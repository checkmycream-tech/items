            <li>While I do think Crest makes a very good product with their whitestrips line, I don&#x27;t think the 2-Hr</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in incredible pain.  </li>
            <li>This time I thought the two days must be incredible</li>
            <li>Good Luck!</li>
            <li>great movie, very entertaining!</li>
            <li>I was so happy with the results I signed on to buy another package.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t ever be doing this again, however, because after a sleepless night in great pain, I can&#x27;t imagine inflicting that sort of torture on myself.  </li>
            <li>you had to wear them two hour and had a great outcome, I can see maybe suffering through it.</li>
            <li>and they worked great.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the product worked great.</li>
            <li>Not anymore, I&#x27;m happy to say.</li>
            <li>lol which happens to be 4 strips sets in a box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To my surprise, I experienced NO PAIN</li>
            <li>They are, however, GREAT for maintenance.</li>
            <li>Worked great on 2 of us.</li>
            <li>After just one treatment, I experienced the aching pain on a couple of teeth for the remainder of the day, but that went away by day 2.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product .</li>
            <li>It is harmless but doesn&#x27;t taste that great.</li>
            <li>They all work great for me.</li>
            <li>This one works great, too.</li>
            <li>Great article.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was happy with the strips.</li>
            <li>I was happy to tear them off after the two hours were up.&lt;br /&gt;Since</li>
            <li>There great</li>
            <li>trust me a great buy.</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you want to lose weight.</li>
            <li>Oh joy.  </li>
            <li>However, a great deal of the discoloration was removed.</li>
            <li>However, a great deal of the discoloration was removed.</li>
            <li>And I experienced no issues placing them correctly.</li>
            <li>These are great when you&#x27;re in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that they work as well as the Crest white-strips that one uses for 20 days, but they&#x27;re great when you&#x27;ve forgotten an event coming up, and you need some in a pinch.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am happy with the results, just wish the sensitivity wasn&#x27;t an issue, but that is not Crest&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li>But like they say &amp;#34;Beauty hurts&amp;#34; over all they&#x27;re great</li>
            <li>lol....</li>
            <li>I can just use it once on a free day for 2 hours and then not worry about it for 3 months!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be very honest.</li>
            <li>I will be very honest.</li>
            <li>but after I successfully removed them I had no residue on my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Oh and make sure you don&#x27;t do it more than once a month!!!!</li>
            <li>Nice!</li>
            <li>AND, the added bonus is that my teeth didn&#x27;t look remarkably whiter.</li>
            <li>teeth were remarkably whiter.  </li>
            <li>good product...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s peculiar and can&#x27;t be good.  </li>
            <li>The gel stuck really good though, the strips weren&#x27;t sliding around</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve given these 5 stars... but 4 stars seem fair to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good quality they stick to teeth.</li>
            <li>good results</li>
            <li>Was good.</li>
            <li>so I was a good candidate but</li>
            <li>Express whitening strips are a good complement to it.  </li>
            <li>Express whitening strips are a good complement to it.  </li>
            <li>Never use it if you know what&#x27;s good for you.</li>
            <li>there was a problem with the product but the provider made good with it.</li>
            <li>If your teeth feel good, keep going.</li>
            <li>Good luck on your whitening endeavors.</li>
            <li>These are good, but they will not work miracles.  </li>
            <li>I think they did a good job whitening as well.  </li>
            <li>They work good</li>
            <li>MAYBE one shade (if the lighting is good).</li>
            <li>MAYBE one shade (if the lighting is good).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has damaged my teeth permanently and I am scared that my teeth will crack and be gone for good after just using this damn product.  </li>
            <li>Good price, product works well</li>
            <li>This is a good product that doesn&#x27;t cause sensitivity once removed.</li>
            <li>I received this product in a timely manner and in good order.</li>
            <li>Seemed to do a good job.</li>
            <li>Good product....did whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>It did a good job as advertised.</li>
            <li>I bought the best ever whiting product, five minute whitening gel and some cheap football teeth guards.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is really good.</li>
            <li>was so scared and the strips stuck on so good.</li>
            <li>Top strips worked great...</li>
            <li>I have to say I am very glad I did use them.  </li>
            <li>one should feel very confident when getting things from this provider</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the results after using this product.  </li>
            <li>Most things are great.</li>
            <li>Fairly speak, it is kind of effective.</li>
            <li>I woke up with significantly more sensitivity though!  </li>
            <li>i was able to buy two boxes for the price of one!</li>
            <li>Seemed like the two hour works better and lasted longer!</li>
            <li>I love these things!</li>
            <li>My teeth look very bright and I am super stoked with my results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and impressed with the product, the seller however, not so much.</li>

            <li>If you do this it works amazingly</li>
            <li>They stick on amazingly well.  </li>

            <li>It was a kind of \\&quot;in</li>

            <li>so this is nice to treat my teeth every 6 months.</li>

            <li>I got the liquid kind</li>
            <li>own review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; kind of agony.  </li>
            <li>you want to whiten your teeth an easy and effective way - then give these a try!</li>
            <li>and I was so excited about the great price which was off the charts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased many teeth whitening products over the years and Crest Advanced Seal products are easily the best.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are bright white and look excellent.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and no hassle at all.</li>
            <li>very easy to use</li>
            <li>The product was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>My teeth look pretty damn good!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best whitening strips I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>Quite a nice surprise:)</li>
            <li>I can honestly say it hurt more than my tattoo.  </li>
            <li>Great product, useful</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the straightest teeth, I&#x27;ll get something to straighten them one day, but having a bright smile is an amazing thing.</li>
            <li>They work great my first try butttt</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully, but I was looking for a product for some minor touch-up in between, maybe at the 1.5 month mark, just to keep things nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>and I experienced no pain and my teeth are very noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li>If I were ever to do this again, which I won&#x27;t, I&#x27;d make sure to press on that tooth off and on so that it would get even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was hoping for better results</li>
            <li>I think most people would find the level of pain truly excruciating.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The two week crest whitestrips and much better</li>
            <li>The whitening was ok but the pain afterwards....</li>
            <li>Recieved this product fast and for a great price...</li>
            <li>got a lovely sore on the top part front of my gums.</li>
            <li>The whitening is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I was not warned about custom charge prices and had to pay £24 on top of the £70 p&amp;p.</li>
            <li>Having just finished my Invisalign treatment, I dropped the extra money begrudgingly but was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>, I save the bottom strips for the top).</li>
            <li>When I wore these strips I saw a notable difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, overall, Its a GREAT product!</li>
            <li>but when I got it, it&#x27;s just the 1 box with 4 strips?&lt;br /&gt;Not such a great deal!!!</li>
            <li>I put the strips on and cooked dinner, by the time my fiancee got home I was able to take them off.</li>
            <li>After two strips and three weeks I was able to bring them to the whitening level I need for my dress.</li>
            <li>The strips really did stick great</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, I was happy with the product.</li>
            <li>and there is more of that yucky taste with these.  </li>
            <li>I was able to do chores around the house while my teeth were getting whiter.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure after using all 4 sets throughout the month</li>
            <li>Make sure you dont brush ur teeth immediately before.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>These 2-hour applications are better for maintenance, I think.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are not horrible but they could use whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I would give it a 5th star if the whitening power was a bit more noticeable.</li>
            <li>And I had made sure the strips didn&#x27;t touch my gums, so</li>
            <li>I may not be able to eat tomorrow.  </li>
            <li>Most of the coffee stains have disappeared.</li>
            <li>One hour, okay.</li>
            <li>still okay.</li>
            <li>still okay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now been more than 48 hours</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;ll say there are safer options to whiten the teeth than using those drastic strips.</li>
            <li>was more contniues and much more bearable.</li>
            <li>so the strips adhere better.  </li>
            <li>real problem with this product is the tooth sensitivity I experienced after using it.</li>
            <li>just more painful.rom chewing aluminum foil with your teeth.</li>
            <li>so you get greater coverage</li>
            <li>I have read reviews about the Crest Advanced Seal Whitening Strips which stay on 30 minutes and require more treatments within a 14 day period, that these are more effective and provide more whitening benefits.  </li>
            <li>I love these, my teeth are so white, perfect for my upcoming wedding</li>
            <li>Price is great, Fast Delivery, I received te 2 hour Express, was hoping for the 1 hour</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now going to have to spend more money just to get rid of this distracting achy pain from my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>I was expecting much more.</li>
            <li>this was a rip off for sure.  </li>
            <li>Uhm, not quite sure what to say about this product.</li>
            <li>Not quite sure it whitens my teeth.</li>
            <li>But ones I&#x27;ve bought from a convenient store work better...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>Love to use this type of product.</li>
            <li>but I felt they worked better if I avoided that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Crest whitestrips for years, and love their product.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll probably need more than one package of these if you haven&#x27;t whitened in a while.</li>
            <li>That really gave me some great looking teeth.</li>
            <li>, I think I&#x27;d feel better using something more often.</li>
            <li>more night\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My lower teeth are most susceptible to the pain.</li>
            <li>I am hoping for even better results in 3 mths.</li>
            <li>wonder that they dont want you using the whiteners more than once a month</li>
            <li>Advil and Aleve haven&#x27;t been able to touch it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s under 6 bucks for more than you&#x27;ll need.</li>
            <li>Stayed in place much better than the others that I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure if the strips worked AT ALL</li>
            <li>As soon as it wears off, take more.</li>
            <li>for 2 hours 15 minutes just to make sure</li>
            <li>/&gt;Today is day 4, I just put on one more 2 hour</li>
            <li>eat extremely healthy.  </li>
            <li>Mostly grilled or steamed seafood,&lt;br /&gt;fresh</li>
            <li>is day 4, I just put on one more 2 hour</li>
            <li>eat extremely healthy.  </li>
            <li>Mostly grilled or steamed seafood,&lt;br /&gt;fresh</li>
            <li>I was happy to find these on your site, and such a good price.</li>
            <li>Love these, I&#x27;ve used them before.  </li>
            <li>So glad they have improved the sticky stuff so that the strips don&#x27;t move around, they stay put.  </li>
            <li>this one is for like if you just wanna suttley whiten up your teeth. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I have used some many whitening systems and have not found the effects as this product in one application.</li>
            <li>you will have sensitivity to most whitening products.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>/&gt;The strips are ok for inbetween treatments</li>
            <li>These were FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li>sometimes more on the weekends when out with family or friends)...</li>
            <li>love these.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like the whitener helped them absorb even MORE wine.</li>
            <li>...have to use more often</li>
            <li>it worked ok.....</li>
            <li>So glad I did.</li>
            <li>It is waxy which make it more comforable to wear for 2 hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought these on sale.  </li>
            <li>now is really more like 4 days for maximum effect.</li>
            <li>I experienced a mild instance of transitory tooth pain, but it passed quickly.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to get this product, as I&#x27;ve tried the 5 minute crest strips and didn&#x27;t notice</li>
            <li>For the price I think this is a pretty good product, but of course a dentist will do a much better job if you want to spend the money to go that route.</li>
            <li>I had hot coffee (kinda defeating the whitening purpose, which didn&#x27;t even whiten that much) and the sip felt wonderful</li>
            <li>but I think a couple days of pain is more than worth a great smile.</li>
            <li>Natural is beautiful.</li>
            <li>but I say when it comes to convienece that this one (one 2-hr strip once a month) is pretty good.</li>
            <li>The teeth whitening strips stay perfectly in place for as long as you keep them there.</li>
            <li>These stick pretty good</li>
            <li>Surprisingly also, they did not make my teeth sensitive at alll!!!!</li>
            <li>The new and improved strips are great, too.</li>
            <li>Use them at your own risk, or be smart and don&#x27;t use them!!</li>
            <li>will be very sensitive but great product</li>
            <li>still noticed the bright whiteness endured the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Adaml noticed the bright whiteness endured the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today</li>
            <li>I truly believe this is one of the most important steps.</li>
            <li>I plan to switch to the Advanced Seal Formula for better results.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping for good things with this product seeing the reviews seemed high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t go from brown to brilliant white so easily, and some stains are easier to attack than others.  </li>
            <li>teeth do hurt right now - kind of pulsating -</li>
            <li>When I saw this product was coming out, I was extremely excited since I absolutely love Crest Whitening products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to carve out 15-30 minutes, but 2 hours seems like forever when you&#x27;ve got stuff glued to your teeth.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are also easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This very mild sensitivity lasted maybe 24 hours.</li>
            <li>I have still not been brave enough to leave them on for more than 1.5 hours, but I have read that rinsing with mouthwash or using some sensodyne afterwards helps.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The strips were easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The strips are easy to apply and wear for two hours.  </li>
            <li>They were easy to apply and remove.  </li>
            <li>you get the hang of it, putting the strips on is fairly easy.  </li>
            <li>The strips were easy to apply and they stayed in place for the 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>oh 2 hours awesome white smile</li>
            <li>Easy application w/ supplied instructions.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>They stick well to your teeth and are easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This strips were so easy to use.</li>
            <li>It comes off easily when you rinse and brush your teeth after the 2 hours is up.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>have strong teeth</li>
            <li>Maybe these are just too strong even at 1/2 the recommended time for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ouch.  </li>
            <li>First of they go on nicely</li>
            <li>Although the strips are not uncomfortable, it was kind of a pain to keep them in my mouth</li>
            <li>and it was fine.  </li>
            <li>and I thought I would be fine</li>
            <li>After they were on, they were fine.</li>
            <li>Fine for being around the house, working in the yard, etc., but not something people won&#x27;t notice.  </li>
            <li>then that they were comfortable and easy to use...</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine, but why would they say &amp;#34;removes years of stains in just one hour&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li>i woke up feeling perfectly fine this morning.</li>
            <li>I figured, Vicodin helps with surgeries, I&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>its own, its a great product that does exactly what it promises, but do you ~need~ to buy this instead of the standard version?  </li>
            <li>Worked great but made my teeth super sensitive.</li>
            <li>Overall good product for strong healthy teeth.</li>
            <li>A quick search on the internet shows that she&#x27;s not alone: MANY customers have experienced the same type of crushing, piercing, \\&quot;I can&#x27;t breathe through my mouth because the air on my teeth makes me hit the ceiling\\</li>
            <li>I bought these to whiten my teeth a little bit for senior pictures and they worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>The original Crest Whitestrips easily moved around or slid off my teeth, sometimes within minutes after I put them on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>They may take more effort but they result in nice white teeth and no pain :)</li>
            <li>I also doubt that you can, or would want to, eat while wearing the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; strips.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, however, they did whiten my teeth noticeably.</li>
            <li>When I took them off my teeth looked amazing, much noticeably whiter than before.</li>
            <li>Most certainly worth the asking price--especially with the $5 and $10-off coupons that float around on Amazon&#x27;s coupon book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detailed review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have read reviews that it crates so much pain afterwords and can fully agree wth it - and you know its the kind of pain that creeeps on and likes to suprise</li>
            <li>Not blindingly white, but attractive</li>
            <li>At Home Tooth Whitening Light System]])</li>
            <li>But the promise of movie star teeth bling (and perhaps the fact that it was free), got me to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I got the free sample with the purchase of a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Actually so much, that I wasn&#x27;t sure I won&#x27;t take off a tooth with it :)</li>
            <li>Although you can talk pretty easily with the strips on, I&#x27;ve found that the more you move your mouth around,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a user of the original 14-day Crest White Strips for years, and have always been happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>The only way I was able to surpass those 12 hrs of pain was taking a sleeping pill to sleep it off!!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I am brave enough to do the full 2 hours...</li>
            <li>Thanks for your help and happy new year</li>
            <li>They were really easy to put on, they&#x27;re really sticky, and I was able to get the strips in the cracks of my teeth easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used the original strip and never has a problem.</li>
            <li>I was excited to give the 2-hour version a test drive</li>
            <li>the original Whitestrips did.  </li>
            <li>With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton]], and also provide more whitening upkeep than this every-3-month product.  </li>

            <li>Of course I read the reviews after I placed the first strip on my top layer of teeth.</li>
            <li>however the more often u use them the more likely it is you will have greater sensitivity and pain.</li>
            <li>I hoped to see significant, near-immediate whitening.  </li>
            <li>Again, my teeth did not look significantly</li>
            <li>and I think it&#x27;s pretty safe to say that the Express Strips did not cause me any pain, not even a bit of sensitivity.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I was excited to try this 2 hour product.  </li>
            <li>With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton]], and make sure to use Sensodyne during the treatment.  </li>
            <li>With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton]], and make sure to use Sensodyne during the treatment.  </li>
            <li>I found that my teeth returned to thier original color within 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant change in the shade of my teeth.</li>
            <li>works well if you have original teeth</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see how well these were going to work.</li>
            <li>The whitening was fairly significant, though, so I decided \\&quot;one</li>
            <li>The edges and gumline remained the original yellowish color.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Soon after, however, I began to experience significant pain in my teeth.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try these.</li>
            <li>My wife and I both used these and saw a significant improvement.</li>
            <li>Both of our teeth were significantly whiter.</li>
            <li>All I know is that my teeth look nice and white and all I use is Crest strips, the latest batch being these 2-hour strips.  </li>
            <li>I used before regular whitestrips and to be honest they did much better job than those 2-hour express.</li>
            <li>I have used Crest Whitestrips many times and love the professional effects.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted bright teeth for a client meeting, and my teeth really needed a brightening up.  </li>
            <li>and these are nothing special.  </li>
            <li>wanting to rip them right out of their roots!  </li>
            <li>to the more aggressive options [bleach and high intensity gels with a whitening light used 20 times every 2 minutes]</li>
            <li>will be sure to get more of these amazing little</li>
            <li>will be sure to get more of these amazing little</li>
            <li>was pleasantly surprised to see that the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li>Did not change teeth shade one bit after a full hour.</li>
            <li>but those are the only good things I can say.&lt;br</li>
            <li>mother always told me you have to suffer for beauty, and in this case I guess it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton]] when that product became available.  </li>
            <li>Not even full two hours.</li>
            <li>so I thought it would be a superior product(wrong)&lt;br /&gt;2)It promises results in only 2 hours which was basically</li>
            <li>Crest is giving me a full refund, BUT i now have go to my dentist.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t want to wear the strips for 30 days to get the full result.  </li>
            <li>About an hour after removing the strips, a tingling sensation began to grow in my teeth, and has continued on to a full blown pain fest.</li>
            <li>They have a better seal and do not seem to have as much \\&quot;goo\\&quot; on them.  </li>
            <li>Also I would make sure you do it on a day or night when you don&#x27;t have plans to socialize or talk too much.</li>
            <li>These absolutely work, leave on longer for even better results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d much rather spend more money and have my teeth whitened by my dentist.</li>
            <li>They went on okay, and I was able to leave them on the whole 2 hours without much fuss.  </li>
            <li>you have - or even if you don&#x27;t have - sensitive teeth, refrain from using this product, or you may pull out your own teeth one by one, in hopes of alleviating the pain our s</li>
            <li>For a 2 hour treatment not bad.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re not bad,</li>
            <li>The taste is not bad, but I would not drink anything during this time period.  </li>
            <li>I am happy to report that the usual excruciating pain I have in the days after using teeth whitening strips is significantly reduced using this strategy!</li>
            <li>My teeth are significantly whiter now, but the pain at the moment doesn&#x27;t feel worth it.</li>
            <li>I did not experience any of the gum pain or tooth pain experienced by some other users.  </li>
            <li>I was fine for the first hour, until I started getting this literal blinding pains that literally went to the core of my teeth.</li>
            <li>After first \\&quot;application\\&quot;, everything seemed fine until that evening.</li>
            <li>I am glad I saved the extra cash from a spared office visit, but I wish they were slightly more affordable.</li>
            <li>decided to go to sleep to pass the time quickly, and got up on time to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>i wanted a quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;anyway</li>
            <li>Luckily I didn&#x27;t experience any of the pain that others have.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 16 and have always prided myself on my white smile and always have taken really good care of my teeth.</li>
            <li>quick becuase</li>
            <li>So I decided to try this product hoping to see a bright white smile in a couple hours.</li>
            <li>The product shipped quickly as well.</li>
            <li>so perhaps I was lucky.</li>
            <li>If you have any questions they will answer to your e-mail so quick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty good size guy, and a pair of strips barely covers 6-7 teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a quick fix, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li>Whitened my teeth but wasn&#x27;t anything super</li>
            <li>just needed a quick touch up before pictures, they whiten your teeth but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product, It does work and better than the dentist office whitening.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I love this product because you only use it 4 times in 1 whole yr!!!!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results I had with only one box of the 1 Hour Express.  </li>
            <li>There is no unpleasant taste, but the frothy foam type substance tends to bubble up around the gums...</li>
            <li>They bind very well to the teeth and are easy to wear.  </li>
            <li>They are easy to place and they really grip your teeth.  </li>
            <li>and you will get some pretty pearly whites!</li>
            <li>Was excited about whitening my teeth for the first time.</li>
            <li>Came on time, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Reviews scared me off as too many videos records pain and super sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>anything that can help is useful, in this case, they&#x27;re not expensive, treatments can be taken over if need be and they&#x27;re pretty easy to employ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always been pretty happy with the result from the other whitening strips.</li>
            <li>I experienced a little bit of sensitivity the day after I used them</li>
            <li>I have used the old school 14 day whitening strips with minimal sensitivity and very good results.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they are worth using.</li>
            <li>They were slightly sensitive and mostly a chipped tooth I have on the bottom, and I didn&#x27;t use the strips on my bottom teeth (never do</li>
            <li>and you have a whiter smile.</li>
            <li>But, I like to use these strips to freshen up my smile.  </li>
            <li>But if you have sensitive teeth you may be better off going with the 30 minute strips.  </li>
            <li>These are worth a try before going to your dentist.</li>
            <li>For me, the end result  is worth it.</li>
            <li>In short: these are great for individuals who don&#x27;t have the patience to use the 14 or 21 day Professional Effects strips.  </li>
            <li>These just added to my smile.</li>
            <li>I rarely ever write reviews on products, but these strips caused me a lot of pain and discomfort and didn&#x27;t even whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li>I used these one night so far and they worked better than the zoom I bought from the dentist.</li>
            <li>If I want more whitening, then I rest for 3-5 days until my teeth are no longer sensitive.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews either, but since it&#x27;s 4:45 in the morning</li>
            <li>so I figured it would be worth it, so</li>
            <li>I suppose it&#x27;s my own fault for pushing it so far knowing that it causes so much pain.</li>
            <li>Second, and most importantly, they hurt like hell.</li>
            <li>Go professional or use some more powerful over the counter strips, not these.</li>
            <li>I feel like this product is worth it</li>
            <li>, I can see my teeth are whiter and its worth the convenience of not having to do it night after night for me.</li>
            <li>These white strips and professional effects both work great</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re worth it for me.</li>
            <li>They stayed on nicely and my teeth are incredibly white after the two hours.  </li>
            <li>and I was looking for a brighter smile.</li>
            <li>The pain I am in right now is worse than the pain I experienced when my appendix decided it wanted to be forcibly evicted from my body (and I never thought I would say that about anything).</li>
            <li>The pain I am in right now is worse than the pain I experienced when my appendix decided it wanted to be forcibly evicted from my body (and I never thought I would say that about anything).</li>
            <li>I have experience with the original Crest White Strips which I enjoyed the results from but didn&#x27;t like the amount of commitment it required or the limitations the strips put on me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Crest white strips before, both the cheapest ones and the vivid ones, and I had experienced minimal sensitivity and fairly good results, enough to buy these because I thought they&#x27;d work even better.  </li>
            <li>However I have found that if I leave them on for 1.5 hours instead of the full two I have little to no pain and still get a good amount of whitening.</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>was right</li>
            <li>Will not see results right away</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s killing me right now.</li>
            <li>If Hell were a place, right now it would be residing on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>What may have helped is, right after I took the strips off my teeth, in order to get the residue off(and thus the peroxide that was probably still on them)</li>
            <li>I do have sensative teeth (I can&#x27;t stand people who chew ice or just bite right through a popsicle).</li>
            <li>I used these right before my wedding and saw a drastic change.</li>
            <li>I used theses as instructed, but they made my teeth VERY sensitive for almost a full day afterwards, I ended up using oragel to calm the pain!</li>
            <li>I also know that professional whitening comes with some discomfort and is anywhere from $300-$500, though laser whitening is the best and usually $500</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Crest Whitestrips in the past, and while I could always live with the idea of wearing the plastic film on my teeth for eight hours or more, the idea of getting it done in two hours certainly had great appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll go back to the 14-day version - popping them on after breakfast in the morning for 30 minutes (more than the time it takes me to shower, get dressed and get ready to leave the house) is much easier and the results are much more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I see a bright future for them in a new Saw movie.</li>
            <li>tolerated the 2hour pain and was lucky enough not to have any more pain after I took off the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Work fast and easily, but didn&#x27;t really see a lot of whitening difference.</li>
            <li>I liked using it because it was so easy and was non messy.  </li>
            <li>While the dentist will make a mold of your teeth, and whiten all surfaces of all your teeth, this product takes a more modest, and perhaps more practical approach, and just gives you strips that will cover the front surfaces of your front-most teeth, upper and lower jaw.  </li>
            <li>overall, 3D is better than $500 dentist teeth trays, 3D is better than the old skool strips.  </li>
            <li>Despite the pain, I would do it again but more frequently than every 3 months to hopefully get better and longer lasting results.  </li>
            <li>I used the 30 minute strips in the past and they worked great.</li>
            <li>a daily drinker of strong coffees and teas, I was interested in the Crest Whitestrips ever since they became available.  </li>
            <li>I took Advil and was able to sleep a little more but woke up in pain again.</li>
            <li>The only positive point was that I was able to return them for a full refund even though I had used one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that my teeth were probably 1 to 1 and a half shades lighter, but my calcium stains from my braces were extremely bright.  </li>
            <li>I think the result are on par with the professional dentist trays that I paid for - but the stips make finding the time to whiten so easy.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to sleep all night because of the intense sensitivity and I do not have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Sure they were supposed to be used over a few months, but I had more immediate needs.  </li>
            <li>process of putting on the strips was simple enough and I experienced no noticeable discomfort or pain while wearing the strips</li>
            <li>So here I am, in my own personal iron maiden for absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So here I am, in my own personal iron maiden for absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li>After finally finishing my box of four within the last year, I can say that this is a great product.</li>
            <li>They are clear, but the whitening gel foams up, so they give your teeth a bright white funny look while they are on.  </li>
            <li>Strips are very fast to put on and off.</li>
            <li>Although it is far easier to talk while wearing the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; strips compared with the original Whitestrips (which could easily be moved or dislodged with the slightest mouth movements), with the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; strips stuck to my teeth, my speech was usually slightly altered, as if I had a bit of peanut butter in my mouth or as if I was wearing braces.  </li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t whitened your teeth before and it&#x27;s that important to you, invest the time in the Professional Effects or the Advanced Vivid strips.</li>
            <li>My gums were sensitive during the first brushing after use, but fine otherwise.</li>
            <li>the crest 3d white 2-hour express teeth whitening strips 4 count work as well on my teeth to make them more cleaner lookiing.</li>
            <li>The first problem is the 2 hr time span.</li>
            <li>If they don&#x27;t, though, I will likely obtain more.  </li>
            <li>I was pleased overall with the product and its results.</li>
            <li>Even the lower level crest white strips whiten better.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use a more extensive and time consuming whitening kit.</li>
            <li>It was like someone took a hot glue gun to my teeth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not sure if most people will be truly pleased with</li>
            <li>After all, these products are not exactly inexpensive, and I want to get my money&#x27;s worth of whitening with each application!  :-)  </li>
            <li>Once-A-Week Whitestrip\\&quot; that would be more convenient than daily use of the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Once-A-Week Whitestrip\\&quot; that would be more convenient than daily use of the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>What ever you do, don&#x27;t brush your teeth first and then put these on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes your teeth more sensitve where you get these white spots and sore spots as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I suspect most such products are.  </li>
            <li>but my teeth were VERY noticeably whiter!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll see a difference from the first use, and you&#x27;re meant to use 1 every 3 months</li>
            <li>Used exactly as stated on the package.. never, never again.</li>
            <li>i kept a pic record of how my teeth is changing color, and it got MUCH whiter!</li>
            <li>I was so worried at first because i thought, oh, it hurt to put them on for 30 mins</li>
            <li>Tooth look brighter with the first strip.</li>
            <li>I did see good color change, but not sure if it&#x27;s worth the pain.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also using the recommended 3D White toothpaste and mouthwash which I think may have brightened them even more than they appeared yesterday.</li>
            <li>Just having something on your teeth may irritate you at first, but give it some time</li>
            <li>The 2-hr Express version just has a thicker gel, along with a bit better strip design, to allow you to get a substantial effect with only one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then yesterday I tried the Crest strips for the first time.</li>
            <li>The whitening is especially noticeable, because you see the results in two hours, instead of gradually over many treatments.  </li>
            <li>Same results, except that the splotches were even more noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I did notice results although my teeth are already pretty light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>(they were really stuck on there!).  </li>
            <li>I followed the steps exactly like the instructions said, en everything seemed to be going well...  </li>
            <li>soooo much pain!</li>
            <li>The pain is pretty unbearable.</li>
            <li>I did my first treatment two days ago.</li>
            <li>(I know, why would I try this without checking reviews first?</li>
            <li>I know you are only supposed to use these strips once every 3 months, but I think I am going to try them again in a day or so to get a more noticeable effect.</li>
            <li>Most people complain about sensitivity &amp; pain, but this is my third time uses crest products, so I knew what to expect.</li>
            <li>I would recommend simply using Crest&#x27;s 3D White Toothpaste (which is excellent) or a different whitening procedure instead.</li>
            <li>The Crest 2 Hour Express Whitestrips and 3D White Rinse is one of Crest&#x27;s many products in their at-home teeth-whitening line.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it if you are willing to deal with some pain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Crests line of whitening products for 3-4 years now (from the first products where you brushed on the whitening gel to the newest Advanced Seal strips) and these are my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>I would NOT recommend these strips for first time users.</li>
            <li>its not blingin like diamonds, but still pretty.</li>
            <li>This was my first time attempting to use any sort of teeth whitening strips.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and came within 3-4 days!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using these</li>
            <li>although i made sure that the strip was on teeth only and not making contact with my gums.</li>
            <li>Bought it and did exactly as instructed and no change at all.  </li>
            <li>But the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>Even when the product is used exactly as instructed, tooth sensitivity ensues a couple of hours after using them.</li>
            <li>As an avid teeth whitener, I must warn you that you will experience sensitivity with every whitening procedure whether you use strips, trays or get it done at the dentist (which I also do).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re using this for the first time, I recommend trying one strip for the amount of time as instructed.</li>
            <li>I am in so much pain!  </li>
            <li>Used this product exactly as instructions stated.  </li>
            <li>These strips are better than the regular 14 day ones.  </li>
            <li>That stuff is pretty gooey, but it provided relief for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I took the strips off exactly 10 hours ago</li>
            <li>I took the strips off exactly 10 hours ago</li>
            <li>My teeth were noticeably even more white</li>
            <li>Love the convenience of only using for 2 hours every 3 months.</li>
            <li>This works pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Thanks I will use this service again!</li>
            <li>After day 5 I always have had the most white teeth that people would stop and comment while I was shopping, on an elevator etc.</li>
            <li>It is not uncomfortable but is something that you notice.</li>
            <li>Some people have sensitive gums and I&#x27;m fortunate not to be one of them; perhaps Crest should state that on their instructions.  </li>
            <li>Upon removal (and there is a significant residue that must be wiped away after), I did notice that my teeth were significantly whiter, if not the neon white promised in the advertising.</li>
            <li>And, these work very well!</li>
            <li>I will be posting this review on as many sites as possible, and contacting Crest.</li>
            <li>And they worked on me on the first try</li>
            <li>they are more of an off white</li>
            <li>Whiten teeth 10 times more than the &amp;#34;storebrand &amp;#34;I purchased from my local department store.</li>
            <li>Not just with cold/ hot.</li>
            <li>They hurt consistently.</li>
            <li>I am very familiar with the Crest strips, and I take precautions, such as using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>full week later, my teeth look SIGNIFICANTLY whiter than pre-treatment.  </li>
            <li>This is in contrast to the old style strips that are gummy and don&#x27;t make good contact (not as good results) or the big trays that make it hard to breath.  </li>
            <li>The instructions say the results should last 3 months, but don&#x27;t clearly indicate whether it is safe to use them more frequently, so I don&#x27;t know if I can try another application sooner to see if I can improve the results</li>
            <li>With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton]], these new strips have two notches in the upper/lower strips that help the strips to tuck behind your teeth edge more easily.  </li>
            <li>I have experienced a little sensitivity, however, I tried using sensitive toothpaste for about 2 weeks before and after whitening and this seems to help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they take longer, but with consistent use are just as, if not more, effective, and they&#x27;re certainly not as painful.</li>
            <li>They did whiten my teeth noticeably and w/o using them for the full allotted time so I can imagine what they&#x27;d do if left on the full time.</li>
            <li>but it ruined my enamel so much that I can most likely never whiten my teeth again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It could be my own fault because the impression I got from seeing the commercials and ads was that it was the same whiteness as Professional Effects.</li>
            <li>Luster White actually gave me good results...</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked over a lot of different options (from the more gentle Crest options [1 strip a day for 5 minutes every day monthly]</li>
            <li>The adhesive holds very well to to the teeth for the 2 hour whitening time, and I love that it&#x27;s only 2 hours every 3 months.  </li>
            <li>The old, regular Crest WS worked good for me even though it made my teeth very sensitive.  </li>
            <li>many times in the past (higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide than normal strips) and been able to handle it.  </li>
            <li>many times in the past (higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide than normal strips) and been able to handle it.   </li>
            <li>I have healthy teeth, not sensitive at all.</li>
            <li>first thing that I did was to really examine my pain level on a scale.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well but teeth very sore for about 20 hours afterwards.</li>
            <li>Tried one of these types of strips for the first time today, and kept them on the whole two hours.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty much in keeping with the rest of the Crest whitening line, but after just 30 minutes I could feel what was almost a burning sensation on my gums.</li>
            <li>it is not worth the money i always liked the dissolving strips.</li>
            <li>The strips are just as easy to use as the original, and in fact are much \\&quot;stickier\\&quot; - there is a lot less slipping than with the 2-week kind.  </li>
            <li>used this a month ago and my teeth are still white and clean, they feel so fresh all the time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, I did notice a slight whitening of my teeth (and I&#x27;m not complaining about that)</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after doing quite a bit of research, thinking the results would be exactly as stated: noticeable whitening in only two hours, side effects including (possibly) light tooth/gum sensitivity/pain.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li>Application of the stips to the teeth is easy and they stay intact the entire two hours.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say if you use these and have sore spots or sensitive teeth, you will feel it, even if it mild.</li>
            <li>granted they are pretty pricey, i am always pleased with the little boost i get from popping a pair on for a couple hours and having a noticeably whiter smile afterwards.</li>
            <li>done, my teeth certainly seemed whiter.</li>
            <li>The limitations were largely improved with the advent of the Advance</li>
            <li>Pure agony.</li>
            <li>i was scared to try them because of certain reviews but \\&quot;dont believe the hype\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I would characterize the result as a 20% lightening of color which doesn&#x27;t sound like much, but for a home treatment, that&#x27;s pretty solid.  </li>
            <li>i would definitely recommend it for busy bee&#x27;s like me! :)</li>
            <li>My teeth were already reasonably white, I really just wanted to touch up the small yellowish bits at the very tops of my teeth near the gums - and this did that perfectly.</li>
            <li>If not, then the standard product will be just fine for you.</li>
            <li>All was fine until about 3 hours later when I noticed some zinger type pains in one tooth.</li>
            <li>I feel like I should add that I have a very high pain tolerance.  </li>
            <li>It was fine the whole time I had them on but after took them off and brushed my teeth.</li>
            <li>I purchased the one-hour under the impression that results would be nearly immediate, but accompanied by tremendous tooth pain and sensitivity as many other review mention.</li>
            <li>The advertisement for this new Whitestrip is certainly enticing - all you have to do is get this box of 4 pairs of Whitestrips, and wear a strip for just 2 hours, repeating the treatment 3 months later, for a full year&#x27;s worth of whitening.  </li>
            <li>I really wish I&#x27;d taken a before photo but trust me when I say the difference is huge after only 1 treatment.</li>
            <li>However, I am writing this because I feel this product should have a huge red warning label on it!</li>
            <li>My teeth aren&#x27;t usually sensitive but this really made them hurt..which would&#x27;ve been worth it if they whitened..</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t feel like I wanted to spit the whole time.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t do much of anything to my teeth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have much to compare to</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li>It was a really sticky gel, almost like a silicone</li>
            <li>Two aleve really helped.  </li>
            <li>They do cling to teeth very well....</li>
            <li>If you do not drink much coffee, tea, colas, perhaps this product will give you 3 months of whitening.tly drinking coffee/tea.  </li>
            <li>If you do not drink much coffee, tea, colas, perhaps this product will give you 3 months of whitening.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t that much of a pain - but finding the hours to sit with them on was a challenge at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product from Crest makes whitening so much easier.</li>
            <li>So much pain</li>
            <li>Really could not tell a difference.</li>
            <li>They stayed on during the whole process really well.</li>
            <li>When my friend brought these over I decided that since I smoke and drink coffee, it was high time for me to whiten!</li>
            <li>it hurts so much.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, when I removed the strips the effect was very slight--not really noticeable at all.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much difference after two hours.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These 2 hour strips really are sticky &amp; stay on</li>
            <li>I guess it really depends on how much time or sensitivity you have.  </li>
            <li>these 2 hour strips really didn&#x27;t cause me problems.  </li>
            <li>This 2-hour whitestrip is much easier to use than the 30 minute whitestrip.  </li>
            <li>I removed the strips, brushed my teeth lightly and then went to bed.  </li>
            <li>and it really helped with the pain.  </li>
            <li>I really think Crest is on to something here</li>
            <li>Whitening effect was as good as, if not better, than I&#x27;ve experienced in the past with the standard product, with no noticeable sensitivity during or after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the two hours you have them in your mouth they are slighlty umconfortable (unlike the Listerine strips which you can&#x27;t feel much) but manageable.</li>
            <li>These did the trick for me to whiten my teeth a bit although the strips did not stay on my teeth very well and was a bit of a hassle to keep adjusting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once these puppies go on my teeth, they aren&#x27;t moving until I take them off and that alone is worth it compared to the old strips.  </li>
            <li>How much whiter are my teeth?  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d expected \\&quot;express\\&quot; strips to give more of a \\&quot;wow\\&quot; when I was done.</li>
            <li>I tried to make sure there was minimal overlap with my gums.  </li>
            <li>With that being the case; I have whitening gel that comes straight from a dentist office (as a family member worked for a dentist), and I think I will try to speed up the results by adding some of the gel to it.</li>
            <li>After wearing the strips for an hour and 45 mins I felt intense pain in my teeth</li>
            <li>I did not notice any real difference in my teeth</li>
            <li>For anyone who wants whiter teeth, I suggest they try the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>For anyone who wants whiter teeth, I suggest they try the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Really nobody should use it.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do a whole lot</li>
            <li>and they were somewhat affected by the strips, but not so much that I wouldn&#x27;t use them again.</li>
            <li>I just tried out these Whitestrips, and they worked better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>too much wetness</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there really is a difference between all the strips.</li>
            <li>I use one strip for 30 to 1 hour, once a day for three days straight.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product for at home use if you don&#x27;t want to visit or pay your dentist $$$.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in too much pain to even notice if they worked.  </li>
            <li>this product does it cause you intense pain and a sleepless evening.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in so much pain that I can&#x27;t sleep, this is what it&#x27;s come to.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find much value in this one though.</li>
            <li>It did whiten my teeth, but not by much.</li>
            <li>These really did not whiten my teeth at all</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s done absolutely nothing for the pain.</li>
            <li>I really like how you use these every 3 months instead of every day or every week.</li>
            <li>Just rinse it of gently if needed.</li>
            <li>My teeth arent very yellow/brown</li>
            <li>It is doing ABSOLUTELY nothing, and I am shocked.&lt;br /&gt;--I</li>
            <li>Teeth were much whiter.</li>
            <li>Our family dentist loves these strips and recommends them to her patients, but for us they didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>Misleading-made it sound like we were getting 4 treatments and there were only 2.</li>
            <li>I finished my fourth one last night and my teeth are WHITE which feels great.</li>
            <li>I felt absolutely NO&lt;br</li>
            <li>No candy, junk food, fast food, foods with alot of sugar,&lt;br /&gt;no</li>
            <li>No candy, junk food, fast food, foods with alot of sugar,&lt;br /&gt;no</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work, May be for an hour</li>
            <li>Some reviews said their teeth hurt, I use Sensodyne pronamel gentle whitening toothpaste and it really helps sensetive teeth.</li>
            <li>I got fast and noticeable results from those.</li>
            <li>Yes they removed the stains a bit, but my teeth hurt SO much</li>
            <li>Crest 3D White Whitestrips with Advanced Seal 2 Hour Express 18 Month Supply,6 Count]]</li>
            <li>These work very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Crest 2-hour Whitestrips for over a year and find them to be very convenient.  </li>
            <li>When I was ready to use the product I opened it and read the directions.</li>
            <li>I kept the film on for 2 hours and noticed a considerably lighter brighter smile.</li>
            <li>Now, 5 hours after using the 3D Whitestrips, she wants to pull her teeth out.</li>
            <li>The pain was so intense I had a fever and could not sleep.</li>
            <li>I took off the strips at 3pm and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Crest should really consider pulling this product.</li>
            <li>It gave me intense pain with no noticeable results.</li>
            <li>Used the whole box (4 packets) of 1hr express in 2 days, 12 hrs between each packet.</li>
            <li>Two, Using them on a daily basis made my teeth extremely sensitive to the point that it hurt to breathe because the air touching my teeth alone was hurtful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame as I still have all the rest of the strips left and won&#x27;t be letting them near my mouth for sure.</li>
            <li>I used the professional white strips &amp; felt like those have given me the most improvement.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve whitened them a few times to keep them looking nice..</li>
            <li>hopefully in the next couple days it will whiten up even more and my teeth will stop being so sensitive.</li>
            <li>Those made my teeth more sensitive while I was using them, but didn&#x27;t cause any actual pain.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used these before with good results so we&#x27;re continuing to use these as we don&#x27;t care to wear the strips any longer than necessary, and certainly not day after day after day as you&#x27;re required to do with some.</li>
            <li>Both of the drugstores in my area (Chicago) had these exact same ones priced above $60 for the same 12 month supply which includes 4 sets of strips (4 for the top, 4 for the bottom.)&lt;br /&gt;Second, the application is so easy.  </li>
            <li>My dentist asked me if I had my teeth professionally whitened!!!  </li>
            <li>It turns color throughout the day depending on what you eat but after a quick brush it ends up pretty white.</li>
            <li>Compared to the original Crest Whitestrips, the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; technology really does work to hold the strips firmly to the teeth.  </li>
            <li>but anyways, i heard that the other whitening strips were better than the 2 hour express ones, so if you really need to whiten your teeth go for that one.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to whiten their teeth to go out on a special occasion and wants instant results.</li>
            <li>So I was excited to finally join the masses to try these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it tastes like hydrogen peroxide, not exactly yummy, but not horrible.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just most people don&#x27;t stick with them due to the pain.</li>
            <li>This product works faster and stays put better than the other strips.</li>
            <li>These arrive on time, as expected, no messy clean up, and user friendly.</li>
            <li>The date on the box was very expired so they did not work to their full potential of whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li>I use a sensitive teeth toothpaste and have never suffered more than some mild sensitivity with any other over-the-counter or professional product I have ever used ~ till now.  </li>
            <li>My teeth were so sensitive and it really bothered me for the rest of the day, but the next morning they felt fine.</li>
            <li>my teeth are pretty white right now.</li>
            <li>You would not want to use these strips&#x27; strong adhesion on any loose teeth.</li>
            <li>I will not do this process ever again and strongly recommend caution before using it if you think you could potentially have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I have really noticed a 90% change in color and they are now super white!</li>
            <li>I have really noticed a 90% change in color and they are now super white!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have as much problem with them moving around that I normally have with whitening</li>
            <li>With that said, they don&#x27;t really require a time commitment, since you can go about your normal business with them</li>
            <li>It did the job, but not to the full potential.</li>
            <li>What surprised me was that you don&#x27;t brush your teeth first.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive teeth already, but I was willing to experience the pain for whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>Although the product did whiten my teeth, they are slightly more whiten where I pressed down.</li>
            <li>Two strips (for top and bottom teeth) come in a treatment, and lay over the teeth so that the peroxide presses down onto them and coats them.</li>
            <li>I ever experience more yellowing in the months down the road,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I ever experience more yellowing in the months down the road,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These are obviously the teeth that are most prominent when you open your mouth or smile, but obviously it does nothing for the other teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the results, but the are kind of inconvenient to use.  </li>
            <li>Also, the taste is not as overwhelming as the previous kits.</li>
            <li>I also used Sensodyne toothpaste to make the pain less, which worked for the most part.</li>
            <li>Oddly, when I pushed my tongue against the area that was hurting, it seemed to make it better</li>
            <li>I googled this and found a white strips review site and see that many people say the same thing.  </li>
            <li>I ignored it, expecting mild pain as a normality of white strips, which I&#x27;ve used all the time (just not these 2 hour ones).</li>
            <li>This kit is a super must for all beauty junkies that crave white teeth all the time!!!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fall apart and fall off like the older versions.  </li>
            <li>I have never experienced having sensitive teeth before, but this product just caused me to experienced so.  </li>
            <li>So if you are a first timer, I recommened you use the pro white strips first then move onto these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used regularly, Crest 3D whitening strips really does make a difference in the bightness of your smile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a loyal user of all the White Strip formulations.</li>
            <li>First, my teeth looked exactly the same after I used them.</li>
            <li>Used it 4 days before prom and got decent results for being a rush.</li>
            <li>Whitening Vibrant Mint Toothpaste 4.1 Oz]]  </li>
            <li>people even commented that my teeth were super white and asked where I went (referring to a dentist) to get it done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>people even commented that my teeth were super white and asked where I went (referring to a dentist) to get it done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only noticed mild sensitivity.</li>
            <li>She followed the directions exactly and has no previous episodes of tooth pain or sensitivity.</li>
            <li>I have decent colored teeth and just needed them to brighten up a bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m usually not bothered by much.  </li>
            <li>Yes, there was a minor difference in color - a tad whiter, but in no way is it worth the pain!</li>
            <li>fortunately, a quick search indicated these are normal and would go away in several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I advise no one buy these unless you have a HIGH pain tolerance.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend a straw</li>
            <li>highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally okay with a little bit of pain</li>
            <li>It hurt just a little when they were on but mostly unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>On top of that, I saw little, if any results.</li>
            <li>I imagine aspirin or ibuprofen might help a little more.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try the 2 hour white strips and had read multiple positive reviews.</li>
            <li>So when I saw these 2 hr ones, I thought \\&quot;wow, great--should be really good\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>but if you have very stained teeth, you may need a professional bleaching.  </li>
            <li>Absolute agony, my teeth are slightly sensitive to this day.</li>
            <li>They made them only verryyy slightly sensitive, definitely not bad at all and this bit of sensitivity goes away within a day or two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>this might lead you to believe that the strips were effective, at least, on the remaining parts of my teeth.</li>
            <li>I got up and took some aspirin and was able to get a few hour sleep.</li>
            <li>I would say it might be worth it if the strips had any actual whitening effect, but in my case they did nothing.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t normally write reviews.</li>
            <li>I woke up with my normal brushing routing and my&lt;br /&gt;teeth</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice it when I first received the box in April, but just looked today when getting ready to whiten with the second strips.  </li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll definitely try the Professional Effects, as many reviwers have suggested.</li>
            <li>so I figured this would be better than having to use the two week long white strips to save time and pain.</li>
            <li>okay, not a huge difference, but noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have pretty white teeth naturally, but other products I&#x27;ve used have had better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>crest product is similar, but much more limited.  </li>
            <li>They are harder to remove than the original (because of the increased stickiness) -</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t do what I expected as I wanted to see a significant difference in the whitness of my teeth</li>
            <li>Did we all get a new batch of pain?</li>
            <li>&quot; the package mentions turned out to be equivalent to getting a mouthful of new fillings and then having a set of braces tightened.  </li>
            <li>So yesterday evening, I bought a new toothbrush, and it came with a sample of #Crest 3D 1-Hour Express Whitening Strips.</li>
            <li>For this sort of torture, I expect them to look like brand new porcelain.</li>
            <li>When you peel the strips off, there is a slightly odd aftertaste, but it was not disagreeable to me and can be easily washed away by rinsing with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I finally had two free hours but could only stand them for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed, 4 strips only , too much money for 4 strips and the didnt even work</li>
            <li>The pain started about 2 and a half hours after taking off the strips, so it&#x27;s been going for about five hours strong and no sign of letting up yet.</li>
            <li>In the future, I&#x27;ll stick with their Advanced Vivid white strips -</li>
            <li>Also, I have had very sensitive teeth ever since.  </li>
            <li>These do whiten your teeth, but they also make your teeth very sensitive</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve used them before, my teeth aren&#x27;t very sensitive</li>
            <li>So... I wish I would have read reviews on this product BEFORE using it, because I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive teeth, and i did experience sensitivity / discomfort after removing the strips as directed.  </li>
            <li>Teeth are exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive teeth, but if you have even the slightest bit of tooth sensitivity I do not recommend these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple of the strips now, and overall am fairly pleased with this product, but not exactly blown</li>
            <li>My results were so-so, though I have pretty white teeth anyway.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll report back ;)</li>
            <li>(your whitening your teeth not you gums!, plus it can make you gums sensitive!)</li>
            <li>I felt it mostly like hte shoots of pain to various parts of the treated teeth - will not recommend those strips, however I used the other 14 day strips and the pain</li>
            <li>Had the 3 - 4 month thing been disclosed prior to purchase, I would have given a higher rating.</li>
            <li>I purchased the white strips for the simple fact that it was the 2-hour express, and I simply did not want to wait days for show able results.</li>
            <li>As someone who has rarely experienced tooth discomfort/sensitivity from any food or dental hygiene product, I was surprised that these strips could cause me such an irritating amount of pain.</li>
            <li>but if used consistently you will notice a difference, especially if you are a coffee or tea drinker.</li>
            <li>I myself do not have particularly sensitive teeth, and this stuff kills them!</li>
            <li>Well, results were nearly immediate and I had no sensitivity at all!</li>
            <li>I left them on for exactly 2 hours as stated and did not see any difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I usually use Crest Pro strips, which cost quite a bit more than these.  </li>
            <li>I never have had sensitive teeth or tooth pain, not even a cavity!</li>
            <li>Dont use this product, the other crest white strips (14day) works much better.</li>
            <li>I wanted to write this review to clarify that this doesn&#x27;t cause pain on everyone with sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li>Normally, I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But then my teeth are already pretty white since I had a Zoom treatment-</li>
            <li>I followed all the directions my teeth were whitened unevened and white spots.... not to mention my whole mouth was in severe pain!</li>
            <li>And the fact that it didnt whiten them at all was a huge let down after all that pain.</li>
            <li>thought I was being &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; by purchasing the new Crest Sensitive Strips (not the whitening ones).</li>
            <li>I am going to try the new professional strips to see how they work,</li>
            <li>The adhesive on these new Whitestrips seem to be a bit stickier than before even though the previous \\&quot;Professional Effects\\&quot; Advanced Seal was already quite sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth usually, but I used the strips more than 8 hours ago</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Bought the box of 4 white strips, thinking that it would last a full year as advertised.  </li>
            <li>These whitestrips are very poorly designed so they don&#x27;t work so well (as compared to opalescence or something you squeeze out onto your own tray), and it is overpriced too!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t last long but for not even seeing much of a difference at all in the whiteness of my teeth, it wasn&#x27;t worth the pain.  </li>
            <li>for the love of god only put these on your teeth for a half hour - 45 min tops.</li>
            <li>Three months later, I applied them for a second session and did experience some mild shooting pains in one of my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the pain only lasted one day for me, after an extra nights rest my teeth went back to normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not promising you will have zero pain, but if you&#x27;re like me, even half as much pain would be much more tolerable.</li>
            <li>with regular Whitestrips, application of the film on the teeth is very simple, and once they&#x27;re on, its easy to forget that you&#x27;re wearing them, and you could - if you wanted to - go out in public wearing them with no one noticing them, unless they&#x27;re closely looking at your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This minimal discomfort seemed like a fair trade for the slight whitening effect that I saw on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest issue is with the \\&quot;possible side effects\\&quot; of \\&quot;tooth sensitivity\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>i think more the next day it looked a little whiter than before.</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth, but they did cause some to have a sharp aching pain and the rest to be mildly sore for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I used the Whitestrip last night and the gel that was on them feels like a real dentist&#x27;s gel, something that a professional would apply</li>
            <li>According to my dentist, I have fairly white teeth when he puts the tooth whiteness scale to my teeth and don&#x27;t really need a professional bleaching.</li>
            <li>This product definitely makes a difference, but nowhere near as much as the box or advertising would lead you to believe.</li>
            <li>It is a clear piece of plastic with a layer of hydrogen peroxide covering the strip.  </li>
            <li>So if you feel compelled to use a Crest product, I would try the others but stay clear of the 2 Hour Express.  </li>
            <li>Stick with Professional Effects, same price, and make your teeth SO much whiter.</li>
            <li>This is a fast acting product that works well.  </li>
            <li>Can make teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li>my teeth sensitive?  </li>
            <li>My teeth have never been sensitive no matter what the weather, food temperature, whitening strips, toothpastes...</li>
            <li>These strips made my teeth horribly sensitive.</li>
            <li>However, I really wonder how well this whitening will last during the 3-month period before I use another one of these \\&quot;Express\\&quot; strips again.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>I dont have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Most of them work, but have one flaw in common, the tape never sticks.</li>
            <li>Maybe my teeth were white to begin with, but I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference afterwards.</li>
            <li>I started to get scared after reading some of the reviews that my teeth would become painfully sensitive.</li>
            <li>My teeth never got painfully sensitive.</li>
            <li>Followed direction, put this on for 2 hrs, near the end</li>
            <li>They make your teeth very sensetive for several days also.  </li>
            <li>, about an hour later I awoke in intense pain.</li>
            <li>and they really work after only two hours.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m going to take her advice (because it completely makes sense) and test run these strips again maybe 4-5 days from now to continue the whitening process.  </li>
            <li>-- also try to tuck the strip into the teeth crevices so you wrap the whole tooth as to not leave a not so white outline!</li>
            <li>and I can use the 3D professional strength without issue.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are occasionally sensitive</li>
            <li>recommend you buy the PROFESSIONAL EFFECTS strips instead of the express.</li>
            <li>I have NEVER had sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>These strips really cannot be worn outside of your house.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been 24 so far</li>
            <li>It is way too much to take especially for someone who has senstivite teeth.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that I have sensitive teeth either</li>
            <li>, i have crack lines on my teeths and 3 white (really bright)dots on my front tooth.</li>
            <li>I had to go to sensitive teeth toothpaste and</li>

            <li>About three hours later I began to experience some intense pain and sensitivity.</li>

            <li>The strips definitely made my teeth whiter, not as white as I expected, but I am satisfied with the results.  </li>

            <li>Made my teeth a little sore for a day or so, but it was well worth it!</li>
            <li>now I am really worried that I am going to have this intense pain all night long and possibly for days.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many home whitening kits from Crest over the past ten years.</li>
            <li>I would much rather suffer through the inconvenience of using multiple strips over the course of a few days than to do a one time quick session that doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
            <li>The whitening provided by this product is pretty similar to the results after about two months of using Crest&#x27;s 3D White Toothpaste.</li>
            <li>I left them on for exactly two hours....and revealed the same teeth I had before.</li>
            <li>I used to drink more red wine in the past, but it is contraindicated with some of the medication I take now</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re one of those people that just wants things to be done as quickly as possible, there&#x27;s certainly a virtue, and if you like the effect of standard Whitestrips but find the experience of wearing them objectionable, you&#x27;ll definitely want it.  </li>
            <li>I has such high hopes for these 2 hour strips ~ but I have to say that I&#x27;m dissapointed in the results.  </li>
            <li>The box contains four treatments, so it may be more economical than their other products, since the price per treatment is not as expensive (most other Crest products require you to use the entire box for a treatment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>upon closer inspection, it quickly becomes clear that the whitening is patchy and extremely uneven</li>
            <li>I do have fairly sensitive teeth, but I never expected pain like this.</li>
            <li>After lots of Advil, regular doses of Tylenol, and finally, thank the stars, some canker sore medicine that my husband had once bought rubbed on my gums I was able to drop off for a few hours.  </li>
            <li>They do stick pretty well though and seem to have minimal overflow</li>
            <li>I have used the normal white strips from Crest without an issue, but just used the 1 hour express over the weekend</li>
            <li>The strips hold right with little waste, and the results were fabulous.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The whitening effect of these seemed similar to the full round to me, so I think they did live up to their promise.</li>
            <li>Before using these strips, I&#x27;d previously used the original Crest Whitestrips that used a two-week series of daily strips.</li>
            <li>I spent the next few hours putting my mouth and tongue in every imaginable position to try and make me a little more comfortable but nothing worked.  </li>
            <li>During my testing of this new Whitestrip, instead of waiting 3 months before using another application, I waited 2 weeks later and then applied another Whitestrip.  </li>
            <li>When I bought the express white strips, I also bought the new Crest Sensi-Stop Strips (warning, the Sensi-Stop strips are ridiculously tiny, and I used the whole six pack in one go to cover the area the white strips covered, but the protection lasts for a month so it worked out).</li>
            <li>overall sensation is a bit odd: after 5-7 minutes you definitely notice a light tingling feeling near the gums as the gel activates and applies to your teeth.</li>
            <li>I hate thinking people are judging me on my not so bright smile.</li>
            <li>think the results definitely depend not only on the person, but their lifestyle as well (how much acid, coffee, cigarettes, etc.. you consume).</li>
            <li>: I have found that if I use the 3D White toothpaste it really helps keep them white.</li>
            <li>It felt like it was right down to the root.  </li>
            <li>No slipping and sliding!</li>
            <li>Since cold water or hot water will bring more pain to sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesnt hurt really, but there is some feeling in them which is not normal.  </li>
            <li>The other was evidently allergic and had a sore mouth for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m not the type to send the product back to Crest and get my money back, because I&#x27;m just too busy and in my little bit of free time I&#x27;d rather do something else.</li>
            <li>I suggest using the vivid white instead.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a major change with these</li>
            <li>Plus, for the amount of pain you suffer, there is barely any whitening!  </li>
            <li>Okay so i got this product, left it on my teeth for two hours as directed, and i felt a little tinglying but not very much.</li>
            <li>So, while my teeth do seem a little bit whiter, I would not consider it to be an amount worth the shooting pains afterwards, which have now lasted over sixteen hours.  </li>
            <li>The product directions indicate that only one 2 hour treatment per day, because it is highly concentrated and may cause issues if used too aggressively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $39 for the kit, which includes 4 pairs (1 upper &amp; 1 lower) of strips in the box.</li>
            <li>The product directions indicate that only one 2 hour treatment per day, because it is highly concentrated and may cause issues if used too aggressively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $39 for the kit, which includes 4 pairs (1 upper &amp; 1 lower) of strips in the box.</li>
            <li>The back of my throat hurt the rest of the day since I probably swallowed a small amount of the gel solution during that huge chunk of time.</li>
            <li>My teeth are whiter which is nice, but the strips make my teeth feeling horrrribly painful sensitive for the whole day.</li>
            <li>but wow after 2 hours the yellow is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>Barely even one shade difference,</li>
            <li>have absolutely no teeth sensitivity, but after this product my teeth have really hurt and stung.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this kit to anyone, but especially not to those with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>For a daily coffee/tea drinker like me, that is asking a lot for a Whitestrip to maintain its whitening power after 3 months of frequently drinking coffee/tea.  </li>
            <li>They are nearly invisible, hold well and actually do the job</li>
            <li>and I could barely brush my tenth 8 hours after I took them off.</li>
            <li>i can only hope and pray that by the time i wake up tomorrow, they will be gone, because it is nearly unbearable.</li>
            <li>Crest apparently changed the product to 1 Hour Express because reviews and complaints of pain for this product was</li>
            <li>After trying the regular white stips and the gentle white strips, I wanted a quicker working item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The strips come in different strengths to allow people with sensitive teeth to use them.  </li>
            <li>If you drink coffee and/or tea, you may need multiple applications to get some momentum, and I might recommend the normal 3D Professional kit, which takes weeks of shorter treatments rather than one long one.  </li>
            <li>Back in the old days I purchased teeth trays and whitener from my dentist to the tune of $500.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So now I&#x27;ve tried the Crest 3D strips and they are a definite improvement over the old strips.  </li>
            <li>I used this product twice and barely noticed a difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the whitening I did obtain, did not last anywhere near three months, and faded after about three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Additionally, the whitening I did obtain, did not last anywhere near three months, and faded after about three weeks.    </li>
            <li>But barely noticable :</li>
            <li>/&gt;***Basically, if you use these, it&#x27;s like using the old school Crest Whitestrips (lowest level) and getting those same results in 2 hours instead of 14 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth have now become quite sensitive to air, water and all such.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive teeth and a low pain tolarance, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li>a 30 year old male.</li>
            <li>I read the directions and after careful reading of warnings (which were really none), I put this on for 2 hours.  </li>
            <li>Towards the last hour, I felt like my tongue was beaten \\&quot;eaten\\&quot; up alive, but I still kept it on.  </li>
            <li>I feel like knives are being continuously jabbed into each individual tooth that the strip touched - this has been going on for 3 hours so far.</li>
            <li>My teeth were barely whiter, and the pain brought me to tears.</li>
            <li>My teeth are old and now they are getting white.  </li>
            <li>my teeth barely got any whiter.</li>
            <li>I used toothpaste for sensitive teeth around the time that I used these, and I think it helped, as they were mostly back to normal the next day, and a couple of days later, they didn&#x27;t have any sensitivity at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Final word years later: I think there should be a class action against crest for these strips</li>
            <li>For the next hour my teeth felt normal, but by the second hour.. OMG! OUUUCHHH!</li>
            <li>They whitened my teeth 2 shades which I was kind of skeptical about.</li>
            <li>My teeth didn&#x27;t exactly hurt, but they were extremely sensitive for a few hours after I used them, to the extent that I didn&#x27;t want to eat or drink anything.</li>
            <li>My teeth look slightly lighter but this pain is very intense and almost intolerable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;These do work well, but find a less intense version if your teeth are somewhat sensitive to begin with.</li>
            <li>I am literally crying right now about the regret I feel over using this product.</li>
            <li>but after the first half hour I got used to them.</li>
            <li>The instructions say not to use these strips on loose teeth because the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; truly feels like duct tape firmly stuck to your teeth.</li>
            <li>I discovered I could not go through the entire process because I&#x27;d have sensitivity pain that only stopped when I took warm water and help it in my mouth for a few seconds and then repeated for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Two hours is a long time to wear them, but after a few minutes I normally forget that they&#x27;re there and there is a noticable difference - my co-workers even commented on my smile the next day.</li>
            <li>They really stick and aren&#x27;t all goopy like the other</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already put in the time to whiten my teeth with the other 14-30 day treatments and 2 hours is really all I&#x27;m looking to do to freshen up my teeth.</li>
            <li>Much like the other 100</li>
            <li>When removing, start from the backs of your teeth, on one side, and gently pull across to the other side.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never done teeth whitening before and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but after years of smoking, I didn&#x27;t think it would be dramatic and it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Then in recent years I have occasionally been using the old skool Crest Whitestrips.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thankfully, this is the third day and the pain finally has stopped even though my teeth are somewhat sensitive still.</li>
            <li>I tried the 3D 1-Hour Express and was pleasantly surprised after only 1 hour of wearing them, my teeth were several shades lighter.  </li>
            <li>Did not get as much whitening as I expected, but could definitely tell a difference.</li>
            <li>I consume hot and cold but brush my teeth with warm water so that says that they&#x27;re a little sensitive</li>
            <li>i found myself drooling a little and talking funny with the soreness for those hours afterwards.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll certainly buy other Crest white strips.  </li>
            <li>Keeping them in for two hours turned out to be a lot less comfortable that the 30 minutes needed for the 14-day version - my teeth started to ache a bit (and I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth), plus it is hard to completely relax your mouth while you are aware of these strips, so my jaw was a little achy towards the end.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Applying the strips was an easy process, and although awkward at first, the strips aren&#x27;t intrusive.</li>
            <li>I have white teeth naturally in general</li>
            <li>6 hours later, my teeth hurt just as much, despite pain killers and every other home remedy I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>However, don&#x27;t expect to see IMMEDIATE results--it will take several days for the whiteness to become apparent.  </li>
            <li>My teeth are normally not sensitive, but about four hours after using this product, my front teeth were in considerable discomfort.</li>
            <li>I bought these strips after reading a few good reviews on amazon despite seeing several poor reviews on independant websites.</li>
            <li>After taking the strips off, I noticed a number of white &#x27;splotches&#x27; on my teeth, other than these splotches the teeth looked largely the same.</li>
            <li>It began as a dull ache, but graduated quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used crest whitening strips before and never have had much to complain about besides slight sensitivity.</li>
            <li>before we put it on, I was afraid I won&#x27;t be able to leave it on for 2 hours, without feeling like I can&#x27;t behave normally with it in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, this sucks, I put these on expecting some \\&quot;mild tooth sensitivity\\</li>
            <li>(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do continue to have some minor sensitivity which is expected, and had 1 quick sharp pain in my tooth while using the strips</li>
            <li>While there might have been a slight initial whiteness, they just did not do much of a job of whitening my teeth.  </li>
            <li>My teeth hurt for about a day and a half after using these - they aren&#x27;t typically sensitive (I can bite ice cream with no discomfort), so I was surprised.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness is doesn&#x27;t really show unless I smile a REALLY BIG SMILE :[]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not see a color difference, it may have been subtle, but I did not use them for the full two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have any bad taste in my mouth, which is good since I&#x27;d be stuck with it for 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>

            <li> Great article.</li>

            <li> However, a great deal of the discoloration was removed.</li>
            <li> And I experienced no issues placing them correctly.</li>
            <li> These are great when you&#x27;re in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that they work as well as the Crest white-strips that one uses for 20 days, but they&#x27;re great when you&#x27;ve forgotten an event coming up, and you need some in a pinch.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am happy with the results, just wish the sensitivity wasn&#x27;t an issue, but that is not Crest&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> But like they say &amp;#34;Beauty hurts&amp;#34; over all they&#x27;re great</li>
            <li> lol....</li>
            <li> I can just use it once on a free day for 2 hours and then not worry about it for 3 months!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be very honest.</li>
            <li> I will be very honest.</li>
            <li> but after I successfully removed them I had no residue on my teeth.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Nice!</li>
            <li> AND, the added bonus is that my teeth didn&#x27;t look remarkably whiter.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s peculiar and can&#x27;t be good.  </li>
            <li> The gel stuck really good though, the strips weren&#x27;t sliding around</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;ve given these 5 stars... but 4 stars seem fair to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> good results</li>
            <li> Was good.</li>
            <li> so I was a good candidate but</li>

            <li> I bought the best ever whiting product, five minute whitening gel and some cheap football teeth guards.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is really good.</li>
            <li> was so scared and the strips stuck on so good.</li>

            <li> &quot; kind of agony.  </li>
            <li> you want to whiten your teeth an easy and effective way - then give these a try!</li>
            <li> and I was so excited about the great price which was off the charts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many teeth whitening products over the years and Crest Advanced Seal products are easily the best.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are bright white and look excellent.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and no hassle at all.</li>
            <li> very easy to use</li>
            <li> The product was very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> My teeth look pretty damn good!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best whitening strips I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Quite a nice surprise:)</li>
            <li> I can honestly say it hurt more than my tattoo.  </li>
            <li> Great product, useful</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the straightest teeth, I&#x27;ll get something to straighten them one day, but having a bright smile is an amazing thing.</li>
            <li> They work great my first try butttt</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully, but I was looking for a product for some minor touch-up in between, maybe at the 1.5 month mark, just to keep things nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> and I experienced no pain and my teeth are very noticeably whiter.</li>
            <li> If I were ever to do this again, which I won&#x27;t, I&#x27;d make sure to press on that tooth off and on so that it would get even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was hoping for better results</li>
            <li> I think most people would find the level of pain truly excruciating.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The two week crest whitestrips and much better</li>
            <li> The whitening was ok but the pain afterwards....</li>
            <li> Recieved this product fast and for a great price...</li>
            <li> got a lovely sore on the top part front of my gums.</li>
            <li> The whitening is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I was not warned about custom charge prices and had to pay £24 on top of the £70 p&amp;p.</li>
            <li> Having just finished my Invisalign treatment, I dropped the extra money begrudgingly but was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> , I save the bottom strips for the top).</li>
            <li> When I wore these strips I saw a notable difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, overall, Its a GREAT product!</li>
            <li> but when I got it, it&#x27;s just the 1 box with 4 strips?&lt;br /&gt;Not such a great deal!!!</li>
            <li> I put the strips on and cooked dinner, by the time my fiancee got home I was able to take them off.</li>
            <li> After two strips and three weeks I was able to bring them to the whitening level I need for my dress.</li>
            <li> The strips really did stick great</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, I was happy with the product.</li>
            <li> and there is more of that yucky taste with these.  </li>
            <li> I was able to do chores around the house while my teeth were getting whiter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure after using all 4 sets throughout the month</li>
            <li> Make sure you dont brush ur teeth immediately before.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> These 2-hour applications are better for maintenance, I think.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are not horrible but they could use whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I would give it a 5th star if the whitening power was a bit more noticeable.</li>
            <li> And I had made sure the strips didn&#x27;t touch my gums, so</li>
            <li> I may not be able to eat tomorrow.  </li>
            <li> Most of the coffee stains have disappeared.</li>
            <li> One hour, okay.</li>
            <li> still okay.</li>
            <li> still okay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now been more than 48 hours</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ll say there are safer options to whiten the teeth than using those drastic strips.</li>
            <li> was more contniues and much more bearable.</li>
            <li> so the strips adhere better.  </li>
            <li> real problem with this product is the tooth sensitivity I experienced after using it.</li>
            <li> just more painful.rom chewing aluminum foil with your teeth.</li>
            <li> so you get greater coverage</li>
            <li> I have read reviews about the Crest Advanced Seal Whitening Strips which stay on 30 minutes and require more treatments within a 14 day period, that these are more effective and provide more whitening benefits.  </li>
            <li> I love these, my teeth are so white, perfect for my upcoming wedding</li>
            <li> Price is great, Fast Delivery, I received te 2 hour Express, was hoping for the 1 hour</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now going to have to spend more money just to get rid of this distracting achy pain from my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> I was expecting much more.</li>
            <li> this was a rip off for sure.  </li>
            <li> Uhm, not quite sure what to say about this product.</li>
            <li> Not quite sure it whitens my teeth.</li>
            <li> But ones I&#x27;ve bought from a convenient store work better...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> Love to use this type of product.</li>
            <li> but I felt they worked better if I avoided that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest whitestrips for years, and love their product.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably need more than one package of these if you haven&#x27;t whitened in a while.</li>
            <li> That really gave me some great looking teeth.</li>
            <li> , I think I&#x27;d feel better using something more often.</li>
            <li> more night\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> My lower teeth are most susceptible to the pain.</li>
            <li> I am hoping for even better results in 3 mths.</li>
            <li> wonder that they dont want you using the whiteners more than once a month</li>
            <li> Advil and Aleve haven&#x27;t been able to touch it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s under 6 bucks for more than you&#x27;ll need.</li>
            <li> Stayed in place much better than the others that I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure if the strips worked AT ALL</li>
            <li> As soon as it wears off, take more.</li>
            <li> for 2 hours 15 minutes just to make sure</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today is day 4, I just put on one more 2 hour</li>
            <li> eat extremely healthy.  </li>
            <li> Mostly grilled or steamed seafood,&lt;br /&gt;fresh</li>

            <li> Mostly grilled or steamed seafood,&lt;br /&gt;fresh</li>
            <li> I was happy to find these on your site, and such a good price.</li>
            <li> Love these, I&#x27;ve used them before.  </li>
            <li> So glad they have improved the sticky stuff so that the strips don&#x27;t move around, they stay put.  </li>
            <li> this one is for like if you just wanna suttley whiten up your teeth. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I have used some many whitening systems and have not found the effects as this product in one application.</li>
            <li> you will have sensitivity to most whitening products.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> /&gt;The strips are ok for inbetween treatments</li>
            <li> These were FANTASTIC!</li>
            <li> sometimes more on the weekends when out with family or friends)...</li>
            <li> love these.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like the whitener helped them absorb even MORE wine.</li>
            <li> ...have to use more often</li>
            <li> it worked ok.....</li>
            <li> So glad I did.</li>
            <li> It is waxy which make it more comforable to wear for 2 hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought these on sale.  </li>
            <li> now is really more like 4 days for maximum effect.</li>
            <li> I experienced a mild instance of transitory tooth pain, but it passed quickly.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product, as I&#x27;ve tried the 5 minute crest strips and didn&#x27;t notice</li>
            <li> For the price I think this is a pretty good product, but of course a dentist will do a much better job if you want to spend the money to go that route.</li>
            <li> I had hot coffee (kinda defeating the whitening purpose, which didn&#x27;t even whiten that much) and the sip felt wonderful</li>
            <li> but I think a couple days of pain is more than worth a great smile.</li>
            <li> Natural is beautiful.</li>
            <li> but I say when it comes to convienece that this one (one 2-hr strip once a month) is pretty good.</li>
            <li> The teeth whitening strips stay perfectly in place for as long as you keep them there.</li>
            <li> These stick pretty good</li>
            <li> Surprisingly also, they did not make my teeth sensitive at alll!!!!</li>
            <li> The new and improved strips are great, too.</li>
            <li> Use them at your own risk, or be smart and don&#x27;t use them!!</li>
            <li> will be very sensitive but great product</li>
            <li> still noticed the bright whiteness endured the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Adaml noticed the bright whiteness endured the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today</li>
            <li> I truly believe this is one of the most important steps.</li>
            <li> I plan to switch to the Advanced Seal Formula for better results.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping for good things with this product seeing the reviews seemed high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t go from brown to brilliant white so easily, and some stains are easier to attack than others.  </li>
            <li> teeth do hurt right now - kind of pulsating -</li>
            <li> When I saw this product was coming out, I was extremely excited since I absolutely love Crest Whitening products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to carve out 15-30 minutes, but 2 hours seems like forever when you&#x27;ve got stuff glued to your teeth.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are also easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This very mild sensitivity lasted maybe 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I have still not been brave enough to leave them on for more than 1.5 hours, but I have read that rinsing with mouthwash or using some sensodyne afterwards helps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The strips were easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The strips are easy to apply and wear for two hours.  </li>
            <li> They were easy to apply and remove.  </li>
            <li> you get the hang of it, putting the strips on is fairly easy.  </li>
            <li> The strips were easy to apply and they stayed in place for the 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> oh 2 hours awesome white smile</li>
            <li> Easy application w/ supplied instructions.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> They stick well to your teeth and are easy to apply.</li>
            <li> This strips were so easy to use.</li>
            <li> It comes off easily when you rinse and brush your teeth after the 2 hours is up.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> have strong teeth</li>
            <li> Maybe these are just too strong even at 1/2 the recommended time for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ouch.  </li>
            <li> First of they go on nicely</li>
            <li> Although the strips are not uncomfortable, it was kind of a pain to keep them in my mouth</li>
            <li> and it was fine.  </li>
            <li> and I thought I would be fine</li>
            <li> After they were on, they were fine.</li>
            <li> Fine for being around the house, working in the yard, etc., but not something people won&#x27;t notice.  </li>
            <li> then that they were comfortable and easy to use...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine, but why would they say &amp;#34;removes years of stains in just one hour&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> i woke up feeling perfectly fine this morning.</li>
            <li> I figured, Vicodin helps with surgeries, I&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> its own, its a great product that does exactly what it promises, but do you ~need~ to buy this instead of the standard version?  </li>
            <li> Worked great but made my teeth super sensitive.</li>
            <li> Overall good product for strong healthy teeth.</li>
            <li> A quick search on the internet shows that she&#x27;s not alone: MANY customers have experienced the same type of crushing, piercing, \\&quot;I can&#x27;t breathe through my mouth because the air on my teeth makes me hit the ceiling\\</li>
            <li> I bought these to whiten my teeth a little bit for senior pictures and they worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> The original Crest Whitestrips easily moved around or slid off my teeth, sometimes within minutes after I put them on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> They may take more effort but they result in nice white teeth and no pain :)</li>
            <li> I also doubt that you can, or would want to, eat while wearing the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; strips.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, however, they did whiten my teeth noticeably.</li>
            <li> When I took them off my teeth looked amazing, much noticeably whiter than before.</li>
            <li> Most certainly worth the asking price--especially with the $5 and $10-off coupons that float around on Amazon&#x27;s coupon book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detailed review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have read reviews that it crates so much pain afterwords and can fully agree wth it - and you know its the kind of pain that creeeps on and likes to suprise</li>
            <li> Not blindingly white, but attractive</li>
            <li> At Home Tooth Whitening Light System]])</li>
            <li> But the promise of movie star teeth bling (and perhaps the fact that it was free), got me to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I got the free sample with the purchase of a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Actually so much, that I wasn&#x27;t sure I won&#x27;t take off a tooth with it :)</li>
            <li> Although you can talk pretty easily with the strips on, I&#x27;ve found that the more you move your mouth around,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of the original 14-day Crest White Strips for years, and have always been happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> The only way I was able to surpass those 12 hrs of pain was taking a sleeping pill to sleep it off!!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I am brave enough to do the full 2 hours...</li>
            <li> Thanks for your help and happy new year</li>
            <li> They were really easy to put on, they&#x27;re really sticky, and I was able to get the strips in the cracks of my teeth easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used the original strip and never has a problem.</li>
            <li> I was excited to give the 2-hour version a test drive</li>
            <li> the original Whitestrips did.  </li>
            <li> With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton]], and also provide more whitening upkeep than this every-3-month product.  </li>
            <li> With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton]], and also provide more whitening upkeep than this every-3-month product.  </li>
            <li> Of course I read the reviews after I placed the first strip on my top layer of teeth.</li>
            <li> however the more often u use them the more likely it is you will have greater sensitivity and pain.</li>
            <li> I hoped to see significant, near-immediate whitening.  </li>
            <li> Again, my teeth did not look significantly</li>
            <li> and I think it&#x27;s pretty safe to say that the Express Strips did not cause me any pain, not even a bit of sensitivity.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I was excited to try this 2 hour product.  </li>
            <li> With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton]], and make sure to use Sensodyne during the treatment.  </li>
            <li> With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton]], and make sure to use Sensodyne during the treatment.  </li>
            <li> I found that my teeth returned to thier original color within 4 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant change in the shade of my teeth.</li>
            <li> works well if you have original teeth</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see how well these were going to work.</li>
            <li> The whitening was fairly significant, though, so I decided \\&quot;one</li>
            <li> The edges and gumline remained the original yellowish color.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Soon after, however, I began to experience significant pain in my teeth.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both used these and saw a significant improvement.</li>
            <li> Both of our teeth were significantly whiter.</li>
            <li> All I know is that my teeth look nice and white and all I use is Crest strips, the latest batch being these 2-hour strips.  </li>
            <li> I used before regular whitestrips and to be honest they did much better job than those 2-hour express.</li>
            <li> I have used Crest Whitestrips many times and love the professional effects.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted bright teeth for a client meeting, and my teeth really needed a brightening up.  </li>
            <li> and these are nothing special.  </li>
            <li> wanting to rip them right out of their roots!  </li>
            <li> to the more aggressive options [bleach and high intensity gels with a whitening light used 20 times every 2 minutes]</li>
            <li> will be sure to get more of these amazing little</li>
            <li> will be sure to get more of these amazing little</li>
            <li> was pleasantly surprised to see that the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li> Did not change teeth shade one bit after a full hour.</li>
            <li> but those are the only good things I can say.&lt;br</li>
            <li> mother always told me you have to suffer for beauty, and in this case I guess it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton]] when that product became available.  </li>
            <li> Not even full two hours.</li>
            <li> so I thought it would be a superior product(wrong)&lt;br /&gt;2)It promises results in only 2 hours which was basically</li>
            <li> Crest is giving me a full refund, BUT i now have go to my dentist.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t want to wear the strips for 30 days to get the full result.  </li>
            <li> About an hour after removing the strips, a tingling sensation began to grow in my teeth, and has continued on to a full blown pain fest.</li>
            <li> They have a better seal and do not seem to have as much \\&quot;goo\\&quot; on them.  </li>
            <li> Also I would make sure you do it on a day or night when you don&#x27;t have plans to socialize or talk too much.</li>
            <li> These absolutely work, leave on longer for even better results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d much rather spend more money and have my teeth whitened by my dentist.</li>
            <li> They went on okay, and I was able to leave them on the whole 2 hours without much fuss.  </li>
            <li> you have - or even if you don&#x27;t have - sensitive teeth, refrain from using this product, or you may pull out your own teeth one by one, in hopes of alleviating the pain our s</li>
            <li> For a 2 hour treatment not bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They&#x27;re not bad,</li>
            <li> The taste is not bad, but I would not drink anything during this time period.  </li>
            <li> I am happy to report that the usual excruciating pain I have in the days after using teeth whitening strips is significantly reduced using this strategy!</li>
            <li> My teeth are significantly whiter now, but the pain at the moment doesn&#x27;t feel worth it.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any of the gum pain or tooth pain experienced by some other users.  </li>
            <li> I was fine for the first hour, until I started getting this literal blinding pains that literally went to the core of my teeth.</li>
            <li> After first \\&quot;application\\&quot;, everything seemed fine until that evening.</li>
            <li> I am glad I saved the extra cash from a spared office visit, but I wish they were slightly more affordable.</li>
            <li> decided to go to sleep to pass the time quickly, and got up on time to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i wanted a quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;anyway</li>
            <li> Luckily I didn&#x27;t experience any of the pain that others have.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 16 and have always prided myself on my white smile and always have taken really good care of my teeth.</li>
            <li> quick becuase</li>
            <li> So I decided to try this product hoping to see a bright white smile in a couple hours.</li>
            <li> The product shipped quickly as well.</li>
            <li> so perhaps I was lucky.</li>
            <li> If you have any questions they will answer to your e-mail so quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty good size guy, and a pair of strips barely covers 6-7 teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a quick fix, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> Whitened my teeth but wasn&#x27;t anything super</li>
            <li> just needed a quick touch up before pictures, they whiten your teeth but don&#x27;t expect a miracle.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product, It does work and better than the dentist office whitening.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I love this product because you only use it 4 times in 1 whole yr!!!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results I had with only one box of the 1 Hour Express.  </li>
            <li> There is no unpleasant taste, but the frothy foam type substance tends to bubble up around the gums...</li>
            <li> They bind very well to the teeth and are easy to wear.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to place and they really grip your teeth.  </li>
            <li> and you will get some pretty pearly whites!</li>
            <li> Was excited about whitening my teeth for the first time.</li>
            <li> Came on time, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Reviews scared me off as too many videos records pain and super sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> anything that can help is useful, in this case, they&#x27;re not expensive, treatments can be taken over if need be and they&#x27;re pretty easy to employ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always been pretty happy with the result from the other whitening strips.</li>
            <li> I experienced a little bit of sensitivity the day after I used them</li>
            <li> I have used the old school 14 day whitening strips with minimal sensitivity and very good results.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they are worth using.</li>
            <li> They were slightly sensitive and mostly a chipped tooth I have on the bottom, and I didn&#x27;t use the strips on my bottom teeth (never do</li>
            <li> and you have a whiter smile.</li>
            <li> But, I like to use these strips to freshen up my smile.  </li>
            <li> But if you have sensitive teeth you may be better off going with the 30 minute strips.  </li>
            <li> These are worth a try before going to your dentist.</li>
            <li> For me, the end result  is worth it.</li>
            <li> In short: these are great for individuals who don&#x27;t have the patience to use the 14 or 21 day Professional Effects strips.  </li>
            <li> These just added to my smile.</li>
            <li> I rarely ever write reviews on products, but these strips caused me a lot of pain and discomfort and didn&#x27;t even whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> I used these one night so far and they worked better than the zoom I bought from the dentist.</li>
            <li> If I want more whitening, then I rest for 3-5 days until my teeth are no longer sensitive.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews either, but since it&#x27;s 4:45 in the morning</li>
            <li> so I figured it would be worth it, so</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s my own fault for pushing it so far knowing that it causes so much pain.</li>
            <li> Second, and most importantly, they hurt like hell.</li>
            <li> Go professional or use some more powerful over the counter strips, not these.</li>
            <li> I feel like this product is worth it</li>
            <li> , I can see my teeth are whiter and its worth the convenience of not having to do it night after night for me.</li>
            <li> These white strips and professional effects both work great</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re worth it for me.</li>
            <li> They stayed on nicely and my teeth are incredibly white after the two hours.  </li>
            <li> and I was looking for a brighter smile.</li>
            <li> The pain I am in right now is worse than the pain I experienced when my appendix decided it wanted to be forcibly evicted from my body (and I never thought I would say that about anything).</li>
            <li> The pain I am in right now is worse than the pain I experienced when my appendix decided it wanted to be forcibly evicted from my body (and I never thought I would say that about anything).</li>
            <li> I have experience with the original Crest White Strips which I enjoyed the results from but didn&#x27;t like the amount of commitment it required or the limitations the strips put on me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest white strips before, both the cheapest ones and the vivid ones, and I had experienced minimal sensitivity and fairly good results, enough to buy these because I thought they&#x27;d work even better.  </li>
            <li> However I have found that if I leave them on for 1.5 hours instead of the full two I have little to no pain and still get a good amount of whitening.</li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> was right</li>
            <li> Will not see results right away</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s killing me right now.</li>
            <li> If Hell were a place, right now it would be residing on my teeth and gums.</li>
            <li> What may have helped is, right after I took the strips off my teeth, in order to get the residue off(and thus the peroxide that was probably still on them)</li>
            <li> I do have sensative teeth (I can&#x27;t stand people who chew ice or just bite right through a popsicle).</li>
            <li> I used these right before my wedding and saw a drastic change.</li>
            <li> I used theses as instructed, but they made my teeth VERY sensitive for almost a full day afterwards, I ended up using oragel to calm the pain!</li>
            <li> I also know that professional whitening comes with some discomfort and is anywhere from $300-$500, though laser whitening is the best and usually $500</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Crest Whitestrips in the past, and while I could always live with the idea of wearing the plastic film on my teeth for eight hours or more, the idea of getting it done in two hours certainly had great appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll go back to the 14-day version - popping them on after breakfast in the morning for 30 minutes (more than the time it takes me to shower, get dressed and get ready to leave the house) is much easier and the results are much more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I see a bright future for them in a new Saw movie.</li>
            <li> tolerated the 2hour pain and was lucky enough not to have any more pain after I took off the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Work fast and easily, but didn&#x27;t really see a lot of whitening difference.</li>
            <li> I liked using it because it was so easy and was non messy.  </li>
            <li> While the dentist will make a mold of your teeth, and whiten all surfaces of all your teeth, this product takes a more modest, and perhaps more practical approach, and just gives you strips that will cover the front surfaces of your front-most teeth, upper and lower jaw.  </li>
            <li> overall, 3D is better than $500 dentist teeth trays, 3D is better than the old skool strips.  </li>
            <li> Despite the pain, I would do it again but more frequently than every 3 months to hopefully get better and longer lasting results.  </li>
            <li> I used the 30 minute strips in the past and they worked great.</li>
            <li> a daily drinker of strong coffees and teas, I was interested in the Crest Whitestrips ever since they became available.  </li>
            <li> I took Advil and was able to sleep a little more but woke up in pain again.</li>
            <li> The only positive point was that I was able to return them for a full refund even though I had used one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that my teeth were probably 1 to 1 and a half shades lighter, but my calcium stains from my braces were extremely bright.  </li>
            <li> I think the result are on par with the professional dentist trays that I paid for - but the stips make finding the time to whiten so easy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to sleep all night because of the intense sensitivity and I do not have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Sure they were supposed to be used over a few months, but I had more immediate needs.  </li>
            <li> process of putting on the strips was simple enough and I experienced no noticeable discomfort or pain while wearing the strips</li>
            <li> So here I am, in my own personal iron maiden for absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So here I am, in my own personal iron maiden for absolutely nothing.  </li>
            <li> After finally finishing my box of four within the last year, I can say that this is a great product.</li>
            <li> They are clear, but the whitening gel foams up, so they give your teeth a bright white funny look while they are on.  </li>
            <li> Strips are very fast to put on and off.</li>
            <li> Although it is far easier to talk while wearing the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; strips compared with the original Whitestrips (which could easily be moved or dislodged with the slightest mouth movements), with the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; strips stuck to my teeth, my speech was usually slightly altered, as if I had a bit of peanut butter in my mouth or as if I was wearing braces.  </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t whitened your teeth before and it&#x27;s that important to you, invest the time in the Professional Effects or the Advanced Vivid strips.</li>
            <li> My gums were sensitive during the first brushing after use, but fine otherwise.</li>
            <li> the crest 3d white 2-hour express teeth whitening strips 4 count work as well on my teeth to make them more cleaner lookiing.</li>
            <li> The first problem is the 2 hr time span.</li>
            <li> If they don&#x27;t, though, I will likely obtain more.  </li>
            <li> I was pleased overall with the product and its results.</li>
            <li> Even the lower level crest white strips whiten better.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use a more extensive and time consuming whitening kit.</li>
            <li> It was like someone took a hot glue gun to my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not sure if most people will be truly pleased with</li>
            <li> After all, these products are not exactly inexpensive, and I want to get my money&#x27;s worth of whitening with each application!  :-)  </li>
            <li> Once-A-Week Whitestrip\\&quot; that would be more convenient than daily use of the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Once-A-Week Whitestrip\\&quot; that would be more convenient than daily use of the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> What ever you do, don&#x27;t brush your teeth first and then put these on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes your teeth more sensitve where you get these white spots and sore spots as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I suspect most such products are.  </li>
            <li> but my teeth were VERY noticeably whiter!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll see a difference from the first use, and you&#x27;re meant to use 1 every 3 months</li>
            <li> Used exactly as stated on the package.. never, never again.</li>
            <li> i kept a pic record of how my teeth is changing color, and it got MUCH whiter!</li>
            <li> I was so worried at first because i thought, oh, it hurt to put them on for 30 mins</li>
            <li> Tooth look brighter with the first strip.</li>
            <li> I did see good color change, but not sure if it&#x27;s worth the pain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using the recommended 3D White toothpaste and mouthwash which I think may have brightened them even more than they appeared yesterday.</li>
            <li> Just having something on your teeth may irritate you at first, but give it some time</li>
            <li> The 2-hr Express version just has a thicker gel, along with a bit better strip design, to allow you to get a substantial effect with only one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then yesterday I tried the Crest strips for the first time.</li>
            <li> The whitening is especially noticeable, because you see the results in two hours, instead of gradually over many treatments.  </li>
            <li> Same results, except that the splotches were even more noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I did notice results although my teeth are already pretty light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (they were really stuck on there!).  </li>
            <li> I followed the steps exactly like the instructions said, en everything seemed to be going well...  </li>
            <li> soooo much pain!</li>
            <li> The pain is pretty unbearable.</li>
            <li> I did my first treatment two days ago.</li>
            <li> (I know, why would I try this without checking reviews first?</li>
            <li> I know you are only supposed to use these strips once every 3 months, but I think I am going to try them again in a day or so to get a more noticeable effect.</li>
            <li> Most people complain about sensitivity &amp; pain, but this is my third time uses crest products, so I knew what to expect.</li>
            <li> I would recommend simply using Crest&#x27;s 3D White Toothpaste (which is excellent) or a different whitening procedure instead.</li>
            <li> The Crest 2 Hour Express Whitestrips and 3D White Rinse is one of Crest&#x27;s many products in their at-home teeth-whitening line.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it if you are willing to deal with some pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crests line of whitening products for 3-4 years now (from the first products where you brushed on the whitening gel to the newest Advanced Seal strips) and these are my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> I would NOT recommend these strips for first time users.</li>
            <li> its not blingin like diamonds, but still pretty.</li>
            <li> This was my first time attempting to use any sort of teeth whitening strips.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and came within 3-4 days!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using these</li>
            <li> although i made sure that the strip was on teeth only and not making contact with my gums.</li>
            <li> Bought it and did exactly as instructed and no change at all.  </li>
            <li> But the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Even when the product is used exactly as instructed, tooth sensitivity ensues a couple of hours after using them.</li>
            <li> As an avid teeth whitener, I must warn you that you will experience sensitivity with every whitening procedure whether you use strips, trays or get it done at the dentist (which I also do).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re using this for the first time, I recommend trying one strip for the amount of time as instructed.</li>
            <li> I am in so much pain!  </li>
            <li> Used this product exactly as instructions stated.  </li>
            <li> These strips are better than the regular 14 day ones.  </li>
            <li> That stuff is pretty gooey, but it provided relief for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I took the strips off exactly 10 hours ago</li>
            <li> I took the strips off exactly 10 hours ago</li>
            <li> My teeth were noticeably even more white</li>
            <li> Love the convenience of only using for 2 hours every 3 months.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Thanks I will use this service again!</li>
            <li> After day 5 I always have had the most white teeth that people would stop and comment while I was shopping, on an elevator etc.</li>
            <li> It is not uncomfortable but is something that you notice.</li>
            <li> Some people have sensitive gums and I&#x27;m fortunate not to be one of them; perhaps Crest should state that on their instructions.  </li>
            <li> Upon removal (and there is a significant residue that must be wiped away after), I did notice that my teeth were significantly whiter, if not the neon white promised in the advertising.</li>
            <li> And, these work very well!</li>
            <li> I will be posting this review on as many sites as possible, and contacting Crest.</li>
            <li> And they worked on me on the first try</li>
            <li> they are more of an off white</li>
            <li> Whiten teeth 10 times more than the &amp;#34;storebrand &amp;#34;I purchased from my local department store.</li>
            <li> Not just with cold/ hot.</li>
            <li> They hurt consistently.</li>
            <li> I am very familiar with the Crest strips, and I take precautions, such as using [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> full week later, my teeth look SIGNIFICANTLY whiter than pre-treatment.  </li>
            <li> This is in contrast to the old style strips that are gummy and don&#x27;t make good contact (not as good results) or the big trays that make it hard to breath.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say the results should last 3 months, but don&#x27;t clearly indicate whether it is safe to use them more frequently, so I don&#x27;t know if I can try another application sooner to see if I can improve the results</li>
            <li> With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton]], these new strips have two notches in the upper/lower strips that help the strips to tuck behind your teeth edge more easily.  </li>
            <li> I have experienced a little sensitivity, however, I tried using sensitive toothpaste for about 2 weeks before and after whitening and this seems to help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they take longer, but with consistent use are just as, if not more, effective, and they&#x27;re certainly not as painful.</li>
            <li> They did whiten my teeth noticeably and w/o using them for the full allotted time so I can imagine what they&#x27;d do if left on the full time.</li>
            <li> but it ruined my enamel so much that I can most likely never whiten my teeth again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It could be my own fault because the impression I got from seeing the commercials and ads was that it was the same whiteness as Professional Effects.</li>
            <li> Luster White actually gave me good results...</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked over a lot of different options (from the more gentle Crest options [1 strip a day for 5 minutes every day monthly]</li>
            <li> The adhesive holds very well to to the teeth for the 2 hour whitening time, and I love that it&#x27;s only 2 hours every 3 months.  </li>
            <li> The old, regular Crest WS worked good for me even though it made my teeth very sensitive.  </li>
            <li> many times in the past (higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide than normal strips) and been able to handle it.  </li>
            <li> many times in the past (higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide than normal strips) and been able to handle it.   </li>
            <li> I have healthy teeth, not sensitive at all.</li>
            <li> first thing that I did was to really examine my pain level on a scale.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well but teeth very sore for about 20 hours afterwards.</li>
            <li> Tried one of these types of strips for the first time today, and kept them on the whole two hours.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty much in keeping with the rest of the Crest whitening line, but after just 30 minutes I could feel what was almost a burning sensation on my gums.</li>
            <li> it is not worth the money i always liked the dissolving strips.</li>
            <li> The strips are just as easy to use as the original, and in fact are much \\&quot;stickier\\&quot; - there is a lot less slipping than with the 2-week kind.  </li>
            <li> used this a month ago and my teeth are still white and clean, they feel so fresh all the time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest, I did notice a slight whitening of my teeth (and I&#x27;m not complaining about that)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after doing quite a bit of research, thinking the results would be exactly as stated: noticeable whitening in only two hours, side effects including (possibly) light tooth/gum sensitivity/pain.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah</li>
            <li> Application of the stips to the teeth is easy and they stay intact the entire two hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say if you use these and have sore spots or sensitive teeth, you will feel it, even if it mild.</li>
            <li> granted they are pretty pricey, i am always pleased with the little boost i get from popping a pair on for a couple hours and having a noticeably whiter smile afterwards.</li>
            <li> done, my teeth certainly seemed whiter.</li>
            <li> The limitations were largely improved with the advent of the Advance</li>
            <li> Pure agony.</li>
            <li> i was scared to try them because of certain reviews but \\&quot;dont believe the hype\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I would characterize the result as a 20% lightening of color which doesn&#x27;t sound like much, but for a home treatment, that&#x27;s pretty solid.  </li>
            <li> i would definitely recommend it for busy bee&#x27;s like me! :)</li>
            <li> My teeth were already reasonably white, I really just wanted to touch up the small yellowish bits at the very tops of my teeth near the gums - and this did that perfectly.</li>
            <li> If not, then the standard product will be just fine for you.</li>
            <li> All was fine until about 3 hours later when I noticed some zinger type pains in one tooth.</li>
            <li> I feel like I should add that I have a very high pain tolerance.  </li>
            <li> It was fine the whole time I had them on but after took them off and brushed my teeth.</li>
            <li> I purchased the one-hour under the impression that results would be nearly immediate, but accompanied by tremendous tooth pain and sensitivity as many other review mention.</li>
            <li> The advertisement for this new Whitestrip is certainly enticing - all you have to do is get this box of 4 pairs of Whitestrips, and wear a strip for just 2 hours, repeating the treatment 3 months later, for a full year&#x27;s worth of whitening.  </li>
            <li> I really wish I&#x27;d taken a before photo but trust me when I say the difference is huge after only 1 treatment.</li>
            <li> However, I am writing this because I feel this product should have a huge red warning label on it!</li>
            <li> My teeth aren&#x27;t usually sensitive but this really made them hurt..which would&#x27;ve been worth it if they whitened..</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t feel like I wanted to spit the whole time.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t do much of anything to my teeth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have much to compare to</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very</li>
            <li> It was a really sticky gel, almost like a silicone</li>
            <li> Two aleve really helped.  </li>
            <li> They do cling to teeth very well....</li>
            <li> If you do not drink much coffee, tea, colas, perhaps this product will give you 3 months of whitening.tly drinking coffee/tea.  </li>
            <li> If you do not drink much coffee, tea, colas, perhaps this product will give you 3 months of whitening.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that much of a pain - but finding the hours to sit with them on was a challenge at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product from Crest makes whitening so much easier.</li>
            <li> So much pain</li>
            <li> Really could not tell a difference.</li>
            <li> They stayed on during the whole process really well.</li>
            <li> When my friend brought these over I decided that since I smoke and drink coffee, it was high time for me to whiten!</li>
            <li> it hurts so much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, when I removed the strips the effect was very slight--not really noticeable at all.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much difference after two hours.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These 2 hour strips really are sticky &amp; stay on</li>
            <li> I guess it really depends on how much time or sensitivity you have.  </li>
            <li> these 2 hour strips really didn&#x27;t cause me problems.  </li>
            <li> This 2-hour whitestrip is much easier to use than the 30 minute whitestrip.  </li>
            <li> I removed the strips, brushed my teeth lightly and then went to bed.  </li>
            <li> and it really helped with the pain.  </li>
            <li> I really think Crest is on to something here</li>
            <li> Whitening effect was as good as, if not better, than I&#x27;ve experienced in the past with the standard product, with no noticeable sensitivity during or after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the two hours you have them in your mouth they are slighlty umconfortable (unlike the Listerine strips which you can&#x27;t feel much) but manageable.</li>
            <li> These did the trick for me to whiten my teeth a bit although the strips did not stay on my teeth very well and was a bit of a hassle to keep adjusting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once these puppies go on my teeth, they aren&#x27;t moving until I take them off and that alone is worth it compared to the old strips.  </li>
            <li> How much whiter are my teeth?  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d expected \\&quot;express\\&quot; strips to give more of a \\&quot;wow\\&quot; when I was done.</li>
            <li> I tried to make sure there was minimal overlap with my gums.  </li>
            <li> With that being the case; I have whitening gel that comes straight from a dentist office (as a family member worked for a dentist), and I think I will try to speed up the results by adding some of the gel to it.</li>
            <li> After wearing the strips for an hour and 45 mins I felt intense pain in my teeth</li>
            <li> I did not notice any real difference in my teeth</li>
            <li> For anyone who wants whiter teeth, I suggest they try the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> For anyone who wants whiter teeth, I suggest they try the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Really nobody should use it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a whole lot</li>
            <li> and they were somewhat affected by the strips, but not so much that I wouldn&#x27;t use them again.</li>
            <li> I just tried out these Whitestrips, and they worked better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> too much wetness</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there really is a difference between all the strips.</li>
            <li> I use one strip for 30 to 1 hour, once a day for three days straight.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product for at home use if you don&#x27;t want to visit or pay your dentist $$$.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in too much pain to even notice if they worked.  </li>
            <li> this product does it cause you intense pain and a sleepless evening.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in so much pain that I can&#x27;t sleep, this is what it&#x27;s come to.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find much value in this one though.</li>
            <li> It did whiten my teeth, but not by much.</li>
            <li> These really did not whiten my teeth at all</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s done absolutely nothing for the pain.</li>
            <li> I really like how you use these every 3 months instead of every day or every week.</li>
            <li> Just rinse it of gently if needed.</li>
            <li> My teeth arent very yellow/brown</li>
            <li> It is doing ABSOLUTELY nothing, and I am shocked.&lt;br /&gt;--I</li>
            <li> Teeth were much whiter.</li>
            <li> Our family dentist loves these strips and recommends them to her patients, but for us they didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> Misleading-made it sound like we were getting 4 treatments and there were only 2.</li>
            <li> I finished my fourth one last night and my teeth are WHITE which feels great.</li>
            <li> I felt absolutely NO&lt;br</li>
            <li> No candy, junk food, fast food, foods with alot of sugar,&lt;br /&gt;no</li>
            <li> No candy, junk food, fast food, foods with alot of sugar,&lt;br /&gt;no</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work, May be for an hour</li>
            <li> Some reviews said their teeth hurt, I use Sensodyne pronamel gentle whitening toothpaste and it really helps sensetive teeth.</li>
            <li> I got fast and noticeable results from those.</li>
            <li> Yes they removed the stains a bit, but my teeth hurt SO much</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White Whitestrips with Advanced Seal 2 Hour Express 18 Month Supply,6 Count]]</li>
            <li> These work very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest 2-hour Whitestrips for over a year and find them to be very convenient.  </li>
            <li> When I was ready to use the product I opened it and read the directions.</li>
            <li> I kept the film on for 2 hours and noticed a considerably lighter brighter smile.</li>
            <li> Now, 5 hours after using the 3D Whitestrips, she wants to pull her teeth out.</li>
            <li> The pain was so intense I had a fever and could not sleep.</li>
            <li> I took off the strips at 3pm and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Crest should really consider pulling this product.</li>
            <li> It gave me intense pain with no noticeable results.</li>
            <li> Used the whole box (4 packets) of 1hr express in 2 days, 12 hrs between each packet.</li>
            <li> Two, Using them on a daily basis made my teeth extremely sensitive to the point that it hurt to breathe because the air touching my teeth alone was hurtful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame as I still have all the rest of the strips left and won&#x27;t be letting them near my mouth for sure.</li>
            <li> I used the professional white strips &amp; felt like those have given me the most improvement.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve whitened them a few times to keep them looking nice..</li>
            <li> hopefully in the next couple days it will whiten up even more and my teeth will stop being so sensitive.</li>
            <li> Those made my teeth more sensitive while I was using them, but didn&#x27;t cause any actual pain.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used these before with good results so we&#x27;re continuing to use these as we don&#x27;t care to wear the strips any longer than necessary, and certainly not day after day after day as you&#x27;re required to do with some.</li>
            <li> Both of the drugstores in my area (Chicago) had these exact same ones priced above $60 for the same 12 month supply which includes 4 sets of strips (4 for the top, 4 for the bottom.)&lt;br /&gt;Second, the application is so easy.  </li>
            <li> My dentist asked me if I had my teeth professionally whitened!!!  </li>
            <li> It turns color throughout the day depending on what you eat but after a quick brush it ends up pretty white.</li>
            <li> Compared to the original Crest Whitestrips, the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; technology really does work to hold the strips firmly to the teeth.  </li>
            <li> but anyways, i heard that the other whitening strips were better than the 2 hour express ones, so if you really need to whiten your teeth go for that one.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to whiten their teeth to go out on a special occasion and wants instant results.</li>
            <li> So I was excited to finally join the masses to try these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it tastes like hydrogen peroxide, not exactly yummy, but not horrible.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just most people don&#x27;t stick with them due to the pain.</li>
            <li> This product works faster and stays put better than the other strips.</li>
            <li> These arrive on time, as expected, no messy clean up, and user friendly.</li>
            <li> The date on the box was very expired so they did not work to their full potential of whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li> I use a sensitive teeth toothpaste and have never suffered more than some mild sensitivity with any other over-the-counter or professional product I have ever used ~ till now.  </li>
            <li> My teeth were so sensitive and it really bothered me for the rest of the day, but the next morning they felt fine.</li>
            <li> my teeth are pretty white right now.</li>
            <li> You would not want to use these strips&#x27; strong adhesion on any loose teeth.</li>
            <li> I will not do this process ever again and strongly recommend caution before using it if you think you could potentially have sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I have really noticed a 90% change in color and they are now super white!</li>
            <li> I have really noticed a 90% change in color and they are now super white!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have as much problem with them moving around that I normally have with whitening</li>
            <li> With that said, they don&#x27;t really require a time commitment, since you can go about your normal business with them</li>
            <li> It did the job, but not to the full potential.</li>
            <li> What surprised me was that you don&#x27;t brush your teeth first.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive teeth already, but I was willing to experience the pain for whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> Although the product did whiten my teeth, they are slightly more whiten where I pressed down.</li>
            <li> Two strips (for top and bottom teeth) come in a treatment, and lay over the teeth so that the peroxide presses down onto them and coats them.</li>
            <li> I ever experience more yellowing in the months down the road,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I ever experience more yellowing in the months down the road,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These are obviously the teeth that are most prominent when you open your mouth or smile, but obviously it does nothing for the other teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the results, but the are kind of inconvenient to use.  </li>
            <li> Also, the taste is not as overwhelming as the previous kits.</li>
            <li> I also used Sensodyne toothpaste to make the pain less, which worked for the most part.</li>
            <li> Oddly, when I pushed my tongue against the area that was hurting, it seemed to make it better</li>
            <li> I googled this and found a white strips review site and see that many people say the same thing.  </li>
            <li> I ignored it, expecting mild pain as a normality of white strips, which I&#x27;ve used all the time (just not these 2 hour ones).</li>
            <li> This kit is a super must for all beauty junkies that crave white teeth all the time!!!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fall apart and fall off like the older versions.  </li>
            <li> I have never experienced having sensitive teeth before, but this product just caused me to experienced so.  </li>
            <li> So if you are a first timer, I recommened you use the pro white strips first then move onto these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used regularly, Crest 3D whitening strips really does make a difference in the bightness of your smile.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a loyal user of all the White Strip formulations.</li>
            <li> First, my teeth looked exactly the same after I used them.</li>
            <li> Used it 4 days before prom and got decent results for being a rush.</li>

            <li> people even commented that my teeth were super white and asked where I went (referring to a dentist) to get it done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only noticed mild sensitivity.</li>
            <li> She followed the directions exactly and has no previous episodes of tooth pain or sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I have decent colored teeth and just needed them to brighten up a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually not bothered by much.  </li>
            <li> Yes, there was a minor difference in color - a tad whiter, but in no way is it worth the pain!</li>
            <li> fortunately, a quick search indicated these are normal and would go away in several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I advise no one buy these unless you have a HIGH pain tolerance.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend a straw</li>
            <li> highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally okay with a little bit of pain</li>
            <li> It hurt just a little when they were on but mostly unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> On top of that, I saw little, if any results.</li>
            <li> I imagine aspirin or ibuprofen might help a little more.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try the 2 hour white strips and had read multiple positive reviews.</li>
            <li> So when I saw these 2 hr ones, I thought \\&quot;wow, great--should be really good\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> but if you have very stained teeth, you may need a professional bleaching.  </li>
            <li> Absolute agony, my teeth are slightly sensitive to this day.</li>
            <li> They made them only verryyy slightly sensitive, definitely not bad at all and this bit of sensitivity goes away within a day or two.&lt;br</li>
            <li> this might lead you to believe that the strips were effective, at least, on the remaining parts of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I got up and took some aspirin and was able to get a few hour sleep.</li>
            <li> I would say it might be worth it if the strips had any actual whitening effect, but in my case they did nothing.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t normally write reviews.</li>
            <li> I woke up with my normal brushing routing and my&lt;br /&gt;teeth</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice it when I first received the box in April, but just looked today when getting ready to whiten with the second strips.  </li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll definitely try the Professional Effects, as many reviwers have suggested.</li>
            <li> so I figured this would be better than having to use the two week long white strips to save time and pain.</li>
            <li> okay, not a huge difference, but noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have pretty white teeth naturally, but other products I&#x27;ve used have had better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> crest product is similar, but much more limited.  </li>
            <li> They are harder to remove than the original (because of the increased stickiness) -</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do what I expected as I wanted to see a significant difference in the whitness of my teeth</li>
            <li> Did we all get a new batch of pain?</li>
            <li> &quot; the package mentions turned out to be equivalent to getting a mouthful of new fillings and then having a set of braces tightened.  </li>
            <li> So yesterday evening, I bought a new toothbrush, and it came with a sample of #Crest 3D 1-Hour Express Whitening Strips.</li>
            <li> For this sort of torture, I expect them to look like brand new porcelain.</li>
            <li> When you peel the strips off, there is a slightly odd aftertaste, but it was not disagreeable to me and can be easily washed away by rinsing with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally had two free hours but could only stand them for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed, 4 strips only , too much money for 4 strips and the didnt even work</li>
            <li> The pain started about 2 and a half hours after taking off the strips, so it&#x27;s been going for about five hours strong and no sign of letting up yet.</li>
            <li> In the future, I&#x27;ll stick with their Advanced Vivid white strips -</li>
            <li> Also, I have had very sensitive teeth ever since.  </li>
            <li> These do whiten your teeth, but they also make your teeth very sensitive</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve used them before, my teeth aren&#x27;t very sensitive</li>
            <li> So... I wish I would have read reviews on this product BEFORE using it, because I have very sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth, and i did experience sensitivity / discomfort after removing the strips as directed.  </li>
            <li> Teeth are exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive teeth, but if you have even the slightest bit of tooth sensitivity I do not recommend these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of the strips now, and overall am fairly pleased with this product, but not exactly blown</li>
            <li> My results were so-so, though I have pretty white teeth anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll report back ;)</li>
            <li> (your whitening your teeth not you gums!, plus it can make you gums sensitive!)</li>
            <li> I felt it mostly like hte shoots of pain to various parts of the treated teeth - will not recommend those strips, however I used the other 14 day strips and the pain</li>
            <li> Had the 3 - 4 month thing been disclosed prior to purchase, I would have given a higher rating.</li>
            <li> I purchased the white strips for the simple fact that it was the 2-hour express, and I simply did not want to wait days for show able results.</li>
            <li> As someone who has rarely experienced tooth discomfort/sensitivity from any food or dental hygiene product, I was surprised that these strips could cause me such an irritating amount of pain.</li>
            <li> but if used consistently you will notice a difference, especially if you are a coffee or tea drinker.</li>
            <li> I myself do not have particularly sensitive teeth, and this stuff kills them!</li>
            <li> Well, results were nearly immediate and I had no sensitivity at all!</li>
            <li> I left them on for exactly 2 hours as stated and did not see any difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I usually use Crest Pro strips, which cost quite a bit more than these.  </li>
            <li> I never have had sensitive teeth or tooth pain, not even a cavity!</li>
            <li> Dont use this product, the other crest white strips (14day) works much better.</li>
            <li> I wanted to write this review to clarify that this doesn&#x27;t cause pain on everyone with sensitive teeth!</li>
            <li> Normally, I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But then my teeth are already pretty white since I had a Zoom treatment-</li>
            <li> I followed all the directions my teeth were whitened unevened and white spots.... not to mention my whole mouth was in severe pain!</li>
            <li> And the fact that it didnt whiten them at all was a huge let down after all that pain.</li>
            <li> thought I was being &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; by purchasing the new Crest Sensitive Strips (not the whitening ones).</li>
            <li> I am going to try the new professional strips to see how they work,</li>
            <li> The adhesive on these new Whitestrips seem to be a bit stickier than before even though the previous \\&quot;Professional Effects\\&quot; Advanced Seal was already quite sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth usually, but I used the strips more than 8 hours ago</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Bought the box of 4 white strips, thinking that it would last a full year as advertised.  </li>
            <li> These whitestrips are very poorly designed so they don&#x27;t work so well (as compared to opalescence or something you squeeze out onto your own tray), and it is overpriced too!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last long but for not even seeing much of a difference at all in the whiteness of my teeth, it wasn&#x27;t worth the pain.  </li>
            <li> for the love of god only put these on your teeth for a half hour - 45 min tops.</li>
            <li> Three months later, I applied them for a second session and did experience some mild shooting pains in one of my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> Fortunately the pain only lasted one day for me, after an extra nights rest my teeth went back to normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not promising you will have zero pain, but if you&#x27;re like me, even half as much pain would be much more tolerable.</li>
            <li> with regular Whitestrips, application of the film on the teeth is very simple, and once they&#x27;re on, its easy to forget that you&#x27;re wearing them, and you could - if you wanted to - go out in public wearing them with no one noticing them, unless they&#x27;re closely looking at your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This minimal discomfort seemed like a fair trade for the slight whitening effect that I saw on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest issue is with the \\&quot;possible side effects\\&quot; of \\&quot;tooth sensitivity\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> i think more the next day it looked a little whiter than before.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth, but they did cause some to have a sharp aching pain and the rest to be mildly sore for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I used the Whitestrip last night and the gel that was on them feels like a real dentist&#x27;s gel, something that a professional would apply</li>
            <li> According to my dentist, I have fairly white teeth when he puts the tooth whiteness scale to my teeth and don&#x27;t really need a professional bleaching.</li>
            <li> This product definitely makes a difference, but nowhere near as much as the box or advertising would lead you to believe.</li>
            <li> It is a clear piece of plastic with a layer of hydrogen peroxide covering the strip.  </li>
            <li> So if you feel compelled to use a Crest product, I would try the others but stay clear of the 2 Hour Express.  </li>
            <li> Stick with Professional Effects, same price, and make your teeth SO much whiter.</li>
            <li> This is a fast acting product that works well.  </li>
            <li> Can make teeth sensitive.  </li>
            <li> my teeth sensitive?  </li>
            <li> My teeth have never been sensitive no matter what the weather, food temperature, whitening strips, toothpastes...</li>
            <li> These strips made my teeth horribly sensitive.</li>
            <li> However, I really wonder how well this whitening will last during the 3-month period before I use another one of these \\&quot;Express\\&quot; strips again.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> I dont have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Most of them work, but have one flaw in common, the tape never sticks.</li>
            <li> Maybe my teeth were white to begin with, but I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference afterwards.</li>
            <li> I started to get scared after reading some of the reviews that my teeth would become painfully sensitive.</li>
            <li> My teeth never got painfully sensitive.</li>
            <li> Followed direction, put this on for 2 hrs, near the end</li>
            <li> They make your teeth very sensetive for several days also.  </li>
            <li> , about an hour later I awoke in intense pain.</li>
            <li> and they really work after only two hours.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m going to take her advice (because it completely makes sense) and test run these strips again maybe 4-5 days from now to continue the whitening process.  </li>
            <li> -- also try to tuck the strip into the teeth crevices so you wrap the whole tooth as to not leave a not so white outline!</li>
            <li> and I can use the 3D professional strength without issue.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are occasionally sensitive</li>
            <li> recommend you buy the PROFESSIONAL EFFECTS strips instead of the express.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER had sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> These strips really cannot be worn outside of your house.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been 24 so far</li>
            <li> It is way too much to take especially for someone who has senstivite teeth.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say that I have sensitive teeth either</li>
            <li> , i have crack lines on my teeths and 3 white (really bright)dots on my front tooth.</li>
            <li> I had to go to sensitive teeth toothpaste and</li>

            <li> I have never had sensitive teeth until I used them.</li>
            <li> This product is not for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Overall, I could see improvement in the shade of my teeth and they did not cause much discomfort.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Crest for continuing to sell these despite obviously knowing the risk.</li>
            <li> will never waste my money on gimmick teeth whiteners again.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> The pain in my teeth far exceeds the amount of whitening that was achieved.</li>
            <li> I have slightly sensitive teeth, and these did not bother me at all.  </li>
            <li> About three hours later I began to experience some intense pain and sensitivity.</li>
            <li> The intense pain lasted for about seven hours and sensitivity was present for about twelve.</li>

            <li> teeth aren&#x27;t even that sensitive, and I feel like I need prescription painkillers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth and this product has caused every tooth in my mouth to have shooting pain.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old.</li>
            <li> I think my teeth may be sensitive to this product.</li>
            <li> My teeth are soooooo sensitive they are killing me.  </li>
            <li> However, I used a straw to ensure it did not get near the application strips...</li>
            <li> However, these did not bother my sensitive teeth at all.</li>
            <li> The strips definitely made my teeth whiter, not as white as I expected, but I am satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the professional effects before I used this product</li>
            <li> I couldnt sleep all night because how sensitive my teeth were after using.</li>
            <li> Or whiten professionally</li>
            <li> I hope this pain doesn&#x27;t last much longer.</li>
            <li> It was very afordable and I only need to use one strip to whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> They are not cheap, comes in a pack of four, and would love to get my money back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was not clear from the instructions how to put it exactly, and which strip goes</li>
            <li> At this rate, assuming continuous improvement, I suspect it would take 4-6 treatments (1-1.5 boxes) to go from a moderately yellow smile to a noticeably white one.</li>
            <li> im actually surprised by how many negative reviews there are.  </li>
            <li> I was not able to enjoy any of the delicious Christmas food from today :(</li>
            <li> After all if you only needed to do it every few months it had to make a huge difference compared to the daily or weekly treatments, right?</li>
            <li> Made my teeth a little sore for a day or so, but it was well worth it!</li>
            <li> now I am really worried that I am going to have this intense pain all night long and possibly for days.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many home whitening kits from Crest over the past ten years.</li>
            <li> I would much rather suffer through the inconvenience of using multiple strips over the course of a few days than to do a one time quick session that doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  </li>
            <li> The whitening provided by this product is pretty similar to the results after about two months of using Crest&#x27;s 3D White Toothpaste.</li>
            <li> I left them on for exactly two hours....and revealed the same teeth I had before.</li>
            <li> I used to drink more red wine in the past, but it is contraindicated with some of the medication I take now</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re one of those people that just wants things to be done as quickly as possible, there&#x27;s certainly a virtue, and if you like the effect of standard Whitestrips but find the experience of wearing them objectionable, you&#x27;ll definitely want it.  </li>
            <li> I has such high hopes for these 2 hour strips ~ but I have to say that I&#x27;m dissapointed in the results.  </li>
            <li> The box contains four treatments, so it may be more economical than their other products, since the price per treatment is not as expensive (most other Crest products require you to use the entire box for a treatment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> upon closer inspection, it quickly becomes clear that the whitening is patchy and extremely uneven</li>
            <li> I do have fairly sensitive teeth, but I never expected pain like this.</li>
            <li> After lots of Advil, regular doses of Tylenol, and finally, thank the stars, some canker sore medicine that my husband had once bought rubbed on my gums I was able to drop off for a few hours.  </li>
            <li> They do stick pretty well though and seem to have minimal overflow</li>
            <li> I have used the normal white strips from Crest without an issue, but just used the 1 hour express over the weekend</li>
            <li> The strips hold right with little waste, and the results were fabulous.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The whitening effect of these seemed similar to the full round to me, so I think they did live up to their promise.</li>
            <li> Before using these strips, I&#x27;d previously used the original Crest Whitestrips that used a two-week series of daily strips.</li>
            <li> I spent the next few hours putting my mouth and tongue in every imaginable position to try and make me a little more comfortable but nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> During my testing of this new Whitestrip, instead of waiting 3 months before using another application, I waited 2 weeks later and then applied another Whitestrip.  </li>
            <li> When I bought the express white strips, I also bought the new Crest Sensi-Stop Strips (warning, the Sensi-Stop strips are ridiculously tiny, and I used the whole six pack in one go to cover the area the white strips covered, but the protection lasts for a month so it worked out).</li>
            <li> overall sensation is a bit odd: after 5-7 minutes you definitely notice a light tingling feeling near the gums as the gel activates and applies to your teeth.</li>
            <li> I hate thinking people are judging me on my not so bright smile.</li>
            <li> think the results definitely depend not only on the person, but their lifestyle as well (how much acid, coffee, cigarettes, etc.. you consume).</li>
            <li> : I have found that if I use the 3D White toothpaste it really helps keep them white.</li>
            <li> It felt like it was right down to the root.  </li>
            <li> No slipping and sliding!</li>
            <li> Since cold water or hot water will bring more pain to sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesnt hurt really, but there is some feeling in them which is not normal.  </li>
            <li> The other was evidently allergic and had a sore mouth for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m not the type to send the product back to Crest and get my money back, because I&#x27;m just too busy and in my little bit of free time I&#x27;d rather do something else.</li>
            <li> I suggest using the vivid white instead.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a major change with these</li>
            <li> Plus, for the amount of pain you suffer, there is barely any whitening!  </li>
            <li> Okay so i got this product, left it on my teeth for two hours as directed, and i felt a little tinglying but not very much.</li>
            <li> So, while my teeth do seem a little bit whiter, I would not consider it to be an amount worth the shooting pains afterwards, which have now lasted over sixteen hours.  </li>
            <li> The product directions indicate that only one 2 hour treatment per day, because it is highly concentrated and may cause issues if used too aggressively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $39 for the kit, which includes 4 pairs (1 upper &amp; 1 lower) of strips in the box.</li>

            <li> The back of my throat hurt the rest of the day since I probably swallowed a small amount of the gel solution during that huge chunk of time.</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter which is nice, but the strips make my teeth feeling horrrribly painful sensitive for the whole day.</li>
            <li> but wow after 2 hours the yellow is barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Barely even one shade difference,</li>
            <li> have absolutely no teeth sensitivity, but after this product my teeth have really hurt and stung.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this kit to anyone, but especially not to those with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> For a daily coffee/tea drinker like me, that is asking a lot for a Whitestrip to maintain its whitening power after 3 months of frequently drinking coffee/tea.  </li>
            <li> They are nearly invisible, hold well and actually do the job</li>
            <li> and I could barely brush my tenth 8 hours after I took them off.</li>
            <li> i can only hope and pray that by the time i wake up tomorrow, they will be gone, because it is nearly unbearable.</li>
            <li> Crest apparently changed the product to 1 Hour Express because reviews and complaints of pain for this product was</li>
            <li> After trying the regular white stips and the gentle white strips, I wanted a quicker working item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The strips come in different strengths to allow people with sensitive teeth to use them.  </li>
            <li> If you drink coffee and/or tea, you may need multiple applications to get some momentum, and I might recommend the normal 3D Professional kit, which takes weeks of shorter treatments rather than one long one.  </li>
            <li> Back in the old days I purchased teeth trays and whitener from my dentist to the tune of $500.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;ve tried the Crest 3D strips and they are a definite improvement over the old strips.  </li>
            <li> I used this product twice and barely noticed a difference in the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the whitening I did obtain, did not last anywhere near three months, and faded after about three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Additionally, the whitening I did obtain, did not last anywhere near three months, and faded after about three weeks.    </li>
            <li> But barely noticable :</li>
            <li> /&gt;***Basically, if you use these, it&#x27;s like using the old school Crest Whitestrips (lowest level) and getting those same results in 2 hours instead of 14 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth have now become quite sensitive to air, water and all such.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive teeth and a low pain tolarance, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this.</li>
            <li> a 30 year old male.</li>
            <li> I read the directions and after careful reading of warnings (which were really none), I put this on for 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> Towards the last hour, I felt like my tongue was beaten \\&quot;eaten\\&quot; up alive, but I still kept it on.  </li>
            <li> I feel like knives are being continuously jabbed into each individual tooth that the strip touched - this has been going on for 3 hours so far.</li>
            <li> My teeth were barely whiter, and the pain brought me to tears.</li>
            <li> My teeth are old and now they are getting white.  </li>
            <li> my teeth barely got any whiter.</li>
            <li> I used toothpaste for sensitive teeth around the time that I used these, and I think it helped, as they were mostly back to normal the next day, and a couple of days later, they didn&#x27;t have any sensitivity at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Final word years later: I think there should be a class action against crest for these strips</li>
            <li> For the next hour my teeth felt normal, but by the second hour.. OMG! OUUUCHHH!</li>
            <li> They whitened my teeth 2 shades which I was kind of skeptical about.</li>
            <li> My teeth didn&#x27;t exactly hurt, but they were extremely sensitive for a few hours after I used them, to the extent that I didn&#x27;t want to eat or drink anything.</li>
            <li> My teeth look slightly lighter but this pain is very intense and almost intolerable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;These do work well, but find a less intense version if your teeth are somewhat sensitive to begin with.</li>
            <li> I am literally crying right now about the regret I feel over using this product.</li>
            <li> but after the first half hour I got used to them.</li>
            <li> The instructions say not to use these strips on loose teeth because the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; truly feels like duct tape firmly stuck to your teeth.</li>
            <li> I discovered I could not go through the entire process because I&#x27;d have sensitivity pain that only stopped when I took warm water and help it in my mouth for a few seconds and then repeated for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Two hours is a long time to wear them, but after a few minutes I normally forget that they&#x27;re there and there is a noticable difference - my co-workers even commented on my smile the next day.</li>
            <li> They really stick and aren&#x27;t all goopy like the other</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already put in the time to whiten my teeth with the other 14-30 day treatments and 2 hours is really all I&#x27;m looking to do to freshen up my teeth.</li>
            <li> Much like the other 100</li>
            <li> When removing, start from the backs of your teeth, on one side, and gently pull across to the other side.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never done teeth whitening before and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but after years of smoking, I didn&#x27;t think it would be dramatic and it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Then in recent years I have occasionally been using the old skool Crest Whitestrips.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thankfully, this is the third day and the pain finally has stopped even though my teeth are somewhat sensitive still.</li>
            <li> I tried the 3D 1-Hour Express and was pleasantly surprised after only 1 hour of wearing them, my teeth were several shades lighter.  </li>
            <li> Did not get as much whitening as I expected, but could definitely tell a difference.</li>
            <li> I consume hot and cold but brush my teeth with warm water so that says that they&#x27;re a little sensitive</li>
            <li> i found myself drooling a little and talking funny with the soreness for those hours afterwards.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll certainly buy other Crest white strips.  </li>
            <li> Keeping them in for two hours turned out to be a lot less comfortable that the 30 minutes needed for the 14-day version - my teeth started to ache a bit (and I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth), plus it is hard to completely relax your mouth while you are aware of these strips, so my jaw was a little achy towards the end.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Applying the strips was an easy process, and although awkward at first, the strips aren&#x27;t intrusive.</li>
            <li> I have white teeth naturally in general</li>
            <li> 6 hours later, my teeth hurt just as much, despite pain killers and every other home remedy I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> However, don&#x27;t expect to see IMMEDIATE results--it will take several days for the whiteness to become apparent.  </li>
            <li> My teeth are normally not sensitive, but about four hours after using this product, my front teeth were in considerable discomfort.</li>
            <li> I bought these strips after reading a few good reviews on amazon despite seeing several poor reviews on independant websites.</li>
            <li> After taking the strips off, I noticed a number of white &#x27;splotches&#x27; on my teeth, other than these splotches the teeth looked largely the same.</li>
            <li> It began as a dull ache, but graduated quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used crest whitening strips before and never have had much to complain about besides slight sensitivity.</li>
            <li> before we put it on, I was afraid I won&#x27;t be able to leave it on for 2 hours, without feeling like I can&#x27;t behave normally with it in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , this sucks, I put these on expecting some \\&quot;mild tooth sensitivity\\</li>
            <li> (&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do continue to have some minor sensitivity which is expected, and had 1 quick sharp pain in my tooth while using the strips</li>
            <li> While there might have been a slight initial whiteness, they just did not do much of a job of whitening my teeth.  </li>
            <li> My teeth hurt for about a day and a half after using these - they aren&#x27;t typically sensitive (I can bite ice cream with no discomfort), so I was surprised.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness is doesn&#x27;t really show unless I smile a REALLY BIG SMILE :[]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not see a color difference, it may have been subtle, but I did not use them for the full two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have any bad taste in my mouth, which is good since I&#x27;d be stuck with it for 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> It says that you could have mild sensitivity in the box, but this was unbearable pain for 24 hours and not worth the results which were little to non from a whitening standpoint.</li>
            <li> It differentiates itself from their other products, by promising noticeable whiter teeth in just two hours, with results expected to last up to three months.  </li>
            <li> The gel is thick and sticky, and the strips stay on your teeth really well, without as much foamy peroxide goo leakage as the other strips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe it was probably due to the longer application time, since I&#x27;ve used [[ASIN:B000XS3FYM Crest Whitestrips Supreme Professional Strength 84 strips]]</li>
            <li> I believe it was probably due to the longer application time, since I&#x27;ve used [[ASIN:B000XS3FYM Crest Whitestrips Supreme Professional Strength 84 strips]]</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and have even had my gums bleed from other whitening strips/trays but these strips did NOT cause me any pain or discomfort whatsoever.</li>
            <li> - could I possibly get the same results in only one long application?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used crest white strips in the past with little problems and was excited to try crest 2 hour white strips.</li>
            <li> Brush your teeth 1 hour before actual putting them on, Then after your done using then avoid brushing your teeth for as long as possible.</li>
            <li> A few hours after using these strips, my 20-year-old daughter is in excruciating pain, particularly with her bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t smoke, drink much coffee or red wine, or do other things that make my teeth overly dark, but I also do not use whitening toothpaste, so every year</li>
            <li> Apparently the vast majority of people who use this product don&#x27;t experience the intense pain that we unlucky few had to bear, but if you haven&#x27;t tried it, it&#x27;s not worth the risk.</li>
            <li> so I do not drink wine as much as I did (usually a glass every night with dinner...</li>
            <li> I will come back and edit this review to say how long this discomfort lasts.  </li>
            <li> long hours later, I had difficulty taking the strips off.  </li>
            <li> this long, so I was thankful I only had to do it</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t get the level of results you&#x27;re looking for and they won&#x27;t last long, either.</li>
            <li> This product visibly whitened my teeth for about a week, after that it seemed like the whiteness was almost &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; off of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It left my teeth a strange fleshy-brown color.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I have heard that yellow teeth are easier to whiten, as opposed to those with a grey tinge...</li>
            <li> I brushed for a long while with Sensodyne.</li>
            <li> keeps your teeth very white for long time</li>
            <li> It did not get my teeth as white as a few applications the vivid product.  </li>
            <li> ON 11-17-11:  My dentist told me that this is a common occurrence with certain strips, that there&#x27;s an ingredient missing from this particular strip that causes this.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t much of a difference immediately after removing these but the this morning a few of my teeth that were annoyingly pretty yellow are at least half as yellow!!  </li>
            <li> The 2 hour white strips were applied the same as other crest white strips.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very lazy and don&#x27;t care very much to complain.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive teeth, but my teeth got progressively more painful as the night wore on.</li>
            <li> I did have sensitive teeth before, but never have I experienced anything this awful.  </li>
            <li> Wow I bought these and had them on my teeth for less then 5 minutes before I read these reviews .</li>
            <li> I have a mild cold sensitivity because of fillings, but overall, I do not have very sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li> In the past, I tried using the normal white strips only every 3-4 days, but I still had to suffer every single time I used them.</li>
            <li> I bought this even though I&#x27;ve read positive and negative comments before, decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have used various at-home teeth whitening strips and gels several times in the past and had also had my teeth whitened professionally once.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long this pain will last, but definitely not worth it since i barely see any whitening.</li>
            <li> I only left the product on for one hour, thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t be painful like it had been on the first application, and still it has caused me SO MUCH PAIN!</li>
            <li> My teeth would react to cold and warm drink when before it wouldn&#x27;t super uncomfortable it lasted for a couple of days</li>
            <li> I have used the other Crest Whitestrips in the past with very limited success</li>
            <li> Not surprisingly, this product does not completely renovate your smile in a single two hour application.</li>
            <li> It will make your teeth a little sensitive for a day or so</li>
            <li> They did still make my teeth feel a little sensitive though.  </li>
            <li> Started reading the reviews here and was horrified -- it seemed like way too many people complained about serious pain afterward</li>
            <li> I have taken 4 Advil and just finished my 4th glass of wine in desperation to dull the intense pain.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing was that my teeth hurt, but because i left them on for more then an hour.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d keep buying these boxes desperately wanting to whiten my teeth, but it was torturous and I never used more than maybe 8 or so</li>
            <li> but it was more of a numb pain with the aleve</li>
            <li> The first time it made my tongue numb and after one hour my gums were hurting too much to keep them on for another hour.  </li>
            <li> and I really had to look myself to see if I noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;The strips were awkward at first</li>
            <li> I really had faith in this product..or wanted to at the least.</li>
            <li> But with barely a difference, it&#x27;s not worth the time, pain or money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest Whitestrips in the past and they have always made my teeth sensitive, these 3D Whitestrips are no different.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll just be careful not to wear white.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2 hours was a long time to keep them in, and that 2 hours included discomfort</li>
            <li> I have minor sensitivity and</li>
            <li> , it had a strange taste</li>
            <li> Cause strange taste&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, while it&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;m simply over emphasizing the feeling of accomplishment for strips which require a few days use, I&#x27;m going back to those rather than keep using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> package arrived earlier than I expected which was a plus.</li>
            <li> I am not a smoker and only had minimal staining</li>
            <li> closed because everytime i&#x27;d open my mouth</li>
            <li> I spent a night in totally agony after using the 2 hour 3D Whitestrips.</li>
            <li> used this product... literally took the enamel off my teeth could not eat or drink anything my teeth hurt for days and kept me up all night long.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I used a sensitive toothpast for about a week before and a few days after.  </li>
            <li> Even though I carefully pressed the strips into the spaces between teeth and against the gumline, the lightening effect was concentrated on the middle of the tooth.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find any review comments on how long this pain lasts for others, but I know that I am not alone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s physical pain, but there&#x27;s also mental pain associated here.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find any review comments on how long this pain lasts for others, but I know that I am not alone.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s physical pain, but there&#x27;s also mental pain associated here.</li>
            <li> I used them for 3 days with minor discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I bought these a few days ago and have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> So lad I only spent $15 on it.</li>
            <li> My teeth are very slightly sensitive since I had my braces off 10 years ago, but I&#x27;ve whitened a few times over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried other crest whitening strips before, mainly the ones that required using them everyday.</li>
            <li> When I used this, I got a very sharp pain deep in several of my teeth.</li>
            <li> It was a little uncomfortable for the first few days, but not unbearable by far, and by day 4 they were completely back to normal.</li>
            <li> A product that has this many bad reviews has no business on the market, and an attorney would do well to file a class action lawsuit on behalf of all of the people who suffered excruciating pain due to this malicious product.</li>
            <li> After reading about half of these reviews I&#x27;m going back to using the regular, if somewhat tedious, original strips.  </li>
            <li> The treatment lasts two hours, which is much longer than the usual 30 minutes their other treatments take.  </li>
            <li> I will be using another strip tomorrow or the following day and expect dramatic results that piggybacked off the first treatment.</li>
            <li> I will be using another strip tomorrow or the following day and expect dramatic results that piggybacked off the first treatment.</li>
            <li> But other than not drinking/eating and minimizing my talking, I could go about my daily routines while wearing them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some of their other White Strips a while ago, but I&#x27;ve decided to give this a try since it supposedly show results in two hours.</li>
            <li> I used sensodyne toothpaste with using those daily routine crest strips but that only helped a little and eventually stopped using them anyway because i couldn&#x27;t handle</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see the result after using the other strips in the next months.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was excited when I say Crest came out with a 2 hour kit.</li>
            <li> I have used other Crest whitestrips before and only had some sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> i have used teeth whitening gels, 30 minute strips and was never sensitive!</li>
            <li> In other words, don&#x27;t expect miracles or gleaming white chompers.</li>
            <li> During that duration of time, I felt several sharp, shooting pains throughout my teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried white strips before and never had the issue of extreme tooth sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> But unlike some other whiteners I have used, this product definitely affected the enamel on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have used numerous whitening products over the years including other crest products.  </li>
            <li> I sent them a very long email to which I received no response.</li>
            <li> , I experienced a stabbing sensation going through my bottom teeth approximately four hours after using them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t dry your teeth though</li>
            <li> pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Edited on 5-4-11:&lt;br /&gt;I must amend this review to say that I&#x27;ve used a few more of the 2-hour strips and something weird is going on.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t frequent, and it was more annoying than anything.</li>
            <li> My teeth were a little sensitive afterwards, where I have compromised enamel due to grinding at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But because I doubt that a single every-3-month application will endure 3 months of drinking coffee and tea, I would almost prefer that Crest come out with a \\&quot;Crest</li>
            <li> But because I doubt that a single every-3-month application will endure 3 months of drinking coffee and tea, I would almost prefer that Crest come out with a \\&quot;Crest</li>
            <li> They did appear whiter, but only very slightly, and not enough to justify the product&#x27;s use.  </li>
            <li> Well, they are about a centimeter and a half long, so I had to use a total of eight.</li>
            <li> Any results are not worth the pain of barely being able to talk because my teeth hurt so bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other whitening products like 5 minute whitening, and more recently Rembrandt 2 hour whitening (which I could not complete because it burned my gums so badly).</li>
            <li> they withstand anything, and my pain threshold is above average.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the extra price you pay for \\&quot;2 hour whitening.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Usually, my teeth get sensitive after this</li>
            <li> My teeth are an average white.</li>
            <li> the results had been spectacular, I wouldn&#x27;t be as disappointed with the pain.</li>
            <li> For the kind of money you spend on this product I was seriously disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I tired the first time and did not notice a difference, so</li>
            <li> I do not normally have issues with sensitivity other than a minimal amount from using classic whitestrips in the past as I mentioned before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use if you have any loose teeth, fillings, or crowns in the front.  </li>
            <li> But the thing is, if you have really sensitive teeth and gums, EVERY whitening product causes serious pain for several days after use.</li>
            <li> I do have one tooth which is slightly less white because it is a bit recessed from the rest.  </li>
            <li> But I noticed only a slight difference.</li>
            <li> In future I will use the slower methods with less pain.</li>
            <li> It was slightly horrifying.&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-four hours after using this kit, my teeth are actually sore.</li>
            <li> Yes, I only kept it on for half the time, but I still feel like I should have seen SOME change.</li>
            <li> I read one review that said to use the strips for only an hour and a half.</li>
            <li> only do my teeth look odd now, but</li>
            <li> If this is what they call slight, then they are grossly misrepresenting their product.</li>
            <li> would like to mention that after all of this, I notice only a slight difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth are only slightly discolored from coffee and wine but they seem yellower to me than they used to be</li>
            <li> The results were slight whitening of teeth probably about two shades only.  </li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to cold and hot beverages....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is due to hypersensitive teeth, which I have never had a problem with before, or some other reaction, but the morning after I used the whitestrips until about 24 hours later I had excruciating pain in my gums.</li>
            <li> Does cause tooth sensitivity, only for about half a day.</li>
            <li> As for the whitening, I only noticed a slight difference.</li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t typically use that stuff, because my teeth are fairly white.</li>
            <li> I have used other Crest whitening strips in the past and they always work; however, results may be slow to appear and diminish quickly.</li>
            <li> If you are familiar with other strips its not any less uncomfortable, just keep busy if you are impatient like me.</li>
            <li> Bottom teeth strips were very very dry and did not adhere to my teeth..</li>
            <li> It scared the crap out of my baby, and I quickly put her in her bouncy seat as the pains were so intense that I ran into the bathroom and ripped the strips off my teeth</li>
            <li> Now for the secondary effects: for the next 4 hours or so, my gums were very sensitive and hurt a little.</li>
            <li> His lightened about 3 shades but took 2 sessions to do it, and it seems like his only lasted a little over 2 months</li>
            <li> It does make your teeth a little bit sensitive for a few days after each use.</li>
            <li> The strip is way too sticky and hard that it doesnt even soften or wettens enough for the peroxide to actually penetrate your teeth even after 2 hours in mouth.  </li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t make your teeth any whiter, just more painful.</li>
            <li> , i mean it was a little whiter but not by that much.</li>
            <li> Now, one set of the one hour express strips only whitens a few shades.</li>
            <li> The last time, a few weeks ago, my gums felt irritated afterwards.  </li>
            <li> answer is no, not really.  </li>
            <li> On my teeth, the lower strip sometimes does not stick as well as the upper strip, which always sticks as firmly as duct</li>
            <li> Once I used my fingers to firmly press the strip onto my upper and lower teeth, the strips never moved around the way</li>
            <li> But, a few hours later I started having pain in my teeth</li>
            <li> My friend said she used Sensodyne a few days before using these strips and the days following</li>
            <li> Some teeth sensitivity is to be expected, I use Sensodyne toothpaste to combat this.  </li>
            <li> In the middle of nursing my 6 week old daughter, I had a stabbing pain in my teeth that nearly made me knock her onto the floor.  </li>
            <li> This is a total waste of 1.</li>
            <li> I applied the 2-hour express whitestrips a few hours ago, and during the actual whitening process, I felt no discomfort, which led me to believe that I would have no sensitivity to the product.</li>
            <li> I am 46 with heavy tea stains on my teeth and after using the whitening strips my teeth are very white again.  </li>
            <li> But, it did whiten as expected.  </li>
            <li> Only use every few months?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible if I had finished the box I would have, but...too much trouble.</li>
            <li> But aside from the pain, I got blotchy, minimal whitening</li>
            <li> Minimal peroxide leakage into mouth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As expected.</li>
            <li> Come as expected.</li>
            <li> I used another strip four days later, and another a few days after that.  </li>
            <li> I did follow the instructions carefully, and they dont seem to mention anything about that.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> Did actually have some trouble taking strips off.</li>
            <li> I bought these strips only a few days ago,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I have whitened my teeth using strips and paint on whiteners with no pain and minimal results.</li>
            <li> Does leave white streaks on teeth though they go away in a few hours.</li>
            <li> but i had absolutely no problems or pain.</li>
            <li> I noticed a little sensitivity for the 3 days following, but much less than the daily treatments which I often quit half way through.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thankful I only kept them on half the time!</li>
            <li> I only came on here to write this review to hopefully help a few other people out, and keep them from purchasing this product, wasting their money and putting themselves through a whole lot of unnecessary pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Crest white strips products and I&#x27;ve had my teeth whitened professionally, and I&#x27;ve never experienced this level of discomfort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About an hour and a half after I took the strips off (minor improvement of whiteness)</li>
            <li> Made my teeth slightly whiter but 2 hours seems like a long time to wear them.</li>
            <li> few minutes later I started feeling sharp pains in my teeth.</li>
            <li> It was not a sharp pain but a dull one.  </li>
            <li> The strips are a little strange feeling, but they did not effect my speech.</li>
            <li> It is hard to focus on anything EXCEPT for your teeth, which ache for any apparent reason.</li>
            <li> I used them again a few days later, this time I had less pain</li>
            <li> I am going to go ahead and used the other 3 sets of whitening strips this week</li>
            <li> Other than that, do not recommend.</li>
            <li> no Oragel or other numbing products are going to do anything.</li>
            <li> The 2-hour strip did whiten my teeth somewhat but there is no magic to take you from zero-to-bright white.  </li>
            <li> but other</li>
            <li> I purchased them at a discounted price and when they arrived, there were three extra sets of strips and a small bottle of whitening rinse in the box.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews where people say it works after all 4 treatments in the box.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitivity, space out the application by using every other day and shorter amount of time.</li>
            <li> The other Crest Whitestrips did not cause this problem when I used them.</li>
            <li> stretched a few days apart</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be giving the other 3 doses in the box away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the company means by \\&quot;noticable whitening\\&quot;, but there is no obvious whiteing of the teeth after using one strip for two hours.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The most tragic part, they didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> The most tragic part, they didn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any of the sensitivity as some other users have.  </li>
            <li> After using the express strips I will no longer use any of the other Crest strips, although, they work well too.  </li>
            <li> Do not buy these, they are not worth the price tag and the side effects (that crest will tell you is minimal).</li>
            <li> Just hoping this pain goes away within the 12 hours that the other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> In the past I have used the 3D white 10 days instead of the 2 day express.</li>
            <li> My Bottom Tooth Had A REALLY Sharp Pain,...</li>
            <li> They are also extremely adhesive, and I felt like I was going to be losing some teeth with the strips upon removal.  </li>
            <li> I took them off because they made my spit thick and in general I don&#x27;t like the feeling of wearing the strips.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The other strips, even ones by Crest, don&#x27;t hurt like this.</li>
            <li> I suppose I could see a little bit of whitening, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the expensive price.  </li>
            <li> I used them once and had very minimal</li>
            <li> My teeth were a bit senstive after the first application, the day after the second strip my teeth felt like they were covered in chalk, it was extremely unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> Yeah my teeth had mild sensitivity but not too crazy</li>
            <li> Yes, I have read an article where a woman developed a long lasting condition where she couldn&#x27;t eat cold foods because she over-applied and did not wait the recommended amount of time between applying...</li>
            <li> Seems like other people are having the same issue lately?</li>
            <li> As far as cost, I bought mine in the drug store and paid $50 so definitely buy them on Amazon where they are less expensive.</li>
            <li> only complaint this time is that when I received the box from the vendor, through amazon.com, the strips are due to expire in October of this year.  </li>
            <li> I have used other crest whitening products and had slight sensitivity.</li>
            <li> Prior to that iteration, the bottom strip was a little too small, but they have remedied that.  </li>
            <li> I did use this method, but realized I didnt press hard enough around my gum line.</li>
            <li> For people that have dull or yellow teeth, it will do the trick.</li>
            <li> If you have ridiculous sensitivity issues, this is a much less painful, drawn-out way to get nice pearly whites.</li>
            <li> So .. I guess it&#x27;s not worth paying $30-50 for it.</li>
            <li> not worth it.</li>
            <li> I am a smoker and daily coffee/tea drinker and my teeth were stained to say the least.</li>
            <li> It so was not worth it for me.</li>
            <li> bottom line - not worth the time or money.</li>
            <li> money 3. and definitely not worth the pain.  </li>
            <li> After using the product, and seeing the results, I would have to say that the discomfort is not really worth the marginal whitening job performed.</li>
            <li> Not worth it, at all.</li>
            <li> its not worth the money and the pain</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with average teeth.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that there&#x27;s gummy residue remaining on your teeth after removing the strips.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely NOT worth the $50.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> The last time I used any Crest Whitestrips, it was pretty painful.  </li>
            <li> so it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> AVOID this product at all costs -- it&#x27;s not worth the suffering you might experience.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth pain.</li>
            <li> The strips were a bit difficult to get off, they REALLY stuck to my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using that for the past few years and my teeth are so white</li>
            <li> Not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> I did notice a result but its so not worth it.</li>
            <li> Yes they make your teeth whiter but not worth this pain.</li>
            <li> I think it could be even worse for those with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> My advice: make sure to take a pain reliever during and after, and you dont have to follow that 3-month crap you can use them as often as you like</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive teeth, but - was lulled into a false sense of security by the lack of pain after using the 30-min 14-day strips (no pain with those).&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I sure would hate to be in excruciating pain for 2 days ...</li>
            <li> Yes, it is still awkward putting them on and they shift slightly while they&#x27;re in, but the results were worth it.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is slight tooth ache 24 hours after treatment, but beauty is pain,</li>
            <li> Sharpe shooting pains down teeth to jaw while using.</li>
            <li> After sitting down and reading for about thirty minutes</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s $30-something down the drain.</li>
            <li> I mean I already have white teeth</li>
            <li> I am a smoker and an extreme coffee drinker, but you would never know it!</li>
            <li> A little bit before the 2 hours was up, I thought I&#x27;d see what other people thought of them.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B005TI7EWK Crest 3D White Intensive Professional Effects, 7 Count]]  Decided to try out the Intensive Professional Effects 3d White Strips, and without a doubt, it was the worst mistake I have ever made.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I am convinced that a conspiracy was behind their approval in the first place.o is sit here and wish that I could morph time.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I am convinced that a conspiracy was behind their approval in the first place.</li>
            <li> I began to feel the slight tingle of a forthcoming torturous journey.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Slightly whiter after use.</li>
            <li> The strips clung to my teeth for dear life, and once I was actually able to pull them off, they left these horrible strings and globs all over my mouth.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t for the sore and slight pain</li>
            <li> I took them off about half an hour ago.</li>
            <li> but I could see that using them for less time and sooner than 3 months</li>
            <li> that &#x27;slight&#x27; pain?</li>
            <li> and they said that I might experience a slight discomfort and to take advil or motrin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the Amazon price is lessv than half the cost of the drugstore ones</li>
            <li> I took the strips off and my teeth looked slightly whiter, highlight the \\&quot;slightly\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> There was a slight ache afterward</li>
            <li> like I previously mentioned I had used crest products before.</li>
            <li> (Never had I previously had a problem with using them in regard to sensitivity, spotting, etc.)</li>
            <li> The pains would come and go, and the box said there could be slight discomfort.</li>
            <li> I stuck in the strips, waited two hours, and saw a slight difference.  </li>
            <li> my teeth appeared slightly whiter, nothing that anyone noticed</li>
            <li> There was a slight lightening of my tooth</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;slight temporary pain or sensitivity\\</li>
            <li> /&gt;a week and a half before trying the strips if that makes&lt;br</li>
            <li> this trial goes as well as the previous ones, then&lt;br</li>
            <li> this trial goes as well as the previous ones, then&lt;br</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s on however, I did feel slight discomfort.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the next day I had red wine with dinner</li>
            <li> Slightly.</li>
            <li> So take them off within an hour or less.</li>
            <li> After thirty minutes I would feel a slight pain in my lower teeth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to say whether these are better or worse than the once-a-day variety, because it&#x27;s tough to judge whitening.  </li>
            <li> They never worked for me because one, i was very horrible at keeping up because of my busy schedule, those 30 mins everyday were precious and usually that meant skipping a lot of days which in turn, the strips never worked for me.</li>
            <li> I recommend you wipe your mouth a bit first, because if you&#x27;re at all spitty the strips will squish around awkwardly as you try to position it.</li>
            <li> Unhappy with the first treatment</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used whitening strips in a few years because the strips I used previously didn&#x27;t work that well.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why others left negative reviews, I am a smoker, and after two treatments (twice in 3days)</li>
            <li> They stick onto your teeth tight unlike other strips I have used in the past that are slippery.</li>
            <li> These little joyous &#x27;whitening strips&#x27; are what nightmares are made of.</li>
            <li> With other whitening products, my calcium stains usually don&#x27;t get whiter, but I suppose that means these strips are doing their job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took one aleve which helped a little</li>
            <li> It looked like they did get a little bit whiter though.</li>
            <li> These little strips do not do the job.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a little sensitivity on my bottom teeth about an hour into the process.  </li>
            <li> Just do a little prep work.  </li>
            <li> I put them on and watched TV for the 2 hours, with little discomfort or pain.</li>
            <li> ITS NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> not sure if I&#x27;ll use the remaining strips due to the pain.</li>
            <li> Not even a little bit.</li>
            <li> and I took pain medication with little relief.  </li>
            <li> Oh, and my teeth seem to be a little whiter but not worth the pain!</li>
            <li> little bit of sensitivity but nothing you cannot cope with&lt;br /&gt;reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;quick delivery</li>
            <li> Additionally, there was little to no improvement in whiteness.</li>
            <li> Brush your teeth with it for 5-10 minutes after whitening, then rub a little into teeth.</li>
            <li> Just a little tingling and&lt;br /&gt;sensitivity</li>
            <li> I can see my teeth became a little bit whiter after use it, however my teeth are so sore after use since this pain never happened before.</li>
            <li> I wish it came with a chart like some other products I tried in the past.</li>
            <li> I wish it came with a chart like some other products I tried in the past.</li>
            <li> It felt as if little itty bitty people were using drills in my mouth, specifically targeting JUST my nerve endings.</li>
            <li> I spent at least $30 on products to fix the pain from this mess.</li>
            <li> The strips didn&#x27;t stick well and were a little messy.</li>
            <li> My pain began immediately after removing the strips with a dull ache that turned into a throbbing pain, and then morphed slowly into the level of torture that I am currently experiencing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a complete worthless product and I am very disappointement that I just fell for this scam and wasted my hard earned</li>
            <li> wow my teeth hurt really bad after only two uses for an hour each time.  </li>
            <li> 3 hours later in the middle of the night I woke up to feel stabbing pain in my teeth where the strips had been.</li>
            <li> I did and removed it and saw results a few shades lower.</li>
            <li> A few hours afterward, my teeth were shooting pain, even when I wasn&#x27;t drinking or eating anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> The pain lasted quite a few hours and even though I took 2 Aleeve</li>
            <li> However I took a few advil, and the pain went away immediately.</li>
            <li> I am always forgetting about them, so the box ends up taking me a few months to finish.</li>
            <li> In that respect, the results were actually quite poor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a non smoker, but I do drink coffee a few times a week</li>
            <li> which the directions do mention that they will go away within a few hours</li>
            <li> waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I also noticed some burns, I guess, to my gums with sensitivity for a few days.  </li>
            <li> The fact that pain develops a few hours after treatment should be disclosed.  </li>
            <li> As I only used them 5 hours ago, I am hoping that the pain does not get any worse.</li>
            <li> so well you have trouble taking them</li>
            <li> waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> I had to pick / wipe it off for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There was a Peroxide taste after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Having little/no results and having to wait a few months for another application just seems like a waste to me.</li>
            <li> I decided to wait a few days and try it again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the two hour version.</li>
            <li> and it was messy to apply.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was going to send the strips back because of the poor reviews.  </li>
            <li> Waste of time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the four treatments, my teeth were a few shades whiter.  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any pain from five minute, the taste isn&#x27;t harsh and</li>
            <li> I had trouble getting them off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel I can grade the product because I only used it twice, and both times it was just annoying to have the strips in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Painkillers did not help and the pain got worse over the next few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I worked past it and it died down a bit, so I finished the 2 hours.  </li>
            <li> As if I don&#x27;t get little enough sleep with a 6 week old baby, now I might be spending what little time I would be sleeping suffering in pain :(  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I have to say that my teeth are indeed whiter, and I found the process much less bothersome than strips I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Awsome product and a LOT less pricey!</li>
            <li> While I was unable to sleep from the endless pain, I got on the internet and found that TONS of people have had this same excruciating experience.</li>
            <li> The strips are made of a thicker plastic than other strips I&#x27;ve used by Crest, and were hard to mold to my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitivity issues (I can only use Sensodyne toothpaste), so I was really wary after reading the other reviews re:</li>
            <li> I never smiled in pictures due to it.</li>
            <li> Just plain do not get these.</li>
            <li> When I peel it off after 2 hours its like its glued onto my teeth, and not easy to peel off.  </li>
            <li> First, I never write reviews but these were so bad I had to warn others.</li>
            <li> The actual whitening process wasn&#x27;t bad at all, kind of annoying on my gums.</li>
            <li> The strip adheres pretty well to the teeth, and it doesn&#x27;t show any sign of coming off, and in fact, it adheres TOO well that when removing it from the teeth is painful</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have used a few whitening strip products in the past but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s costly, but at least it&#x27;s not money down the drain.</li>
            <li> If it would at least whiten my teeth then that would be one thing, but it doesn&#x27;t whiten and extreme pain!</li>
            <li> Pain, pain, pain and still in bad pain 12 hours later even with several pain killers.</li>
            <li> Before I comment on the whitening, a lot of the bad reviews on here claim that they left the strip o for 2 hours, but only 1 hour is recommended.</li>
            <li> These strips whiten LITTLE TO NONE!</li>
            <li> and while I don&#x27;t expect crazy white teeth, I can already tell the results of this experiment will be much better than my previous (very painful) experiences.</li>
            <li> but I have used the regular 30-minute Whitestrips in the past with minimal discomfort), but my teeth ached like crazy afterwards despite popping ibuprofen throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> On a scale of of &amp;#34;nah, I&#x27;m good&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;I might be driven mad by pain&amp;#34; I am at the &amp;#34;I have been driven mad, someone PLEASE find me the pliers RIGHT NOW&amp;#34; level.&lt;br /&gt;--I took a Vicodin that I had left over from a surgery.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews because quite frankly its a waste of time, but I thought I&#x27;d go ahead &amp; give this 5 stars.</li>
            <li> imagine my teeth turning into sponges, brittle and open and useless, just screaming for attention.</li>
            <li> Today I used them and within a few hours of taking them off, my mouth hurts!  </li>
            <li> Obviously not everyone has this reaction, but be wary.  </li>
            <li> I am not satisfied and want my money back.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product is relatively simple to use, merely peel the backing off the enclosed strips and place on your unbrushed teeth</li>
            <li> These were no better than the usual strips.</li>
            <li> I could tell that they&#x27;re whiter from the back of my teeth ( they&#x27;re not as white as my front teeth :[])</li>
            <li> I usually use the Crest 3D Whitestrips that stay on your teeth for 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I usually use them a day after having my teeth cleaned so there is no plaque to get in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> use Sensodyne or the Crest Sensitivity tooth paste a few days or a week before using these strips!  </li>
            <li> I usually rinse with lukewarm water.</li>
            <li> I was also skeptical that I would get the same results as the  2 week and 4 week kits.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am not sure if these strips made my teeth any whiter or not.  </li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and wondered why I stopped.</li>
            <li> I would definitely NOT recommend this product unless you&#x27;re game for a day of pain!</li>
            <li> Not touching these again...</li>
            <li> It was unbelievable pain, like the dentist was zinging your nerves over and over and over....</li>
            <li> Not sure.</li>
            <li> Not sure why they tell you this,</li>
            <li> I bought this package because I could not find my usual whitening product and figured I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not really sure why I wanted to try this product, but I did.  </li>
            <li> After the 2 hour was up, I anxiously removed the strip to see if it would reveal a brighter, whiter teeh.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have never been so yellow in my life and makes me so sad.</li>
            <li> I do not have any cracks on the enamel nor have I had any cavities in the past...</li>
            <li> Not sure why I didn&#x27;t have a reaction this time</li>
            <li> The only parts that looked whiter were the white parts already on my teeth. :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;See if your dentist offer a service for a small one-time fee with refills each time you go in for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> Two hours after removal the pain began; stabbing and deep aching even down to my jawbone.</li>
            <li> Stay with Crest&#x27;s other white strips products, and don&#x27;t waste your money on this bad idea.</li>
            <li> i get very impatient with whiteners.</li>
            <li> I finally use one pack yesterday, this morning woke up with the worse sensitivity on my teeth, and to make matters worse</li>
            <li> I was in so much pain that my heart was racing like crazy!</li>
            <li> This was way worse than slight discomfort.</li>
            <li> had pain like this several years ago with some crest strips but as hoping the advances would make the treatment less painful.</li>
            <li> I began to get pain about an hour with the strips on, a sudden shocking zinger in one tooth, WOW!  </li>
            <li> i dont even think painkillers will help dull them.</li>
            <li> Hard hard time staying on for two hours, didn&#x27;t stay in place to well.  </li>
            <li> They are visible and it is hard to talk, so read a book or magazines for an hour.</li>
            <li> Cold drinks hurt, sucking in air hurts, and it&#x27;s just a constant dull pain - and it&#x27;s been about 10 hours since I removed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But then, my stupid self, i didn&#x27;t really follow direction</li>
            <li> They lasted at least until the time I went to bed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d do this on a day off, because if I were at work this would drive me nuts (and my patients would probably think I was crazy, from my occasional twitchy mouth).</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve been drinking a lot of coffee lately, so</li>
            <li> I will say that I did not notice a big difference, which was disappointing.  </li>
            <li> and it was too late for me to not do the treatment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you gonna be on you tippy toes at least 2 days afterwords.</li>
            <li> but I hoping at least 1 shade after a almost finishing the box.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t eat or drink anything for at least 12 hours, and I continued to feel stabs of pain throughout the rest of the week.</li>
            <li> They are on fire, and pitchforks are stabbing me constantly.</li>
            <li> read the negative reviews and thought, nah, that won&#x27;t happen to me.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked if they end up banned, or if a class action lawsuit is formed (keep me in the loop if anyone hears about that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked if they end up banned, or if a class action lawsuit is formed (keep me in the loop if anyone hears about that).  </li>
            <li> after reading all the negative reviews and&lt;br /&gt;trying</li>
            <li> /&gt;to think that all the negative reviews online was just&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I read all the horror stories about excruciating tooth pain and was afraid to go to sleep lest the same thing should happen to me.</li>
            <li> - it hurts, but it goes away fast, and it&#x27;s just an annoying</li>
            <li> I was forced to in order to submit the review.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean to imply that these strips won&#x27;t cause sensitivity and pain.</li>
            <li> It continued until about 7 a.m. this morning, needless to say I did not get even an hour of sleep due to the pain.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> And i mean serious pain.</li>
            <li> The white spots look horrible....and they actually highlight the yellow-ish tone of my teeth and make it look MUCH MUCH worse!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a constant dull pain with extremely painful bolts of pain when I eat or drink.</li>
            <li> Absolutely ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I was wrong: there was no improvement at all, and the only difference is that now I have streaks on my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it did not even make a big difference, and even if it did, it would not justify the pain that I&#x27;ve been in for the past 15 hours :(</li>
            <li> After about an hour and a half, I started to get a couple random shooting pains in my teeth here and</li>
            <li> However, no more than an hour later, my bottom teeth started hurting like crazy!</li>
            <li> but this is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I thought they were a little gooey, but nothing uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I tried these last night, I thought it wasn&#x27;t too bad of a price for getting 4 applications.  </li>
            <li> However about 15 minutes later I got shooting pain in my teeth, which hurts so bad it makes you want to cry.</li>
            <li> the pain was so bad I couldn&#x27;t get back to sleep.</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Some people experience painful sensitivity when they use White Strips.</li>
            <li> When pain is so severe that it causes your brain to scream, that&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> When pain is so severe that it causes your brain to scream, that&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> I was dead wrong.</li>
            <li> I am MISERABLE right now.</li>
            <li> I was originally afraid to use the 2 hour whitening because of the tooth and gum pain reported by other users.  </li>
            <li> Kept waking up from an annoying dull pain, still in pain 12 hours later.</li>
            <li> My teeth are hardly even any whiter and my three front teeth on the bottom are KILLING me!</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive teeth, but I was afraid to drink anything cold or eat for hours.</li>
            <li> so clean\\&quot; feeling you have after using the strips discourages snacking for a while, so 2 weeks of no mid-morning munchies (or do them at night if that&#x27;s your weak time)</li>
            <li> &#x27;s your weak time)</li>
            <li> 2 days of sharp uncomfortable pain couldn&#x27;t eat, drink and barley slept!</li>
            <li> This product sucks!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dulled ever so slightly, but I&#x27;m afraid to inhale air through my mouth, sip water, or even eat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tough cookie.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tough cookie.</li>
            <li> It seals up the little pores in your teeth that cause sensitivity to heat and cold</li>
            <li> The bottom one was a little awkward to put in -</li>
            <li> The pain was so horrible that I actually teared up and cried a few times because I just did not know what else to do.  </li>
            <li> Now I know that my boyfriend secretly hates</li>
            <li> poor results ...</li>
            <li> The worst for me was how much bleachy tasting spit accumulated in my mouth, which I had to keep spitting out.</li>
            <li> (but, that could just be all in my head) - instead of making it worse, like I thought it would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shattered my knee cap and the pain was worse than that.</li>
            <li> the searing pain would get worse</li>
            <li> It has gradually gotten worse thoughout the day to the point it hurts to even drink room temperature water.  </li>
            <li> POOR FORM.</li>
            <li> POOR FORM.</li>
            <li> The pain got worse.  </li>
            <li> Sorry for the negative comment but have to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;Sue</li>
            <li> The pain is worse than the reward.</li>
            <li> i put them on and they aren&#x27;t thin</li>
            <li> It has been about 6 hours since I have taken them off and the pain continues to get worse.</li>
            <li> I use the strips, they were quite irritating my gum.</li>
            <li> Never experienced pain quite like this, Ive taken pain killers, numbing spray, everything...</li>
            <li> the pain is still here and is progressively getting worse.</li>
            <li> I get terrible migraines occasionally and one aleve usually knocks it out.</li>
            <li> The change was dramatic and immediate.</li>
            <li> I continued to use them because the results were quite dramatic.  </li>
            <li> There was a dramatic change when I compared both products...</li>
            <li> There was a dramatic change when I compared both products...</li>
            <li> There was slight sensitivity but nothing painful.  </li>
            <li> the only thing they do is make my teeth  hurt extremely bad!</li>
            <li> product did whiten my teeth well for it just being two hours, but I&#x27;m not sure that I will try it again because my teeth hurt!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does feel really weird with these on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, I have some sort of texture intolerance or something and could not stand these in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My teeth aren&#x27;t horribly stained or anything, so I figured using the Express kit would work well enough</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this could make my teeth whiter</li>
            <li> My teeth aren&#x27;t terribly stained, but I do drink coffee and wine regularly and like to brighten them up from time to time.  </li>
            <li> Besides, as a random fringe benefit, I&#x27;ve noticed that the \\&quot;oh</li>
            <li> It almost worse than having a root canal!</li>
            <li> I know there are reviews that people had a lot of pain, and i feel sorry for them.  </li>
            <li> After removing I thought it would go away, but it only got worst in the morning.</li>
            <li> Not a happy camper!!</li>
            <li> again, wrong.</li>
            <li> I was unable to eat or drink anything for almost 48 hours.</li>
            <li> nothing that I didn&#x27;t get bored of after applying for a week and seeing zero results.  </li>
            <li> Totally useless.  </li>
            <li> I had taken them off, I continued to get the random shooting pains throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I also found it difficult to keep the strips on for 2 hours - the product makes your (or mine anyway)</li>
            <li> produce A LOT of saliva and spitting is difficult with the strips on nor do I want to swallow since it tastes like the whitening elements.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t go through the painful dentist process, try these at least once, you&#x27;ll be amazed.</li>
            <li> SO SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TRY A PRODUCT THAT WORKS BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE PAIN!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have to admit, after wearing the uncomfortable, gummy strips--</li>
            <li> Too expensive for doing nothing to your teeth.</li>
            <li> They are blatantly lying about their product.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until an hour later that the horrible pain started.  </li>
            <li> Well, unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;After two hours</li>
            <li> I managed to sleep through the worst of it, and the next morning it was alright</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s currently eight-thirty and the pain is awful.</li>
            <li> I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> SO SO wrong.</li>
            <li> Then, the pain returned and the stabbing was worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now sitting here 60 hours after my last use and I am still in horrible pain.  </li>
            <li> They were basically expensive pieces of plastic.</li>
            <li> Upon seeing all the horrible tooth pain everyone went thru I immediately ripped them off and threw them away and brushed my teeth Immediately .</li>
            <li> I hate to waste 60 bucks</li>
            <li> really sad..</li>
            <li> Using these strips was the WORST mistake I have made in a very, very long</li>
            <li> Seriously you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Yank them off (this part is hard and annoying) -- takes a while to get them off gotta rip it off</li>
            <li> So bad we didnt even want to talk because the slightest bit of change would make the pain that much worse.</li>
            <li> You might think I&#x27;m insane if you&#x27;re reading the other reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> 7 hours after having removed the strips, my teeth are still throbbing with horrible, sharp pains.</li>
            <li> I was and still am having TERRIBLE sharp pains in my teeth.</li>
            <li> , i wore these for 2 hrs and my teeth did get a little bit whiter but what came afterward was horrible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying desperately to achieve a level of drunkness I&#x27;ve never seen before, just praying for a blackout to sail me away into a sea of even a &#x27;kindof&#x27; comfort.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m really unhappy with the experience.</li>
            <li> Cold water was not an option.</li>
            <li> I started having stabbing pains in my teeth.</li>
            <li> Every tooth the strips touched hurts like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Like biting into really cold icecream for 24 hours, painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that I would&lt;br /&gt;wake up in terrible pain in a few hours or</li>
            <li> disappointing.</li>
            <li> I even tried Anbesol, and all it did was make my mouth numb and drool-y, but the pain didn&#x27;t subside.</li>
            <li> Worse mistake ever !!</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> They are unpleasant to wear</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an altogether unpleasant experience using the strips.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> very expensive,</li>
            <li> A poor soul strapped into a nasty cold diseaseinfested dungeon chair mercilessly screams as a masked demon stretches these devices onto their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> My teeth hurt so badly, I contemplated going to the emergency room.</li>
            <li> was so bad it woke me up</li>
            <li> Everyone of them was bad....</li>
            <li> and it hurt sooooo bad.  </li>
            <li> it was so bad.</li>
            <li> It was so bad I literally almost passed out.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so bad.</li>
            <li> but nothing too bad.</li>
            <li> I am not exaggerating about how bad these hurt, or their lack of whitening.</li>
            <li> I am not exaggerating about how bad these hurt, or their lack of whitening.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> bad girl).</li>
            <li> bad boy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my teeth hurter so badly after 2 min of use.</li>
            <li> but it was so bad I am not going to do it again because my teeth weren&#x27;t noticeably whiter</li>
            <li> Bad idea.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t bad or persistent</li>
            <li> I never write bad reviews</li>
            <li> It hurts so bad.</li>
            <li> Biting, drinking water, even breathing through my mouth is painful.</li>
            <li> I was scared of what some people were saying throbbing and painful teeth.</li>
            <li> I will use this product again, but I would warn others to keep in mind that while it works, it can be annoyingly painful -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked by the results because I&#x27;ve used teeth whitener before</li>
            <li> Breathing was painful.</li>
            <li> These are painful.</li>
            <li> it wasnt painful or anything.</li>
            <li> and that it was going to be painful</li>
            <li> However, after removing them and cleaning the residual goo off of my teeth, I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend these if you are prone to sensitivity like me. :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the whitening, and a bit concerned--</li>
            <li> Since I purchased this for a wedding, I was highly disappointed that it was meant for 1 use every 3 - 4 months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Results: (hope this link works)&lt;br /</li>
            <li> and I still have stabbing pain in my teeth!</li>
            <li> I hope it stops soon!  :(</li>
            <li> This time I was unfortunately awake during the worst of it.</li>
            <li> After spending the money, I was extremely disappointed in the lack of results we achieved.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed with this product...</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy and hope that it will fade and the color will return.</li>
            <li> I felt really stupid buying another Crest product, but I&#x27;ll see if it works.</li>
            <li> This is horrible, stabbing, pulsating pain.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to hate this</li>
            <li> Hopefully I got that crap off and none of it got into my teeth .</li>
            <li> this crap.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to someone I hate.</li>
            <li> It was very unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> It was very unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> My teeth were not that bad to begin with and these strip did nothing but cause me to have horrible tooth aches for about 2 days after each strip.</li>
            <li> it hurts so bad!</li>
            <li> Use these strips and your teeth will hurt so bad you can&#x27;t eat!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> You might think I&#x27;m insane if you&#x27;re reading the other reviews for this product. I don&#x27;t mean to imply that these strips won&#x27;t cause sensitivity and pain. They do. But the thing is, if you have really sensitive teeth and gums, EVERY whitening product causes serious pain for several days after use. I finally realized this. In the past, I tried using the normal white strips only every 3-4 days, but I still had to suffer every single time I used them. The so called &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; white strips are the same. So I&#x27;d keep buying these boxes desperately wanting to whiten my teeth, but it was torturous and I never used more than maybe 8 or so and then the rest would end up never used. So I changed strategies. When I bought the express white strips, I also bought the new Crest Sensi-Stop Strips (warning, the Sensi-Stop strips are ridiculously tiny, and I used the whole six pack in one go to cover the area the white strips covered, but the protection lasts for a month so it worked out). I used the one hour express whitening strips for 2 hours, then I immediately applied the Sensi-Stop strips. I am happy to report that the usual excruciating pain I have in the days after using teeth whitening strips is significantly reduced using this strategy! Now, one set of the one hour express strips only whitens a few shades. I am going to go ahead and used the other 3 sets of whitening strips this week and while I don&#x27;t expect crazy white teeth, I can already tell the results of this experiment will be much better than my previous (very painful) experiences. If you have ridiculous sensitivity issues, this is a much less painful, drawn-out way to get nice pearly whites. I&#x27;m not promising you will have zero pain, but if you&#x27;re like me, even half as much pain would be much more tolerable. This method definitely achieved that.</li>
            <li> Used all 4 strips within a month. No noticeable difference in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> The Crest Whitening system does what it promises. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> the crest 3d white 2-hour express teeth whitening strips 4 count work as well on my teeth to make them more cleaner lookiing.</li>
            <li> Just used these and I experienced no pain and my teeth are very noticeably whiter. I was so happy with the results I signed on to buy another package.</li>
            <li> This is a fast acting product that works well.  Visibly whiter after 2 hours. Can make teeth sensitive.  I&#x27;ve used these a couple times and it seems to be hit or miss for tooth sensitivity.</li>
            <li> (review by Amy Sutherland)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I have to say that my teeth are indeed whiter, and I found the process much less bothersome than strips I&#x27;ve used in the past.  The strips stayed on well and I didn&#x27;t feel like I wanted to spit the whole time.  I do have one tooth which is slightly less white because it is a bit recessed from the rest.  If I were ever to do this again, which I won&#x27;t, I&#x27;d make sure to press on that tooth off and on so that it would get even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t ever be doing this again, however, because after a sleepless night in great pain, I can&#x27;t imagine inflicting that sort of torture on myself.  After lots of Advil, regular doses of Tylenol, and finally, thank the stars, some canker sore medicine that my husband had once bought rubbed on my gums I was able to drop off for a few hours.  I&#x27;m praying this will end before bedtime tonight.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used these before with good results so we&#x27;re continuing to use these as we don&#x27;t care to wear the strips any longer than necessary, and certainly not day after day after day as you&#x27;re required to do with some.</li>
            <li> Did not change teeth shade one bit after a full hour. Teeth are exactly the same. Disapointed!</li>
            <li> only had 2 treatments in the box where the description read that the box would contain 4 treatments.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought these for me to get rid of the stains I so wonderfully received from 5 beautiful years of braces. Now I know that my boyfriend secretly hates me.&lt;br /&gt;I wore these for only an hour and about 40 minutes in I began to feel the slight tingle of a forthcoming torturous journey.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I think my teeth hurt.&amp;#34; I said about an hour after removal.&lt;br /&gt;Ten hours after removal I&#x27;m trying desperately to achieve a level of drunkness I&#x27;ve never seen before, just praying for a blackout to sail me away into a sea of even a &#x27;kindof&#x27; comfort.&lt;br /&gt;I imagine my teeth turning into sponges, brittle and open and useless, just screaming for attention. These little joyous &#x27;whitening strips&#x27; are what nightmares are made of. I see a bright future for them in a new Saw movie. A poor soul strapped into a nasty cold diseaseinfested dungeon chair mercilessly screams as a masked demon stretches these devices onto their teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t buy these. Just say no. Natural is beautiful.</li>
            <li> These were the most uncomfortable strips I&#x27;ve ever tried. The first problem is the 2 hr time span. The back of my throat hurt the rest of the day since I probably swallowed a small amount of the gel solution during that huge chunk of time. They didn&#x27;t do much of anything to my teeth. Barely even one shade difference, if that. They do stick pretty well though and seem to have minimal overflow but those are the only good things I can say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to carve out 15-30 minutes, but 2 hours seems like forever when you&#x27;ve got stuff glued to your teeth. The second problem is during the middle of the night(the night immediately following the use of the strips) I kept waking up because my teeth were aching. I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive teeth, but my teeth got progressively more painful as the night wore on. I will NEVER put these on again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you had to wear them two hour and had a great outcome, I can see maybe suffering through it. But with barely a difference, it&#x27;s not worth the time, pain or money.</li>
            <li> Tried it out and followed the instruction to put it on for 2 hours. I did and removed it and saw results a few shades lower. I noticed that and people did as well that my teeth were obviously whiter. I was hoping for better results but I can&#x27;t complain about the results I got. It turns color throughout the day depending on what you eat but after a quick brush it ends up pretty white. I don&#x27;t really have much to compare to but I say when it comes to convienece that this one (one 2-hr strip once a month) is pretty good. Note: That is why its a 4 count, its ONCE EVERY THREE MONTHS.</li>
            <li> The Crest Whitestrips suggest that they can whiten teeth effecitvely for 3 months, a claim that will take some time to validate.  I used the Whitestrip last night and the gel that was on them feels like a real dentist&#x27;s gel, something that a professional would apply and I felt the peroxide foaming against my teeth.  When I removed the strips from my mouth, I had to pick some of the material off my teeth, but that&#x27;s not unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once done, my teeth certainly seemed whiter. The instructions talk about &#x27;white spots&#x27; but I did not notice anything that I would call problematic.  I would characterize the result as a 20% lightening of color which doesn&#x27;t sound like much, but for a home treatment, that&#x27;s pretty solid.  I smoke and I drink a lot of coffee...anything that can help is useful, in this case, they&#x27;re not expensive, treatments can be taken over if need be and they&#x27;re pretty easy to employ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good product...I just hope they stay white for the promise 3 months.  If they don&#x27;t, though, I will likely obtain more.  I was pleased overall with the product and its results.</li>
            <li> All I know is that my teeth look nice and white and all I use is Crest strips, the latest batch being these 2-hour strips.  Will stick with Crest.  My dentist is impressed and I&#x27;m very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;Edited on 5-4-11:&lt;br /&gt;I must amend this review to say that I&#x27;ve used a few more of the 2-hour strips and something weird is going on.  The last time, a few weeks ago, my gums felt irritated afterwards.  Today I used them and within a few hours of taking them off, my mouth hurts!  Yes, my teeth hurt.  I googled this and found a white strips review site and see that many people say the same thing.  It&#x27;s peculiar and can&#x27;t be good.  I will come back and edit this review to say how long this discomfort lasts.  I will continue to use Crest White Strips but won&#x27;t use the 2-hour version again and will stick to the 30-minute variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are my teeth sensitive?  Maybe.  I do not use Sensidyne. I consume hot and cold but brush my teeth with warm water so that says that they&#x27;re a little sensitive I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED ON 11-17-11:  My dentist told me that this is a common occurrence with certain strips, that there&#x27;s an ingredient missing from this particular strip that causes this.  The weirdness lasted 24 hours.  Won&#x27;t buy the 3D 2-hour strips again but I&#x27;ll certainly buy other Crest white strips.  My teeth look pretty damn good!</li>
            <li> I tried these last night, I thought it wasn&#x27;t too bad of a price for getting 4 applications.  They were really easy to put on, they&#x27;re really sticky, and I was able to get the strips in the cracks of my teeth easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does feel really weird with these on.  I had a lot of saliva build-up and I could definitely feel something happening to my teeth.  The gel stuck really good though, the strips weren&#x27;t sliding around and I didn&#x27;t have any bad taste in my mouth, which is good since I&#x27;d be stuck with it for 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two long hours later, I had difficulty taking the strips off.  It was a really sticky gel, almost like a silicone but after I successfully removed them I had no residue on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that my teeth were probably 1 to 1 and a half shades lighter, but my calcium stains from my braces were extremely bright.  With other whitening products, my calcium stains usually don&#x27;t get whiter, but I suppose that means these strips are doing their job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have absolutely no teeth sensitivity, but after this product my teeth have really hurt and stung.  Cold drinks hurt, sucking in air hurts, and it&#x27;s just a constant dull pain - and it&#x27;s been about 10 hours since I removed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did whiten my teeth well for it just being two hours, but I&#x27;m not sure that I will try it again because my teeth hurt!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, I have some sort of texture intolerance or something and could not stand these in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I used only one.&lt;br /&gt;My mother always told me you have to suffer for beauty, and in this case I guess it&#x27;s true. I think I&#x27;ll just be careful not to wear white.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Crest white strips products and I&#x27;ve had my teeth whitened professionally, and I&#x27;ve never experienced this level of discomfort. I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth usually, but I used the strips more than 8 hours ago and I still feel like I just had braces tightened - if you remember how terrible that was - and Advil isn&#x27;t helping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the results had been spectacular, I wouldn&#x27;t be as disappointed with the pain. But I noticed only a slight difference. I have pretty white teeth naturally, but other products I&#x27;ve used have had better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m really unhappy with the experience.</li>
            <li> These whitestrips are very poorly designed so they don&#x27;t work so well (as compared to opalescence or something you squeeze out onto your own tray), and it is overpriced too! Absolutely ridiculous.  The strip is way too sticky and hard that it doesnt even soften or wettens enough for the peroxide to actually penetrate your teeth even after 2 hours in mouth.  however it leaves my gums and teeth in horrible pain.  When I peel it off after 2 hours its like its glued onto my teeth, and not easy to peel off.  Then when I look at my teeth it is not white! Even the lower level crest white strips whiten better.</li>
            <li> NEVER AGAIN! Easy to use. Sharpe shooting pains down teeth to jaw while using. Slightly whiter after use. Pain, pain, pain and still in bad pain 12 hours later even with several pain killers. In future I will use the slower methods with less pain.</li>
            <li> I bought this even though I&#x27;ve read positive and negative comments before, decided to give it a try. I used before regular whitestrips and to be honest they did much better job than those 2-hour express. I do not see a big difference and the saddest thing about this products is that my relatives told me that they do not see a difference too. So .. I guess it&#x27;s not worth paying $30-50 for it. I got it only because I found a deal and I paid $5. Other than that, do not recommend.</li>
            <li> My teeth aren&#x27;t horribly stained or anything, so I figured using the Express kit would work well enough so I wouldn&#x27;t have to use a more extensive and time consuming whitening kit. Unfortunately I was wrong: there was no improvement at all, and the only difference is that now I have streaks on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;Applying the strips was an easy process, and although awkward at first, the strips aren&#x27;t intrusive. After sitting down and reading for about thirty minutes I stopped noticing that I had them on. Taking them off, however... that&#x27;s another story. The pamphlet warns that the strips may stick to teeth, and suggests pulling from the back if you have issues removing them. The pamphlet grossly underestimates the whitening gel&#x27;s adhesive. It was like someone took a hot glue gun to my teeth. The strips clung to my teeth for dear life, and once I was actually able to pull them off, they left these horrible strings and globs all over my mouth. It was slightly horrifying.&lt;br /&gt;Twenty-four hours after using this kit, my teeth are actually sore. Biting, drinking water, even breathing through my mouth is painful. I don&#x27;t recommend this kit to anyone, but especially not to those with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I used these last night at about 7 PM, and left them on for the two hours. After I took them off, my teeth were somewhat whiter, but almost immediately, shooting pains began in my lower teeth.  They lasted at least until the time I went to bed.  Now, at about 1:30 the next day, I am again getting the shooting pains after having eaten some food. I think most people would find the level of pain truly excruciating.  So, while my teeth do seem a little bit whiter, I would not consider it to be an amount worth the shooting pains afterwards, which have now lasted over sixteen hours.  Obviously not everyone has this reaction, but be wary.  It&#x27;s coming from inside the teeth, so no Oragel or other numbing products are going to do anything.</li>
            <li> My teeth have never been sensitive no matter what the weather, food temperature, whitening strips, toothpastes... they withstand anything, and my pain threshold is above average.  These were no issue for the 2 hours that I had them on.. but about 15 minutes after removing them (put them on at 10pm, took them off at midnight), there was a pulsating pain in EACH of my teeth.  I ignored it, expecting mild pain as a normality of white strips, which I&#x27;ve used all the time (just not these 2 hour ones). I was awake EVERY hour on the hour that night.  The pain was so horrible that I actually teared up and cried a few times because I just did not know what else to do.  I woke up from what seemed like 30 minutes of total sleep for work at 8am, still in throbbing pain.  It is now 3PM and I am sitting at work STILL IN THE SAME AMOUNT OF PAIN.  I am skipping class tonight to get some ibuprofen and ProNamel to try and make this go away quicker than the time that it seems it may take.  Please stay away from this product, it did not even make a big difference, and even if it did, it would not justify the pain that I&#x27;ve been in for the past 15 hours :(</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have strong teeth and I&#x27;m usually not bothered by much.  I&#x27;ve used Chest whitestrips before- the ones you use over 14 days and they worked great.  I used the 2 hour express ones from 7 - 9 and it was fine.  At around 4 in the morning I woke up because my teeth hurt.  It felt like the core of ever tooth exposed to the whitestrip was freezing and hurting at the same time.  I didn&#x27;t get back to sleep.  I spent the next few hours putting my mouth and tongue in every imaginable position to try and make me a little more comfortable but nothing worked.  Everything hut my teeth.  Licking my teeth, putting my teeth together, my lips over my teeth.  EVERYTHING.  The pain was HORRIBLE!  I took one aleve which helped a little but my mouth was still killing me so I took another one.  Let me just say- I get terrible migraines occasionally and one aleve usually knocks it out. I&#x27;ve never taken 2 aleve before- not even for a migraine! Two aleve really helped.  I could still feel my teeth hurting but it was more of a numb pain with the aleve so it was bearable.  The pain lasted from around 4 am to around 4 pm.  And here&#x27;s the kicker, I didn&#x27;t even notice a difference in the color of my teeth! All that for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.  I am not satisfied and want my money back.&lt;br /&gt;The two week crest whitestrips and much better all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use this product.</li>
            <li> These strips made my teeth horribly sensitive. A few hours afterward, my teeth were shooting pain, even when I wasn&#x27;t drinking or eating anything. I don&#x27;t normally have sensitive teeth, but if you have even the slightest bit of tooth sensitivity I do not recommend these. The whitening was ok but the pain afterwards....not worth it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that this could make my teeth whiter but thought I&#x27;d give it a try. The product is relatively simple to use, merely peel the backing off the enclosed strips and place on your unbrushed teeth (yes, that seems counterintuitive but that&#x27;s what the instructions state).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I did notice a slight whitening of my teeth (and I&#x27;m not complaining about that) but it was that noticeable (and no one else commented on them either). I&#x27;m really not sure if most people will be truly pleased with the results - mine were just so-so.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried these specific strips and would like to thank everyone who reviewed and advised on pain.  I used the original strip and never has a problem. When I used the Advaned ones - the ones that came after the basic strips - I discovered I could not go through the entire process because I&#x27;d have sensitivity pain that only stopped when I took warm water and help it in my mouth for a few seconds and then repeated for a few minutes.  After reading about half of these reviews I&#x27;m going back to using the regular, if somewhat tedious, original strips.  They may take more effort but they result in nice white teeth and no pain :) Note: I use Listerine Whitening mouthwash and alternate between Mentadent Whitening toothpaste and Aquafresh Whitening toothpaste and my teeth have remained noticably white for about 3 years now - this is in conjunction with strip use perdiodically.  Happy teeth!!</li>
            <li> Recieved this product fast and for a great price...but it doesn&#x27;t do what it states...White teeth in 2 hours...poor results ...Do not try..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of the original 14-day Crest White Strips for years, and have always been happy with the results.  My teeth aren&#x27;t terribly stained, but I do drink coffee and wine regularly and like to brighten them up from time to time.  I was excited to give the 2-hour version a test drive - could I possibly get the same results in only one long application?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer is no, not really.  The strips are just as easy to use as the original, and in fact are much \\&quot;stickier\\&quot; - there is a lot less slipping than with the 2-week kind.  Keeping them in for two hours turned out to be a lot less comfortable that the 30 minutes needed for the 14-day version - my teeth started to ache a bit (and I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth), plus it is hard to completely relax your mouth while you are aware of these strips, so my jaw was a little achy towards the end.  They are harder to remove than the original (because of the increased stickiness) - but that&#x27;s not big deal.  However, after removing them and cleaning the residual goo off of my teeth, I was disappointed.  They were whiter, but not nearly as white as at the end of the 14-day treatment.  The instructions say the results should last 3 months, but don&#x27;t clearly indicate whether it is safe to use them more frequently, so I don&#x27;t know if I can try another application sooner to see if I can improve the results (there are 4 sets of strips in the box).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 hours was a long time to keep them in, and that 2 hours included discomfort I don&#x27;t feel with the 14-day version.  I think I&#x27;ll go back to the 14-day version - popping them on after breakfast in the morning for 30 minutes (more than the time it takes me to shower, get dressed and get ready to leave the house) is much easier and the results are much more noticeable.  Besides, as a random fringe benefit, I&#x27;ve noticed that the \\&quot;oh so clean\\&quot; feeling you have after using the strips discourages snacking for a while, so 2 weeks of no mid-morning munchies (or do them at night if that&#x27;s your weak time) leaves you smiling brighter AND maybe a bit skinnier!&#x27;s your weak time) leaves you smiling brighter AND maybe a bit skinnier!</li>
            <li> Im not a fan of whitening strips. These were no better than the usual strips. It took me forever to try them only because they need two hours on your teeth. I finally had two free hours but could only stand them for 45 minutes. They do cling to teeth very well....but only in front. The worst for me was how much bleachy tasting spit accumulated in my mouth, which I had to keep spitting out. I noticed spots on my teeth after removing the strips but those faded after a night a two brushings. My gums were sensitive during the first brushing after use, but fine otherwise. They did whiten my teeth noticeably and w/o using them for the full allotted time so I can imagine what they&#x27;d do if left on the full time. All in all, not a product I&#x27;d pay for. I prefer the quicker acting strips.</li>
            <li> இ Fuzzy Wuzzy&#x27;s Summary:&lt;br /&gt;ѾѾѾѾ Recommended with warm fuzzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a daily drinker of strong coffees and teas, I was interested in the Crest Whitestrips ever since they became available.  I thought that they would help with maintaining the whiteness in between periodic visits to the dentist for teeth check-ups and cleaning.  The original Crest Whitestrips easily moved around or slid off my teeth, sometimes within minutes after I put them on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then used three boxes of the [[ASIN:B00336EUTK Crest 3D White Whitestrips With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton]] when that product became available.  The 20-strip box of that version is designed to be worn for 30 minutes, once a day.  Compared to the original Crest Whitestrips, the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; technology really does work to hold the strips firmly to the teeth.  On my teeth, the lower strip sometimes does not stick as well as the upper strip, which always sticks as firmly as duct tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions recommend that you do not brush your teeth before application.  But I brushed my teeth anyway whenever I applied the strips after eating a meal.  Once I used my fingers to firmly press the strip onto my upper and lower teeth, the strips never moved around the way the original Whitestrips did.  But even though the advertisements say that you can talk and drink water while wearing the strips, I always avoided drinking water while wearing the strips out of concern that too much fluid may dilute the peroxide whitening agent.  After all, these products are not exactly inexpensive, and I want to get my money&#x27;s worth of whitening with each application!  :-)  I also doubt that you can, or would want to, eat while wearing the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; strips.  Although it is far easier to talk while wearing the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; strips compared with the original Whitestrips (which could easily be moved or dislodged with the slightest mouth movements), with the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; strips stuck to my teeth, my speech was usually slightly altered, as if I had a bit of peanut butter in my mouth or as if I was wearing braces.  But other than not drinking/eating and minimizing my talking, I could go about my daily routines while wearing them.  The instructions say not to use these strips on loose teeth because the \\&quot;Advanced Seal\\&quot; truly feels like duct tape firmly stuck to your teeth. You would not want to use these strips&#x27; strong adhesion on any loose teeth. When you peel the strips off, there is a slightly odd aftertaste, but it was not disagreeable to me and can be easily washed away by rinsing with water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to this newest addition to the Crest Whitestrip product line...  The advertisement for this new Whitestrip is certainly enticing - all you have to do is get this box of 4 pairs of Whitestrips, and wear a strip for just 2 hours, repeating the treatment 3 months later, for a full year&#x27;s worth of whitening.  During my testing of this new Whitestrip, instead of waiting 3 months before using another application, I waited 2 weeks later and then applied another Whitestrip.  Compared to the [[ASIN:B00336EUTK Crest 3D White Whitestrips With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton]], these new strips have two notches in the upper/lower strips that help the strips to tuck behind your teeth edge more easily.  The adhesive on these new Whitestrips seem to be a bit stickier than before even though the previous \\&quot;Professional Effects\\&quot; Advanced Seal was already quite sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict after two applications within a two week period?  I do see some incremental whitening.  However, I really wonder how well this whitening will last during the 3-month period before I use another one of these \\&quot;Express\\&quot; strips again.  For a daily coffee/tea drinker like me, that is asking a lot for a Whitestrip to maintain its whitening power after 3 months of frequently drinking coffee/tea.  I can understand the appeal and convenience of just applying the whitening once every 3 months.  But because I doubt that a single every-3-month application will endure 3 months of drinking coffee and tea, I would almost prefer that Crest come out with a \\&quot;Crest Once-A-Week Whitestrip\\&quot; that would be more convenient than daily use of the [[ASIN:B00336EUTK Crest 3D White Whitestrips With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton]], and also provide more whitening upkeep than this every-3-month product.  If you do not drink much coffee, tea, colas, perhaps this product will give you 3 months of whitening.tly drinking coffee/tea.

            <li> Some years ago I paid a dentist to fir me for trays for whitening. It wasn&#x27;t that much of a pain - but finding the hours to sit with them on was a challenge at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product from Crest makes whitening so much easier. I think the result are on par with the professional dentist trays that I paid for - but the stips make finding the time to whiten so easy. They are nearly invisible, hold well and actually do the job wonderfully!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to whiten your teeth an easy and effective way - then give these a try!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth but I was told that I could use this no problem (I called and asked a rep from Crest). After an hour my teeth and gums were starting to burn. Not only this, but I was swallowing the goo that was under the strips which caused me to become nauseous. I took them off after an hour and literally saw no difference. Yes, I only kept it on for half the time, but I still feel like I should have seen SOME change. My gums started bleeding about an hour later when I tried to eat and I could barely brush my tenth 8 hours after I took them off. If I could give this product a 0/5 stars I would.</li>
            <li> What ever you do, don&#x27;t brush your teeth first and then put these on. I won&#x27;t be doing that again. There&#x27;s a reason they don&#x27;t want you to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a lovely sore on the top part front of my gums. Thank goodness is doesn&#x27;t really show unless I smile a REALLY BIG SMILE :[]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes your teeth more sensitve where you get these white spots and sore spots as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tolerated the 2hour pain and was lucky enough not to have any more pain after I took off the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I notice a difference in my teeth? I have to say I did. I mean I already have white teeth I just wanted them whiter and I have to say they are. I could tell that they&#x27;re whiter from the back of my teeth ( they&#x27;re not as white as my front teeth :[])&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using these again in 3 months... only I won&#x27;t be brushing my teeth before I put on the strips :\&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it wasn&#x27;t for the sore and slight pain I would&#x27;ve given these 5 stars... but 4 stars seem fair to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:[]</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t get the same number of strips I ordered the product worked great. Amazon corrected the error and I will buy the product again because my husband and I saw noticeable differences after one treatment. Hopefully next time we will receive the correct size box!</li>
            <li> I tried to use these strips two seperate times and they didn&#x27;t work!  Also, I have had very sensitive teeth ever since.  My dentist said that he doesn&#x27;t recommend using them.  I asked for my money back, but they refused to give it back.  I won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. I&#x27;ve tried some of their other White Strips a while ago, but I&#x27;ve decided to give this a try since it supposedly show results in two hours. I took them off about half an hour ago. They didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth, but they did cause some to have a sharp aching pain and the rest to be mildly sore for about 10-15 minutes. It&#x27;s a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> So I just got this product about 4 hours ago. Put them on around 8:30 and took them off around 10:20-10:30 ish.My teeth are hardly even any whiter and my three front teeth on the bottom are KILLING me! It almost worse than having a root canal! DO NOT BUY THESE! you will regret it! I dont have sensitive teeth and I thought I would be fine but I&#x27;m not. I&#x27;m in tears as I&#x27;m writing this it hurts so bad!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many home whitening kits from Crest over the past ten years. Most of them work, but have one flaw in common, the tape never sticks. Well, no need to worry about that with the Crest 3D  2 hour express kit. The teeth whitening strips stay perfectly in place for as long as you keep them there. No slipping and sliding! Also, the taste is not as overwhelming as the previous kits. The whitening is fantastic! My teeth look very bright and I am super stoked with my results. This kit is a super must for all beauty junkies that crave white teeth all the time!!!</li>
            <li> The strips stay on well and don&#x27;t get in your way. They are also easy to apply. I didn&#x27;t eat or drink for the 2 hours I had them in, but I read somewhere that you can have water. Be careful though, they make your teeth sensitive afterwards. My teeth were so sensitive and it really bothered me for the rest of the day, but the next morning they felt fine. I also used Sensodyne toothpaste to make the pain less, which worked for the most part. Maybe my teeth were white to begin with, but I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference afterwards. It looked like they did get a little bit whiter though.</li>
            <li> These little strips do not do the job.  They are unpleasant to wear but I suspect most such products are.  While there might have been a slight initial whiteness, they just did not do much of a job of whitening my teeth.  I don&#x27;t think they are worth using.</li>
            <li> These work great!  I experienced a little bit of sensitivity the day after I used them but my teeth were VERY noticeably whiter!</li>
            <li> good quality they stick to teeth. good results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of the strips now, and overall am fairly pleased with this product, but not exactly blown away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many years ago I went to a dentist for teeth whitening.  He made a plastic mold of my teeth, and then put the whitening goo inside that, and I had to wear the mold for several hours each day over a period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This crest product is similar, but much more limited.  While the dentist will make a mold of your teeth, and whiten all surfaces of all your teeth, this product takes a more modest, and perhaps more practical approach, and just gives you strips that will cover the front surfaces of your front-most teeth, upper and lower jaw.  These are obviously the teeth that are most prominent when you open your mouth or smile, but obviously it does nothing for the other teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that my teeth look a bit whiter each time I used it.  And I will continue to use it until I run out of strips.  It&#x27;s not an altogether unpleasant experience using the strips.  You simply have to remember that they are there, and obviously not eat or drink during the 2 hours that they are attached.  For the price I think this is a pretty good product, but of course a dentist will do a much better job if you want to spend the money to go that route.</li>
            <li> I ended up paying over £100 for a £25 product, so understand when i say i am hesitant to use this seller again. I was not warned about custom charge prices and had to pay £24 on top of the £70 p&amp;p. The only reason it&#x27;s not a \\&quot;never again\\&quot; is cause the product actually works, it does what it says on the box basically. You&#x27;ll see a difference from the first use, and you&#x27;re meant to use 1 every 3 months so 4 strips will last me the year. I&#x27;m very pleased and impressed with the product, the seller however, not so much.</li>
            <li> Meh.. These aren&#x27;t all they are cracked up to be. They will leave your teeth hurting even if you shorten time to 90 minutes. I did not notice enough of a difference of regular white strips to justify using these.</li>
            <li> Will never do this again! So much pain and I don&#x27;t see any difference in my teeth. Used exactly as stated on the package.. never, never again.</li>
            <li> I have healthy teeth, not sensitive at all. It did definitely whiten my teeth within two hours but it made my teeth ache. I think it could be even worse for those with sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> Really could not tell a difference. They are not cheap, comes in a pack of four, and would love to get my money back.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and no hassle at all. I watched a movie during the treatment and after removal my teeth were 3 to 4 shades whiter. Having just finished my Invisalign treatment, I dropped the extra money begrudgingly but was very happy with the results. My only complaint is slight tooth ache 24 hours after treatment, but beauty is pain, right?</li>
            <li> I bought these whitening strips to save some time whitening. Of course I read the reviews after I placed the first strip on my top layer of teeth. I started to get scared after reading some of the reviews that my teeth would become painfully sensitive. I read one review that said to use the strips for only an hour and a half. So I did. My teeth never got painfully sensitive. They were slightly sensitive and mostly a chipped tooth I have on the bottom, and I didn&#x27;t use the strips on my bottom teeth (never do, I save the bottom strips for the top). This very mild sensitivity lasted maybe 24 hours. My results were so-so, though I have pretty white teeth anyway. I was just looking for a refresher. They stayed on during the whole process really well. I did get a white spot on my front tooth which disappeared the next day. A week later my husband even complimented how white they look and I didn&#x27;t tell him I was using the product. I don&#x27;t think I am brave enough to do the full 2 hours...but I could see that using them for less time and sooner than 3 months and you will get some pretty pearly whites!</li>
            <li> I used teeth whitening toothpaste but I can&#x27;t notice a difference. When I wore these strips I saw a notable difference. I know there are reviews that people had a lot of pain, and i feel sorry for them.  There was no pain for me.</li>
            <li> The product works well. I have tried other crest whitening strips before, mainly the ones that required using them everyday. They never worked for me because one, i was very horrible at keeping up because of my busy schedule, those 30 mins everyday were precious and usually that meant skipping a lot of days which in turn, the strips never worked for me. Two, Using them on a daily basis made my teeth extremely sensitive to the point that it hurt to breathe because the air touching my teeth alone was hurtful. I used sensodyne toothpaste with using those daily routine crest strips but that only helped a little and eventually stopped using them anyway because i couldn&#x27;t handle it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I love this product because you only use it 4 times in 1 whole yr!!!! PERFECT for me! I can just use it once on a free day for 2 hours and then not worry about it for 3 months!!! Thats amazing and let me tell you, i kept a pic record of how my teeth is changing color, and it got MUCH whiter! Surprisingly also, they did not make my teeth sensitive at alll!!!! I was so worried at first because i thought, oh, it hurt to put them on for 30 mins, it ll prob kill me if i had it on for 2 hours. No, No, No! They made them only verryyy slightly sensitive, definitely not bad at all and this bit of sensitivity goes away within a day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall, Its a GREAT product! i would definitely recommend it for busy bee&#x27;s like me! :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this 3D whitestrips thinking I was getting 4 boxes for $30. but when I got it, it&#x27;s just the 1 box with 4 strips?&lt;br /&gt;Not such a great deal!!! You can get it @ any store for the same price. DON&#x27;T WAIST YOUR TIME.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used whitestrips before, but I have used the listerine ones, and never had a problem. When my friend brought these over I decided that since I smoke and drink coffee, it was high time for me to whiten! The actual whitening process wasn&#x27;t bad at all, kind of annoying on my gums. After I took them off, however, there was an immense throbbing pain. I whitened at 1pm-3pm and its now 10:30pm and I&#x27;ve been laying in bed for the last 3 hours on a friday night. WHEN WILL THIS PAIN STOP?! AND HOW DO I AID IT IN STOPPING?!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews, but this is an exception! Followed direction, put this on for 2 hrs, near the end i started feeling pain in my teeth. After removing I thought it would go away, but it only got worst in the morning. I don&#x27;t know how long this pain will last, but definitely not worth it since i barely see any whitening. Seems like other people are having the same issue lately? Reviews earlier didn&#x27;t have this issue?? Did we all get a new batch of pain?</li>
            <li> Was good. Tooth look brighter with the first strip. We&#x27;ll see the result after using the other strips in the next months.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work.  My husband, daughter and I all tried them.  Our teeth don&#x27;t look any different.  They make your teeth very sensetive for several days also.  Not a good product.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0045XE3AG Crest 3D White 2-Hour Express Whitestrips Dental Whitening Kit, 4-Count]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be prepared for pain!  I began to get pain about an hour with the strips on, a sudden shocking zinger in one tooth, WOW!  I worked past it and it died down a bit, so I finished the 2 hours.  An hour later and ALL my teeth hurt hurt hurt!!!  7 hours later and my teeth still hurt.  I tried Oragel and coated my teeth front and back and gums, didn&#x27;t even touch the pain.  Pain meds are next and I doubt I will sleep tonight it hurts so much.  I did see good color change, but not sure if it&#x27;s worth the pain.  I will definately try the sensodyne IF I do use it again, and not brushing my teeth before using (didn&#x27;t read instructions).  Not a happy camper!!</li>
            <li> I used Crest 3-D Express Whitestrips on my teeth yesterday and am stunned at how well they worked. I am a smoker and daily coffee/tea drinker and my teeth were stained to say the least. I always had to use the \\&quot;teeth whiten\\&quot; feature on myself in my photo editing software. Not anymore, I&#x27;m happy to say. I really wish I&#x27;d taken a before photo but trust me when I say the difference is huge after only 1 treatment. I&#x27;m also using the recommended 3D White toothpaste and mouthwash which I think may have brightened them even more than they appeared yesterday.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after doing quite a bit of research, thinking the results would be exactly as stated: noticeable whitening in only two hours, side effects including (possibly) light tooth/gum sensitivity/pain.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, i wish.&lt;br /&gt;Despite applying the strips rather meticulously, the results of the whitening process are sub-par at best. None of my teeth were whitened along the gumline, and, though they were already a rather white shade, they now appear to be outlined in yellow. this might lead you to believe that the strips were effective, at least, on the remaining parts of my teeth. again, wrong. upon closer inspection, it quickly becomes clear that the whitening is patchy and extremely uneven looking.&lt;br /&gt;not only do my teeth look odd now, but that &#x27;slight&#x27; pain? UNDERSTATEMENT!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;over 7 hours after having removed the strips, my teeth are still throbbing with horrible, sharp pains. i dont even think painkillers will help dull them. i can only hope and pray that by the time i wake up tomorrow, they will be gone, because it is nearly unbearable. honestly.&lt;br /&gt;so, buyer beware!!</li>
            <li> I have used crest white strips in the past with little problems and was excited to try crest 2 hour white strips. It had been about a year since I had used any whiting product. I was really excited to try the 2 hour white strips and had read multiple positive reviews. The 2 hour white strips were applied the same as other crest white strips. I did not brush my teeth before. I thought they were a little gooey, but nothing uncomfortable. I removed them at the 2 hour mark and rinsed my mouth with water. I then went to sleep. I did not see an immediate difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, about an hour later I awoke in intense pain. My teeth hurt so badly, I contemplated going to the emergency room. I have never felt tooth pain like this before. I called the number on the crest box and they said that I might experience a slight discomfort and to take advil or motrin. If this is what they call slight, then they are grossly misrepresenting their product. Motrin did not help my pain. I was still in excruciating pain 12 hours later and went to an urgent care clinic and they prescribed 800 mg of advil. I was unable to eat or drink anything for almost 48 hours. I will NEVER use or recommend this product to anyone again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to mention that after all of this, I notice only a slight difference in my teeth.</li>
            <li> The strips worked well for me. I used these as a test before my wedding and these did the job for a lower cost than the dentist. I am glad I saved the extra cash from a spared office visit, but I wish they were slightly more affordable. For a 2 hour treatment not bad. I put the strips on and cooked dinner, by the time my fiancee got home I was able to take them off. Only then did I read the reviews. I was scared of what some people were saying throbbing and painful teeth. I did not experience any pain nor discomfort while wearing the strips. If you are familiar with other strips its not any less uncomfortable, just keep busy if you are impatient like me. My teeth did not look any whiter immediately after removal, but the next day I noticed a difference. After two strips and three weeks I was able to bring them to the whitening level I need for my dress. Overall good product for strong healthy teeth.</li>
            <li> These are a wonderful product.  They don&#x27;t fall apart and fall off like the older versions.  They stay put and they really work after only two hours.</li>
            <li> I have used various at-home teeth whitening strips and gels several times in the past and had also had my teeth whitened professionally once. So when I saw these 2 hr ones, I thought \\&quot;wow, great--should be really good\\&quot;. I applied the strips and waited 2 hrs. The strips really did stick great and I didn&#x27;t have as much problem with them moving around that I normally have with whitening strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I removed the strips the effect was very slight--not really noticeable at all. But, a few hours later I started having pain in my teeth and I&#x27;ve NEVER, EVER had any tooth sensitivity before. The pain lasted quite a few hours and even though I took 2 Aleeve the pain was still there. Cannot imagine the pain if a person has tooth sensitivity to begin with. I wouldn&#x27;t advise anyone to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Hard hard time staying on for two hours, didn&#x27;t stay in place to well.  Didn&#x27;t see much difference after two hours.</li>
            <li> EDIT*** This review was done for the 2 Hour Express. Crest apparently changed the product to 1 Hour Express because reviews and complaints of pain for this product was so rampant!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God, this sucks, I put these on expecting some \\&quot;mild tooth sensitivity\\&quot; as the box says. Put them on at 10 and took them off around 1150. Not even full two hours. I felt nothing and then in the middle of the night around 5 am the pain was so bad it woke me up and I couldn&#x27;t go back to sleep. This is horrible, stabbing, pulsating pain. It&#x27;s within the tooth and no amount of rubbing will make it stop. I&#x27;m normally okay with a little bit of pain but this is like something I&#x27;ve never felt before, without relief. DO NOT buy this product! DO NOT!!!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, I was happy with the product. Strips are very fast to put on and off. I t takes only one hour and you have a whiter smile. I would order from Ucline2011 again.</li>
            <li> I am impressed. These actually whitened my teeth in 2 hrs. I am a smoker and an extreme coffee drinker, but you would never know it!</li>
            <li> These do whiten your teeth, but they also make your teeth very sensitive</li>
            <li> I have used Crest Whitestrips before and they do whiten my teeth.  According to my dentist, I have fairly white teeth when he puts the tooth whiteness scale to my teeth and don&#x27;t really need a professional bleaching. But, I like to use these strips to freshen up my smile.  I usually use the Crest 3D Whitestrips that stay on your teeth for 30 minutes.  I use 1 set a day for 2 -3 days &amp; that&#x27;s enough for my teeth.  I usually use them a day after having my teeth cleaned so there is no plaque to get in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These 2 hour strips really are sticky &amp; stay on and there is more of that yucky taste with these.  They seem to work just as well as the 3D strips.  I guess it really depends on how much time or sensitivity you have.  I have minor sensitivity and these 2 hour strips really didn&#x27;t cause me problems.  But if you have sensitive teeth you may be better off going with the 30 minute strips.  It&#x27;s a trade off of 30 minutes over several days vs. 2 hours in one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  They whiten your teeth but if you have very stained teeth, you may need a professional bleaching.  These are worth a try before going to your dentist.</li>
            <li> This 2-hour whitestrip is much easier to use than the 30 minute whitestrip.  It doesn&#x27;t foam up in your mouth.  I was able to do chores around the house while my teeth were getting whiter.  It only has to be done every 3 months.  And best of all-my teeth are whiter!</li>
            <li> BEST PIECE OF ADVICE...use Sensodyne or the Crest Sensitivity tooth paste a few days or a week before using these strips!  TRUST ME!  It seals up the little pores in your teeth that cause sensitivity to heat and cold which will drastically reduce any discomfort you&#x27;ll experience from the peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a few whitening strip products in the past but nothing that I didn&#x27;t get bored of after applying for a week and seeing zero results.  So I was excited to finally join the masses to try these.&lt;br /&gt;First, the Amazon price is lessv than half the cost of the drugstore ones so anyone considering buying them here, do it!  Both of the drugstores in my area (Chicago) had these exact same ones priced above $60 for the same 12 month supply which includes 4 sets of strips (4 for the top, 4 for the bottom.)&lt;br /&gt;Second, the application is so easy.  They really stick and aren&#x27;t all goopy like the other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t much of a difference immediately after removing these but the this morning a few of my teeth that were annoyingly pretty yellow are at least half as yellow!!  YAY!! I noticed a little sensitivity on my bottom teeth about an hour into the process.  I removed the strips, brushed my teeth lightly and then went to bed.  I woke up with significantly more sensitivity though!  Its not unmanageable and I can talk, eat and drink ok but its definitely uncomfortable.  FYI, I&#x27;ve also taken 5 Tylenol! My friend said she used Sensodyne a few days before using these strips and the days following and it really helped with the pain.  So I&#x27;m going to take her advice (because it completely makes sense) and test run these strips again maybe 4-5 days from now to continue the whitening process.  I&#x27;m sure after using all 4 sets throughout the month I&#x27;ll see a huge difference.  I&#x27;ll report back ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be patient though and use Sensodyne or a sensitivity toothpaste.  I really think Crest is on to something here so don&#x27;t give up if you felt any pain.  Just do a little prep work.  Trust me!!work.    Trust me!!</li>
            <li> Totally useless.  Lower strip would not adhere.  This allowed me to see that the upper strip had no effect whatsoever on the color of my teeth.</li>
            <li> Top strips worked great...Bottom teeth strips were very very dry and did not adhere to my teeth..Everyone of them was bad....Had to toss them out.......</li>
            <li> I use a whitening product I purchase from my dentist about once every three months - it&#x27;s one of the gels you put in a retainer-like product and leave it in overnight. It works wonderfully, but I was looking for a product for some minor touch-up in between, maybe at the 1.5 month mark, just to keep things nice and shiny. I saw this in the pharmacy today and on a whim purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put them on at 2pm and left them on until 4pm. The bottom one was a little awkward to put in - I recommend you wipe your mouth a bit first, because if you&#x27;re at all spitty the strips will squish around awkwardly as you try to position it. After they were on, they were fine. After about an hour and a half, I started to get a couple random shooting pains in my teeth here and there - but it wasn&#x27;t frequent, and it was more annoying than anything. Sort of like having your finger pricked - it hurts, but it goes away fast, and it&#x27;s just an annoying distraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I had taken them off, I continued to get the random shooting pains throughout the day. Oddly, when I pushed my tongue against the area that was hurting, it seemed to make it better (but, that could just be all in my head) - instead of making it worse, like I thought it would. Fortunately, however, they did whiten my teeth noticeably. My teeth were already reasonably white, I really just wanted to touch up the small yellowish bits at the very tops of my teeth near the gums - and this did that perfectly. I will use this product again, but I would warn others to keep in mind that while it works, it can be annoyingly painful - I&#x27;d do this on a day off, because if I were at work this would drive me nuts (and my patients would probably think I was crazy, from my occasional twitchy mouth).</li>
            <li> I was really hoping for good things with this product seeing the reviews seemed high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions to the &#x27;t&#x27; and the results were ZERO improvement.  I was not looking for miracles but there was NOTHING .  For the kind of money you spend on this product I was seriously disappointed.  I had my boyfriend try the strips next to see if it was just me.  Same results NO improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a complete worthless product and I am very disappointement that I just fell for this scam and wasted my hard earned money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So buyer beware!!!</li>
            <li> My teeth are whiter which is nice, but the strips make my teeth feeling horrrribly painful sensitive for the whole day. I would not recommend these if you are prone to sensitivity like me. :( It so was not worth it for me. I had to go out and buy sensodyne halfway through my day I just couldn&#x27;t take it.</li>
            <li> YES THEY WILL HURT. However I have found that if I leave them on for 1.5 hours instead of the full two I have little to no pain and still get a good amount of whitening. Oh and make sure you don&#x27;t do it more than once a month!!!! I definitely see results after the second &#x27;session&#x27;. I have still not been brave enough to leave them on for more than 1.5 hours, but I have read that rinsing with mouthwash or using some sensodyne afterwards helps. I usually rinse with lukewarm water. Since cold water or hot water will bring more pain to sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically the 101.&lt;br /&gt;1. Make sure you dont brush ur teeth immediately before.&lt;br /&gt;2. Floss&lt;br /&gt;3. Apply the strips (try to only get a sliver on ur gums, focus on your teeth. (your whitening your teeth not you gums!, plus it can make you gums sensitive!) -- also try to tuck the strip into the teeth crevices so you wrap the whole tooth as to not leave a not so white outline! yuck!&lt;br /&gt;4. Wait 1.5 hours or 2 if you dare.&lt;br /&gt;5. Yank them off (this part is hard and annoying) -- takes a while to get them off gotta rip it off&lt;br /&gt;6. Rinse with lukewarm water&lt;br /&gt;7. Take a toothbrush (run under lukewarm water) and do one stroke in each direction to try and get the rest of the sticky stuff off of your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ps. it tastes like hydrogen peroxide, not exactly yummy, but not horrible.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get this product, as I&#x27;ve tried the 5 minute crest strips and didn&#x27;t notice the results.&lt;br /&gt;So my friend and I, we both put it on to try it.&lt;br /&gt;It was not clear from the instructions how to put it exactly, and which strip goes where.&lt;br /&gt;Just before we put it on, I was afraid I won&#x27;t be able to leave it on for 2 hours, without feeling like I can&#x27;t behave normally with it in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I was right, it had a strange taste and I felt like I&#x27;m swallowing something I&#x27;m not suppose to, and definitely don&#x27;t want to!&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go to sleep to pass the time quickly, and got up on time to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;I have no clue how people drink or eat with this - it&#x27;s disgusting!&lt;br /&gt;I will give them this: it did stick on to my teeth and didn&#x27;t move. Actually so much, that I wasn&#x27;t sure I won&#x27;t take off a tooth with it :)&lt;br /&gt;The after result, was not noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good:&lt;br /&gt;1) Sticks to your teeth&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad:&lt;br /&gt;1) Cause strange taste&lt;br /&gt;2) Result not noticeable&lt;br /&gt;3) Unclear directions for applying and removing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My bottom line - not worth the time or money.</li>
            <li> After trying the regular white stips and the gentle white strips, I wanted a quicker working item. I put them on and watched TV for the 2 hours, with little discomfort or pain. When I took them off my teeth looked amazing, much noticeably whiter than before. However about 15 minutes later I got shooting pain in my teeth, which hurts so bad it makes you want to cry. However I took a few advil, and the pain went away immediately. My advice: make sure to take a pain reliever during and after, and you dont have to follow that 3-month crap you can use them as often as you like however the more often u use them the more likely it is you will have greater sensitivity and pain. If you do this it works amazingly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many teeth whitening products over the years and Crest Advanced Seal products are easily the best.  They bind very well to the teeth and are easy to wear.  You can even drink while wearing them!  This is in contrast to the old style strips that are gummy and don&#x27;t make good contact (not as good results) or the big trays that make it hard to breath.  Just having something on your teeth may irritate you at first, but give it some time and you&#x27;ll likely forget they are on.  I&#x27;ve come close to going to work with them on multiple times!  They are clear, but the whitening gel foams up, so they give your teeth a bright white funny look while they are on.  Fine for being around the house, working in the yard, etc., but not something people won&#x27;t notice.  With that said, they don&#x27;t really require a time commitment, since you can go about your normal business with them on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips come in different strengths to allow people with sensitive teeth to use them.  Since I&#x27;ve used them before, my teeth aren&#x27;t very sensitive and I can use the 3D professional strength without issue.  Prior to that iteration, the bottom strip was a little too small, but they have remedied that.  The 2-hr Express version just has a thicker gel, along with a bit better strip design, to allow you to get a substantial effect with only one application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think you should know that teeth whitening is not like on TV.  You don&#x27;t go from brown to brilliant white so easily, and some stains are easier to attack than others.  If you drink coffee and/or tea, you may need multiple applications to get some momentum, and I might recommend the normal 3D Professional kit, which takes weeks of shorter treatments rather than one long one.  These 2-hour applications are better for maintenance, I think.  Also, don&#x27;t forget to get your teeth cleaned by your dentist every 6-months.  A lot of that buildup just needs to be scraped off properly rather than whitened.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;regular\\&quot; Crest Whitestrips in the past, and while I could always live with the idea of wearing the plastic film on my teeth for eight hours or more, the idea of getting it done in two hours certainly had great appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with regular Whitestrips, application of the film on the teeth is very simple, and once they&#x27;re on, its easy to forget that you&#x27;re wearing them, and you could - if you wanted to - go out in public wearing them with no one noticing them, unless they&#x27;re closely looking at your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Whitening effect was as good as, if not better, than I&#x27;ve experienced in the past with the standard product, with no noticeable sensitivity during or after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On its own, its a great product that does exactly what it promises, but do you ~need~ to buy this instead of the standard version?  If you&#x27;re one of those people that just wants things to be done as quickly as possible, there&#x27;s certainly a virtue, and if you like the effect of standard Whitestrips but find the experience of wearing them objectionable, you&#x27;ll definitely want it.  If not, then the standard product will be just fine for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smoke but I do drink two cups of coffee per day. My teeth are not horrible but they could use whitening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried whitening toothpaste and the Listerine strips. I did not experience noticeable results with any. Then yesterday I tried the Crest strips for the first time. The change was dramatic and immediate. I don&#x27;t need to use a second set of strips, my teeth are whiter than ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips were easy to apply. For the two hours you have them in your mouth they are slighlty umconfortable (unlike the Listerine strips which you can&#x27;t feel much) but manageable. Now for the secondary effects: for the next 4 hours or so, my gums were very sensitive and hurt a little. For me, the end result  is worth it. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Should have got the 8 count. Watta Doh Doh</li>
            <li> I have been using Crest Whitestrips for years. I love the results, but the are kind of inconvenient to use.  Two times a day for two weeks (or a month)?  I am always forgetting about them, so the box ends up taking me a few months to finish. I continued to use them because the results were quite dramatic.  My dentist asked me if I had my teeth professionally whitened!!!  Needless to say I was excited when I say Crest came out with a 2 hour kit. I was also skeptical that I would get the same results as the  2 week and 4 week kits.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised to see that the results were amazing.  The whitening is especially noticeable, because you see the results in two hours, instead of gradually over many treatments.  There is a one year supply in the box, which is 4 treatments to do every 3 months. I will be recommending this to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Back in the old days I purchased teeth trays and whitener from my dentist to the tune of $500.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Then in recent years I have occasionally been using the old skool Crest Whitestrips.  These did the trick for me to whiten my teeth a bit although the strips did not stay on my teeth very well and was a bit of a hassle to keep adjusting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So now I&#x27;ve tried the Crest 3D strips and they are a definite improvement over the old strips.  Once these puppies go on my teeth, they aren&#x27;t moving until I take them off and that alone is worth it compared to the old strips.  The 2-hour strip did whiten my teeth somewhat but there is no magic to take you from zero-to-bright white.  My teeth are occasionally sensitive but I did not experience any discomfort from these strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, 3D is better than $500 dentist teeth trays, 3D is better than the old skool strips.  I would give it a 5th star if the whitening power was a bit more noticeable.</li>
            <li> I received the box of express strips for Christmas.  I put on a two hour strip.  Afterward, my teeth looked no brighter...and I didn&#x27;t expect them to because this is a one time deal.  I would much rather suffer through the inconvenience of using multiple strips over the course of a few days than to do a one time quick session that doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  I just can&#x27;t believe everyone else on here that says they work great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you buy the PROFESSIONAL EFFECTS strips instead of the express.</li>
            <li> I have white teeth naturally in general but i&#x27;ve been drinking a lot of coffee lately, so i wanted a quick fix.&lt;br /&gt;anyway, i wore these for 2 hrs and my teeth did get a little bit whiter but what came afterward was horrible. The pain was excruciating. I couldn&#x27;t sleep all night because of the pain and took pain killers in the middle of the night. The next morning I had to take pain killers again and while at work because of the shooting pain.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, this is the third day and the pain finally has stopped even though my teeth are somewhat sensitive still. I&#x27;m shocked by the results because I&#x27;ve used teeth whitener before and my teeth has handled them before... i never had an experience like this.  ITS NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> In short: these are great for individuals who don&#x27;t have the patience to use the 14 or 21 day Professional Effects strips.  However, don&#x27;t expect to see IMMEDIATE results--it will take several days for the whiteness to become apparent.  Some teeth sensitivity is to be expected, I use Sensodyne toothpaste to combat this.  Most certainly worth the asking price--especially with the $5 and $10-off coupons that float around on Amazon&#x27;s coupon book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detailed review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these on impulse, having used the normal Professional Effects strips in the past but without regularity.  I hoped to see significant, near-immediate whitening.  In that respect, the results were actually quite poor.  After taking the strips off, I noticed a number of white &#x27;splotches&#x27; on my teeth, other than these splotches the teeth looked largely the same. I was disappointed in the whitening, and a bit concerned--fortunately, a quick search indicated these are normal and would go away in several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They did--gradually.  Unhappy with the first treatment, I performed a second one three days later.  Same results, except that the splotches were even more noticeable.  Again, my teeth did not look significantly whiter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A full week later, my teeth look SIGNIFICANTLY whiter than pre-treatment.  I have had several people notice the change and compliment me on them.  At this rate, assuming continuous improvement, I suspect it would take 4-6 treatments (1-1.5 boxes) to go from a moderately yellow smile to a noticeably white one.</li>
            <li> The strips are easy to apply and wear for two hours.  I did notice results although my teeth are already pretty light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not feel any discomfort while wearing the strips, but the next day, aprox. 12 hours later, I felt quite a bit of pain.  The pain lasted an entire day.  On a scale of 1-10, I would put it at a 3.  The only time that my teeth did not hurt was while I was cycling and the wind was on my teeth.  Perhaps Crest should a face fan to the kit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll use the remaining strips due to the pain.</li>
            <li> I have used the old school 14 day whitening strips with minimal sensitivity and very good results.  I bought these 2 day strips today because I had a coupon and haven&#x27;t whitened for a couple of years.  My teeth are only slightly discolored from coffee and wine but they seem yellower to me than they used to be so I wanted to brighten them up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the strips on at 3:20pm and started cleaning up around the house.  In the middle of nursing my 6 week old daughter, I had a stabbing pain in my teeth that nearly made me knock her onto the floor.  I practically jumped off the couch.  It scared the crap out of my baby, and I quickly put her in her bouncy seat as the pains were so intense that I ran into the bathroom and ripped the strips off my teeth (they were really stuck on there!).  I looked at the clock and it was only 3:42.  I seriously only had them on for 22 minutes and it hurt sooooo bad.  I feel like I should add that I have a very high pain tolerance.  I do not normally have issues with sensitivity other than a minimal amount from using classic whitestrips in the past as I mentioned before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course then I got online and read the reviews on this site..  now I am really worried that I am going to have this intense pain all night long and possibly for days.  As if I don&#x27;t get little enough sleep with a 6 week old baby, now I might be spending what little time I would be sleeping suffering in pain :(  I am not even attempting this again, I will be requesting a refund ASAP.  Here&#x27;s hoping 22 minutes doesn&#x27;t cost me days...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get any whitening effect for me.  Now, I didn&#x27;t use all three on consecutive days or anything, but that&#x27;s not what they advertise.  Supposed to be whiter teeth in 2 hours.  Luckily I didn&#x27;t experience any of the pain that others have.  But didn&#x27;t get any whitening either.  That&#x27;s $30-something down the drain.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER written a review before, even though I almost always read product reviews before I buy anything. I regret buying this product. It was a kind of \\&quot;in the moment\\&quot; buy. I should&#x27;ve read the reviews! I followed the steps exactly like the instructions said, en everything seemed to be going well...  I took the strips off and my teeth looked slightly whiter, highlight the \\&quot;slightly\\&quot;. For the next hour my teeth felt normal, but by the second hour.. OMG! OUUUCHHH! soooo much pain! Even when I was not drinking or eating anything. I was in so much pain that my heart was racing like crazy! I tried over the counter pain killers, and nothing... The pain and discomfort were unbearable. I have NEVER had sensitive teeth. Not even a little bit. And I had made sure the strips didn&#x27;t touch my gums, so what the heck?!! The only way I was able to surpass those 12 hrs of pain was taking a sleeping pill to sleep it off!!  DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> These strips really cannot be worn outside of your house.  They are visible and it is hard to talk, so read a book or magazines for an hour.</li>
            <li> 10 year veteran at teeth whitening.  I use a sensitive teeth toothpaste and have never suffered more than some mild sensitivity with any other over-the-counter or professional product I have ever used ~ till now.  YIKES!  I wore the strips today (upper and lower) per instructions from 1-3PM. They were easy to apply and remove.  Two hours after removal the pain began; stabbing and deep aching even down to my jawbone. It is now midnight and 6 Aleve painkillers later and I doubt I will get any sleep tonight.  I may not be able to eat tomorrow.  How much whiter are my teeth?  A bit, but not enough to justify this pain by a longshot. I am returning the unused portion of this product for a refund.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if these strips made my teeth any whiter or not.  It doesn&#x27;t matter, because I will never be using them again.  I have used other Crest whitestrips before and only had some sensitivity.  When I used this, I got a very sharp pain deep in several of my teeth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to say whether these are better or worse than the once-a-day variety, because it&#x27;s tough to judge whitening.  I will say that I did not notice a big difference, which was disappointing.  I think that what they give you in ease of use they lose in the perception of whitening, though I don&#x27;t have studies to say they actually fall short.  So, while it&#x27;s possible that I&#x27;m simply over emphasizing the feeling of accomplishment for strips which require a few days use, I&#x27;m going back to those rather than keep using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re not bad, but I&#x27;d expected \\&quot;express\\&quot; strips to give more of a \\&quot;wow\\&quot; when I was done.</li>
            <li> I saw some whitening but I don&#x27;t think its enough that anyone else would notice. The pain is pretty unbearable. It hurt just a little when they were on but mostly unnoticeable. Now, 5 hours later, the pain is just intensifying. I&#x27;ve already taken 4 advil and it hasn&#x27;t touched the pain. I do have fairly sensitive teeth, but I never expected pain like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a non smoker, but I do drink coffee a few times a week so my teeth are a bit yellowish. I&#x27;ve tried other whitening products like 5 minute whitening, and more recently Rembrandt 2 hour whitening (which I could not complete because it burned my gums so badly). Anyway I decided to try Crest Advance 2 hour white strips because of the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)Their expensive(over $50 at CVS) so I thought it would be a superior product(wrong)&lt;br /&gt;2)It promises results in only 2 hours which was basically it&#x27;s best feature...&lt;br /&gt;3)It comes with a year supply...lol which happens to be 4 strips sets in a box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product DID NOT whiten my teeth. It did however leave white spots on them....which the directions do mention that they will go away within a few hours...it&#x27;s been 24 so far and they look the same. The white spots look horrible....and they actually highlight the yellow-ish tone of my teeth and make it look MUCH MUCH worse!!!! :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do continue to have some minor sensitivity which is expected, and had 1 quick sharp pain in my tooth while using the strips but other then that they were comfortable and easy to use...the results just suck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. Seriously you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> After having this for two hours my teeth weren&#x27;t whiter.  It has been 9 hours since I removed the strips and I am still in pain.  I have never experienced having sensitive teeth before, but this product just caused me to experienced so.  This is a total waste of 1. time 2. money 3. and definitely not worth the pain.  I regret to have bought this product.</li>
            <li> I used this product twice and barely noticed a difference in the color of my teeth. Not worth the extra price you pay for \\&quot;2 hour whitening.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I used the Crest 3-D White 2-Hour Express Whitestrips just once and I could see the difference in my teeth already. Most of the coffee stains have disappeared. It does make your teeth a little bit sensitive for a few days after each use.</li>
            <li> So... I wish I would have read reviews on this product BEFORE using it, because I have very sensitive teeth. I applied the 2-hour express whitestrips a few hours ago, and during the actual whitening process, I felt no discomfort, which led me to believe that I would have no sensitivity to the product. However, three hours later and my teeth hurt like the dickens. It&#x27;s just a constant dull pain with extremely painful bolts of pain when I eat or drink. My teeth are significantly whiter now, but the pain at the moment doesn&#x27;t feel worth it. Had I read the reviews about the sensitivity beforehand, I would have returned the product. Ouch!</li>
            <li> I bought this on impulse. I did my first treatment two days ago. A little bit before the 2 hours was up, I thought I&#x27;d see what other people thought of them. (I know, why would I try this without checking reviews first? Argh...) Started reading the reviews here and was horrified -- it seemed like way too many people complained about serious pain afterward and it was too late for me to not do the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off the strips when the 2 hours was up, brushed my teeth thoroughly, and then waited in apprehension. One hour, okay. Two hours (several reviewers said the pain hit two hours afterward), still okay. Went to bed, wondering if I was going to wake up in the night in pain. Woke up the next morning, still okay. It&#x27;s now been more than 48 hours and I think it&#x27;s pretty safe to say that the Express Strips did not cause me any pain, not even a bit of sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teeth whiter? A bit. I&#x27;ve never done teeth whitening before and wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but after years of smoking, I didn&#x27;t think it would be dramatic and it wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ll say there are safer options to whiten the teeth than using those drastic strips. It is way too much to take especially for someone who has senstivite teeth. I have read reviews that it crates so much pain afterwords and can fully agree wth it - and you know its the kind of pain that creeeps on and likes to suprise so you gonna be on you tippy toes at least 2 days afterwords. I felt it mostly like hte shoots of pain to various parts of the treated teeth - will not recommend those strips, however I used the other 14 day strips and the pain was more contniues and much more bearable. If you do have to do it go with the ones that go for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used Crest Whitestrips many times and love the professional effects.  I tried the 2 hour last night and my teeth were whiter! Although, in the instructions it tells you to press onto the front of your teeth before applying to the backs. I truly believe this is one of the most important steps. I did use this method, but realized I didnt press hard enough around my gum line. Although the product did whiten my teeth, they are slightly more whiten where I pressed down. I know you are only supposed to use these strips once every 3 months, but I think I am going to try them again in a day or so to get a more noticeable effect. It did whiten my teeth, but it was not as noticable as one might think. I wouldn&#x27;t say that I have sensitive teeth either and I am still feeling the effects of the whitening. It doesnt hurt really, but there is some feeling in them which is not normal.  I would overall give this product a C. It did the job, but not to the full potential.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews posted here I was originally afraid to use the 2 hour whitening because of the tooth and gum pain reported by other users.  But after planning ahead ahead and buying Advil and the gum numbing gel that others had talked about  I have to say I am very glad I did use them.  I am 46 with heavy tea stains on my teeth and after using the whitening strips my teeth are very white again.  I tried to make sure there was minimal overlap with my gums.  I did not experience any of the gum pain or tooth pain experienced by some other users.  There was a slight ache afterward but it was the same feeling I get when I have my teeth cleaned during my annual checkup at the dentist.  I would recommend the 2 hour whitestrips and plan on using them again in 3 months for the next treatment.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in order to whiten my teeth. Worse mistake ever !! I finally use one pack yesterday, this morning woke up with the worse sensitivity on my teeth, and to make matters worse, i have crack lines on my teeths and 3 white (really bright)dots on my front tooth. Crest is giving me a full refund, BUT i now have go to my dentist.</li>
            <li> wow my teeth hurt really bad after only two uses for an hour each time.  I had to go to sensitive teeth toothpaste and after several days finally got some relief.  It&#x27;s a shame as I still have all the rest of the strips left and won&#x27;t be letting them near my mouth for sure.</li>
            <li> They work great my first try butttt I recommend to use it for 45 mins topSS or else you&#x27;re teeth will be very sensitive but great product</li>
            <li> I hardly ever write reviews because quite frankly its a waste of time, but I thought I&#x27;d go ahead &amp; give this 5 stars. Most people complain about sensitivity &amp; pain, but this is my third time uses crest products, so I knew what to expect. To my surprise, I experienced NO PAIN AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;I want to add that my teeth weren&#x27;t yellow, like I previously mentioned I had used crest products before. I used the professional white strips &amp; felt like those have given me the most improvement. These just added to my smile. So if you are a first timer, I recommened you use the pro white strips first then move onto these.&lt;br /&gt;My package arrived earlier than I expected which was a plus. I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I have experience with the original Crest White Strips which I enjoyed the results from but didn&#x27;t like the amount of commitment it required or the limitations the strips put on me.  The limitations were largely improved with the advent of the Advance so the strips adhere better.  So, I was excited to try this 2 hour product.  I do think my teeth looked whiter once done.  But, I did NOT know until I opened the box that I could only use it once every 3 months.  Since I purchased this for a wedding, I was highly disappointed that it was meant for 1 use every 3 - 4 months.  I also found it difficult to keep the strips on for 2 hours - the product makes your (or mine anyway) produce A LOT of saliva and spitting is difficult with the strips on nor do I want to swallow since it tastes like the whitening elements.  I also noticed some burns, I guess, to my gums with sensitivity for a few days.  But, it did whiten as expected.  Had the 3 - 4 month thing been disclosed prior to purchase, I would have given a higher rating.</li>
            <li> I purchased the white strips for the simple fact that it was the 2-hour express, and I simply did not want to wait days for show able results. Looking back; I should&#x27;ve waited. The strip adheres pretty well to the teeth, and it doesn&#x27;t show any sign of coming off, and in fact, it adheres TOO well that when removing it from the teeth is painful and I do not have sensitive teeth. This is my second application of the white strips, and I now have spotty white patches on my teeth and in some spots you can noticeably  see the difference between the coloring of my teeth. Who wants to walk around with white patches? With that being the case; I have whitening gel that comes straight from a dentist office (as a family member worked for a dentist), and I think I will try to speed up the results by adding some of the gel to it.</li>
            <li> 2 days of sharp uncomfortable pain couldn&#x27;t eat, drink and barley slept! i have used teeth whitening gels, 30 minute strips and was never sensitive! I bought a box of 4 and i had to sell the rest. I have never write a review but i thought this was needed do not put yourself through the pain barley any results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a smoker and coffee drinker, so you can imagine the stains.  This is by far the best whitening strips I&#x27;ve ever used.  Got a 1 time treatment sample with a toothbrush I bought at the drugstore.  I was amazed all the stains were gone!  Highly recommend this product.  Don&#x27;t go through the painful dentist process, try these at least once, you&#x27;ll be amazed.</li>
            <li> I wore these strips for two hours yesterday, as directed, and my teeth are not any whiter! All I got out of these strips is painful achy teeth!</li>
            <li> I bought these strips after reading a few good reviews on amazon despite seeing several poor reviews on independant websites. These strips whiten LITTLE TO NONE! I am not a smoker and only had minimal staining so I was a good candidate but the cons out weigh the pros by far. First of they go on nicely but when the gel starts to foam it gives you a horrible sore throat. After wearing the strips for an hour and 45 mins I felt intense pain in my teeth and so did two of my friends who were trying them with me. After we took them off the pain contiued for several hours. So bad we didnt even want to talk because the slightest bit of change would make the pain that much worse. We wanted to rip our teeth out it was so bad. And the fact that it didnt whiten them at all was a huge let down after all that pain. SO SAVE YOUR MONEY AND TRY A PRODUCT THAT WORKS BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT WORTH THE MONEY OR THE PAIN!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The whitening provided by this product is pretty similar to the results after about two months of using Crest&#x27;s 3D White Toothpaste. In other words, don&#x27;t expect miracles or gleaming white chompers. This product definitely makes a difference, but nowhere near as much as the box or advertising would lead you to believe. Not surprisingly, this product does not completely renovate your smile in a single two hour application. The results, however, were noticeable, and within reason for the price -- just don&#x27;t go in looking for something magical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real problem with this product is the tooth sensitivity I experienced after using it. My teeth are normally not sensitive, but about four hours after using this product, my front teeth were in considerable discomfort. The box/documentation does mention that tooth sensitivity is a potential side effect. After using the product, and seeing the results, I would have to say that the discomfort is not really worth the marginal whitening job performed. As someone who has rarely experienced tooth discomfort/sensitivity from any food or dental hygiene product, I was surprised that these strips could cause me such an irritating amount of pain. I would recommend simply using Crest&#x27;s 3D White Toothpaste (which is excellent) or a different whitening procedure instead.</li>
            <li> Used regularly, Crest 3D whitening strips really does make a difference in the bightness of your smile. I have used this in the past and wondered why I stopped. Will not see results right away but if used consistently you will notice a difference, especially if you are a coffee or tea drinker. Would recommend this.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product. Only use every few months?  It did not get my teeth as white as a few applications the vivid product.  I will not be purchasing this again. Don&#x27;t bother, Folks!</li>
            <li> The Crest 2 Hour Express Whitestrips and 3D White Rinse is one of Crest&#x27;s many products in their at-home teeth-whitening line.  It differentiates itself from their other products, by promising noticeable whiter teeth in just two hours, with results expected to last up to three months.  The box contains four treatments, so it may be more economical than their other products, since the price per treatment is not as expensive (most other Crest products require you to use the entire box for a treatment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you get the hang of it, putting the strips on is fairly easy.  It is a clear piece of plastic with a layer of hydrogen peroxide covering the strip.  Two strips (for top and bottom teeth) come in a treatment, and lay over the teeth so that the peroxide presses down onto them and coats them. Although you can talk pretty easily with the strips on, I&#x27;ve found that the more you move your mouth around, the easier it is for the strips to slide around and move out of place.  So I advise not to talk during the treatment.  The treatment lasts two hours, which is much longer than the usual 30 minutes their other treatments take.  Although the strips are not uncomfortable, it was kind of a pain to keep them in my mouth this long, so I was thankful I only had to do it once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After removing the strips, I rinsed my mouth out with water and checked the results. I did not notice any real difference in my teeth (I left the bottom teeth completely uncovered so I could compare).  They did appear whiter, but only very slightly, and not enough to justify the product&#x27;s use.  What I did notice was a very painful sensation in my teeth from the peroxide.  I am very familiar with the Crest strips, and I take precautions, such as using [[ASIN:B001OOLF82 Sensodyne Pronamel Gentle Whitening Toothpaste, Alpine Breeze, 4-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 3)]] toothpaste for weeks prior to application, and weeks afterwords.  Even still, my teeth hurt a lot, and I had a sensation that you would expect from chewing aluminum foil with your teeth. It was very unpleasant.  I don&#x27;t know if this is caused by the hydrogen peroxide concentration, or from the longer application time, but I won&#x27;t be trying the strips out again.  I believe it was probably due to the longer application time, since I&#x27;ve used [[ASIN:B000XS3FYM Crest Whitestrips Supreme Professional Strength 84 strips]] many times in the past (higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide than normal strips) and been able to handle it.  Additionally, the whitening I did obtain, did not last anywhere near three months, and faded after about three weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do think Crest makes a very good product with their whitestrips line, I don&#x27;t think the 2-Hr Express whitening strips are a good complement to it.  For anyone who wants whiter teeth, I suggest they try the [[ASIN:B000XS3FYM Crest Whitestrips Supreme Professional Strength 84 strips]] or the [[ASIN:B00336EUTK Crest 3D White Whitestrips With Advanced Seal Professional Effects Enamel Safe Dental Whitening Kit, 20-count Carton]], and make sure to use Sensodyne during the treatment.  Additionally, don&#x27;t ever leave the strips on longer than the directions states.  It won&#x27;t make your teeth any whiter, just more painful.rom chewing aluminum foil with your teeth.

            <li> I bought this item at my local walmart. My teeth have always been yellowish. I never smiled in pictures due to it. Lately, I&#x27;ve been wanting a brighter smile since I work in customer service. I hate thinking people are judging me on my not so bright smile. As I had five minutes left on the two hours, I could definitely see that they were whiter through the strips. My self-esteem jumped on the scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth do hurt right now - kind of pulsating - but I think a couple days of pain is more than worth a great smile. I don&#x27;t have the straightest teeth, I&#x27;ll get something to straighten them one day, but having a bright smile is an amazing thing. I recommend it if you are willing to deal with some pain. It&#x27;s only my bottom ones that hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: (hope this link works)&lt;br /&gt;[…]</li>
            <li> I would NEVER wish this kind of pain upon anyone. I used the strips yesterday from 2-4 p.m. for hours afterward it was constant unbearable shooting pain in all of my teeth. It continued until about 7 a.m. this morning, needless to say I did not get even an hour of sleep due to the pain. On top of that, I saw little, if any results. I am going to request a refund.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Crests line of whitening products for 3-4 years now (from the first products where you brushed on the whitening gel to the newest Advanced Seal strips) and these are my favorite so far. I would NOT recommend these strips for first time users. You won&#x27;t get the level of results you&#x27;re looking for and they won&#x27;t last long, either. If you haven&#x27;t whitened your teeth before and it&#x27;s that important to you, invest the time in the Professional Effects or the Advanced Vivid strips. The 2-Hour Express strips obviously don&#x27;t pack the same punch in only 2 hours every three months. They are, however, GREAT for maintenance. I&#x27;ve already put in the time to whiten my teeth with the other 14-30 day treatments and 2 hours is really all I&#x27;m looking to do to freshen up my teeth. The new and improved strips are great, too. They&#x27;re wider so you get greater coverage and there are two slits in each strip which allows them to wrap around the outermost teeth without bunching.</li>
            <li> My teeth hurt for about a day and a half after using these - they aren&#x27;t typically sensitive (I can bite ice cream with no discomfort), so I was surprised. I didn&#x27;t notice a very obvious change in shade either.</li>
            <li> Worked great on 2 of us. The other was evidently allergic and had a sore mouth for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I have used the Crest 3D White 2-hour Express Whitestrips twice within the last 3 months.  The process is simple.  Application of the stips to the teeth is easy and they stay intact the entire two hours.  The taste is not bad, but I would not drink anything during this time period.  The results were slight whitening of teeth probably about two shades only.  The company advertizes that the treatment lasts 3 months.  I found that my teeth returned to thier original color within 4 weeks.  The fact that pain develops a few hours after treatment should be disclosed.  My teeth were sensitive and ached all night and I took pain medication with little relief.  Despite the pain, I would do it again but more frequently than every 3 months to hopefully get better and longer lasting results.  I have read reviews about the Crest Advanced Seal Whitening Strips which stay on 30 minutes and require more treatments within a 14 day period, that these are more effective and provide more whitening benefits.  I plan to switch to the Advanced Seal Formula for better results.  As far as cost, I bought mine in the drug store and paid $50 so definitely buy them on Amazon where they are less expensive.</li>
            <li> im actually surprised by how many negative reviews there are.  I&#x27;ve used the two hour strips and they did make a noticeable difference on my teeth, and i did not have the marbling another reviewer had mentioned.  these are at home strips so you already should know that you&#x27;re not going to get the same results as a dental visit, but they do work to an extent. granted they are pretty pricey, i am always pleased with the little boost i get from popping a pair on for a couple hours and having a noticeably whiter smile afterwards. its not blingin like diamonds, but still pretty.</li>
            <li> First, I never write reviews but these were so bad I had to warn others. I wanted to whiten my teeth for my engagement pictures this weekend. I had the 2-hour whitening kit but hadn&#x27;t used it yet, so thought I would give it a try. I put the strip on from 7:30-9:30pm and followed all directions. I took it off promptly at 2 hours, if not a few minutes before. 3 hours later in the middle of the night I woke up to feel stabbing pain in my teeth where the strips had been. I got a horrible night&#x27;s sleep and by 4:30am the pain was so bad I couldn&#x27;t get back to sleep. I got up and took some aspirin and was able to get a few hour sleep. Here I am almost 16 hours later and I still have stabbing pain in my teeth! I have never had any issues with sensitivity and I have used white strips from Crest and Oral B before. I went to the drugstore and bought a tube of Crest sensitivity toothpaste that is supposed to provide relief in minutes. I felt really stupid buying another Crest product, but I&#x27;ll see if it works. So far the pain is lessened but not gone. Oh, and my teeth seem to be a little whiter but not worth the pain! Stay away from this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 16 and have always prided myself on my white smile and always have taken really good care of my teeth. So I&#x27;ve whitened them a few times to keep them looking nice..When I saw this product was coming out, I was extremely excited since I absolutely love Crest Whitening products. (Never had I previously had a problem with using them in regard to sensitivity, spotting, etc.) This was literally one of the worst ideas of my life. I was fine for the first hour, until I started getting this literal blinding pains that literally went to the core of my teeth. The pain was so unbearable I ripped them off. I&#x27;ve shattered my knee cap and the pain was worse than that. It was so bad I literally almost passed out. I cried for the rest of the night and actually had to sleep with the heater in my face with my mouth closed because everytime i&#x27;d open my mouth the searing pain would get worse (Yes, the pain was still there even though I was completely still). I wish I could get this product banned it&#x27;s so bad. Not only that but it ruined my enamel so much that I can most likely never whiten my teeth again. I wouldnt recommend this to my worst enemy. I am literally crying right now about the regret I feel over using this product. Never use it if you know what&#x27;s good for you.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really feel I can grade the product because I only used it twice, and both times it was just annoying to have the strips in my mouth. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. It&#x27;s possible if I had finished the box I would have, but...too much trouble.</li>
            <li> I tried just ONE 2-hour strip and suffered the ENTIRE day for it!  I don&#x27;t know if my teeth are just overly sensitive (but I have used the regular 30-minute Whitestrips in the past with minimal discomfort), but my teeth ached like crazy afterwards despite popping ibuprofen throughout the day.  The pain finally went away after about 24 hours.  I would definitely NOT recommend this product unless you&#x27;re game for a day of pain!</li>
            <li> I used theses as instructed, but they made my teeth VERY sensitive for almost a full day afterwards, I ended up using oragel to calm the pain!</li>
            <li> i was able to buy two boxes for the price of one! I love these, my teeth are so white, perfect for my upcoming wedding</li>
            <li> I got these as a gift for Christmas. I opened them up and immediately wanted to try them out, so I followed the instructions and left them on for the specified 2 hours. During that duration of time, I felt several sharp, shooting pains throughout my teeth. The pains would come and go, and the box said there could be slight discomfort. This was way worse than slight discomfort. I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant change in the shade of my teeth. A couple of hours after I took the strips off, I began experiencing excruciating shooting pains throughout my teeth. The pain is almost unbearable even after taking  lot of pain medicine. I was not able to enjoy any of the delicious Christmas food from today :( DO NOT BUY THIS/USE THIS. I was and still am having TERRIBLE sharp pains in my teeth. It has been about 12 hours now and I am still in excruciating pain. SCREW THIS S***! Seriously...Don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> This was my first time attempting to use any sort of teeth whitening strips. I have to admit, after wearing the uncomfortable, gummy strips-- my teeth did look noticeably whiter! However, no more than an hour later, my bottom teeth started hurting like crazy! It&#x27;s been hours and no relief! I would NOT recommend  these strips to anyone. By something else.</li>
            <li> Price is great, Fast Delivery, I received te 2 hour Express, was hoping for the 1 hour Express.&lt;br /&gt;But you still cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to whiten my teeth but not spend a lot of money on it. I found the white strips and decided to give it a try. They SUCK!!! My teeth had no change in color and the only thing they do is make my teeth  hurt extremely bad! They feel like I am just laying ice on them. I have never had sensitive teeth until I used them. I would strongly recommend that you do not buy this product!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Not worth it, at all. I knew my teeth wouldn&#x27;t be pearly white after one use since I&#x27;ve never whitened my teeth before but I hoping at least 1 shade after a almost finishing the box. That didn&#x27;t even happen. Save your money. The shipping was fast and came within 3-4 days!</li>
            <li> This product is not for people with sensitive teeth. Really nobody should use it. I myself do not have particularly sensitive teeth, and this stuff kills them! Used the product as directed for two hours, noticed ZERO difference in whitening, and the entire next day was in pain. Cold water was not an option. Breathing was painful. It is hard to focus on anything EXCEPT for your teeth, which ache for any apparent reason. Fortunately the pain only lasted one day for me, after an extra nights rest my teeth went back to normal. I would say it might be worth it if the strips had any actual whitening effect, but in my case they did nothing. Basically I put myself through a lot of pain for nothing. Also, I&#x27;m not the type to send the product back to Crest and get my money back, because I&#x27;m just too busy and in my little bit of free time I&#x27;d rather do something else. Instead I will never again resort to using white strips. I only came on here to write this review to hopefully help a few other people out, and keep them from purchasing this product, wasting their money and putting themselves through a whole lot of unnecessary pain. Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> I picked this up last week at a local store.  The strips were easy to apply and they stayed in place for the 2 hours.  Whitening effects were almost unnoticeable, but maybe 1 or 2 shades whiter was the result.  After just one treatment, I experienced the aching pain on a couple of teeth for the remainder of the day, but that went away by day 2.  I won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> I bought these to whiten my teeth a little bit for senior pictures and they worked perfectly. Three months later, I applied them for a second session and did experience some mild shooting pains in one of my bottom teeth. Overall, I could see improvement in the shade of my teeth and they did not cause much discomfort. I purchased them at a discounted price and when they arrived, there were three extra sets of strips and a small bottle of whitening rinse in the box. Quite a nice surprise:)</li>
            <li> Seemed like the two hour works better and lasted longer!</li>
            <li> I used a pair before I went to bed. Kept waking up from an annoying dull pain, still in pain 12 hours later. There&#x27;s no noticeable whitening in my teeth. Boooo!</li>
            <li> Too expensive for doing nothing to your teeth. I regret purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I used this product twice.  The first time it made my tongue numb and after one hour my gums were hurting too much to keep them on for another hour.  I used them again a few days later, this time I had less pain and I left them on the entire 2 hours.  But later that night I had an excruciating pain in select teeth.  It felt like it was right down to the root.  I can honestly say it hurt more than my tattoo.  It didn&#x27;t last long but for not even seeing much of a difference at all in the whiteness of my teeth, it wasn&#x27;t worth the pain.  Don&#x27;t buy them... I&#x27;ll give you the leftover strips I have.  Not touching these again...</li>
            <li> I spent a night in totally agony after using the 2 hour 3D Whitestrips. It was unbelievable pain, like the dentist was zinging your nerves over and over and over.... Horrible!! Tylenol did not even begin to touch the pain. While I was unable to sleep from the endless pain, I got on the internet and found that TONS of people have had this same excruciating experience. Nice! Thanks to Crest for continuing to sell these despite obviously knowing the risk. AND, the added bonus is that my teeth didn&#x27;t look remarkably whiter. I&#x27;ve used the 20 minute version with no problem, but I would never recommend these to anyone! Use them at your own risk, or be smart and don&#x27;t use them!!</li>
            <li> If I could give it no stars I would. After using the strip for an hour the pain was horrible! I wasn&#x27;t able to sleep all night because of the intense sensitivity and I do not have sensitive teeth. I felt all of the nerves in my teeth firing over and over again.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t smoke, drink much coffee or red wine, or do other things that make my teeth overly dark, but I also do not use whitening toothpaste, so every year or so I like to give them whitening treatment. This is my first time using these and I would highly recommend them. I noticed a little sensitivity for the 3 days following, but much less than the daily treatments which I often quit half way through. The strips hold right with little waste, and the results were fabulous. I will continue to purchase these to use every 6 months or so!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to whiten their teeth to go out on a special occasion and wants instant results.</li>
            <li> I rarely ever write reviews on products, but these strips caused me a lot of pain and discomfort and didn&#x27;t even whiten my teeth. I&#x27;m now going to have to spend more money just to get rid of this distracting achy pain from my bottom teeth. Off to buy some Orajel and pain killers.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do a whole lot I was expecting much more.</li>
            <li> Does whiten teeth some.  No gum pain here, although i made sure that the strip was on teeth only and not making contact with my gums.</li>
            <li> this was a rip off for sure.  Bought it and did exactly as instructed and no change at all.  My teeth are horrible , I don&#x27;t smoke but do drink coffee.  So was hoping for something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never waste my money on gimmick teeth whiteners again.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product, It does work and better than the dentist office whitening. I can vouch for that. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It did whiten my teeth, but also brought pains to my teeth. I even feel my teeth become thinner. I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> very easy to use&lt;br /&gt;strips stay on your teeth&lt;br /&gt;a little bit of sensitivity but nothing you cannot cope with&lt;br /&gt;reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;quick delivery</li>
            <li> Does not work.  I tired the first time and did not notice a difference, so I didn&#x27;t use the 2nd set.</li>
            <li> Bought this product and used it as its instructed. It was fine the whole time I had them on but after took them off and brushed my teeth. I was dying to see the result but NONE.. And the next thing I realize is a tingling sensation in my teeth followed by severe pain. It&#x27;s killing me right now. Some are saying the pain will last a day. I hope it&#x27;s over soon. Can&#x27;t take it. Took pain killers nothing is helping.&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy this product. I&#x27;m going to send it bald to crest and get my money back.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I have used other Crest whitening strips in the past and they always work; however, results may be slow to appear and diminish quickly. I purchased the one-hour under the impression that results would be nearly immediate, but accompanied by tremendous tooth pain and sensitivity as many other review mention. Well, results were nearly immediate and I had no sensitivity at all! Bottom line: these work well and the accompanying tooth sensitivity depends upon the person.</li>
            <li> Hurt my teeth after having them on for 10 mins. My teeth hurt for about a day after that.  It&#x27;s a great product . Just not for me</li>
            <li> Uhm, not quite sure what to say about this product. Not quite sure it whitens my teeth. Can these expire? Not sure. But ones I&#x27;ve bought from a convenient store work better... maybe it&#x27;s just the one I got. But the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used whitening strips in a few years because the strips I used previously didn&#x27;t work that well.  I also didn&#x27;t want to wear the strips for 30 days to get the full result.  I tried the 3D 1-Hour Express and was pleasantly surprised after only 1 hour of wearing them, my teeth were several shades lighter.  No kidding!  I do have sensitive teeth and they were somewhat affected by the strips, but not so much that I wouldn&#x27;t use them again.</li>
            <li> awesome product much cheaper at the prices at wall mart and product works well and doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth at all</li>
            <li> i bought this product thinking oh 2 hours awesome white smile quick becuase i get very impatient with whiteners. used this product... literally took the enamel off my teeth could not eat or drink anything my teeth hurt for days and kept me up all night long. it is not worth the money i always liked the dissolving strips. its not worth the money and the pain please take my advice and my review. never buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Even when the product is used exactly as instructed, tooth sensitivity ensues a couple of hours after using them. Much like the other 100 + reviewers who stated that their teeth caused them agony after using the product, I experienced a stabbing sensation going through my bottom teeth approximately four hours after using them. It began as a dull ache, but graduated quickly. Additionally, there was little to no improvement in whiteness. As I only used them 5 hours ago, I am hoping that the pain does not get any worse. A product that has this many bad reviews has no business on the market, and an attorney would do well to file a class action lawsuit on behalf of all of the people who suffered excruciating pain due to this malicious product.</li>
            <li> works well if you have original teeth</li>
            <li> I used these one night so far and they worked better than the zoom I bought from the dentist. It will make your teeth a little sensitive for a day or so but nothing too bad. I was very impressed!</li>
            <li> Crest 3d White worked instantly.I was very skeptical about purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing it for my husband.</li>
            <li> there was a problem with the product but the provider made good with it. one should feel very confident when getting things from this provider</li>
            <li> Love to use this type of product. Just wish my teeth were as white as it said it would. Maybe i will try again...</li>
            <li> Pure agony. I&#x27;ve been in pain for over 6 hours. I&#x27;ve tried everything and I can&#x27;t even fall asleep. Ibuprofen, sensodyne, vodka... Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally write reviews. But aside from the pain, I got blotchy, minimal whitening and I can see the weakened enamel of my bottom teeth. They feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t risk it! I have used other crest whitening products and had slight sensitivity. But this is beyond that. Ouch!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews where people say it works after all 4 treatments in the box. That&#x27;s fine, but why would they say &amp;#34;removes years of stains in just one hour&amp;#34;? Nowhere on the box or instructions did it say it would require multiple uses. They are blatantly lying about their product. In no way does it &amp;#34;remove years of stains in just one hour&amp;#34;. I used them once and had very minimal results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I just tried out these Whitestrips, and they worked better than I expected.  I have sightly stained teeth from years of espresso and wine drinking, and these definitely lightened my front teeth a shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I liked:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy application w/ supplied instructions.&lt;br /&gt;- They stick on amazingly well.  Some moisture on your teeth is no problem, but too much wetness and they will not stick as well.&lt;br /&gt;- They work.  I could see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;- You can function while wearing them.&lt;br /&gt;- Minimal peroxide leakage into mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I didn&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;- My teeth were a little sensitive afterwards, where I have compromised enamel due to grinding at night.&lt;br /&gt;- Two hours requires some patience (but I doubt you&#x27;d want a stronger chemical in your mouth).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some tips for effective use:&lt;br /&gt;- Spit out excess saliva before applying.  Don&#x27;t dry your teeth though--they may stick so well you have trouble taking them off.&lt;br /&gt;- Have a snack and drink a glass of water before applying.  They say you can drink water while wearing them but I felt they worked better if I avoided that.&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t brush your teeth before applying.  Not sure why they tell you this, but I&#x27;m guessing any gum irritation will be exacerbated.&lt;br /&gt;- When removing, start from the backs of your teeth, on one side, and gently pull across to the other side.&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t use if you have any loose teeth, fillings, or crowns in the front.  These stick pretty good and you don&#x27;t want to pull off a filling when you remove them.&lt;br /&gt;- Occasionally spit out any peroxide that leaks into your mouth.  It is harmless but doesn&#x27;t taste that great.</li>
            <li> Crests keeps on coming out with different White Strip products with different packaging. I don&#x27;t know if there really is a difference between all the strips. I&#x27;m a loyal user of all the White Strip formulations. I just use whatever is on sale. They all work great for me. This one works great, too. Some people experience painful sensitivity when they use White Strips. As an avid teeth whitener, I must warn you that you will experience sensitivity with every whitening procedure whether you use strips, trays or get it done at the dentist (which I also do). To minimize the sensitivity at home, I never fully follow the instructions. If you&#x27;re using this for the first time, I recommend trying one strip for the amount of time as instructed. If your teeth feel good, keep going. If you have sensitivity, space out the application by using every other day and shorter amount of time. I use one strip for 30 to 1 hour, once a day for three days straight. Usually, my teeth get sensitive after this but they are also white enough and I stop. If I want more whitening, then I rest for 3-5 days until my teeth are no longer sensitive. Then I do another three days of whitening. I repeat until I obtain the whiteness desired. Good luck on your whitening endeavors. I really recommend this product for at home use if you don&#x27;t want to visit or pay your dentist $$$.</li>
            <li> I bought this package because I could not find my usual whitening product and figured I would give this a try. Although the strips adhered well I could taste the peroxide for the entire two hours. This minimal discomfort seemed like a fair trade for the slight whitening effect that I saw on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The biggest issue is with the \\&quot;possible side effects\\&quot; of \\&quot;tooth sensitivity\\&quot;. While I was using the product I had no pain so I thought that I was safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About an hour and a half after I took the strips off (minor improvement of whiteness) I started having stabbing pains in my teeth. Painkillers did not help and the pain got worse over the next few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be requesting a refund. If I wanted my face to hurt like this I&#x27;d sign up for Fight Club.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review of a product before, but I feel compelled to with the 2 Hour Express Whitestrips to hopefully keep someone from purchasing them.  I have used the other Crest Whitestrips in the past with very limited success so I&#x27;m not really sure why I wanted to try this product, but I did.  Very bad decision.  I left them on for exactly 2 hours as stated and did not see any difference in the whiteness of my teeth.  However, like others, about 2 hours after removing them an unbearable pain began in my teeth.  It has gradually gotten worse thoughout the day to the point it hurts to even drink room temperature water.  I have taken ibuprofen to no avail for the pain.  The other Crest Whitestrips did not cause this problem when I used them. So if you feel compelled to use a Crest product, I would try the others but stay clear of the 2 Hour Express.  The only thing it did was expressly hurt my mouth in 2 hours!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about three hours since I removed my two hour whitening strips.  I am in so much pain!  I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d be risking such an irritation.  I&#x27;m in too much pain to even notice if they worked.  I hope it stops soon!  :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried white strips before and never had the issue of extreme tooth sensitivity.  I applied the strips at 9:00 am and took them off at 10:45am.  It wasn&#x27;t until an hour later that the horrible pain started.  It is now 5:30 pm and the pain is still continuous.  I&#x27;ve tried orajel and even tylenol with codeine - nothing seems to help. I can&#x27;t eat, and even when I&#x27;m not opening my mouth, my teeth are throbbing.  Yes, there was a minor difference in color - a tad whiter, but in no way is it worth the pain! I am very disappointed in this product and would encourage others to save their money and not spend on this.  I wish I would have read the reviews prior to purchasing this product.  Buyer beware - the only thing this product does it cause you intense pain and a sleepless evening.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews either, but since it&#x27;s 4:45 in the morning and I&#x27;m in so much pain that I can&#x27;t sleep, this is what it&#x27;s come to.  I&#x27;ve used Crest white strips before, both the cheapest ones and the vivid ones, and I had experienced minimal sensitivity and fairly good results, enough to buy these because I thought they&#x27;d work even better.  Definitely not the case, I can&#x27;t see any difference and I&#x27;m in incredible pain.  I put them on at 8pm and took them off at 10pm, and around 1am I started having terrible pain.  I took 2 650mg tylenol at 2:30am and another 2 220mg motrin at 3:30am, and no help at all. I am MISERABLE right now. I do not suggest these to anyone.</li>
            <li> OUCH. What has this terrible combination of tooth whitening chemicals done to my teeth? I am in agony. About an hour after removing the strips, a tingling sensation began to grow in my teeth, and has continued on to a full blown pain fest. It&#x27;s been been 12 hours, and I feel like my nerves are exposed. When will it end? I&#x27;ll stick with average teeth. The pain in my teeth far exceeds the amount of whitening that was achieved.</li>
            <li> As expected. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> for the love of god only put these on your teeth for a half hour - 45 min tops.</li>
            <li> Great article. Come as expected.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product again. I have been using Crest whitestrips for years, and love their product. I didn&#x27;t find much value in this one though. It did whiten my teeth, but not by much. I suggest using the vivid white instead.</li>
            <li> These are good, but they will not work miracles.  You&#x27;ll probably need more than one package of these if you haven&#x27;t whitened in a while.</li>
            <li> Used this product exactly as instructions stated.  Complete waste of money. Did not brighten or whiten teeth AT ALL.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on it.</li>
            <li> These really did not whiten my teeth at all I saw no difference 😟</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  I drink a lot of red wine so this is nice to treat my teeth every 6 months.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Works. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Reviews scared me off as too many videos records pain and super sensitive teeth reported as a result haven&#x27;t tried yet</li>
            <li> I has such high hopes for these 2 hour strips ~ but I have to say that I&#x27;m dissapointed in the results.  The strips are made of a thicker plastic than other strips I&#x27;ve used by Crest, and were hard to mold to my teeth.  I like to mold them around each tooth so it gets all the in between spots, and you can&#x27;t do that w/ these.  I also read the brochure and it assures you those white spots that result from the tooth whitening will dissapear within hours of use ~~ it took mine about 3 days, and my teeth are fairly white to begin with.  I drink alot of tea &amp; coffee, so I regularly whiten my teeth ~~ I usually use Crest Pro strips, which cost quite a bit more than these.  I was hoping these would be equal to those ~~ but while they DID whiten my teeth, it was only about 2 shades, and weren&#x27;t flexible enough to suit me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never used a whitening strip before, so wanted to give &#x27;em a try.  I really wanted bright teeth for a client meeting, and my teeth really needed a brightening up.  What surprised me was that you don&#x27;t brush your teeth first. That was counter-intuitive.  I stuck in the strips, waited two hours, and saw a slight difference.  Not a lot, but some.  Well, I was in a hurry.  I used another strip four days later, and another a few days after that.  That really gave me some great looking teeth. Not blindingly white, but attractive white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that there&#x27;s gummy residue remaining on your teeth after removing the strips. I had to pick / wipe it off for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy with the strips. Sure they were supposed to be used over a few months, but I had more immediate needs.  I have slightly sensitive teeth, and these did not bother me at all.  The strips are a little strange feeling, but they did not effect my speech. There was a Peroxide taste after a few minutes. I had to hold off on eating and drinking for a couple of hours though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give &#x27;em a thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see how well these were going to work. After all if you only needed to do it every few months it had to make a huge difference compared to the daily or weekly treatments, right? Well, unfortunately that wasn&#x27;t the case.&lt;br /&gt;After two hours my teeth appeared slightly whiter, nothing that anyone noticed and I really had to look myself to see if I noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;The strips were awkward at first but after the first half hour I got used to them. I was happy to tear them off after the two hours were up.&lt;br /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t notice a major change with these, I think I&#x27;d feel better using something more often. Having little/no results and having to wait a few months for another application just seems like a waste to me.</li>
            <li> Apparently the vast majority of people who use this product don&#x27;t experience the intense pain that we unlucky few had to bear, but if you haven&#x27;t tried it, it&#x27;s not worth the risk. Trust me.&lt;br /&gt;The process of putting on the strips was simple enough and I experienced no noticeable discomfort or pain while wearing the strips so I incorrectly assumed that would be the end of it. There was a noticeable (but not immense) whitening effect. About three hours later I began to experience some intense pain and sensitivity. I managed to sleep through the worst of it, and the next morning it was alright so I figured it would be worth it, so I decided to wait a few days and try it again. This time I was unfortunately awake during the worst of it. The intense pain lasted for about seven hours and sensitivity was present for about twelve. The whitening was fairly significant, though, so I decided \\&quot;one more night\\&quot;. Big mistake. I started wearing them at 11pm last night. It&#x27;s currently eight-thirty and the pain is awful. All I have in terms of painkillers is Tylenol and it&#x27;s done absolutely nothing for the pain. I imagine aspirin or ibuprofen might help a little more. The pain started about 2 and a half hours after taking off the strips, so it&#x27;s been going for about five hours strong and no sign of letting up yet. I suppose it&#x27;s my own fault for pushing it so far knowing that it causes so much pain. Nonetheless, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone if there&#x27;s even a chance of suffering what us unlucky customers have gone through.</li>
            <li> I love these things! Whoa! They whitened my teeth 2 shades which I was kind of skeptical about. I&#x27;ve used Crest Whitestrips in the past and they have always made my teeth sensitive, these 3D Whitestrips are no different. My lower teeth are most susceptible to the pain. I&#x27;d say if you use these and have sore spots or sensitive teeth, you will feel it, even if it mild. I really like how you use these every 3 months instead of every day or every week.</li>
            <li> It does what it says, and only that. \\&quot;Noticibly whiter teeth\\&quot;. But barely noticable :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be my own fault because the impression I got from seeing the commercials and ads was that it was the same whiteness as Professional Effects. It&#x27;s not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Basically, if you use these, it&#x27;s like using the old school Crest Whitestrips (lowest level) and getting those same results in 2 hours instead of 14 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even tried using 3 of them stretched a few days apart but it made no difference. Stick with Professional Effects, same price, and make your teeth SO much whiter.</li>
            <li> My teeth still hurt and they are not any whiter. I should have just paid someone to punch me in the mouth instead.</li>
            <li> Hey i just tried the strips and believe it or not they work. i was scared to try them because of certain reviews but \\&quot;dont believe the hype\\&quot;. It DOES NOT BURN\\&quot; OR ANYTHING. There great.. try it for your self and see. My teeth were yellowish now there white! trust me a great buy. and my teeth or gums do not hurt not one bit!!!</li>
            <li> I tried these white strips last week. They&#x27;re definitely NOT worth the $50. First, my teeth looked exactly the same after I used them. Second, and most importantly, they hurt like hell. I didn&#x27;t feel the pain until the 2 hours were almost up, but when it kicked in, I was shocked! Over-the-counter painkillers didn&#x27;t help. It felt like the surfaces of my teeth were being drilled into. Not an exaggeration. The box makes a mention that the strips sometimes cause sensitivity, but doesn&#x27;t include the details. I couldn&#x27;t eat or drink anything for at least 12 hours, and I continued to feel stabs of pain throughout the rest of the week. The only positive point was that I was able to return them for a full refund even though I had used one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend putting yourself through insane discomfort for zero visible results.</li>
            <li> These just don&#x27;t work as advertised.  I&#x27;ve used various types of over the counter whitening strips and these are nothing special.  I suppose I could see a little bit of whitening, but it wasn&#x27;t worth the expensive price.  Go professional or use some more powerful over the counter strips, not these.</li>
            <li> These strips are better than the regular 14 day ones.  They have a better seal and do not seem to have as much \\&quot;goo\\&quot; on them.  They did still make my teeth feel a little sensitive though.  I used a sensitive toothpast for about a week before and a few days after.  My teeth were only sore the day after I used the strips.  I think they did a good job whitening as well.  I am hoping for even better results in 3 mths.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got stained teeth from years of antibiotic treatment for acne as a youth. This Crest White 1-hour Express whitened my teeth &amp; there was a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> They work good but here is the trick to avoid pain. Brush your teeth 1 hour before actual putting them on, Then after your done using then avoid brushing your teeth for as long as possible.Just rinse it of gently if needed. I do not know why they do not include this info in the instructions.</li>
            <li> Before I comment on the whitening, a lot of the bad reviews on here claim that they left the strip o for 2 hours, but only 1 hour is recommended. They stick well to your teeth and are easy to apply. While waitig on time to be up you can feel something happening to your teeth, butit doesn&#x27;t hurt. I took off the strips and it wasn&#x27;t that noticeableof a whitening, but still.</li>
            <li> The shipping from Amazon was on-time, as always. My teeth arent very yellow/brown but I dont consider them white either. I have used this only once, so may be this product needs multiple treatments to show results (I will update my review later). But unlike some other whiteners I have used, this product definitely affected the enamel on my teeth. After first \\&quot;application\\&quot;, everything seemed fine until that evening. My teeth have now become quite sensitive to air, water and all such. I did follow the instructions carefully, and they dont seem to mention anything about that.&lt;br /&gt;No wonder that they dont want you using the whiteners more than once a month&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any visible effect from any of the longer-term (7-day or 1-month) Whitestrips kits, so I was hopeful for this kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good:&lt;br /&gt;- The gel is thick and sticky, and the strips stay on your teeth really well, without as much foamy peroxide goo leakage as the other strips.&lt;br /&gt;- There was a slight lightening of my tooth color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad:&lt;br /&gt;- Even though I carefully pressed the strips into the spaces between teeth and against the gumline, the lightening effect was concentrated on the middle of the tooth.  The edges and gumline remained the original yellowish color.&lt;br /&gt;- The \\&quot;slight temporary pain or sensitivity\\&quot; the package mentions turned out to be equivalent to getting a mouthful of new fillings and then having a set of braces tightened.  Every tooth the strips touched hurts like crazy.  I have a mild cold sensitivity because of fillings, but overall, I do not have very sensitive teeth.  These strips gave me a near-migraine level head/neck/jaw ache and I&#x27;m still waiting for the pain to fade 7 hours after taking the strips off.  Advil and Aleve haven&#x27;t been able to touch it.  I&#x27;ll be giving the other 3 doses in the box away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the company means by \\&quot;noticable whitening\\&quot;, but there is no obvious whiteing of the teeth after using one strip for two hours.  The alternative twenty count whiteners do work somewhat.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the two hour version. One option might be using one strip for two hours one day and then another strip for two hours the next day. Just a suggestion. The recommendation is to use one two hour strip every three months.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive teeth, and i did experience sensitivity / discomfort after removing the strips as directed.  to me it was a nerve pain like what you face when you have your braces tightened or something. the sensitivity lasted around 5 hours afterwards.  I took a couple of advil and it lessened. If you have sensitive teeth and a low pain tolarance, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. Also I would make sure you do it on a day or night when you don&#x27;t have plans to socialize or talk too much. i found myself drooling a little and talking funny with the soreness for those hours afterwards. i woke up feeling perfectly fine this morning. I feel like this product is worth it, I can see my teeth are whiter and its worth the convenience of not having to do it night after night for me. i will do it again in 3 months.</li>
            <li> If Hell were a place, right now it would be residing on my teeth and gums. They are on fire, and pitchforks are stabbing me constantly. Using these strips was the WORST mistake I have made in a very, very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the negative reviews and thought, nah, that won&#x27;t happen to me. I was so wrong. SO SO wrong. My pain began immediately after removing the strips with a dull ache that turned into a throbbing pain, and then morphed slowly into the level of torture that I am currently experiencing. You know those horror movies where people pull out their own teeth? That&#x27;s run across my mind as an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried these steps to get the pain to subside:&lt;br /&gt;--The first thing that I did was to really examine my pain level on a scale. On a scale of of &amp;#34;nah, I&#x27;m good&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;I might be driven mad by pain&amp;#34; I am at the &amp;#34;I have been driven mad, someone PLEASE find me the pliers RIGHT NOW&amp;#34; level.&lt;br /&gt;--I took a Vicodin that I had left over from a surgery. I figured, Vicodin helps with surgeries, I&#x27;ll be fine. It is doing ABSOLUTELY nothing, and I am shocked.&lt;br /&gt;--I tried Aleve, same story. I simply cannot believe these painkillers are like popping sugar pills.&lt;br /&gt;--I thought I was being &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; by purchasing the new Crest Sensitive Strips (not the whitening ones). They are supposed to target sensitive teeth and gums. Well, they are about a centimeter and a half long, so I had to use a total of eight. Four on the front teeth, four on the back. It dulled the pain while they were on, but afterward, the pain came rushing back like riptide.&lt;br /&gt;--Next, I tried Oragel Severe. That stuff is pretty gooey, but it provided relief for about 30 minutes. Then, the pain returned and the stabbing was worse. Is it rebelling against my attempts? Do these strips have intelligence????&lt;br /&gt;--Anbesol? Would Anbesol work? I got the liquid kind and it was messy to apply. It didn&#x27;t work for even one minute. Don&#x27;t bother, all it will make you do is drool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m out of options. All I can do is sit here and wish that I could morph time. I can&#x27;t find any review comments on how long this pain lasts for others, but I know that I am not alone. I should have listened to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most tragic part, they didn&#x27;t even work. At all. MAYBE one shade (if the lighting is good). So here I am, in my own personal iron maiden for absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be very honest. The pain I am in right now is worse than the pain I experienced when my appendix decided it wanted to be forcibly evicted from my body (and I never thought I would say that about anything). It&#x27;s all I can think about, it&#x27;s all I can focus on, I can&#x27;t even watch television to try to pass the time. I took the strips off exactly 10 hours ago and I do not know what to do. HOW ARE THESE ON THE MARKET? In what world did Crest get these to pass any sort of testing. POOR FORM. I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked if they end up banned, or if a class action lawsuit is formed (keep me in the loop if anyone hears about that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s physical pain, but there&#x27;s also mental pain associated here. I&#x27;m a tough cookie. I can take physical pain. When pain is so severe that it causes your brain to scream, that&#x27;s not good. I am not exaggerating about how bad these hurt, or their lack of whitening. I WANT SOMEONE ELSE TO READ THIS REVIEW AND TO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE THAT I DID. LISTEN- THEY ARE AWFUL- RUN AWAY NOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone from Crest reads this, you need to yank these off the shelves. Seriously, I am convinced that a conspiracy was behind their approval in the first place.o is sit here and wish that I could morph time. I can&#x27;t find any review comments on how long this pain lasts for others, but I know that I am not alone. I should have listened to everyone!  The most tragic part, they didn&#x27;t even work. At all. MAYBE one shade (if the lighting is good). So here I am, in my own personal iron maiden for absolutely nothing.  I will be very honest. The pain I am in right now is worse than the pain I experienced when my appendix decided it wanted to be forcibly evicted from my body (and I never thought I would say that about anything). It&#x27;s all I can think about, it&#x27;s all I can focus on, I can&#x27;t even watch television to try to pass the time. I took the strips off exactly 10 hours ago and I do not know what to do. HOW ARE THESE ON THE MARKET? In what world did Crest get these to pass any sort of testing. POOR FORM. I wouldn&#x27;t be shocked if they end up banned, or if a class action lawsuit is formed (keep me in the loop if anyone hears about that).  There&#x27;s physical pain, but there&#x27;s also mental pain associated here. I&#x27;m a tough cookie. I can take physical pain. When pain is so severe that it causes your brain to scream, that&#x27;s not good. I am not exaggerating about how bad these hurt, or their lack of whitening.

            <li> Seems to have worked. You just have to keep it up.</li>
            <li> These absolutely work, leave on longer for even better results. Trick I learned, search for remineralization gel on Amazon (Sunshine brand). It&#x27;s under 6 bucks for more than you&#x27;ll need. Brush your teeth with it for 5-10 minutes after whitening, then rub a little into teeth. You will have zero sensitivity, just read the reviews on it and don&#x27;t hesitate. These white strips and professional effects both work great it&#x27;s just most people don&#x27;t stick with them due to the pain.</li>
            <li> The product was very easy to use.  Stayed in place much better than the others that I have tried.  Did actually have some trouble taking strips off. Teeth were much whiter. I have not used a second time because of having some discomfort the next day,which did not last but a couple of hours. Yes I will use them again.</li>
            <li> This product works faster and stays put better than the other strips.</li>
            <li> Our family dentist loves these strips and recommends them to her patients, but for us they didn&#x27;t work very well. After spending the money, I was extremely disappointed in the lack of results we achieved. I&#x27;m not even sure if the strips worked AT ALL or if I just imagined they did to justify the expense in my mind. I&#x27;d much rather spend more money and have my teeth whitened by my dentist. It&#x27;s costly, but at least it&#x27;s not money down the drain.</li>
            <li> great movie, very entertaining!</li>
            <li> Misleading-made it sound like we were getting 4 treatments and there were only 2.</li>
            <li> After finally finishing my box of four within the last year, I can say that this is a great product. I tried the ones you use every morning and evening for two weeks and they just don&#x27;t work with my life. I forget to do them! With these, you put them on for 2 hours and go to bed and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a couple days to see the effect, but if you do it again around 5 weeks later, you&#x27;ll definitely see a difference. I finished my fourth one last night and my teeth are WHITE which feels great. (Before, my dentist would ask me if I smoked since my teeth were so yellow!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADVICE: Take Tylenol before bed. As soon as it wears off, take more. These are painful. Like biting into really cold icecream for 24 hours, painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cheapest you&#x27;ll find them is here, I&#x27;ve looked and compared prices. They&#x27;re worth it for me. Beauty is pain!</li>
            <li> I bought these strips only a few days ago,&lt;br /&gt;and after reading all the negative reviews and&lt;br /&gt;trying it myself, I felt the need to write&lt;br /&gt;my own review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a 30 year old male. I quit smoking some 6 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;I am an occasional wine and vodka cranberry drinker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth were never terribly yellow or stained, but they&lt;br /&gt;weren&#x27;t as white as I would like them to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also been using the Crest 3D whitening toothpaste for&lt;br /&gt;a week and a half before trying the strips if that makes&lt;br /&gt;a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the reviews, I was a bit nervous about&lt;br /&gt;trying these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put them on as instructed, and left them&lt;br /&gt;on for 2 hours 15 minutes just to make sure&lt;br /&gt;that they would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed the difference immediately upon removing them.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth were remarkably whiter.  I felt absolutely NO&lt;br /&gt;pain during or after the process.  Just a little tingling and&lt;br /&gt;sensitivity for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also brushed my teeth and used Scope mouthwash after&lt;br /&gt;each time I used the strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I slept that night with the expectation that I would&lt;br /&gt;wake up in terrible pain in a few hours or the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went about my next day with no pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought the 5 minute daily strips as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put on a 5 minute strip that afternoon of Day 2 for&lt;br /&gt;10 minutes just to see if there is anymore sensitivity... None.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the 2 hour express strip the evening of Day 2 to&lt;br /&gt;see if I could get my teeth whiter.  Brushed afterwards again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the same.  My teeth were noticeably even more white&lt;br /&gt;then after Day 1, and again no pain.  I was starting&lt;br /&gt;to think that all the negative reviews online was just&lt;br /&gt;the concentration of people who had terrible experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 3 I woke up with my normal brushing routing and my&lt;br /&gt;teeth were still very white.  I didn&#x27;t use any strips Day 3,&lt;br /&gt;but still noticed the bright whiteness endured the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is day 4, I just put on one more 2 hour Whitening strip&lt;br /&gt;about 20 minutes ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this trial goes as well as the previous ones, then&lt;br /&gt;my teeth should be very white, just where I want them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever experience more yellowing in the months down the road,&lt;br /&gt;I will be sure to get more of these amazing little strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as a side note, aside from my occasional alcohol intake,&lt;br /&gt;I eat extremely healthy.  Mostly grilled or steamed seafood,&lt;br /&gt;fresh fruits and veggies.&lt;br /&gt; No candy, junk food, fast food, foods with alot of sugar,&lt;br /&gt;no coffee, etc.  Maybe that is why these strips are working&lt;br /&gt;so well for me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knows.  It works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend these strips to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adaml noticed the bright whiteness endured the whole day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is day 4, I just put on one more 2 hour Whitening strip&lt;br /&gt;about 20 minutes ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this trial goes as well as the previous ones, then&lt;br /&gt;my teeth should be very white, just where I want them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I ever experience more yellowing in the months down the road,&lt;br /&gt;I will be sure to get more of these amazing little strips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as a side note, aside from my occasional alcohol intake,&lt;br /&gt;I eat extremely healthy.  Mostly grilled or steamed seafood,&lt;br /&gt;fresh fruits and veggies.&lt;br /&gt; No candy, junk food, fast food, foods with alot of sugar,&lt;br /&gt;no coffee, etc.  Maybe that is why these strips are working&lt;br /&gt;so well for me?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who knows.  It works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend these strips to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adam</li>
            <li> The old, regular Crest WS worked good for me even though it made my teeth very sensitive.  I would use it once a month and it would keep my teeth white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it for a while and saw this 2 hour one at WalMart.  I decided to pick it up despite the hefty price.  I read the directions and after careful reading of warnings (which were really none), I put this on for 2 hours.  Towards the last hour, I felt like my tongue was beaten \\&quot;eaten\\&quot; up alive, but I still kept it on.  After the 2 hour was up, I anxiously removed the strip to see if it would reveal a brighter, whiter teeh.  However, when I removed the strips, I noticed that I had white marks on my teeth.  I thought, no problem, let me just brush it off.  That didn&#x27;t work.  I then used one of those dental metal tools to scrape it off.  That&#x27;s when I realize that I now have a chip in one of my tooth.  I also noticed the rest of my teeth \\&quot;cracking.\\&quot;  It literally has a crack line on my teeth now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has damaged my teeth permanently and I am scared that my teeth will crack and be gone for good after just using this damn product.  This product should be taken off the market.  I would sue if I could, but I should probably save the money to prepare to buy some veneers should my teeth finally crack all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this sounds like a joke, but it is not.  I did have sensitive teeth before, but never have I experienced anything this awful.  My teeth/smile was my number one physical feature and now it is ruined.  I will NEVER try to whiten my teeth ever again.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work, May be for an hour</li>
            <li> Used it 4 days before prom and got decent results for being a rush. Definitely took the stains off of the surface of my teeth</li>
            <li> Good price, product works well</li>
            <li> This product visibly whitened my teeth for about a week, after that it seemed like the whiteness was almost &amp;#34;stripped&amp;#34; off of my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It left my teeth a strange fleshy-brown color.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness I didn&#x27;t try keeping the strip on longer. My teeth don&#x27;t look any different and about an hour after I took off the strips, pain kicked in. I feel like knives are being continuously jabbed into each individual tooth that the strip touched - this has been going on for 3 hours so far. Will NEVER use the 2-Hr express strips again.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find these on your site, and such a good price. I will continue to purchase these as needed.</li>
            <li> Love these, I&#x27;ve used them before.  So glad they have improved the sticky stuff so that the strips don&#x27;t move around, they stay put.  They are one hour strips.</li>
            <li> If your teeth are at all sensitive to dentist visits, do not, I repeat, DO NOT use this product.&lt;br /&gt;Your teeth will be in excruciating pain for hours.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth aren&#x27;t even that sensitive, and I feel like I need prescription painkillers.</li>
            <li> This strips were so easy to use. Just apply these as directed and they would dissolve - no removal necessary. Did not get as much whitening as I expected, but could definitely tell a difference.</li>
            <li> Okay so i got this product, left it on my teeth for two hours as directed, and i felt a little tinglying but not very much. it wasnt painful or anything. then when i took it off i noticed a suttle difference in whiteness, i mean it was a little whiter but not by that much. i think more the next day it looked a little whiter than before. Yeah my teeth had mild sensitivity but not too crazy i could still eat and drink and stuff. But then, my stupid self, i didn&#x27;t really follow direction and i put another strip two days later (even though it said to do it once every three months, i just wanted it to be whiterr) and now my teeth hurt &#x3D;[ but i know its a result of using them within two days in stead of three months. but anyways. ya my teeth are pretty white right now. hopefully in the next couple days it will whiten up even more and my teeth will stop being so sensitive. but anyways, i heard that the other whitening strips were better than the 2 hour express ones, so if you really need to whiten your teeth go for that one. this one is for like if you just wanna suttley whiten up your teeth. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I purchased the express strips last week before I read the reviews.  After reading the reviews I was going to send the strips back because of the poor reviews.  I&#x27;m so glad that I didn&#x27;t.  I used the express strips today and they worked well.  They stayed on nicely and my teeth are incredibly white after the two hours.  I didn&#x27;t experience any of the sensitivity as some other users have.  After using the express strips I will no longer use any of the other Crest strips, although, they work well too.  Love the convenience of only using for 2 hours every 3 months.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product! I don&#x27;t have sensitive teeth and this product has caused every tooth in my mouth to have shooting pain. I only left the product on for one hour, thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t be painful like it had been on the first application, and still it has caused me SO MUCH PAIN! This product sucks! I will not be using it again and will give the remaining strips to someone I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> Made my teeth slightly whiter but 2 hours seems like a long time to wear them. Some reviews said their teeth hurt, I use Sensodyne pronamel gentle whitening toothpaste and it really helps sensetive teeth. I don&#x27;t think I would use these strips again.</li>
            <li> I just tried these and the pain is so awful that I cannot sleep! If it would at least whiten my teeth then that would be one thing, but it doesn&#x27;t whiten and extreme pain! Do not buy these, they are not worth the price tag and the side effects (that crest will tell you is minimal).</li>
            <li> I should have read the reviews before trying these white strips.  They went on okay, and I was able to leave them on the whole 2 hours without much fuss.  But ... OMG ... after taking them off, pain pain pain. I have somewhat sensitive teeth, but - was lulled into a false sense of security by the lack of pain after using the 30-min 14-day strips (no pain with those).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2-hour strips did not make a noticeable improvement on my teeth, and the after-shock still has me awed. Just hoping this pain goes away within the 12 hours that the other reviewers mentioned. Do not recommend these 2-hour strips.</li>
            <li> I love these!!! I have used some many whitening systems and have not found the effects as this product in one application. Obviously people will have different sensitivities. If you are sensitive to cold and hot beverages....you will have sensitivity to most whitening products. I am 51 years old. My teeth are an average white. These strips have increased the color FOR ME drastically. I would recommend this product. They do also offer almost a test drive toothbrush with one application of the 1 hour express for 19.99 sold at CVS. That is how I got hooked. I then went ahead and purchased the box. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> These did not work at all. There was literally no difference before and after. I do not suggest buying them because of this.</li>
            <li> This product is so painful!!!!! Any results are not worth the pain of barely being able to talk because my teeth hurt so bad. I used they as they were directed to. Did not go over 2 hours of having them on and I still will never use them again. I used the 30 minute strips in the past and they worked great. I got fast and noticeable results from those.</li>
            <li> I never take the time to write a review..I&#x27;m very lazy and don&#x27;t care very much to complain.  However, I am writing this because I feel this product should have a huge red warning label on it! I have whitened my teeth using strips and paint on whiteners with no pain and minimal results. I never have had sensitive teeth or tooth pain, not even a cavity! So I decided to try this product hoping to see a bright white smile in a couple hours. I had no pain while the strips were on, but after taking them off every tooth in my mouth was on fire. My teeth were barely whiter, and the pain brought me to tears. No eating, drinking, breathing through my mouth for 8 hours. Absolute agony, my teeth are slightly sensitive to this day. Not worth it. Go to your dentist!</li>
            <li> I have used the normal white strips from Crest without an issue, but just used the 1 hour express over the weekend and it was an absolutely horrible experience. I don&#x27;t know if it is due to hypersensitive teeth, which I have never had a problem with before, or some other reaction, but the morning after I used the whitestrips until about 24 hours later I had excruciating pain in my gums. I will not do this process ever again and strongly recommend caution before using it if you think you could potentially have sensitive teeth. It says that you could have mild sensitivity in the box, but this was unbearable pain for 24 hours and not worth the results which were little to non from a whitening standpoint. Just a warning!!</li>
            <li> used this a month ago and my teeth are still white and clean, they feel so fresh all the time.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that doesn&#x27;t cause sensitivity once removed. While it&#x27;s on however, I did feel slight discomfort. For people that have dull or yellow teeth, it will do the trick. For those that have white teeth but want &amp;#34;celebrity white&amp;#34; teeth, you should know that this won&#x27;t get you there.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you want to lose weight. Use these strips and your teeth will hurt so bad you can&#x27;t eat! I open my mouth to talk and my breath hurts my teeth. PLUS my teeth aren&#x27;t any whiter. Lammme.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t make my teeth whiter, they made them practically see-through.  Yes they removed the stains a bit, but my teeth hurt SO much I can&#x27;t even drink water without wanting to cry.  I advise no one buy these unless you have a HIGH pain tolerance.  It claimed the pain would last an hour or two tops.  6 hours later, my teeth hurt just as much, despite pain killers and every other home remedy I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I started the treatment at 10 am and removed the strips at 11:30  All was fine until about 3 hours later when I noticed some zinger type pains in one tooth. At about 5 pm I started getting a throbbing pain in every tooth that was treated and by 9 pm I was grimacing and moaning in pain.  I have taken 4 Advil and just finished my 4th glass of wine in desperation to dull the intense pain. I doubt I will be sleeping at all tonight. My teeth look slightly lighter but this pain is very intense and almost intolerable.&lt;br /&gt;I had pain like this several years ago with some crest strips but as hoping the advances would make the treatment less painful. I was dead wrong.</li>
            <li> My teeth are old and now they are getting white.  Oh joy.  Thanks for your help and happy new year</li>
            <li> Thanks&lt;br /&gt;All ok&lt;br /&gt;Best regards</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  Was excited about whitening my teeth for the first time. The strips didn&#x27;t stick well and were a little messy. I left them on for exactly two hours....and revealed the same teeth I had before. Disappointed. Perhaps it just didn&#x27;t work for me. I didn&#x27;t experience any pain at all though. However, I wont purchase these again and save my $40 on something else.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B005TI7EWK Crest 3D White Intensive Professional Effects, 7 Count]]  Decided to try out the Intensive Professional Effects 3d White Strips, and without a doubt, it was the worst mistake I have ever made.  I used them for 3 days with minor discomfort.  After the 4th treatment I decided to stop because I was having sensitivity issues.  About 14 hours after stopping I started having horrible pain in two of my teeth.  It felt as though someone was drilling into my teeth, and the pain was shooting through my entire mouth.  I tried everything from Anbesol to taking Asprin and Aleve.  Nothing worked.  The pain got worse.  I&#x27;m now sitting here 60 hours after my last use and I am still in horrible pain.  I now am on my way to see my dentist because I can&#x27;t take another night without sleep.  Hopefully they can help but I would suggest that no one ever uses these things</li>
            <li> It took about 2 weeks to get my home. Fairly speak, it is kind of effective. I can see my teeth became a little bit whiter after use it, however my teeth are so sore after use since this pain never happened before. I think my teeth may be sensitive to this product.</li>
            <li> This works pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;But I would usw Luter white. My teeth were diffucult to whiten at home.&lt;br /&gt;The Luster White actually gave me good results...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strips are ok for inbetween treatments</li>
            <li> These strips are terrible. I don&#x27;t notice a difference in my teeth at all.  My teeth are soooooo sensitive they are killing me.  What a waste of money!!</li>
            <li> These were FANTASTIC! I could see immediate difference after 2 hours. These arrive on time, as expected, no messy clean up, and user friendly.</li>
            <li> Rapid response to order.pleased with product</li>
            <li> The strips worked wonderfully...I used as directed and was very impressed. The product shipped quickly as well. Thanks I will use this service again!</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;  I kept putting off writing a review hoping my teeth would finally get whiter using the 3D polish after whitening for 2hours but it didn&#x27;t happen. In the past I have used the 3D white 10 days instead of the 2 day express. After day 5 I always have had the most white teeth that people would stop and comment while I was shopping, on an elevator etc. and then i would finish the 10 days and wait almost 2 years before having to do again. This time I thought the two days must be incredible and I was so excited about the great price which was off the charts. Well, I did the last week of December and hoping I can do again before waiting 3 months to do again. Is it possible to do another treatment earlier without damaging my teeth? My teeth have never been so yellow in my life and makes me so sad. Sorry for the negative comment but have to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;Sue Fushpanski</li>
            <li> I bought these a few days ago and have been pleasantly surprised. I drink a lot of coffee, tea, and occasionally red wine. I used to drink more red wine in the past, but it is contraindicated with some of the medication I take now so I do not drink wine as much as I did (usually a glass every night with dinner...sometimes more on the weekends when out with family or friends)...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked over a lot of different options (from the more gentle Crest options [1 strip a day for 5 minutes every day monthly] [[ASIN:B00584IBIQ Crest 3D White Whitestrips with Advanced Seal 2 Hour Express 18 Month Supply,6 Count]] to the more aggressive options [bleach and high intensity gels with a whitening light used 20 times every 2 minutes] [[ASIN:B007R6E03S Luster Premium White At Home Tooth Whitening Light System]]) and thought this was the best option for me. I figured I would use it at night while watching TV, in the office, or maybe whip them on and watch a movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall sensation is a bit odd: after 5-7 minutes you definitely notice a light tingling feeling near the gums as the gel activates and applies to your teeth. It is not uncomfortable but is something that you notice. After 20-30 minutes you will notice there is a lot of saliva in your mouth. When possible I spit it out rather than swallowing. There is no unpleasant taste, but the frothy foam type substance tends to bubble up around the gums...but it&#x27;s not that bad. It comes off easily when you rinse and brush your teeth after the 2 hours is up. I did not have any \\&quot;marbling\\&quot; or \\&quot;white spots\\&quot; as some have indicated (as well as the box). I do not have any cracks on the enamel nor have I had any cavities in the past...so perhaps I was lucky. I also drank water during the 2 hour application. The box indicates that drinking water was not an issue. However, I used a straw to ensure it did not get near the application strips...I highly recommend a straw so you do not wash away any of the product strip or adversely effect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was indeed a noticeable difference! I wish it came with a chart like some other products I tried in the past. However, a great deal of the discoloration was removed. I will be using another strip tomorrow or the following day and expect dramatic results that piggybacked off the first treatment. The product directions indicate that only one 2 hour treatment per day, because it is highly concentrated and may cause issues if used too aggressively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $39 for the kit, which includes 4 pairs (1 upper &amp; 1 lower) of strips in the box. Each is a 2 hour express treatment. I paired it with Crest 3D White toothpaste, which claims to remove 90% of surface stains within a week (box says 5 days but I noticed the greatest improvement around day 6-7) and that sealed the deal, per se. [[ASIN:B007F4B69S Crest 3d White Glamorous White Teeth Whitening Vibrant Mint Toothpaste 4.1 Oz]]  There was a dramatic change when I compared both products...people even commented that my teeth were super white and asked where I went (referring to a dentist) to get it done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the product. I have really noticed a 90% change in color and they are now super white! I achieved this with the strips and the Crest 3D White \\&quot;Glamorous White\\&quot; toothpaste. I did not use their mouthwash as it seemed superfluous. I will be buying the kit again when I run out.dversely effect it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was indeed a noticeable difference! I wish it came with a chart like some other products I tried in the past. However, a great deal of the discoloration was removed. I will be using another strip tomorrow or the following day and expect dramatic results that piggybacked off the first treatment. The product directions indicate that only one 2 hour treatment per day, because it is highly concentrated and may cause issues if used too aggressively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $39 for the kit, which includes 4 pairs (1 upper &amp; 1 lower) of strips in the box. Each is a 2 hour express treatment. I paired it with Crest 3D White toothpaste, which claims to remove 90% of surface stains within a week (box says 5 days but I noticed the greatest improvement around day 6-7) and that sealed the deal, per se. [[ASIN:B007F4B69S Crest 3d White Glamorous White Teeth Whitening Vibrant Mint Toothpaste 4.1 Oz]]  There was a dramatic change when I compared both products...people even commented that my teeth were super white and asked where I went (referring to a dentist) to get it done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the product. I have really noticed a 90% change in color and they are now super white! I achieved this with the strips and the Crest 3D White \\&quot;Glamorous White\\&quot; toothpaste. I did not use their mouthwash as it seemed superfluous. I will be buying the kit again when I run out.</li>
            <li> love these. will buy again!!</li>
            <li> Some people have sensitive gums and I&#x27;m fortunate not to be one of them; perhaps Crest should state that on their instructions.  The product does the job for me and I will continue to use them!</li>
            <li> I purchased a 4 pack of these strips and both my husband and I used them. I have extremely sensitive teeth already, but I was willing to experience the pain for whiter teeth. It was a little uncomfortable for the first few days, but not unbearable by far, and by day 4 they were completely back to normal. My teeth became about 3 shades whiter, and the results lasted for about 3 months, and I drink both coffee and red wine (I know...bad girl). My husband didn&#x27;t experience any sensitivity at all and he did 2 treatments in a week, the second he left on for almost 3 hours. His lightened about 3 shades but took 2 sessions to do it, and it seems like his only lasted a little over 2 months and he drinks both coffee and red wine as well (I know...bad boy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the results definitely depend not only on the person, but their lifestyle as well (how much acid, coffee, cigarettes, etc.. you consume). I have heard that yellow teeth are easier to whiten, as opposed to those with a grey tinge...so if your teeth are gray, these definitely won&#x27;t work. I also know that professional whitening comes with some discomfort and is anywhere from $300-$500, though laser whitening is the best and usually $500+. I&#x27;m very happy with my $30 investment...I will definitely recommend, and will definitely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I have found that if I use the 3D White toothpaste it really helps keep them white. My husband used the mouthwash as well but it causes extra sensitivity in my teeth, doesn&#x27;t bother him at all though. I have also tried the Optic White line and I get a lot of sensitivity, so I will stick with the 3D White.</li>
            <li> Just plain do not get these. While wearing them there is not pain, an hour after you take them off though, you just want to rip your teeth out.  The air that you breath in is like when you bite a popsicle... nothing works!  I had hot coffee (kinda defeating the whitening purpose, which didn&#x27;t even whiten that much) and the sip felt wonderful then it was gone and my teeth are back to me wanting to rip them right out of their roots!  The pain is like getting braces times 100! It comes in pulses like knives going in and out of your teeth (but only the bottom teeth) Plus, for the amount of pain you suffer, there is barely any whitening!  Do not get these!</li>
            <li> The date on the box was very expired so they did not work to their full potential of whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well but teeth very sore for about 20 hours afterwards.</li>
            <li> My teeth were not that bad to begin with and these strip did nothing but cause me to have horrible tooth aches for about 2 days after each strip. Waste of time. Horrible pain.</li>
            <li> For the pack, it was hit or miss on whether they&#x27;d even stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*strong grip, no slip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except for not having any grip and constantly sliding. They were basically expensive pieces of plastic. What an utter ripoff.</li>
            <li> Great product, useful</li>
            <li> Kit works okay, not a huge difference, but noticeable. Price is a lot lower that what it&#x27;s sold for in chain retail drug strokes.</li>
            <li> My teeth would react to cold and warm drink when before it wouldn&#x27;t super uncomfortable it lasted for a couple of days so dont buy</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to hate this and that it was going to be painful but I didn&#x27;t have a reaction this time.  There was slight sensitivity but nothing painful.  The last time I used any Crest Whitestrips, it was pretty painful.  Not sure why I didn&#x27;t have a reaction this time but I didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I got results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the four treatments, my teeth were a few shades whiter.  Definitely noticeable.  I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> These work very well. I find if I use once sometimes twice a month my teeth remain very white. I am going to try the new professional strips to see how they work,</li>
            <li> my teeth hurter so badly after 2 min of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Crest 2-hour Whitestrips for over a year and find them to be very convenient.  The adhesive holds very well to to the teeth for the 2 hour whitening time, and I love that it&#x27;s only 2 hours every 3 months.  I have experienced a little sensitivity, however, I tried using sensitive toothpaste for about 2 weeks before and after whitening and this seems to help a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint this time is that when I received the box from the vendor, through amazon.com, the strips are due to expire in October of this year.  I didn&#x27;t notice it when I first received the box in April, but just looked today when getting ready to whiten with the second strips.  Since it&#x27;s a product that is designed to be used over the course of a year, I don&#x27;t think the vendor should be shipping product that will expire before the year is over.  I will definitely order again, but will look for another vendor and will check the expiration dates as soon as I receive so I can return if it&#x27;s expiring before the year.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed, 4 strips only , too much money for 4 strips and the didnt even work i want my money back</li>
            <li> Does whiten teeth, just as it says on the tin. Does leave white streaks on teeth though they go away in a few hours. Does cause tooth sensitivity, only for about half a day. And I experienced no issues placing them correctly. I&#x27;d imagine you would have a problem if your teeth are horribly misaligned. Also brush and floss your teeth before and after using this product.</li>
            <li> Does not work as the one purchased in stores.</li>
            <li> These are great when you&#x27;re in a hurry.  I don&#x27;t think that they work as well as the Crest white-strips that one uses for 20 days, but they&#x27;re great when you&#x27;ve forgotten an event coming up, and you need some in a pinch.  I have sensitivity issues (I can only use Sensodyne toothpaste), so I was really wary after reading the other reviews re: sensitivity.  However, these did not bother my sensitive teeth at all.</li>
            <li> These strips work as promised and the price beats Walmart. I had no sensitivity and my teeth look white again after being stained from drinking coffee and red wine.</li>
            <li> I received this product in a timely manner and in good order. When I was ready to use the product I opened it and read the directions. I kept the film on for 2 hours and noticed a considerably lighter brighter smile.</li>
            <li> Grabbed this at Wal-Mart a while ago because I had a coupon. I read the reviews after I took the strips off my teeth because there was still some residue left on them and was wondering if others had had the same problem. Then I read all the horror stories about excruciating tooth pain and was afraid to go to sleep lest the same thing should happen to me. It&#x27;s now the next day and I&#x27;ve only noticed mild sensitivity. What may have helped is, right after I took the strips off my teeth, in order to get the residue off(and thus the peroxide that was probably still on them) I brushed for a long while with Sensodyne. As for the whitening, I only noticed a slight difference. Next time I&#x27;ll definitely try the Professional Effects, as many reviwers have suggested.</li>
            <li> I tried this with my sister and she didn&#x27;t experience any pain but I did about three hours after applying it I took two ibuprofens to try and ease my pain. When  woke up the next morning it was gone but it was so bad I am not going to do it again because my teeth weren&#x27;t noticeably whiter so it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> A few hours after using these strips, my 20-year-old daughter is in excruciating pain, particularly with her bottom teeth. She followed the directions exactly and has no previous episodes of tooth pain or sensitivity. Now, 5 hours after using the 3D Whitestrips, she wants to pull her teeth out. A quick search on the internet shows that she&#x27;s not alone: MANY customers have experienced the same type of crushing, piercing, \\&quot;I can&#x27;t breathe through my mouth because the air on my teeth makes me hit the ceiling\\&quot; kind of agony.  AVOID this product at all costs -- it&#x27;s not worth the suffering you might experience.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any whiting effect on my teeth. The pain was so intense I had a fever and could not sleep. Definitely not worth pain. Dont use this product, the other crest white strips (14day) works much better.</li>
            <li> I definitely noticed my teeth were whiter after 2 hours.  The strips were a bit difficult to get off, they REALLY stuck to my teeth.  Unfortunately, the next day I had red wine with dinner and my teeth were the darkest they EVER were.  It&#x27;s like the whitener helped them absorb even MORE wine.</li>
            <li> The strips definitely made my teeth whiter, not as white as I expected, but I am satisfied with the results.  My teeth were a bit senstive after the first application, the day after the second strip my teeth felt like they were covered in chalk, it was extremely unpleasant.  I took a day off and continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am happy with the results, just wish the sensitivity wasn&#x27;t an issue, but that is not Crest&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> Tried one of these types of strips for the first time today, and kept them on the whole two hours. They&#x27;re pretty much in keeping with the rest of the Crest whitening line, but after just 30 minutes I could feel what was almost a burning sensation on my gums. Toward the end of the two hours, I was beginning to experience what I can only describe as shooting pains in my teeth. Upon removal (and there is a significant residue that must be wiped away after), I did notice that my teeth were significantly whiter, if not the neon white promised in the advertising. Soon after, however, I began to experience significant pain in my teeth. I do not have sensitive teeth, but I was afraid to drink anything cold or eat for hours. In the future, I&#x27;ll stick with their Advanced Vivid white strips - they take longer, but with consistent use are just as, if not more, effective, and they&#x27;re certainly not as painful.</li>
            <li> Wow I bought these and had them on my teeth for less then 5 minutes before I read these reviews . Upon seeing all the horrible tooth pain everyone went thru I immediately ripped them off and threw them away and brushed my teeth Immediately . I hate to waste 60 bucks but I sure would hate to be in excruciating pain for 2 days ... Hopefully I got that crap off and none of it got into my teeth . F this crap.</li>
            <li> I bought these 2 hour white strips and used them as directed. I have tooth sensitivity so I figured this would be better than having to use the two week long white strips to save time and pain. WRONG! I took off the strips at 3pm and didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference. now it is 7:24pm and my teeth are in horrible pain!!! I wish I could turn the clocks back and not have used them. The pain is worse than the reward. A waste of money. I took some Vicodin and the pain has yet to go away. Crest should really consider pulling this product.I would recommend this to someone I hate.</li>
            <li> Seemed to do a good job. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the results after using this product.  Yes, it is still awkward putting them on and they shift slightly while they&#x27;re in, but the results were worth it.  I have used whitening strips off and on since they hit the market and after trying different brands I will definitely be sticking with this one.  Two hours is a long time to wear them, but after a few minutes I normally forget that they&#x27;re there and there is a noticable difference - my co-workers even commented on my smile the next day.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointed with this product...my teeth barely got any whiter. The only parts that looked whiter were the white parts already on my teeth. :(</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY. I ORDERED 3 AND SAW NO CHANGES</li>
            <li> I wanted to write this review to clarify that this doesn&#x27;t cause pain on everyone with sensitive teeth! I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, but I am looking to so that I will save money on my next box. I have sensitive teeth and have even had my gums bleed from other whitening strips/trays but these strips did NOT cause me any pain or discomfort whatsoever. And, these work very well! After 2 treatments there is a noticeable difference in the shade of my teeth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t work with me, I encourage to use it after viewing the reviews. I use it twice and i didn&#x27;t notice any changes!</li>
            <li> PSA: So yesterday evening, I bought a new toothbrush, and it came with a sample of #Crest 3D 1-Hour Express Whitening Strips. Now, I don&#x27;t typically use that stuff, because my teeth are fairly white. But the promise of movie star teeth bling (and perhaps the fact that it was free), got me to give it a try. Bad idea. Application of the product was simple, as was usage. It&#x27;s the after effects that destroyed my night. I removed the strips at 11pm, and went to bed. An hour later, I woke up in EXCRUCIATING pain. It felt as if little itty bitty people were using drills in my mouth, specifically targeting JUST my nerve endings. I popped three Motrin, to no avail. I even tried Anbesol, and all it did was make my mouth numb and drool-y, but the pain didn&#x27;t subside. I finally fell asleep from exhaustive pain, and it is now almost 10 in the morning, and I&#x27;m still in pain. It&#x27;s dulled ever so slightly, but I&#x27;m afraid to inhale air through my mouth, sip water, or even eat. I will be posting this review on as many sites as possible, and contacting Crest. Their product should come with some sort of warning that states, \\&quot;If you have - or even if you don&#x27;t have - sensitive teeth, refrain from using this product, or you may pull out your own teeth one by one, in hopes of alleviating the pain our s*** product has brought upon you\\&quot;. Oh, and my teeth? Only SLIGHTER whiter. Slightly. For this sort of torture, I expect them to look like brand new porcelain. I didn&#x27;t want to give this any stars at all. I was forced to in order to submit the review.</li>
            <li> Would use Seller again. Excellent product as stated.</li>
            <li> Good product....did whiten my teeth.</li>
            <li> keeps your teeth very white for long time</li>
            <li> I have decent colored teeth and just needed them to brighten up a bit. It gave me intense pain with no noticeable results. So lad I only spent $15 on it.</li>
            <li> Before using these strips, I&#x27;d previously used the original Crest Whitestrips that used a two-week series of daily strips. Those made my teeth more sensitive while I was using them, but didn&#x27;t cause any actual pain. Normally, I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whitening effect of these seemed similar to the full round to me, so I think they did live up to their promise. However, I think you indeed have to be careful with these if you have somewhat sensitive teeth. My teeth didn&#x27;t exactly hurt, but they were extremely sensitive for a few hours after I used them, to the extent that I didn&#x27;t want to eat or drink anything. I used toothpaste for sensitive teeth around the time that I used these, and I think it helped, as they were mostly back to normal the next day, and a couple of days later, they didn&#x27;t have any sensitivity at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These do work well, but find a less intense version if your teeth are somewhat sensitive to begin with.</li>
            <li> Wellll For Starter They Didn&#x27;t Whiten For Me ........ They Did Leave Alot Of White Spots On My Teeth But No Change ... I Did An Before And After And They Were The Same No Diffence ,.... My Bottom Tooth Had A REALLY Sharp Pain,... And No Whitening .., I Will Probably Try A Diffrent One .... But I Wouldnt Recomend These........</li>
            <li> They did nothing for my teeth. At all!</li>
            <li> Work fast and easily, but didn&#x27;t really see a lot of whitening difference.But then my teeth are already pretty white since I had a Zoom treatment- very expensive, which is why I would like maintenance with these strips.</li>
            <li> If you have any questions they will answer to your e-mail so quick. And they worked on me on the first try i put them on and they aren&#x27;t thin so that&#x27;s a good thing. The only bad thing was that my teeth hurt, but because i left them on for more then an hour. So take them off within an hour or less. But like they say &amp;#34;Beauty hurts&amp;#34; over all they&#x27;re great and i like them.</li>
            <li> Not sure why others left negative reviews, I am a smoker, and after two treatments (twice in 3days) my teeth are incredibly white! Awsome product and a LOT less pricey!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty good size guy, and a pair of strips barely covers 6-7 teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See if your dentist offer a service for a small one-time fee with refills each time you go in for a cleaning.</li>
            <li> not as white as I&#x27;d like...have to use more often then I thought</li>
            <li> I liked using it because it was so easy and was non messy.  It did a good job as advertised.</li>
            <li> I was in a hurry and left these on for about an hour.  They are easy to place and they really grip your teeth.  In fact, it takes some pulling to get them off.  I did not see a color difference, it may have been subtle, but I did not use them for the full two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Approximately 3 hours after treatment my teeth began to hurt.  It was not a sharp pain but a dull one.  9 hours after treatment they were still hurting.  Maybe these are just too strong even at 1/2 the recommended time for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ouch.  What a pain in the tooth these are.  I had another set but tossed it.</li>
            <li> Came on time, exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I have used numerous whitening products over the years including other crest products.  I got these to try with another crest product I bought so I figured I would give them a try. It has been about 6 hours since I have taken them off and the pain continues to get worse. I sent my husband to the store for some orajel and sensodyne.  It feels like I need a root canal in each of the teeth that the strips were on.  I have taken 4 800 MG ibuprofen and it has not touched the pain.  Do my teeth look whiter? I can&#x27;t tell through the pain! I would not recommend these to my worst enemy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So update on how I resolved this situation:  1) I threw the strips out and banned them from my house.  2) I bought sensodyne toothpaste and restorative toothpaste (dr Collins restore).  After about a month the pain was gone. 3) I bought the best ever whiting product, five minute whitening gel and some cheap football teeth guards.  I&#x27;ve been using that for the past few years and my teeth are so white it&#x27;s unreal. I&#x27;ve never had any pain from five minute, the taste isn&#x27;t harsh and heck sometimes I leave it on for ten or fifteen without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final word years later: I think there should be a class action against crest for these strips and we should all be reimbursed for them.  I spent at least $30 on products to fix the pain from this mess. They have to know about the issues with these. I sent them a very long email to which I received no response.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product a zero rating I would. I got the free sample with the purchase of a toothbrush. I have used crest whitening strips before and never have had much to complain about besides slight sensitivity. I have always been pretty happy with the result from the other whitening strips. I got home and put these on and and noticed within 10 seconds that it whitened a tiny section of my gum between my teeth. I am very unhappy and hope that it will fade and the color will return. I will not use these again in the future.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Used the whole box (4 packets) of 1hr express in 2 days, 12 hrs between each packet. My teeth are bright white and look excellent. Saw the reviews of folks that had pain after using these but i had absolutely no problems or pain. I will be using these again in the future.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend the product because it did not whitening my teeth much.&lt;br /&gt;When I use the strips, they were quite irritating my gum.</li>
            <li> Yes, I have read an article where a woman developed a long lasting condition where she couldn&#x27;t eat cold foods because she over-applied and did not wait the recommended amount of time between applying... follow the rules on the package!</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t do at all what it says. I wish I could get a refund. My teeth aren&#x27;t yellow they are more of an off white and I was looking for a brighter smile. I don&#x27;t see a difference at all. I&#x27;ve used the professional effects before I used this product and I don&#x27;t see a difference.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results I had with only one box of the 1 Hour Express.  I ordered this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is really good.</li>
            <li> it worked ok.....didn&#x27;t do what I expected as I wanted to see a significant difference in the whitness of my teeth and I did not</li>
            <li> There was no difference in the colour of my teeth when I used them, very disappointed and I did follow the instructions given</li>
            <li> Whiten teeth 10 times more than the &amp;#34;storebrand &amp;#34;I purchased from my local department store. Made my teeth a little sore for a day or so, but it was well worth it!</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t stay on your teeth and don&#x27;t whiten at all.</li>
            <li> I took it off after 30 mins based on the reviews on amazon. So glad I did. My teeth are killing me. Pain didn&#x27;t start until about 5 hours after the treatment. Not just with cold/ hot. They hurt consistently. Not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> I couldnt sleep all night because how sensitive my teeth were after using. I followed all the directions my teeth were whitened unevened and white spots.... not to mention my whole mouth was in severe pain! And i mean serious pain. Do not buy it online pay the extra money and buy in store. Or whiten professionally</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these. I&#x27;m going to Vegas next week. After thirty minutes I would feel a slight pain in my lower teeth but it wasn&#x27;t bad or persistent so I let it go. After one hour and forty five minutes I had a sudden excruciating pain.&lt;br /&gt;I was so scared and the strips stuck on so good. I had trouble getting them off. After I felt immediate relief&lt;br /&gt;A few minutes later I started feeling sharp pains in my teeth. Now I&#x27;m reading horrible reviews. I hope this pain doesn&#x27;t last much longer. I never write bad reviews but this is ridiculous. I did notice a result but its so not worth it.</li>
            <li> Bought the box of 4 white strips, thinking that it would last a full year as advertised.  After following directions and applying strips for 2 hours, I will not be using the rest of the box.  The strips caused discomfort and sensitivity in my teeth that lasted for hours.  They are also extremely adhesive, and I felt like I was going to be losing some teeth with the strips upon removal.  Stay with Crest&#x27;s other white strips products, and don&#x27;t waste your money on this bad idea.</li>
            <li> Was supposed to have 8 strips only has 2!!</li>
            <li> Great product! This item shipped within a week. It was very afordable and I only need to use one strip to whiten my teeth. These strips are used fo r2 hours so the whitening strip is different than the 30 minute whitening strip. It is waxy which make it more comforable to wear for 2 hours.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both used these and saw a significant improvement. Both of our teeth were significantly whiter. I experienced a mild instance of transitory tooth pain, but it passed quickly.</li>
            <li> Worked great but made my teeth super sensitive.</li>
            <li> Never experienced pain quite like this, Ive taken pain killers, numbing spray, everything... the pain is still here and is progressively getting worse. Yes they make your teeth whiter but not worth this pain. I cant concentrate and have to take work off tonight. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.</li>
            <li> It couldn&#x27;t hold my teeth.</li>
            <li> I put the strips on last night around 7 and only wore them 1 hour. My teeth are very slightly sensitive since I had my braces off 10 years ago, but I&#x27;ve whitened a few times over the years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pain with these 2 hr strips is unbearable! I took them off because they made my spit thick and in general I don&#x27;t like the feeling of wearing the strips. There was no pain last night. At 330am I woke up in pain. I took Advil and was able to sleep a little more but woke up in pain again. It hurts so bad. I&#x27;m 4 Advils in now and it hasn&#x27;t even made a dent in the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other strips, even ones by Crest, don&#x27;t hurt like this. I&#x27;m so thankful I only kept them on half the time! Do not recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought these on sale.  I followed all directions and did not see any difference at all in the shade of my teeth.  I will finish the box just because, well, it can&#x27;t hurt anything, but this product doesn&#x27;t at all deliver the results promised.</li>
            <li> I really had faith in this product..or wanted to at the least. I&#x27;m getting older so my &amp;#34;beautiful smile&amp;#34; I used to get commented on all the time as in time turned yellow. My teeth aren&#x27;t usually sensitive but this really made them hurt..which would&#x27;ve been worth it if they whitened..lol....really sad..:(</li>
            <li> I HAD yellowish teeth. Bought a pouch off the net so only 1 treatment but wow after 2 hours the yellow is barely noticeable. I was even asked if i&#x27;ve changed my brushing habits. I do have sensative teeth (I can&#x27;t stand people who chew ice or just bite right through a popsicle). These haven&#x27;t given me any pain afterwards.</li>
            <li> I used these right before my wedding and saw a drastic change. If you are looking for a quick fix, this is the product for you. They stick onto your teeth tight unlike other strips I have used in the past that are slippery.</li>
            <li> Whitened my teeth but wasn&#x27;t anything super spectacular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just needed a quick touch up before pictures, they whiten your teeth but don&#x27;t expect a miracle. Also you have to wait before using another strip so 1 hour now is really more like 4 days for maximum effect.</li>
            <li> Most things are great.</li>
