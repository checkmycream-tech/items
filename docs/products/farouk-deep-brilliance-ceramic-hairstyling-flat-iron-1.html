            <li>It&#x27;s nice to learn I have options.</li>
            <li>I OWN A CHI FOR 4 YEARS</li>
            <li>I recommend getting some kind of protective mat to stick under the iron so it doesn&#x27;t ruin your counter.</li>
            <li>i was kind of concerned of what it can do seeing as how this is supposedly for women with thicker, curly hair.  </li>

            <li>It is now staight, smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, the turn on button is on the inside; which is great because you don&#x27;t have to worry about turning it off by accident when ironing your hair.</li>
            <li>I would not pay more than 50.00 for this iron, but it works better than the ones off the shelf at Fred Meyers.</li>
            <li>This is way better than the ones that you just buy at the store, it works as well as the one my stylist uses.  </li>

            <li>This flat iron is the best iron that my wife has ever used.</li>
            <li>This flat iron works great!  </li>
            <li>I had used a Chi before through one of my friends and loved it, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the price for one.  </li>
            <li>excellent quality heats fast and will really work just like the ones in the salon</li>
            <li>This flatiron is amazing and well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and never snags my hair when I use it.</li>
            <li>I thought were fine until I used the Chi).  </li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly and glides over the hair smoothly.</li>
            <li>Silky smooth straightening with this ...</li>
            <li>The light blinks to let you know the unit is pulsing (heating) to keep even temp for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the best one!My sister has a more expensive straightener that will remain un named, but it was twice as much as mine and mine works so much better!!</li>
            <li>i never thought my hair could look better straight!</li>
            <li>This straightener works when I pass it through a strand the first time (sometimes two times for those more stubborn pieces).  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth $90 or whatever the price is now!</li>
            <li>long cord, hits up super fast and does the job excellent!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and glad I spent a little more money to get something that works!</li>
            <li>I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised and LOVE THIS IRON!  </li>
            <li>1\\&quot;]]This is the most amazing flat iron EVER!</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and evenly and doesn&#x27;t fry my hair.  </li>
            <li>I own a Paul Mitchell flat iron that I thought was fantastic and</li>
            <li>THIS IRON IS VERY HOT.</li>
            <li>I would suggest using ceramic protector with this, as it gets very hot.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I bought one not sure what to expect, but this iron works as good as the Chi; I ended up buying two more.  </li>
            <li>I use Farouk&#x27;s Biosilk Silk Strate before blow drying, then use this iron and presto! straight, smooth hair.</li>
            <li>I paid only $40.00 and am thrilled w/ this purchase.</li>
            <li>Well worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend this iron for those who don&#x27;t have to have a CHI, who want a good quality iron and a low price.</li>
            <li>She was most impressed and said that it only takes her just 5 minutes to completely straighten her hair (previously 15 minutes with her Conair or 25 minutes at the hairdresser).</li>
            <li>Same great iron different packaging.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money, especially if you do not wish to spend the money on a Chi....much better than others that I have purchased from Wal-mart...</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and leaves my hair very shiny.  </li>
            <li>This iron heats up quickly and works very well.</li>
            <li>TIP: ALWAYS USE A HEAT PROTECTOR SPRAY ON HAIR FIRST BEFORE USING THE IRON TO HELP KEEP HAIR FROM BEING DAMAGED.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as hot as the first day</li>
            <li>(my hair is too hot to touch after 2 passes).</li>
            <li>I love the swivel cord and the almost instant heating.  </li>
            <li>This flat/curling iron gets hot</li>
            <li>I know it gets hot and works well, but</li>
            <li>how hot?</li>
            <li>I have a $90 hot iron (not a CHI but similar) which doesn&#x27;t work near as well, and from what I have done with my friend&#x27;s CHIs this works better!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving my new flat iron by Farouk!</li>
            <li>This is a great flat iron - it heats up very fast and it doesn&#x27;t catch on my hair like other irons do.</li>
            <li>Besides the fact that it heats up wicked fast and get really hot.</li>
            <li>Packs light, but takes a while to cool down (it gets really really hot).</li>
            <li>My hair was so silky and straight.  </li>
            <li>I was told it would not be ready to ship until the end of January</li>
            <li>Why was I charged sooo much??</li>
            <li>I NEVER thought I could get my hair straight without hours of struggle.</li>
            <li>I can get it really close to my scalp because of its size and the cord never gets tangled.     </li>
            <li>I have very frizzy and wavy hair...</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t really see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shiny and completely straight.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>My hair is so much prettier.</li>
            <li>and sometimes she wants it completely straight.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>The Farouk Deep Brilliance Ceramic Hairstyling Flat Iron 1\\&quot; is nice...</li>
            <li>My hair ends up more shiny and softer than if I use my old cheapo flat iron.</li>
            <li>This flat iron works just as well as the higher priced flat irons that costs three times more.  </li>
            <li>..make soft curls..and make my hair look more natural than the Japanese re bonding.</li>
            <li>The longevity of the product will be its true test for me, but at $39.95 each, I&#x27;ll be buying a second one to store as a backup.</li>
            <li>It works better than my Chi ever did, and it cost way less.</li>
            <li>The big bonus for me is that the effects last more than 1 day.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Then, while it was being shipped I did a little more research and found it was for \\&quot;women of</li>
            <li>IT WORKS GREAT ON MY HAIR, (HAVE LONG THICK HAIR).  </li>
            <li>I brought them last month and so far they have done a great job on my hair, my hair is really thick and can be unmanageable, but since I got them that has not been a problem.</li>
            <li>Happy with this purchase-product works well on thick wavy hair as  long as you use it in sections.</li>
            <li>With only one heat setting, I know that I am using the right amount of heat on my hair.</li>
            <li>I live by the water</li>
            <li>This unit is lightweight with a VERY long cord and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>It gets hot quickly and can burn your hair if you don&#x27;t be careful, but overall it does what it was made for.  </li>
            <li>For anyone interested in the specifications for this flat iron (wattage etc.)</li>
            <li>It is great for African American natural and relaxed hair, it&#x27;s small enough to get to the root and press out your edges.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much better than the little $15 one I bought a while back.  </li>
            <li>I was apprehensive at first, but after reading positive reviews from previous buyers, I was sold.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.   </li>
            <li>I had to enlist the aide of a couple magazine articles, my hairdresser, and several friends, but now I can have either curly hair (to which I have to do nothing at all) or straight, shiny hair (which takes a bit of effort).  </li>
            <li>I was able to buzz through my hair in only a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I was worried it was going to be a bad product because of how much it is marked down from the original price; nevertheless, I am glad to say that after only one use, I am definitely satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>WAY too much money to drop on a flat iron that doesn&#x27;t even have a valid warranty!</li>
            <li>I have used others that took a long time to heat up and then took me over an hour to get my hair straight, just to have it waving up again in another hour or two.</li>
            <li>I want to add, I first learnt about Chi flat irons from my sister who got hers as a gift from a friend who&#x27;s hairstylist, and this is the exact same flat iron but packeged as \\&quot;Deep Brilliance\\&quot; line.  </li>
            <li>leaves hair shinyy, smooth and silky...takes me less than 20 mins to straighten...a bargain!!</li>
            <li>The only concern I have is about the very high temp causing any damage to my hair in the long run.</li>
            <li>this iron was well worth the money I spent!!!</li>
            <li>this Deep Brilliance iron far exceeds the Paul Mitchell one.</li>
            <li>(it gets curlier when it&#x27;s humid), and I live in New Orleans where the humidity skyrockets every other day.</li>
            <li>She use to spend a lot more time straightning with her other flat iron and this gets the job done in half the time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a little difficult to get the hang of curling, but once you learn, it makes great curls!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommned.</li>
            <li>Even though it only has one temperature setting, this flat iron straightened my naturally wavy/curly hair immediately.</li>
            <li>My hair is an unruly mess and this makes my hair straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>I have never flat ironed my hair myself</li>
            <li>ethnicities\\&quot; so I got worried seeing as I have fine thin blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Farouk makes great styling products and this one is no exception, only less expensive!</li>

            <li> I own a Paul Mitchell flat iron that I thought was fantastic and</li>
            <li> THIS IRON IS VERY HOT.</li>
            <li> I would suggest using ceramic protector with this, as it gets very hot.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought one not sure what to expect, but this iron works as good as the Chi; I ended up buying two more.  </li>
            <li> I use Farouk&#x27;s Biosilk Silk Strate before blow drying, then use this iron and presto! straight, smooth hair.</li>
            <li> I paid only $40.00 and am thrilled w/ this purchase.</li>
            <li> Well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend this iron for those who don&#x27;t have to have a CHI, who want a good quality iron and a low price.</li>
            <li> She was most impressed and said that it only takes her just 5 minutes to completely straighten her hair (previously 15 minutes with her Conair or 25 minutes at the hairdresser).</li>
            <li> Same great iron different packaging.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money, especially if you do not wish to spend the money on a Chi....much better than others that I have purchased from Wal-mart...</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and leaves my hair very shiny.  </li>
            <li> This iron heats up quickly and works very well.</li>
            <li> TIP: ALWAYS USE A HEAT PROTECTOR SPRAY ON HAIR FIRST BEFORE USING THE IRON TO HELP KEEP HAIR FROM BEING DAMAGED.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as hot as the first day</li>
            <li> (my hair is too hot to touch after 2 passes).</li>
            <li> I love the swivel cord and the almost instant heating.  </li>
            <li> This flat/curling iron gets hot</li>
            <li> I know it gets hot and works well, but</li>
            <li> how hot?</li>
            <li> I have a $90 hot iron (not a CHI but similar) which doesn&#x27;t work near as well, and from what I have done with my friend&#x27;s CHIs this works better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my new flat iron by Farouk!</li>
            <li> This is a great flat iron - it heats up very fast and it doesn&#x27;t catch on my hair like other irons do.</li>
            <li> Besides the fact that it heats up wicked fast and get really hot.</li>
            <li> Packs light, but takes a while to cool down (it gets really really hot).</li>
            <li> My hair was so silky and straight.  </li>
            <li> I was told it would not be ready to ship until the end of January</li>
            <li> Why was I charged sooo much??</li>
            <li> I NEVER thought I could get my hair straight without hours of struggle.</li>
            <li> I can get it really close to my scalp because of its size and the cord never gets tangled.     </li>
            <li> I have very frizzy and wavy hair...</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t really see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny and completely straight.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> My hair is so much prettier.</li>
            <li> and sometimes she wants it completely straight.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> The Farouk Deep Brilliance Ceramic Hairstyling Flat Iron 1\\&quot; is nice...</li>
            <li> My hair ends up more shiny and softer than if I use my old cheapo flat iron.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works just as well as the higher priced flat irons that costs three times more.  </li>
            <li> ..make soft curls..and make my hair look more natural than the Japanese re bonding.</li>
            <li> The longevity of the product will be its true test for me, but at $39.95 each, I&#x27;ll be buying a second one to store as a backup.</li>
            <li> It works better than my Chi ever did, and it cost way less.</li>
            <li> The big bonus for me is that the effects last more than 1 day.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Then, while it was being shipped I did a little more research and found it was for \\&quot;women of</li>
            <li> IT WORKS GREAT ON MY HAIR, (HAVE LONG THICK HAIR).  </li>
            <li> I brought them last month and so far they have done a great job on my hair, my hair is really thick and can be unmanageable, but since I got them that has not been a problem.</li>
            <li> Happy with this purchase-product works well on thick wavy hair as  long as you use it in sections.</li>
            <li> With only one heat setting, I know that I am using the right amount of heat on my hair.</li>
            <li> I live by the water</li>
            <li> This unit is lightweight with a VERY long cord and heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> It gets hot quickly and can burn your hair if you don&#x27;t be careful, but overall it does what it was made for.  </li>
            <li> For anyone interested in the specifications for this flat iron (wattage etc.)</li>
            <li> It is great for African American natural and relaxed hair, it&#x27;s small enough to get to the root and press out your edges.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much better than the little $15 one I bought a while back.  </li>
            <li> I was apprehensive at first, but after reading positive reviews from previous buyers, I was sold.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.   </li>
            <li> I had to enlist the aide of a couple magazine articles, my hairdresser, and several friends, but now I can have either curly hair (to which I have to do nothing at all) or straight, shiny hair (which takes a bit of effort).  </li>
            <li> I was able to buzz through my hair in only a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I was worried it was going to be a bad product because of how much it is marked down from the original price; nevertheless, I am glad to say that after only one use, I am definitely satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> WAY too much money to drop on a flat iron that doesn&#x27;t even have a valid warranty!</li>
            <li> I have used others that took a long time to heat up and then took me over an hour to get my hair straight, just to have it waving up again in another hour or two.</li>
            <li> I want to add, I first learnt about Chi flat irons from my sister who got hers as a gift from a friend who&#x27;s hairstylist, and this is the exact same flat iron but packeged as \\&quot;Deep Brilliance\\&quot; line.  </li>
            <li> leaves hair shinyy, smooth and silky...takes me less than 20 mins to straighten...a bargain!!</li>
            <li> The only concern I have is about the very high temp causing any damage to my hair in the long run.</li>
            <li> this iron was well worth the money I spent!!!</li>
            <li> this Deep Brilliance iron far exceeds the Paul Mitchell one.</li>
            <li> (it gets curlier when it&#x27;s humid), and I live in New Orleans where the humidity skyrockets every other day.</li>
            <li> She use to spend a lot more time straightning with her other flat iron and this gets the job done in half the time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little difficult to get the hang of curling, but once you learn, it makes great curls!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommned.</li>
            <li> Even though it only has one temperature setting, this flat iron straightened my naturally wavy/curly hair immediately.</li>
            <li> My hair is an unruly mess and this makes my hair straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> I have never flat ironed my hair myself</li>
            <li> ethnicities\\&quot; so I got worried seeing as I have fine thin blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Farouk makes great styling products and this one is no exception, only less expensive!</li>
            <li> I actually learned to use my Farouk Flat Iron on my unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron is a &#x27;Deep Brilliance&#x27; iron, not a &#x27;CHI&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This flat iron heats up instantly (con: there is no heat controller).  </li>

            <li> I was a little leery of this with the price only being $39.95, but I thought I would risk it.</li>
            <li> I also like the swivel cord which has always been a problem with my other iron.    </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was looking for a blow dryer when I saw this flat iron on sale for $39.95.  WOW! I own a Paul Mitchell flat iron that I thought was fantastic and this Deep Brilliance iron far exceeds the Paul Mitchell one. With only one heat setting, I know that I am using the right amount of heat on my hair. My hair was so silky and straight.  I only went over each section once with the iron and the results were amazing.  I have very thick African American hair and I get salon results every time!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this iron for my teenager for Christmas and she loves it. She has long wavy hair and this does the trick. She use to spend a lot more time straightning with her other flat iron and this gets the job done in half the time. I highly recommend this product. Shipping time was excellant to. I was told it would not be ready to ship until the end of January and it arrived Christmas Eve. I was pleasantly surprised.   TIP: ALWAYS USE A HEAT PROTECTOR SPRAY ON HAIR FIRST BEFORE USING THE IRON TO HELP KEEP HAIR FROM BEING DAMAGED. THIS IRON IS VERY HOT. USE CAUTION!!</li>
            <li> I read all reviews and was most disappointed that I paid 89.-- plus shipping for yhis and everyons reviews for this same product are 39.00! Why was I charged sooo much?? i ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS A \\&quot;chi\\&quot; BUT ITS NOT</li>
            <li> Ok so Ive gone through many hair straighteners and I honestly can say this is the best one!My sister has a more expensive straightener that will remain un named, but it was twice as much as mine and mine works so much better!! My hair is an unruly mess and this makes my hair straight and shiny. Besides the fact that it heats up wicked fast and get really hot. The only downside is you can burn yourself bad on this. Maybe I&#x27;m just clumsy or something, I dont know. But otherwise I love this straightener!!</li>
            <li> The flat iron works great!  It gets hot quickly and can burn your hair if you don&#x27;t be careful, but overall it does what it was made for.  I cannot tell the difference between the Deep Brilliance and the CHI.  They look and work the same.</li>
            <li> I was thoroughly impressed with this product. It&#x27;s just as good as a Chi, but more affordable. I was apprehensive at first, but after reading positive reviews from previous buyers, I was sold. It heats up fast, and is easy to use. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT, I love my Farouk Chi ceramic flat iron!  As a mom I don&#x27;t have hours to style my hair and feel good... but now with this flat iron (and I also got the hair dryer) I can straighten/style my hair in 20 min (I have just over the shoulder length hair that&#x27;s wavy).    I want to add, I first learnt about Chi flat irons from my sister who got hers as a gift from a friend who&#x27;s hairstylist, and this is the exact same flat iron but packeged as \\&quot;Deep Brilliance\\&quot; line.  Same great iron different packaging.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, wavy hair. This results I get with this flat iron are amazing!!! I use Farouk&#x27;s Biosilk Silk Strate before blow drying, then use this iron and presto! straight, smooth hair. I NEVER thought I could get my hair straight without hours of struggle. I have NO idea why the price was so inexpensive... wish I had bought 2 so I&#x27;d have a spare.</li>
            <li> I have had this flat iron for a couple of months and I love it.  I had a CHI previously and the on/off switch broke.  I decided to give this one a try... and it did not disappoint.  I have thick coarse blonde hair and it worked just as well as my CHI if not better, plus it is a lot cheaper!  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I actually learned to use my Farouk Flat Iron on my unruly hair.  I had to enlist the aide of a couple magazine articles, my hairdresser, and several friends, but now I can have either curly hair (to which I have to do nothing at all) or straight, shiny hair (which takes a bit of effort).  It&#x27;s nice to learn I have options.</li>
            <li> I must say this is the best flat iron I ever bought.  It has consistently worked great everytime I have used it.  I bought a similar product at a mall kiosk that I spent over $100 for.  The $100 iron lost its touch after a couple of months.  It wasn&#x27;t as hot as the first day I used it.  Unlike this Farouk Ceramic Iron......this iron was well worth the money I spent!!!</li>
            <li> This flat iron works just as well as the higher priced flat irons that costs three times more.  I have had my iron for over a year now and no problems.  I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It heats up very quickly and never snags my hair when I use it. I can get it really close to my scalp because of its size and the cord never gets tangled.     I am very impressed and for the price, it was a very good buy. Get one if you have frizzy hair like I do. I have had so many compliments on my hair since I got it and so  will you.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!! I OWN A CHI FOR 4 YEARS AND IT FINALLY GAVE OUT.  WHEN I WAS LOOKING ON AMAZON FOR ANOTHER CHI I FOUND THIS ONE AND IT IS ABSOULUTLY WONDERFULL.  IT WORKS GREAT ON MY HAIR, (HAVE LONG THICK HAIR).  YOU CAN&#x27;T BEET THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a month.....All have to say is that my hair never looked this good. I have very frizzy and wavy hair...I did the Japanese Hair Straightening a year back. I was thinking about redoing it. But now I changed my mind...With this Iron I can change my hair..make soft curls..and make my hair look more natural than the Japanese re bonding. The only concern I have is about the very high temp causing any damage to my hair in the long run.</li>
            <li> I bought one not sure what to expect, but this iron works as good as the Chi; I ended up buying two more.  I paid only $40.00 and am thrilled w/ this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was a little leery of this with the price only being $39.95, but I thought I would risk it. I am glad I did! It worked very good for me. I have used others that took a long time to heat up and then took me over an hour to get my hair straight, just to have it waving up again in another hour or two. I was able to buzz through my hair in only a few minutes. I have very long, extremely thick hair.</li>
            <li> I love this iron and it&#x27;s price! It smooths my hair.... it even curls my thick hair. I love it!</li>
            <li> These flat irons work  really good. I brought them last month and so far they have done a great job on my hair, my hair is really thick and can be unmanageable, but since I got them that has not been a problem. They are by the company that the chi irons are made from and to me they work just as good but with a cheaper price. My hair stylest uses the chi and I don&#x27;t really see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is a &#x27;Deep Brilliance&#x27; iron, not a &#x27;CHI&#x27;. But both irons are made by Farouk Systems, so the Deep Brilliance iron has the same technology as the CHI for a fraction of the cost.    Works great. Never have to make 2 passes over a section of hair (my hair is too hot to touch after 2 passes). Leaves my hair shiny and completely straight. Packs light, but takes a while to cool down (it gets really really hot). When pulling a section of hair through the iron, curl the iron under slightly as you come to the ends and voila! It gives a little style.     Great grooming iron, great quality. I highly, highly recommend this iron for those who don&#x27;t have to have a CHI, who want a good quality iron and a low price. I paid $39.99 in February 2008. This iron can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Happy with this purchase-product works well on thick wavy hair as  long as you use it in sections. No temperature setting, but still works  great-I previously used the conair ceramic one and this works much better.</li>
            <li> I had used a Chi before through one of my friends and loved it, but I wasn&#x27;t willing to pay the price for one.  I came across this iron after numerous searches on Ebay and Amazon.  I had read the reviews and thought that since Farouk makes both this iron and the Chi, that I would give it a try.  I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised and LOVE THIS IRON!  I have thick stubborn wavy hair that takes me a long time to straighten and this iron has help me cut down my styling time in half!  For once, I can style my short bob the way it&#x27;s suppose to look without my stubborn waves giving me a fight and flipping in all weird directions.  I also like the swivel cord which has always been a problem with my other iron.    I think that the plates are a lot smoother than my other iron and it doesn&#x27;t rip out my hair.  If you have used the Chi and like it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this iron.  In my opinion, it&#x27;s the same iron, they just placed different logos and stickers on it.  I recommend getting some kind of protective mat to stick under the iron so it doesn&#x27;t ruin your counter.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best flat irons I have used.  This flat iron heats up instantly (con: there is no heat controller).  I only have to go over sections of hair one time.  This product is just as good as the ones used by professionals.  This flat iron will save you time.</li>
            <li> When my Chi broke for the second time in 3 1/2 years, I started looking for another one. When I saw this one for about $40 I thought, \\&quot;What&#x27;s the catch?\\&quot; But you know what? - There isn&#x27;t one! This is a great flat iron - it heats up very fast and it doesn&#x27;t catch on my hair like other irons do. It works better than my Chi ever did, and it cost way less. I&#x27;m hoping it lasts longer than my Chi did, but even if it doesn&#x27;t, it will be a lot easier to replace than a $100+ Chi. I recommend this flat iron to anyone looking for one!</li>
            <li> The Farouk Deep Brilliance Ceramic Hairstyling Flat Iron 1\\&quot; is nice...I also have a Chi which I paid $145.00.  I like both, but perfer the Chi.  Basically the only difference is the plug and for some reason, I think the Chi leaves my hair shinner...could be my imagionation...anyway, I keep the Farouk in my suitcase and use it for weekends away and travel! Well worth the money, especially if you do not wish to spend the money on a Chi....much better than others that I have purchased from Wal-mart...(which I thought were fine until I used the Chi).  I will never go back!</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It straightens my hair in half the time of other flat iron i have used in the past.  A must have!</li>
            <li> This iron is great.  I love the swivel cord and the almost instant heating.  No more waiting when I forgot to plug in the iron.</li>
            <li> This unit is lightweight with a VERY long cord and heats up quickly. Although there is no adjustable heat setting, I do not find that to be a problem. This is a great unit for the price!</li>
            <li> Big Hit with daughter! Silky smooth straightening with this ...long cord, hits up super fast and does the job excellent! Highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> My hair is so much prettier. I can go out in the rain and my hair stays the same.</li>
            <li> i have very pin straight hair, though that doesnt mean im not prone to dryness or crazy hair days.  sometimes my hair does go out of whack, and though my hair&#x27;s very fine, this tool does the trick.  i was kind of concerned of what it can do seeing as how this is supposedly for women with thicker, curly hair.  i never thought my hair could look better straight! the item heats up like THAT and boom in no time you look prim and proper.  highly recommended.</li>
            <li> For someone balancing price and quality, this flat iron is a great buy! I was worried it was going to be a bad product because of how much it is marked down from the original price; nevertheless, I am glad to say that after only one use, I am definitely satisfied with the results. Even though it only has one temperature setting, this flat iron straightened my naturally wavy/curly hair immediately. After trying other flat irons only to through or give them away, I finally found one that works! Buy it before it is gone.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the best iron that my wife has ever used. I decided to take a risk and purchase it for her for $39.95. I bought it to save her time and money at the hairdresser. Her hair is slightly wavy and sometimes she wants it completely straight.  She was most impressed and said that it only takes her just 5 minutes to completely straighten her hair (previously 15 minutes with her Conair or 25 minutes at the hairdresser). After four uses it has already paid for itself. I just wish that I had bought two more for her before the price went up to $89.00. For anyone interested in the specifications for this flat iron (wattage etc.) they can be found on the Deep Brilliance website.</li>
            <li> A couple of my friends had straighteners like this, and I used to borrow them when I visited them.  Now I have my own and love it.  It&#x27;s much better than the little $15 one I bought a while back.  It heats up quickly and leaves my hair very shiny.  I have long, wavy/curly hair (it gets curlier when it&#x27;s humid), and I live in New Orleans where the humidity skyrockets every other day. This straightener works when I pass it through a strand the first time (sometimes two times for those more stubborn pieces).  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This flat/curling iron gets hot almost instantly!&lt;br /&gt;It puts a shine to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is a little difficult to get the hang of curling, but once you learn, it makes great curls!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommned.</li>
            <li> As a hair stylist, I know the importance of a quality flat iron. Farouk makes great styling products and this one is no exception, only less expensive! The only draw back for me is that it does not have a temperature dial, only on and off. Not a big deal considering the savings!    Heats up very quickly and glides over the hair smoothly. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> my sister was very happy to receive her gift and said she was very happy with it, it works wonderful on her hair</li>
            <li> I have had this flat iron for a month and I love it.  It is great for African American natural and relaxed hair, it&#x27;s small enough to get to the root and press out your edges.  I am in need of a relaxer now and you cannot tell after using this product. I would suggest using ceramic protector with this, as it gets very hot.</li>
            <li> This flatiron is amazing and well worth the price.  It heats up quickly and evenly and doesn&#x27;t fry my hair.  My hair ends up more shiny and softer than if I use my old cheapo flat iron.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I got this for $39.95!!! What a great product! Straightens w/o burning...no matter what your length is! I&#x27;m going to buy a 2nd for back-up!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000YDMM54 Farouk Deep Brilliance Ceramic Hairstyling Flat Iron 1\\&quot;]]This is the most amazing flat iron EVER! I received it today and just finished my hair. I have shoulder length, extremely curly, thick and dry looking hair. It is now staight, smooth and shiny! I have never flat ironed my hair myself, I always had my hair dresser do it or my daughter who used her CHI. I didn&#x27;t even think I could do this myself - my daughter told me to try it myself and she would help me finish it. Well I did it myself and I don&#x27;t need her help! She was amazed, I even did the back myself....sorry I am rambling...JUST BUY IT - incredible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving my new flat iron by Farouk! The cord is so long, it heats up in a snap, and it staightens by thick hair in a flash! The one thing it does not have an adjustable heat setting but that hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me.</li>
            <li> I like this flat iron.  It is not as compacted as I had hoped, but it works good.  It heats up fast, the turn on button is on the inside; which is great because you don&#x27;t have to worry about turning it off by accident when ironing your hair. I would not pay more than 50.00 for this iron, but it works better than the ones off the shelf at Fred Meyers.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this product. I have been trying to find out how to return it. Please advise.</li>
            <li> excellent quality heats fast and will really work just like the ones in the salon</li>
            <li> This iron heats up quickly and works very well. It comes with a 1 year warrany.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two things: no adjustable heat setting and no detailed documentation or user info. I know it gets hot and works well, but how hot? I can&#x27;t seem to find it on the box or in the included documentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 8&#x27; swivel cord is wonderful and the unit itself is lightweight. The light blinks to let you know the unit is pulsing (heating) to keep even temp for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, medium length hair and this iron works well with it. The longevity of the product will be its true test for me, but at $39.95 each, I&#x27;ll be buying a second one to store as a backup.</li>
            <li> This flat iron works great!  This is way better than the ones that you just buy at the store, it works as well as the one my stylist uses.  Usually when I want to straighten my hair I have to section it all out and go over every strand a bunch of times and it takes about 1/2 hour.  With this one, it took less than 10 minutes and I never had to go over the same hair twice.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and glad I spent a little more money to get something that works!</li>
            <li> This iron as only $39.95 when I bought it. I saw it was made by Farouk, the makers of CHI, so I thought I&#x27;d take a chance. Then, while it was being shipped I did a little more research and found it was for \\&quot;women of ethnicities\\&quot; so I got worried seeing as I have fine thin blonde hair. I was wrong! This iron works great on my hair! I have a $90 hot iron (not a CHI but similar) which doesn&#x27;t work near as well, and from what I have done with my friend&#x27;s CHIs this works better! Definitely worth $90 or whatever the price is now! Better than a CHI!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this straightening iron for about 1 month and I will never use another.  What a difference a great straightener makes.  I can straighten my hair in less than 10 minutes now whereas with my past 2 irons it took me at least 25 minutes.  My hair has never been so straight and shiny. The big bonus for me is that the effects last more than 1 day.  I can leave my hair straight for a few days without having to re-straighten.  I live by the water and it is often humid and my hair still doesn&#x27;t get fuzzy or curly.  This is the best I have used.  Well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Great hair straightner!! leaves hair shinyy, smooth and silky...takes me less than 20 mins to straighten...a bargain!!</li>
            <li> I have had this iron for two weeks shy of a year.  The iron stopped working.  I thought, \\&quot;Great!  Finally something actually breaks down two weeks BEFORE the warranty runs out instead of two weeks after!\\&quot;  After contacting Farouk, I learned that the warranty is VOID if the product is purchased over the internet.  This was in no way, shape, or form disclosed to me when I purchased my iron.  DO NOT BUY!!  WAY too much money to drop on a flat iron that doesn&#x27;t even have a valid warranty!</li>
