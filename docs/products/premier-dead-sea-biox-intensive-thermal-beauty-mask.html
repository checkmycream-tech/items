            <li>Radiant, clean, and beautiful looking skin</li>
            <li>love the heating effect of the mask and it good for the circulation of the skin.</li>
            <li>All it did was just warm up the face a teeny weeny bit.</li>
            <li>It is really the most effective way to beautiful skin.  </li>
            <li>the package arrived she confirmed that it was the identical product and has been very pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>If you want to look more youthful, this is the product for you and your friends</li>
            <li>After all this I do have to say I love the products just fix the packing please</li>
            <li>I am glad I did not spend 150 at the mall for this</li>
            <li>I am glad I waited.</li>
            <li>You get a better result.  </li>
            <li>also bought this mask to my mom who has more wrinkles than I do</li>
            <li>This mask supports healthy, renewed, and rejuvenated skin cells.</li>
            <li>Tried this in a mall twice, I am sure a lot of people got pulled by these kiosks, they are everywhere, here in USA and in Germany.  </li>
            <li>There are much better products out there.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>maybe with time and more useage.</li>
            <li>Great works very well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product that is reasonably priced on Amazon - just don&#x27;t let the mall guys fool you...</li>
            <li>My fine lines disappear for weeks.  </li>
            <li>This product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Also, it is so cheap that if I want to, I can treat myself every week.  </li>
            <li>but it was a very fresh consistency,</li>
            <li>I use this product with the full line of premier products.  </li>
            <li>It is important to distribute the \\&quot;soap\\&quot; evenly on your face first, to get the thermal reaction with the clay paste.</li>
            <li>It was not near as good as Premiere.  </li>
            <li>so what if the mud is a bit hard to get on our finger or what have you, just get some and rub it gently in your skin, the result is what counts , not the convenience.. love it !!!!!!</li>
            <li>, the packaging was similar, it was kind of a knock-off</li>
            <li>Even so, it can be quite handy before a big event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its unique heating action purifies and cleanses your skin while battling free radicals that cause the skin to age.</li>
            <li>The hardcore sales kids at the mall are actually trying to sell this for $800-$1000 (not kidding!)You just rub the red mineral bar over a wet face, smooth the mask over (it gets warm immediately &amp; feels great), wipe it off after 2-5 minutes &amp; don&#x27;t rinse.</li>
            <li>After many years of trying a myriad of facial products including masks, I found the Premier line.</li>
            <li>but my skin is visibly better weeks later!</li>
            <li>but well my opinion doesn&#x27;t have to be yours ;)</li>
            <li>Too much!</li>
            <li>I love the warming effect and use it along with the facial serum and eye serum.</li>
            <li>Then I saw this woman at our local fair peddaling a very similar version</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last, but good before a big night.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fine lines are softer, at first I could not believe it as the seller was very clever, he applied it on one side of my face only.  </li>
            <li>The mask works really quickly and leaves your skin clear and tight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But in that short time, WOW-my pores disappeared, my skin was amazingly soft and my fine lines were almost invisible!</li>
            <li>Special active ingredients penetrate the heart of the skin cells to promote beautiful long lasting appearance.</li>
            <li>Fast service and was as advertised.</li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t really tell if it is a miracle mask against wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This mask really does what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>this stuff is amazing!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Premier Thermal Beauty Experience Mask opens the pores while absorbing dirt, oil, and toxins.</li>
            <li>Saw here on Amazon for much cheaper, ordered it, tried it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I originally thought it had gotten caught in the snow outside.</li>
            <li>something I had kind of struggled with on my first jar, especially when it started getting empty.  </li>
            <li>I highly doubt that there will exist a mask, cream, serum or whatever as real alternative to Botox</li>
            <li>First, I am \\&quot;just\\&quot; 25 years old.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the BIOX line...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all their products.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this a few times and haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference in fine lines, etc....</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash your face with the little round soap provided on the top section of the jar.  </li>
            <li>Feels great on your face, like it really is doing something, and right after my skin indeed looks like pores are smaller and small wrinkles less visible.</li>
            <li>When my product arrived ( it was brand new )</li>
            <li>This is the same exact formula that is sold at the malls out of kiosks.  </li>
            <li>So i will update this review if possible to tell the development on her wrinkles ;)</li>
            <li>This is the exact same product that is sold in shopping malls for hundreds of dollars.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely surprised about the condition.</li>
            <li>My skin is instantly tighter with less wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small \\&quot;soap\\&quot; smells a little funny to me, while the clay paste is pretty much without a smell, so it works out.</li>
            <li>To be honest I have had trouble with all the Premier containers, the serum pump out too much and is wasteful, the jars are hard to open and the facial cleaner I couldn&#x27;t get to pump at all!!</li>
            <li>I put it on one side of my face and it visibly lifted and smoothed and shrunk my large pores compared to the other side that was splotchy.</li>
            <li>The wife was accosted by a sales person on a recent trip to the local mall, nearly falling prey to the propaganda-quoting sales person.  </li>
            <li>I use the normal Premier serum afterwards and the Premier Moisture Cream for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The mask also appears to be a little drying, so I would caution against using it too much.</li>

            <li> /&gt;The mask also appears to be a little drying, so I would caution against using it too much.</li>
            <li> they guys did a total skin care regime on half of my face with several products in this line - I could not believe the difference in my skin immediately - I bought the entire line and spent about $1,000 but found it soooo much cheaper on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> An added bonus is that it only takes a total of about 5 minutes, between cleansing with the red bar and then applying the mask to a wet face and waiting about 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I have this mask when the cold winter will come to Europe</li>
            <li> I am curious</li>
            <li> I have cleaned it and have used it since that just appeared to be due to transportation.</li>
            <li> so I switch to other brand</li>
            <li> When she tracked me down to talk about the product before buying it, I immediately was suspicious due to the price.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product, however it seems there is very poor packing.</li>
            <li> I have a dream product at over half off.</li>
            <li> It seems to be the same as the expensive stuff, however mine did not have the red mineral bar.</li>
            <li> I use it on colder days (since it seems ridiculous to use a heating mask when it has 30°C outside...)</li>
            <li> when I opened it was a mess inside</li>
            <li> and it was  not cheap.</li>
            <li> It was missing.</li>
            <li> waste your money!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I paid about $200 for it and a small serum (wouldn&#x27;t buy that again).  </li>
            <li> One day I saw Premiere on Amazon and was very skeptical that it could be my miracle wrinkle warming creme for only $29?  </li>
            <li> The leaking was bad enough</li>
            <li> It took me about 2 years to use it as it was a monthly treat to me because it was so expensive-</li>
            <li> That is why I am skeptical.</li>
            <li> Item was opened and dirty.</li>
            <li> and I have used a lot of things that were very expensive.</li>
            <li> Bad experience.</li>
            <li> even thought I wanted it so bad.</li>
            <li> DISAPPOINTMENT!</li>
            <li> I dislike this stupid sales quote..</li>
            <li> Disgusting looking.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is really the most effective way to beautiful skin.  If you want to look more youthful, this is the product for you and your friends</li>
            <li> Bad experience. Item was opened and dirty. Absolutely surprised about the condition. Item returned. Disgusting looking.</li>
            <li> I really like the product, however it seems there is very poor packing. When my product arrived ( it was brand new ) it had leaked not only out of the box but through the postal wrapping. The leaking was bad enough I originally thought it had gotten caught in the snow outside. I feel I lost a good deal of the product and it was  not cheap. To be honest I have had trouble with all the Premier containers, the serum pump out too much and is wasteful, the jars are hard to open and the facial cleaner I couldn&#x27;t get to pump at all!! After all this I do have to say I love the products just fix the packing please</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. I put it on one side of my face and it visibly lifted and smoothed and shrunk my large pores compared to the other side that was splotchy. I am glad I did not spend 150 at the mall for this even thought I wanted it so bad. I am glad I waited. I have a dream product at over half off.</li>
            <li> This is the same exact formula that is sold at the malls out of kiosks.  I bought it years ago in Maui.  It took me about 2 years to use it as it was a monthly treat to me because it was so expensive-I paid about $200 for it and a small serum (wouldn&#x27;t buy that again).  Then I saw this woman at our local fair peddaling a very similar version, the packaging was similar, it was kind of a knock-off and that was a bargain for $100.  It was not near as good as Premiere.  One day I saw Premiere on Amazon and was very skeptical that it could be my miracle wrinkle warming creme for only $29?  What did I have to lose?  It was not only the same thing but it was a very fresh consistency, something I had kind of struggled with on my first jar, especially when it started getting empty.  My fine lines disappear for weeks.  Also, it is so cheap that if I want to, I can treat myself every week.  This is the best stuff that I have ever used and I have used a lot of things that were very expensive.</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding! After many years of trying a myriad of facial products including masks, I found the Premier line. At 54, I was experiencing a bit of acne around my chin...but that has disappeared. The mask is exceptional. An added bonus is that it only takes a total of about 5 minutes, between cleansing with the red bar and then applying the mask to a wet face and waiting about 3 minutes. The results are phenomenal...and immediate. This seller is also top-notch in every way. I highly recommend the BIOX line...it has worked wonders for my face.</li>
            <li> I use this product with the full line of premier products.  It&#x27;s great!  I highly recommend all their products.  Be sure to wash your face with the little round soap provided on the top section of the jar.  You get a better result.  Also, following the mask I use the biox serum and biox cream.  My skin is instantly tighter with less wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I switched from La Mer to this nightly cream --- that says it all! It is lightweight and smells and feels great. I like how my skin has responded.</li>
            <li> Feels great on your face, like it really is doing something, and right after my skin indeed looks like pores are smaller and small wrinkles less visible. Doesn&#x27;t last, but good before a big night.&lt;br /&gt; The package came leaking and the mask is almost unusably solid in places. I feel like I can use only about three quarters of the promised amount.</li>
            <li> This mask is great for a couple of reasons. One, it only has to stay on 2-3 minutes so you don&#x27;t have to block out an evening to do it. But in that short time, WOW-my pores disappeared, my skin was amazingly soft and my fine lines were almost invisible! I thought it wouldn&#x27;t last but my skin is visibly better weeks later! The hardcore sales kids at the mall are actually trying to sell this for $800-$1000 (not kidding!)You just rub the red mineral bar over a wet face, smooth the mask over (it gets warm immediately &amp; feels great), wipe it off after 2-5 minutes &amp; don&#x27;t rinse. I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this at the mall for over $300 a couple of years ago and loved it. I was very happy to see it on amazon for 1/10th the price. It seems to be the same as the expensive stuff, however mine did not have the red mineral bar. It was missing. It still works though and I will re order when I run out.</li>
            <li> This product shrinks your pores and tightens your skin temporarily. The effect wears out in about an hour or so. It is by no means a product that will give you lasting results. Even so, it can be quite handy before a big event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived in a leaky jar, and the box was damaged from moisture. I have cleaned it and have used it since that just appeared to be due to transportation. I am curious if others have experience this or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small \\&quot;soap\\&quot; smells a little funny to me, while the clay paste is pretty much without a smell, so it works out. It is important to distribute the \\&quot;soap\\&quot; evenly on your face first, to get the thermal reaction with the clay paste. The mask works really quickly and leaves your skin clear and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mask also appears to be a little drying, so I would caution against using it too much.</li>
            <li> Fast service and was as advertised.</li>
            <li> it a wonderful product, after wards , the skin feels so good and smooth......so what if the mud is a bit hard to get on our finger or what have you, just get some and rub it gently in your skin, the result is what counts , not the convenience.. love it !!!!!!</li>
            <li> First, I am \\&quot;just\\&quot; 25 years old. So I can&#x27;t really tell if it is a miracle mask against wrinkles. I highly doubt that there will exist a mask, cream, serum or whatever as real alternative to Botox but well my opinion doesn&#x27;t have to be yours ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the heating effect of the mask and it good for the circulation of the skin. My face feels relaxed afterwards. I use it on colder days (since it seems ridiculous to use a heating mask when it has 30°C outside...) and I am glad I have this mask when the cold winter will come to Europe again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the heating effect: I leave the mask on till the heating effect stops, so don&#x27;t look at the clock while you have the mask on and just relax during that time. I use the normal Premier serum afterwards and the Premier Moisture Cream for very dry skin. (One Biox product at my age is probably enough.)&lt;br /&gt;I also bought this mask to my mom who has more wrinkles than I do - she is almost 60 now. She loves the mask too - especially the way it makes her skin feel. So i will update this review if possible to tell the development on her wrinkles ;)</li>
            <li> This mask really does what it says it will do.  I found this stuff in a airline mall in Europe and they guys did a total skin care regime on half of my face with several products in this line - I could not believe the difference in my skin immediately - I bought the entire line and spent about $1,000 but found it soooo much cheaper on Amazon.  Use it according to the directions - check the manufacturer website - this stuff is amazing!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Premier Thermal Beauty Experience Mask opens the pores while absorbing dirt, oil, and toxins. Its unique heating action purifies and cleanses your skin while battling free radicals that cause the skin to age. Formulated to improve blood circulation within the cells and to target wrinkles. This mask supports healthy, renewed, and rejuvenated skin cells. Special active ingredients penetrate the heart of the skin cells to promote beautiful long lasting appearance. The results are stunning! Radiant, clean, and beautiful looking skin</li>
            <li> Tried this in a mall twice, I am sure a lot of people got pulled by these kiosks, they are everywhere, here in USA and in Germany.  When the seller tried it on my face at the mall, NO JOKE. Fine lines are softer, at first I could not believe it as the seller was very clever, he applied it on one side of my face only.  Was with my girlfriend too and she also commented on the same thing, that the side applied was smoother than the unapplied one. After that I went to have lunch to meet up with another friend of mine, she asked me why one side of my face seems smoother ( talking about crows feet area). Ha! Some days later went back again did another test. Same results. Now why did I not buy it from the mall? Cost 100 euros! Too much! Saw here on Amazon for much cheaper, ordered it, tried it. DISAPPOINTMENT! Soooo different! All it did was just warm up the face a teeny weeny bit. That is all! That is why I am skeptical. Did not buy from the mall cos I dislike this stupid sales quote..&#x27;This price 100 euros is only for you today!!!! Hmmmm.....are we in the Stone ages??? Anyways did not work for me, maybe for others.</li>
            <li> There are much better products out there.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money!!&lt;br /&gt;I prefer Clinique products for the money-they actually work</li>
            <li> This is the exact same product that is sold in shopping malls for hundreds of dollars.  The wife was accosted by a sales person on a recent trip to the local mall, nearly falling prey to the propaganda-quoting sales person.  When she tracked me down to talk about the product before buying it, I immediately was suspicious due to the price.  I checked the Amazon price on my smartphone and showed her the difference - she was amazed at the racket they have going on.  Since she had tested the product at the mall kiosk already, I went ahead and ordered it from Amazon on the spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the package arrived she confirmed that it was the identical product and has been very pleased with the results.  It&#x27;s a good product that is reasonably priced on Amazon - just don&#x27;t let the mall guys fool you...</li>
            <li> I have only used this a few times and haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference in fine lines, etc....maybe with time and more useage.</li>
            <li> Great works very well</li>
            <li> I dint use it came all damaged it wasn&#x27;t well packed and when I opened it was a mess inside I called the vendor and he didn&#x27;t care she said that her manager don&#x27;t give her permit ion to return or exchange so I switch to other brand</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I love the warming effect and use it along with the facial serum and eye serum.</li>
