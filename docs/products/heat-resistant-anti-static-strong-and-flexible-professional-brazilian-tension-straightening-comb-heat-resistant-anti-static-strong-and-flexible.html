            <li>broke very easily just by combing through my hair</li>
            <li>This comb offers the perfect amount of tension needed to do the job.</li>
            <li>The colored section of the handle is a separate piece of plastic, which may look better in pictures, but makes the product weaker.</li>
            <li>I heard of the jeegol comb from my sister who couldn&#x27;t stop talking about it, I decided to give it a try it worked out perfectly better than described.</li>
            <li>I think imma get some more for my family</li>

            <li>i can hold it better</li>

            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but after trying this I was absolutely amazed!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Comfortable hand grip, durable design, and aesthetically pleasing.  </li>
            <li>cheap</li>
            <li>This worked perfectly; fabulous salon finish.</li>
            <li>This comb is flimsy &amp; cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>This comb had good reviews, &amp; many say they used it for the same purpose...</li>
            <li>and I think it is great assisting in the flat ironing process</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t sure how to use it at first</li>
            <li>Fantastic iron and works quickly on the hair.</li>
            <li>My hair feels amd looks much healthier now since I dont use any more chemicals to straighten and kill my hair.</li>
            <li>The best machine I ever bought works amazing and crazy</li>
            <li>The wand end is great for picking up sections of hair and running the straightener over without having to use your hands, and the comb helps pull the hair straight for the flat iron to go</li>
            <li>I have short hair, and I love this comb!  </li>
            <li>thought about how useful it would be to have one again and use it with a hair straightener.</li>
            <li>For such a cheap price, I was surprised by the quality and the ability to straighten my hair quite nicely.</li>
            <li>its more durable and strong than the other tension combs you used, it straightens your hair like nothing you have ever used before.</li>
            <li>This comb makes it a lot easier and quicker for me to get super straight hair.</li>
            <li>if I have to blow dry, works great on wet or dry hair, and I don&#x27;t get tangles or static even on hair as fine as mine!  </li>
            <li>Just got back from a trip and it was the most helpful product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>I had something similar to this more than 10 years ago</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t straighten my hair too often because it&#x27;s time consuming and hot.</li>
            <li>In combination with my flat iron this got my hair very smooth.</li>
            <li>I use keratin treatments every few months, so my hair isn&#x27;t in it&#x27;s natural state (ever, lol).  </li>
            <li>but it is kind of hard to use especially when doing your own hair, I will keep working at it to get the hang of it</li>
            <li>Much easier to have someone else use it on you</li>
            <li>but once to get it straight</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference in the time it takes to straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this comb along with my flat iron has been fantastic.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cool, especially if your hair holds heat like mine.</li>
            <li>now that I have it, I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Just in one spot though (happened after I got pregnant years ago and ever went back).</li>
            <li>Seems very sturdy, I will update in a few more months to let you know how it is holding up.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s like a must have with natural to help detangle the ends of hair to get it bone straight.</li>
            <li>My hair is normally unmanageable.</li>
            <li>The right amount of tension is the key to straightening your hair.</li>
            <li>Just got to be careful since it can really get very hot.</li>
            <li>The air is extremely dry where I live right now, and my hair isn&#x27;t standing straight up when I use this tool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of hair &#x27;gadgets&#x27;, and have used the same products and styling tools for years and years, but this was one new &#x27;gadget&#x27; that I absolutely needed.</li>
            <li>I have pretty straight hair, but the underneath part of my hair is EXTREMELY curly.</li>
            <li>but it is huge and great for thick hair but not for thin short hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier to use a brush or regular</li>
            <li>6 times so far</li>
            <li>and I could never get it straight enough (4c hair).</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s much easier than trying to use a regular comb when using my flatiron</li>
            <li>her salon specialilizes permanent straightening, so she uses it frequently</li>
            <li>My hair feels silky soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Takes one swipe of flat iron and my hair are perfectly straight.</li>
            <li>It took a little getting used to, but I quickly got the hang of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really rigid, so you have to make an effort to get it back to the open</li>
            <li>I used to spend a lot of time trying to flat iron but with this it took a lot less time, made my hair much straighter and sooo soft.</li>
            <li>It last just as long as a full blow out (super expensive).</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I bought this because it was recommended for using with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I used this comb while straightening my daughters hair with a flat iron</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to get used to handling it.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m a white female, with thick, unruly (wavy/frizzy) natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a very hard time straightening my hair, and this tool is very helpful!</li>
            <li> If you have really long and a lot of hair and have no time to visit every single week the salon this is for you!</li>
            <li> I use the flat end to gather hair then squeeze the comb down to straighten it out before using my hair straightener to do the rest.</li>
            <li> just not what I  expected.</li>
            <li> probably could get used to the awkwardness, but the bigger issue is that the comb has uneven plastic seams which snag my hair.  </li>
            <li> I misread the product desciption but did find this item helpful with straightening my hair, but a little hard to use at the same time with heating products because one hand has to maneuver the item while the other works the heat product.</li>
            <li> but if you have thick medium to long hair go for it</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair with very tight curls.</li>
            <li> A little flimsy</li>
            <li> but I got the hang of it in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very, very difficult to get this part of my hair perfectly straight since it&#x27;s so curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this at least.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick hair</li>
            <li> I find this really awkward to hold while flat ironing my hair.</li>
            <li> I would totaly reccomend this to my friends, and for this price you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> With that said, however, this comb was absolutely useless for me.  </li>
            <li> Completely useless for the intents &amp; purposes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to keep using it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> just not what I  expected.</li>
            <li> more complicated than I thought to use myself.  Much easier to have someone else use it on you</li>
            <li> If you have really long and a lot of hair and have no time to visit every single week the salon this is for you! You save time and it help to manage your hair with the hair straightener!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was recommended for using with a flat iron.  I find this really awkward to hold while flat ironing my hair. It&#x27;s much easier to use a brush or regular comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably could get used to the awkwardness, but the bigger issue is that the comb has uneven plastic seams which snag my hair.

            <li> I used this comb while straightening my daughters hair with a flat iron and it worked very nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have curly hair and this straightener smooths my hair within minutes! Just got back from a trip and it was the most helpful product!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Must buy!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use and my hair is shinier and softer</li>
            <li> its wonderful but it is huge and great for thick hair but not for thin short hair but if you have thick medium to long hair go for it</li>
            <li> My hair dresser showed me this tool last time I went in for a cut. I have pretty straight hair, but the underneath part of my hair is EXTREMELY curly. Just in one spot though (happened after I got pregnant years ago and ever went back). It&#x27;s very, very difficult to get this part of my hair perfectly straight since it&#x27;s so curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this comb along with my flat iron has been fantastic. It took a little getting used to, but I quickly got the hang of it. The wand end is great for picking up sections of hair and running the straightener over without having to use your hands, and the comb helps pull the hair straight for the flat iron to go over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this was an awesome purchase. I&#x27;m not a fan of hair &#x27;gadgets&#x27;, and have used the same products and styling tools for years and years, but this was one new &#x27;gadget&#x27; that I absolutely needed. I use it every time I wash and straighten my hair...now that I have it, I couldn&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I have short hair, and I love this comb!  It holds up to heat if I have to blow dry, works great on wet or dry hair, and I don&#x27;t get tangles or static even on hair as fine as mine!  Comfortable hand grip, durable design, and aesthetically pleasing.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Straightens like a Dream!!!!!!!! I have used this at least. 6 times so far With No problems. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> broke very easily just by combing through my hair</li>
            <li> It pulls my hair whenever I use it. It&#x27;s really rigid, so you have to make an effort to get it back to the open position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the colors and idea, but the product is overpriced.</li>
            <li> The Jeegol Tension Comb is acceptable.  The colored section of the handle is a separate piece of plastic, which may look better in pictures, but makes the product weaker.</li>
            <li> I heard of the jeegol comb from my sister who couldn&#x27;t stop talking about it, I decided to give it a try it worked out perfectly better than described.</li>
            <li> The best machine I ever bought works amazing and crazy cheap I think imma get some more for my family On</li>
            <li> Quality product! Love it.</li>
            <li> I like this tool but it is kind of hard to use especially when doing your own hair, I will keep working at it to get the hang of it but I like it.</li>
            <li> Great comb!  Takes one swipe of flat iron and my hair are perfectly straight.</li>
            <li> It worked just ok for my 4C hair.</li>
            <li> A little flimsy but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I give this product a 5 star. its more durable and strong than the other tension combs you used, it straightens your hair like nothing you have ever used before. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I got a couple wigs that I love but sometime my girls get a bit frizzy, My sister showed me the jeegol and I loved it, Is great!</li>
            <li> Just bought this hair straightner three weeks ago to try it out and I got to say I am loving it. What used to takes me hours now gets done in minutes. My hair feels amd looks much healthier now since I dont use any more chemicals to straighten and kill my hair. It last just as long as a full blow out (super expensive). I would totaly reccomend this to my friends, and for this price you cant go wrong. Seems very sturdy, I will update in a few more months to let you know how it is holding up.</li>
            <li> In combination with my flat iron this got my hair very smooth. I never thought of this but it&#x27;s like a must have with natural to help detangle the ends of hair to get it bone straight.</li>
            <li> For such a cheap price, I was surprised by the quality and the ability to straighten my hair quite nicely. Great buy, thank you!</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for. The right amount of tension is the key to straightening your hair. This comb offers the perfect amount of tension needed to do the job. My daughter has thick hair and I could never get it straight enough (4c hair). This worked perfectly; fabulous salon finish. Will definitely buy another one for a back-up.</li>
            <li> Fantastic iron and works quickly on the hair. Just got to be careful since it can really get very hot.</li>
            <li> This comb makes it a lot easier and quicker for me to get super straight hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. I have a very hard time straightening my hair, and this tool is very helpful! It does help with static too. The air is extremely dry where I live right now, and my hair isn&#x27;t standing straight up when I use this tool.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! My hair is normally unmanageable. I used to spend a lot of time trying to flat iron but with this it took a lot less time, made my hair much straighter and sooo soft. Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this about once or twice and I think it is great assisting in the flat ironing process, it&#x27;s much easier than trying to use a regular comb when using my flatiron and I find that I don&#x27;t have to pass the iron through my hair but once to get it straight and maybe a second time to just bend or curl my hair! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair with very tight curls. this actually makes straightening my hair a lot easier with my straightening iron&lt;br /&gt; I sent one to my mother who owns a salon in los angeles. She loves it, too. her salon specialilizes permanent straightening, so she uses it frequently</li>
            <li> I had something similar to this more than 10 years ago but it was a brush on both ends and I used it with a blow dryer to straighten my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought about how useful it would be to have one again and use it with a hair straightener. I started my search for it again when I stumbled upon this item.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t sure how to use it at first but I got the hang of it in just a few minutes. I use the flat end to gather hair then squeeze the comb down to straighten it out before using my hair straightener to do the rest. It really does make a difference in the time it takes to straighten my hair.  I don&#x27;t straighten my hair too often because it&#x27;s time consuming and hot. This item makes it a lot easier.&lt;br /&gt;I do use it every day now to straighten my bangs which never looked better. No more hot hands or burnt fingers with this item. I would and have recommend this to anyone who owns a hair straightener. I&#x27;ve had this comb for only about 2 weeks but it is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> This comb is excellent to use when flat ironing hair, using the chasing method.</li>
            <li> Nice one but i still need to know how to crab it ,, i&#x27;m used to use my hair brush i can hold it better</li>
            <li> Allows me to pass my flatiron through my hair once.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect but after trying this I was absolutely amazed!!! My hair feels silky soft afterwards. Makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had this long enough to get used to handling it.</li>
            <li> I misread the product desciption but did find this item helpful with straightening my hair, but a little hard to use at the same time with heating products because one hand has to maneuver the item while the other works the heat product. Once you get the hang of it it&#x27;s cool, especially if your hair holds heat like mine.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for when I apply keratin treatments to my hair.  This comb had good reviews, &amp; many say they used it for the same purpose... Well, I&#x27;m a white female, with thick, unruly (wavy/frizzy) natural hair.  I use keratin treatments every few months, so my hair isn&#x27;t in it&#x27;s natural state (ever, lol).  With that said, however, this comb was absolutely useless for me.  It pulled my hair &amp; I just gave up &amp; went back to using a regular comb.  This comb is flimsy &amp; cheaply made.  No quality here.  Completely useless for the intents &amp; purposes I had in mind.</li>
