    <ol>
            <li>very good for costume.</li>
            <li>and it looked great.</li>
            <li>and It did not settle on my hair very nicely</li>
            <li>Still, amazing color!</li>
            <li>my daughters loved it</li>
            <li>/&gt;The day that it arrived was sooner than the estimated delivery date, so I am VERY pleased with that.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a nice color and it stays on for a night out.</li>
            <li>Nice color</li>
            <li>The product itself it really cool and washed out very easily!</li>
            <li>Do NOT spray this indoors, and if you do, make sure you have a ventilation fan running and a dust mask on.  </li>
            <li>I ordered more, and I&#x27;m doing the costume again for a party, this time with shorter and thinner(layered) hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfectly washable even from white fabrics, but keep this in mind when deciding what to wear</li>
            <li>that are 4 inches more than shoulder length)&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw this!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take very much to spray on my child&#x27;s hair and showed up nicely.  </li>
            <li>This is actually my first amazon order on my own account, so that added to the excitment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i have light brown hair</li>
            <li>but I am sure it would have rinsed right out....</li>
            <li>The color looks very nice, but you need to use it considering that:&lt;br /&gt;(1) spray in an open environment, the spray will go everywhere, coloring everything</li>
            <li>color, fun to play around with, doesn&#x27;t damage your hair, washes out easily, and its PINK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I logged that in order to cover my full head I&#x27;d have to but three cans instead of two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only good if your using it for your bangs</li>
            <li>and it was super vibrant, washed out easily.</li>
            <li>I bought the bright pink color.</li>
            <li>students went nuts when I went to school that morning as I promised to color my hair pink if they were able to achieve something as a whole class :)</li>
            <li>the colour washed right out on the first wash</li>
            <li>The spray seems to last longer than the chalk (but still love chalk too).</li>
            <li>this was exactly what i wanted.</li>
            <li>It was the perfect color pink and it came out with a few brushings....  </li>
            <li>Cut a hole on the top that is big enough for my head to fit</li>
            <li>This spray color is vibrant!</li>
            <li>I had too much hair for the two little cans to handle, but I liked what I saw.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>:) but i think that is to be expected since you are spraying colored liquid chalk around the room.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really cover well and came out very &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I found it very tricky to spray just parts of my hair with out spraying it all over and on my hands.</li>
            <li>colour was so vibrant and went well with my intended costume.</li>
            <li>(I had to dry clean the winter jacket, my fault....</li>
            <li>Really good coverage - my hair was pink with little effort.    </li>
            <li>I bought this the first time last month.</li>
            <li>I got home, I spent a good hour cleaning my small bathroom.</li>
            <li>Bought this product for my seven year old twin girls.</li>
            <li>My husband used half of the can and pretty much did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so there would be no mess.  </li>
            <li>This was my first experience with temp color spray (usually use chalk) and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It took me multiple sprays to get it vibrant and when it was on my hair as soon as I brushed or combed it out</li>
            <li>general</li>
            <li>pink boogers will occur  for real.</li>
            <li>Only one real issue with it - pink dust gets EVERYWHERE, wherever you spray it.  </li>
            <li>but you need to spray for a long time to cover and that was tricky with out getting super messy</li>
            <li>Worked really well for my kids medium to dark hair.  </li>
            <li>Arrived fast and worked well on dark hair</li>
            <li>I used the whole can and only a little dye was left in my hair</li>

            <li> I was really surprised at how... odd the odor was.</li>
            <li> It made a huge mess, feels exactly like hair spray, and is impossible to get off your skin.</li>
            <li> I used red, pink and gold with glitter.  </li>
            <li> So I sprayed my kids hair with red or pink and touched up with gold to get a glitter effect</li>

            <li> Though with the blue and the purple I ordered there was a *little* colored dust, the pink created a veritable cloud of pink that got on and in everything around where the stuff was sprayed.    </li>

            <li> some things still are pink (from oversight, not staining).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , pink never came out.</li>
            <li> Messy, so may want to spray outside.</li>
            <li> I got this pink hair color for my granddaughter&#x27;s birthday,Since she just turned eight and wanted pink hair ,we didn&#x27;t want to use  anything permanent.</li>
            <li> I read all the other reviews and decided to:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll need at least two cans if you don&#x27;t have short hair (I used two for mine</li>
            <li> It also went down the can and everywhere.</li>
            <li> I have black hair</li>
            <li> Messy to put on and just tangled their hair while colouring it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Problem was, I was spitting pink and after being outside (it&#x27;s cold)</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this to people I truly hate.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product, we were trying to get pink hair for a breast cancer tournament.</li>
            <li> It was too cold to bathe him</li>
            <li> The WORST product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I bought the bright pink color. I read all the other reviews and decided to:&lt;br /&gt;1. Spray outdoors.&lt;br /&gt;2. Ask for another person&#x27;s help.&lt;br /&gt;3. Style my hair up prior to spraying so I don&#x27;t have to touch it after the application (I put my hair up in a pony tail).&lt;br /&gt;4. Wear my outfit for the day (or night).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I got a garbage bag. Cut a hole on the top that is big enough for my head to fit so it covered my upper body. I then held the garbage bag up from my neck to cover my face, only exposing my hair to be sprayed. My husband used half of the can and pretty much did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My students went nuts when I went to school that morning as I promised to color my hair pink if they were able to achieve something as a whole class :) I would order this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> Worked really well for my kids medium to dark hair.  I applied the hair paint outside so there would be no mess.  It didn&#x27;t take very much to spray on my child&#x27;s hair and showed up nicely.  As it dries, it does fade some, but Hair still looks colored.  I used red, pink and gold with glitter.  The gold with glitter didn&#x27;t work.  The glitter was visible and that was it.  So I sprayed my kids hair with red or pink and touched up with gold to get a glitter effect and it looked great.</li>
            <li> Really good coverage - my hair was pink with little effort.    Only one real issue with it - pink dust gets EVERYWHERE, wherever you spray it.  Though with the blue and the purple I ordered there was a *little* colored dust, the pink created a veritable cloud of pink that got on and in everything around where the stuff was sprayed.    Do NOT spray this indoors, and if you do, make sure you have a ventilation fan running and a dust mask on.  Otherwise, you&#x27;re guaranteed to inhale pink.    Still, amazing color!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with temp color spray (usually use chalk) and I really like it. The spray seems to last longer than the chalk (but still love chalk too). This spray color is vibrant!</li>
            <li> I bought this the first time last month. I had too much hair for the two little cans to handle, but I liked what I saw.&lt;br /&gt;The colour was so vibrant and went well with my intended costume. I logged that in order to cover my full head I&#x27;d have to but three cans instead of two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem was, I was spitting pink and after being outside (it&#x27;s cold) my nose also ran pink. I&#x27;m definitely acquiring a dust mask.&lt;br /&gt;When I got home, I spent a good hour cleaning my small bathroom. Everything was pink- some things still are pink (from oversight, not staining).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the colour washed right out on the first wash like it&#x27;s supposed to. I ordered more, and I&#x27;m doing the costume again for a party, this time with shorter and thinner(layered) hair. I&#x27;ll offer some pictures, maybe, if I get any.</li>
            <li> my daughters loved it</li>
            <li> You would have to use a lot of this product to get the desired look on the picture. Get all over clothes, will want to wash it out before sleeping.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw this! This is actually my first amazon order on my own account, so that added to the excitment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day that it arrived was sooner than the estimated delivery date, so I am VERY pleased with that. The product itself it really cool and washed out very easily! As far as I can tell, it stayed in my hair until I got it wet. I also like how it&#x27;s NOT a permanent thing and doesn&#x27;t damage your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS -&lt;br /&gt;Cool color, fun to play around with, doesn&#x27;t damage your hair, washes out easily, and its PINK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS -&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I dislike about this product is the smell. I was really surprised at how... odd the odor was. It wasn&#x27;t an unbearable smell, but its not something I want people to think I smell like. If you wear this in public, or for any type of occasion I would suggest spraying it on about 30 minutes before you leave the house, giving time to let the odor wear off.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my seven year old twin girls. Messy to put on and just tangled their hair while colouring it. Minute you brush the hair after it is colours the chalk comes off and gets all over your clothes and skin. Don&#x27;t recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> I have black hair and It did not settle on my hair very nicely It took me multiple sprays to get it vibrant and when it was on my hair as soon as I brushed or combed it out it came out my hair I used the whole can and only a little dye was left in my hair I have had the color in my hair for while and it continuesly keeps on coming out my hair I wore a white shirt and it was rubbing onto my shirt I would not recommend this product it&#x27;s only good if your using it for your bangs but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Used this on my horse for a breast cancer ride.  It was the perfect color pink and it came out with a few brushings....  It was too cold to bathe him but I am sure it would have rinsed right out....</li>
            <li> very good for costume. i had this is my hair for Gamora from guardians of the galaxy cosplay. but it did stain the shirt i wore while i was doing my hair, pink never came out. be in ventilated area because... pink boogers will occur  for real.</li>
            <li> The color looks very nice, but you need to use it considering that:&lt;br /&gt;(1) spray in an open environment, the spray will go everywhere, coloring everything&lt;br /&gt;(2) if you have long hair, it&#x27;s going to color your cloth. It&#x27;s perfectly washable even from white fabrics, but keep this in mind when deciding what to wear (I had to dry clean the winter jacket, my fault....)&lt;br /&gt;(3) you&#x27;ll need at least two cans if you don&#x27;t have short hair (I used two for mine that are 4 inches more than shoulder length)&lt;br /&gt;In general it&#x27;s a nice color and it stays on for a night out.</li>
            <li> The WORST product I have ever used. It made a huge mess, feels exactly like hair spray, and is impossible to get off your skin. The color is hideous. Absolutely terrible. I would only recommend this to people I truly hate.</li>
            <li> this was exactly what i wanted. i have light brown hair and it was super vibrant, washed out easily. it does get on everything though. :) but i think that is to be expected since you are spraying colored liquid chalk around the room.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really cover well and came out very &amp;#34;clumpy&amp;#34;. Disappointed in this product, we were trying to get pink hair for a breast cancer tournament.</li>
            <li> Wore hair in bun and can fully covered entire head with lots to spare.  Messy, so may want to spray outside.</li>
            <li> just what I needed for breast cancer bike ride</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and worked well on dark hair</li>
            <li> I found it very tricky to spray just parts of my hair with out spraying it all over and on my hands. It also went down the can and everywhere. Nice color though but you need to spray for a long time to cover and that was tricky with out getting super messy</li>
            <li> I got this pink hair color for my granddaughter&#x27;s birthday,Since she just turned eight and wanted pink hair ,we didn&#x27;t want to use  anything permanent.</li>
