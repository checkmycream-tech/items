            <li>My hair was soft and silky and very manageable which is saying a lot since it is very fine.</li>

            <li>I have highlights and use a straightening iron on my hair pretty regularly, and this product makes my hair feel so healthy.</li>

            <li> If you have long hair you won&#x27;t be sorry, definitely worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> Because it came in a tiny little bottle with no applicator I just dipped my finger in and used what was on it.  </li>
            <li> My hair before was dull, stringy, lifeless and now it&#x27;s rich, thick and silky!</li>
            <li> I pump a bunch of this out and distribute it through dry hair, then put my hair in a processing cap and leave it for a half hour.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This has a bit of an odor, not unlike the odor of other N. 4 hair products.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to apply to my hair because my hair wants to soak it all up.  </li>

            <li> Works well with shampoo and conditioner. My hair is beautiful and shiny. Very pleased with product line. Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This conditioner allows my hair much more manageability and much less frizz.  It is smooth and shiny, without a keratin treatment!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this with a recent BirchBox. I was hesitant to try it because these things rarely work well on my hair but I gave it a go. Because it came in a tiny little bottle with no applicator I just dipped my finger in and used what was on it.  The consistency is like a conditioner mixed with a creme, it&#x27;s very thick.  I massaged it between both hands and applied it to my hair from the roots to the ends and left it on while I did the rest of my shower things (about 3 minutes).  Once done I rinsed it out and I could immediately tell the difference. My hair just flowed through my fingers like satin, no tangles, perfectly smooth, and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, you can get that from a good conditioner.  What makes this different is that it carries on after your hair is dry.  I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my hair for two days because it felt so amazing.  Now, with my hair (which was past my tailbone at the time) it made it so silky smooth that I couldn&#x27;t do much with it (which is a good thing).  It was perfectly happy just being there and being beautifully soft.  I use it once every 1-2 weeks now to revitalize my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I ordered the large size you see above (it has a pump head so it&#x27;s easy to dispense) and I gave the sample to my mother who has very fine hair about shoulder length and she used it once and found her hair was much more manageable and she was able to do things with her hair that she never could have.  So she used it again the next day and had the same experience.  She&#x27;s now using it almost every day and loves what it does for her hair.  She said she has never had hair this amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this masque, while $50 may seem expensive this is an amazing deal for what it will do for you and the 5.1 oz bottle should last around a year.  I use 1.5 pumps in my hair (it&#x27;s now mid back length) and each pump is about a quarter size dollop.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much. I asked my hairdresser what the best stuff for my hair and she recommended this product to me. I color-dye and put heat to my hair often so I need something that really helps with the damage...this stuff definitely works. You know how you get a product and it works pretty good but its not everlasting?.....Well this product feels like it doesn&#x27;t wash away.....it feels like it sticks in my hair and even after I wash it out, feels healthy.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this  brand and their masque, but the one that came from this seller was terrible. It was so thick i could not get any product out! Very dissapointed:((</li>
            <li> This conditioner is outstanding.  It&#x27;s expensive for such a small amount but my hair smells unbelievable&lt;br /&gt;All day because of it.  Great seller.  Quick ship.</li>
            <li> Quality product with a really rich, yet neutral scent. My hair grew very well while using this as it didn&#x27;t break as easily as it has with other products.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with the comb as advertised, so that was a bummer. Other than that is a great product for thick curly hair that needs a little TLC.</li>
            <li> It is very expensive, but it is amazing.  It&#x27;s not meant for daily use, so keep in mind it will last a long time.  It is the best hair product I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t rate it myself but my girlfriend really loves this produce.  I goes a long way also according to her.</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo and conditioner but feel this made my hair a little rough. Also it is hard to get the product out.</li>
            <li> Finally, a hair product/line that I&#x27;ve been looking for! It&#x27;s AMAZING. This is now the third product I&#x27;ve bought from them in two weeks. My hair before was dull, stringy, lifeless and now it&#x27;s rich, thick and silky! No parabens or sulfates, it smells great and a little goes a long way. Worth every penny. I&#x27;m SOLD! I have the Clarifying shampoo, Volumizing conditioner and now the Reconstructing masque. Ahhh how I love it!</li>
            <li> Phenomenal hair mask. Left my hair feeling silky soft and didn&#x27;t weigh it down. Adding this to my weakly pampering routine.</li>
            <li> Like others here I received a sample of this in my monthly Birchbox.  I immediately fell in love.  My hair is so silky and soft, I&#x27;ll be buying this again.  The full size on Birchbox website is $50 so this is a bargain and a half.  If you have long hair you won&#x27;t be sorry, definitely worth the cost.  I gave it a &#x27;4&#x27; because I didn&#x27;t get a comb.  If you&#x27;re going to post a picture for your product you should probably make sure you send what is pictured.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product in a Birchbox shipment, and bought the bigger size once my sample packet ran out. I&#x27;m not usually one to splurge on beauty products, but this hair masque is worth every penny. My hair has never felt this soft in my life. I have highlights and use a straightening iron on my hair pretty regularly, and this product makes my hair feel so healthy. I don&#x27;t know why anyone would review this negatively. Although it&#x27;s expensive, you get what you pay for. My hair feels like it does after the salon. I hope they never stop making this!</li>
            <li> As with many other reviewers I received a sample of Lumiere&#x27;s reconstructing masque and I love it! Basically you put it on your newly washed hair and then wait two to five minutes (I did five mintues each time I used the sample) then rinse it out. My hair was soft and silky and very manageable which is saying a lot since it is very fine.</li>
            <li> Love this product, leaves hair shiny, bouncy and smelling beautiful....amazing product.</li>
            <li> I have been (mis)using this as a deep conditioner instead of a hair mask, and I love what it does for my hair.  I pump a bunch of this out and distribute it through dry hair, then put my hair in a processing cap and leave it for a half hour.  It&#x27;s a little difficult to apply to my hair because my hair wants to soak it all up.  But I have to say, when I&#x27;m all done (I shampoo and use regular conditioner afterwards), my hair looks and feels wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has a bit of an odor, not unlike the odor of other N. 4 hair products.  It doesn&#x27;t linger.  You do have to use quite a lot if you are putting it on dry hair, but the container will last longer if you use it as intended (as a hair mask, that is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the actual full ingredients list since only the highlights are on the products page:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Cetearyl Alcohol, Cyclopentasiloxane, Dicetyldimonium Chloride, Polysorbate 60, Glycereth-26, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Brassicamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Cetrimonium Chloride, Lactamidopropyl Trimonium Chloride, Cyclohexasiloxane, Fragrance, Divinyldimethicone/Dimethicone Copolymer, Amodimethicone, Cetrimonium Bromide, Jojoba Esters, Methyl Gluceth-20, Panthenol, Behentrimonium Chloride, Dimethiconol, Gluconolactone, Citric Acid, Guar Hydroxypropyltrimonium Chloride, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, C11-15 Pareth-7, Sodium Benzoate, Shea Butter, PEG-45M, Polyquaternium- 37, Laureth-9, Propylene Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate, Glycerin, Benzyl Salicylate, Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil, Mango Seed Butter, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Trideceth-12, C12-13 Pareth-23, C12-13 Pareth-3, Linalool, Hydroxyisohexyl 3-Cyclohexene Carboxaldehyde, Coconut Oil, Jojoba Seed Oil, PPG-1 Trideceth-6, Sunflower Seed Oil, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate, Macrocystis Pyrifera Extract, Black Currant Leaf Extract, Yogurt Extract, Arctium Lappa Root Extract, Camellia Sinensis Leaf Extract, Carrageenan Extract, Euterpe Oleracea Fruit Extract, Garcinia Mangostana Peel Extract, Hibiscus Sabdariffa Flower Extract, Ilex Paraguariensis Leaf Extract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is free of parabens and dyes but does contain silicones, so whether you will want to use this depends on what ingredients you are willing to accept.  Silicones happen to help my hair a lot.  I have thick, waist-length, color treated hair.  It tends to get dry because I wash it every day.  I&#x27;ve been using this once a week and wish I could use it more often (but time doesn&#x27;t allow for that, sadly).  Also, this product appears to maintain quality even if it is a bit old, and it is one of the few cosmetic or haircare items I would gladly use even past any expiration date.  So if you can find a closeout deal on older product, it should still be in pretty good shape (that&#x27;s what I did).bdariffa Flower Extract, Ilex Paraguariensis Leaf Extract&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is free of parabens and dyes but does contain silicones, so whether you will want to use this depends on what ingredients you are willing to accept.

            <li> I use No. 4&#x27;s Fleur de Temps shampoo and conditioner every other day and then use this mask in place of the conditioner once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two uses of this hair mask I found my hair to be shinier, stronger, and almost split end free. You only have to leave it on for 3-5 minutes so there is no having to wait around for the product to complete itself. While I do usually follow up with Paul Mitchell tea tree leave in conditioner on normal days, when I use this mask I find I do not have to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be a No. 4 user for life, and this is just another great product from their excellent line.</li>
