            <li>and I just love the smell!</li>
            <li>Love how this product made my skin feel!  </li>
            <li>It smells good, comes in a good sized bottle, and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>The product smells great and feels fantastic on my skin - I have noticed that my skin seems smoother and brighter after using this for a week.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the citrus smell this one has.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product the moment I opened the bottle and smelled the lemony citrus fragrence.</li>
            <li>I liked the packaging, though I did not receive a box.</li>
            <li>And it has a nice design, which I always appreciate.</li>
            <li>The price is really affordable which I like and the packaging is excellent.</li>
            <li>If you want to try something cheap and effective this is great.</li>
            <li>I wake up with very smooth skin and love it!</li>
            <li>It was very easy to apply as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also using it to smooth out my thighs since I heard some of the ingredients are good for cellulite.</li>
            <li>It does have a nice refreshing feeling (probably from the aloe that&#x27;s in it).</li>
            <li>The smell and texture are pleasant and clean, and my skin feels refreshed.</li>
            <li>Best of all, it smells like oranges leaving your face feeling light, refreshed, and looking vibrant!</li>
            <li>Makes skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very smooth in the areas I have applied the serum to.</li>
            <li>The first bottle was fantastic; loved the non-greasy formula and the light citrus scent was very, very nice.</li>
            <li>My skin appeared more even and smoother after using the serum.</li>
            <li>These aging skin issues may be better</li>
            <li>and I love how my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li>I slathered it all over my face and it felt so refreshing and moist.</li>
            <li>I would love if they could change the smell...</li>
            <li>This serum smells great and goes on to your skin very well.</li>
            <li>so I am confident that in the longer term it will help reverse some of the effects of aging and the sun.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any reduction in wrinkles, but that might take more time.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this product as I apply it to my face.  </li>
            <li>Using this product was a lovely experience.</li>
            <li>It has more of a watery consistency versus creamy.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this one wayyyy more though.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with only one application.</li>
            <li>I love citrus smell.</li>
            <li>I like the packaging of this product &amp; the smell of it is really refreshing.</li>
            <li>I look forward to writing another review in 3 weeks to share some more results :) A+++</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll recommend to friends and family :)</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t have a pamphlet with more details.</li>
            <li>I just ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li>there- so far, so good!</li>
            <li>All in all I would say this product is great for someone looking for a extremely light, non greasy, easily absorb-able, fresh smelling serum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also smells nice (a mild orangey citrus smell) and is inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, i am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it and the smooth way it goes on.  </li>
            <li>It smells very good, for other people their batch smelled more like orange, but mine smells like orange upfront but much more like lilac/light floral which I like.</li>
            <li>Clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to also take with you when your traveling.</li>
            <li>The serum helped my skin feel rejuvenated and reduced my fine lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li>Seems like it would work fine under makeup.</li>
            <li>After about a months use I started to see a decrease in the fine lines in my face.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly!  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic, the consistency is smooth and it&#x27;s light under my make up.</li>
            <li>but otherwise I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>It smells great, similar to oranges.</li>
            <li>I can say that it feels light once applied.</li>
            <li>It looks goopy but soaks into your face and feels light, not greasy when it dries.  </li>
            <li>I could feel and see that my skin was firmer, yet silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>Overall, I had a great experience with purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>For the price and the amount you get, I think this is a great deal even if it only makes my skin softer.</li>
            <li>It was light and fragrant and a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>this felt really light on my face.  </li>
            <li>I do like that the serum is light and smells like what I would imagine Vitamin C to smell like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really light</li>
            <li>What I&#x27;m impressed with is the quick absorption and the feeling that nothing is being wasted or that it is watered down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was excited to try out this product.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel fresh!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see how it will continue to improve my skin over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have liked it better if the instructions had a bigger font!</li>
            <li>The smell isn’t my favorite, it has an odd citrusy smell, but its easily ignored and totally worth it, my complexion hasn’t looked this good in a while</li>
            <li>I want to be reassured I&#x27;m using a good product by the text, not enough information on the bottle when I could read it.</li>
            <li>I even just went to get a facial after using the product for awhile and my facialist complemented me on how good my skin looked.</li>
            <li>This face serum smells good enough to eat.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a week, and I have only good things to say about it</li>
            <li>Not that this makes or breaks a good product, but it definitely helps when you&#x27;re about to put something on your face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great price, solid product and loved the citrus smell.</li>
            <li>but you can still read it, nice to see the natural products listed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and feels smooth in your fingers too; don&#x27;t be daunted by the fact that it looks more like melted sherbet then the light yellow liquid advertised.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, it feels exactly like both of the products mentioned above (transparent and smooth), and it leaves a silky finish on the face.  </li>
            <li>so you had to be quick to catch the serum in my hand before applying it,</li>
            <li>It dries quickly without alcohol so you can use moisturizer or makeup almost immediately after applying.  </li>
            <li>I do break out easily from certain products but this product did not have any adverse affects on my skin.</li>
            <li>You can just easily put it on and get ready for the day.</li>
            <li>serum goes on nicely and the orange scent is just enough to give me an aromatherapy momentary lift.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it&#x27;s reducing my winkles or not, but it sure does make my face smell nice!</li>
            <li>- personally I am not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s orange scented and reminds me of fresh orange juice.</li>
            <li>it smells fresh.  </li>
            <li>I noticed not only a plumping, but it appears that my mores are less visible, and I have a beautiful dewy healthy sheen to my face.  </li>
            <li>When first receiving the product, I immediately liked the packaging and how simple it looked.</li>
            <li>Love the product - amazing price point and works as well as more expensive options.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and easy to apply with the dropper.</li>
            <li>feel that it is important to take care of your skin early to help keep it fresh and youthful.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable for an anti-aging serum.</li>
            <li>For some reason, I have slept very very fitfully each night</li>
            <li>I was very surprised to wake up the first morning after use to find the fine lines around my eyes had largely disappeared.</li>
            <li>It dried within minutes (which is actually fine because I put my moisturizer right on top</li>
            <li>noticed a difference within the first three days.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I started using the serum was the smell.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I immediately felt a tingle</li>
            <li>When putting it on my face it felt a bit sticky, but once rubbed on my face, it felt really smooth and natural.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at the smell and how light the serum went on.</li>
            <li>The citrus smell is overwhelming when you open the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I am switching from expensive serum to this awesome serum!</li>
            <li>After the birth of my first child, I found my skin care routine having to be quite short!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coupled</li>
            <li>At first glance, the liquid looked like it would be sticky and would apply in a gloopy fashion.  </li>
            <li>This was my first experience with an anti aging serum</li>
            <li>I am writing this review based on my first application of Jolie.  </li>
            <li>Would love to see this product in a larger size</li>
            <li>Perhaps it needs a booklet telling me why each ingredient is good for your skin because all that information wouldn&#x27;t fit on the bottle, at the very least put it on the sales page or a</li>
            <li>I suffer from mild rosacea and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The product dries quickly and leaves my skin feeling very soft, but with no residual feeling of &amp;#34;just applied&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely dry and this product is very light.</li>
            <li>It will be interesting to see long term affects as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li>as many masks and lotions have in the past, my skin feels smooth</li>
            <li>It is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and isn&#x27;t oily so it doesn&#x27;t require extensive hand washing after application.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if this will actually reduce my wrinkles/ fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I started out using it only on my face, but have started putting in on my chest and neck, too, to help with the fine lines that have crept up</li>
            <li>I am amazed at the product&#x27;s ability to plump up fine lines with immediate visual results!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m really liking it.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>By the way, this item shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this, although it smells a bit too much like I&#x27;m dropping orange juice all over my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like Jolie vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li>This product was gentle and did not cause any flare ups, my complexion stayed clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel that my skin is much softer now.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell too much about the product from that.</li>
            <li>However, I really have not noticed any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin type is combination (dry and oily), which is normally the hardest to find good products for, but I haven&#x27;t had this dry my skin or cause any acne.  </li>
            <li>would say if you&#x27;re interested in trying out a face serum and have sensitive skin you can try this one.</li>
            <li>It went on a little sticky but then it absorbed quickly, huge</li>
            <li>Other than that, a high quality product that doesn&#x27;t cost an exorbitant amount of money is definitely worth it!!  </li>
            <li>If you love using products such as Kiehl&#x27;s line-reducing concentrate or Ole Henriksen&#x27;s vitamin C truth serum, but are growing weary of the price, then look no further and pick up a bottle of Jolie&#x27;s Vitamin-C Serum.  </li>
            <li>give it three stars mainly because it didn&#x27;t cause me any skin problems.</li>
            <li>Loving this serum so far (the first I&#x27;ve used in a long time) but will have to update as to the long term effects in a few weeks or so :)</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>It does a little more work than this one.  </li>
            <li>After using the serum, I used coconut oil as my moisturizer which is what I normally use.</li>
            <li>the scent is a lovely orange without the smell of any harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always a little hesitant when buying anything to put on my face because I have very sensitive skin and have listened to one too many warnings against anything with chemicals in it.</li>
            <li>I instantly opened the second bottle and it was fine.</li>
            <li>Often when I try new products they cause a flare-up of my skin condition.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy at all, and gives a nice boost of extra moisture to my skin.  </li>
            <li>so far!&lt;br /&gt;I mainly am trying to prevent new wrinkles from popping up in the usual areas, and this product makes my skin feel very moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li>This was the first and only serum I have tried for my face.</li>
            <li>All in all, pretty solid!</li>
            <li>I have used many anti-aging serum in the past.</li>
            <li>so my skin get very dry and damaged my pores are staring to shrink and my skin is not drying out as quickly on the plane</li>
            <li>It has a slight citrus smell which is fine if you like the smell of oranges but something to keep in mind if you are sensitive to smells.  </li>
            <li>This serum is light and doesn&#x27;t clog up your pores and turn your skin into an oily mess.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;ll keep using the serum.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the morning my skin was even and clear, as well as incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>The ingredients is natural so you won&#x27;t have to worry about putting something that is unnatural on your skin.</li>
            <li>The serum is soft and benign on the skin.</li>
            <li>but overall I really like it...</li>
            <li>I am a mom of a newborn and two year old.</li>
            <li>, I was presently surprised.</li>
            <li>I decided to add this anti-aging serum to my skincare routine and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances and</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to order so frequently.</li>
            <li>After only a few days of using this serum, my skin feels firmer and more taut.  </li>
            <li>I also love the subtle citrusy smell.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed quickly and it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel behind.</li>
            <li>have only been using this product for a few days but my skin feels incredibly smooth and soft</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the dropper applicator, not the most efficient.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say whether or not it&#x27;s actually helping prevent wrinkles based on the short amount of time that I&#x27;ve been using it, but it does make my skin feel great!&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>Some of the other reviewers have covered this pretty well.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tacky or stiff.</li>
            <li>It absorbs really well into the skin and also leaves a small layer that feels very</li>
            <li>My skin felt really soft the next day</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when my bottle came in and only two ingredients that had mild-at-best warnings against them.</li>
            <li>The bottle has minimal directions regarding frequency of use and how much to apply.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable compared to other products I&#x27;ve seen in the market ($79.99 and up.)</li>
            <li>other users have commented, this product smells really yummy.</li>
            <li>It firmed, but did not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>It smells like a funny spiced orange, and although not gross, its oddly scented.</li>
            <li>The second time I ordered two bottles and was a little disturbed when the first bottle I opened didn&#x27;t have the citrus scent at all.</li>
            <li>The cost of this product is also very comparable to other similar products; I would definitely recommend it to anyone searching for a Vitamin C serum!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get much sleep, and after just one use the wrinkles around my eyes were already less noticeable.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this!</li>
            <li> It smells really nice, and feels great on my skin.  </li>
            <li> The price is good &amp; as soon as I started using it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very refreshing to use.</li>
            <li> After 3 days of using Jolie Beauty Serum, i am very pleased.</li>
            <li> to tell how this product will work over time, but right now i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This serum is very light and has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I also love that they use organic ingredients!</li>
            <li> and I just love the smell!</li>
            <li> Love how this product made my skin feel!  </li>
            <li> It smells good, comes in a good sized bottle, and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> The product smells great and feels fantastic on my skin - I have noticed that my skin seems smoother and brighter after using this for a week.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the citrus smell this one has.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product the moment I opened the bottle and smelled the lemony citrus fragrence.</li>
            <li> I liked the packaging, though I did not receive a box.</li>
            <li> And it has a nice design, which I always appreciate.</li>
            <li> The price is really affordable which I like and the packaging is excellent.</li>
            <li> If you want to try something cheap and effective this is great.</li>
            <li> I wake up with very smooth skin and love it!</li>
            <li> It was very easy to apply as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using it to smooth out my thighs since I heard some of the ingredients are good for cellulite.</li>
            <li> It does have a nice refreshing feeling (probably from the aloe that&#x27;s in it).</li>
            <li> The smell and texture are pleasant and clean, and my skin feels refreshed.</li>
            <li> Best of all, it smells like oranges leaving your face feeling light, refreshed, and looking vibrant!</li>
            <li> Makes skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very smooth in the areas I have applied the serum to.</li>
            <li> The first bottle was fantastic; loved the non-greasy formula and the light citrus scent was very, very nice.</li>
            <li> My skin appeared more even and smoother after using the serum.</li>
            <li> These aging skin issues may be better</li>
            <li> and I love how my skin feels afterwards.</li>
            <li> I slathered it all over my face and it felt so refreshing and moist.</li>
            <li> I would love if they could change the smell...</li>
            <li> This serum smells great and goes on to your skin very well.</li>
            <li> so I am confident that in the longer term it will help reverse some of the effects of aging and the sun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any reduction in wrinkles, but that might take more time.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this product as I apply it to my face.  </li>
            <li> Using this product was a lovely experience.</li>
            <li> It has more of a watery consistency versus creamy.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this one wayyyy more though.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with only one application.</li>
            <li> I love citrus smell.</li>
            <li> I like the packaging of this product &amp; the smell of it is really refreshing.</li>
            <li> I look forward to writing another review in 3 weeks to share some more results :) A+++</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll recommend to friends and family :)</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t have a pamphlet with more details.</li>
            <li> I just ordered two more bottles.</li>
            <li> there- so far, so good!</li>
            <li> All in all I would say this product is great for someone looking for a extremely light, non greasy, easily absorb-able, fresh smelling serum.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also smells nice (a mild orangey citrus smell) and is inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far, i am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it and the smooth way it goes on.  </li>
            <li> It smells very good, for other people their batch smelled more like orange, but mine smells like orange upfront but much more like lilac/light floral which I like.</li>
            <li> Clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to also take with you when your traveling.</li>
            <li> The serum helped my skin feel rejuvenated and reduced my fine lines on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Seems like it would work fine under makeup.</li>
            <li> After about a months use I started to see a decrease in the fine lines in my face.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly!  </li>
            <li> It smells fantastic, the consistency is smooth and it&#x27;s light under my make up.</li>
            <li> but otherwise I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> It smells great, similar to oranges.</li>
            <li> I can say that it feels light once applied.</li>
            <li> It looks goopy but soaks into your face and feels light, not greasy when it dries.  </li>
            <li> I could feel and see that my skin was firmer, yet silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Overall, I had a great experience with purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> For the price and the amount you get, I think this is a great deal even if it only makes my skin softer.</li>
            <li> It was light and fragrant and a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> this felt really light on my face.  </li>
            <li> I do like that the serum is light and smells like what I would imagine Vitamin C to smell like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really light</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m impressed with is the quick absorption and the feeling that nothing is being wasted or that it is watered down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was excited to try out this product.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel fresh!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see how it will continue to improve my skin over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have liked it better if the instructions had a bigger font!</li>
            <li> The smell isn’t my favorite, it has an odd citrusy smell, but its easily ignored and totally worth it, my complexion hasn’t looked this good in a while</li>
            <li> I want to be reassured I&#x27;m using a good product by the text, not enough information on the bottle when I could read it.</li>
            <li> I even just went to get a facial after using the product for awhile and my facialist complemented me on how good my skin looked.</li>
            <li> This face serum smells good enough to eat.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week, and I have only good things to say about it</li>
            <li> Not that this makes or breaks a good product, but it definitely helps when you&#x27;re about to put something on your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great price, solid product and loved the citrus smell.</li>
            <li> but you can still read it, nice to see the natural products listed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and feels smooth in your fingers too; don&#x27;t be daunted by the fact that it looks more like melted sherbet then the light yellow liquid advertised.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, it feels exactly like both of the products mentioned above (transparent and smooth), and it leaves a silky finish on the face.  </li>
            <li> so you had to be quick to catch the serum in my hand before applying it,</li>
            <li> It dries quickly without alcohol so you can use moisturizer or makeup almost immediately after applying.  </li>
            <li> I do break out easily from certain products but this product did not have any adverse affects on my skin.</li>
            <li> You can just easily put it on and get ready for the day.</li>
            <li> serum goes on nicely and the orange scent is just enough to give me an aromatherapy momentary lift.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it&#x27;s reducing my winkles or not, but it sure does make my face smell nice!</li>
            <li> - personally I am not crazy about the smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s orange scented and reminds me of fresh orange juice.</li>
            <li> it smells fresh.  </li>
            <li> I noticed not only a plumping, but it appears that my mores are less visible, and I have a beautiful dewy healthy sheen to my face.  </li>
            <li> When first receiving the product, I immediately liked the packaging and how simple it looked.</li>
            <li> Love the product - amazing price point and works as well as more expensive options.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and easy to apply with the dropper.</li>
            <li> feel that it is important to take care of your skin early to help keep it fresh and youthful.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable for an anti-aging serum.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I have slept very very fitfully each night</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to wake up the first morning after use to find the fine lines around my eyes had largely disappeared.</li>
            <li> It dried within minutes (which is actually fine because I put my moisturizer right on top</li>
            <li> noticed a difference within the first three days.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I started using the serum was the smell.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I immediately felt a tingle</li>
            <li> When putting it on my face it felt a bit sticky, but once rubbed on my face, it felt really smooth and natural.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the smell and how light the serum went on.</li>
            <li> The citrus smell is overwhelming when you open the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I am switching from expensive serum to this awesome serum!</li>
            <li> After the birth of my first child, I found my skin care routine having to be quite short!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coupled</li>
            <li> At first glance, the liquid looked like it would be sticky and would apply in a gloopy fashion.  </li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an anti aging serum</li>
            <li> I am writing this review based on my first application of Jolie.  </li>
            <li> Would love to see this product in a larger size</li>
            <li> Perhaps it needs a booklet telling me why each ingredient is good for your skin because all that information wouldn&#x27;t fit on the bottle, at the very least put it on the sales page or a</li>
            <li> I suffer from mild rosacea and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The product dries quickly and leaves my skin feeling very soft, but with no residual feeling of &amp;#34;just applied&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry and this product is very light.</li>
            <li> It will be interesting to see long term affects as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> as many masks and lotions have in the past, my skin feels smooth</li>
            <li> It is simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and isn&#x27;t oily so it doesn&#x27;t require extensive hand washing after application.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this will actually reduce my wrinkles/ fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I started out using it only on my face, but have started putting in on my chest and neck, too, to help with the fine lines that have crept up</li>
            <li> I am amazed at the product&#x27;s ability to plump up fine lines with immediate visual results!  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really liking it.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> By the way, this item shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this, although it smells a bit too much like I&#x27;m dropping orange juice all over my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really like Jolie vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> This product was gentle and did not cause any flare ups, my complexion stayed clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel that my skin is much softer now.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell too much about the product from that.</li>
            <li> However, I really have not noticed any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin type is combination (dry and oily), which is normally the hardest to find good products for, but I haven&#x27;t had this dry my skin or cause any acne.  </li>
            <li> would say if you&#x27;re interested in trying out a face serum and have sensitive skin you can try this one.</li>
            <li> It went on a little sticky but then it absorbed quickly, huge</li>
            <li> Other than that, a high quality product that doesn&#x27;t cost an exorbitant amount of money is definitely worth it!!  </li>
            <li> If you love using products such as Kiehl&#x27;s line-reducing concentrate or Ole Henriksen&#x27;s vitamin C truth serum, but are growing weary of the price, then look no further and pick up a bottle of Jolie&#x27;s Vitamin-C Serum.  </li>
            <li> give it three stars mainly because it didn&#x27;t cause me any skin problems.</li>
            <li> Loving this serum so far (the first I&#x27;ve used in a long time) but will have to update as to the long term effects in a few weeks or so :)</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> It does a little more work than this one.  </li>
            <li> After using the serum, I used coconut oil as my moisturizer which is what I normally use.</li>
            <li> the scent is a lovely orange without the smell of any harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always a little hesitant when buying anything to put on my face because I have very sensitive skin and have listened to one too many warnings against anything with chemicals in it.</li>
            <li> I instantly opened the second bottle and it was fine.</li>
            <li> Often when I try new products they cause a flare-up of my skin condition.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy at all, and gives a nice boost of extra moisture to my skin.  </li>
            <li> so far!&lt;br /&gt;I mainly am trying to prevent new wrinkles from popping up in the usual areas, and this product makes my skin feel very moisturized and smooth.</li>
            <li> This was the first and only serum I have tried for my face.</li>
            <li> All in all, pretty solid!</li>
            <li> I have used many anti-aging serum in the past.</li>
            <li> so my skin get very dry and damaged my pores are staring to shrink and my skin is not drying out as quickly on the plane</li>
            <li> It has a slight citrus smell which is fine if you like the smell of oranges but something to keep in mind if you are sensitive to smells.  </li>
            <li> This serum is light and doesn&#x27;t clog up your pores and turn your skin into an oily mess.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;ll keep using the serum.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the morning my skin was even and clear, as well as incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> The ingredients is natural so you won&#x27;t have to worry about putting something that is unnatural on your skin.</li>
            <li> The serum is soft and benign on the skin.</li>
            <li> but overall I really like it...</li>
            <li> I am a mom of a newborn and two year old.</li>
            <li> , I was presently surprised.</li>
            <li> I decided to add this anti-aging serum to my skincare routine and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances and</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to order so frequently.</li>
            <li> After only a few days of using this serum, my skin feels firmer and more taut.  </li>
            <li> I also love the subtle citrusy smell.</li>
            <li> It gets absorbed quickly and it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel behind.</li>
            <li> have only been using this product for a few days but my skin feels incredibly smooth and soft</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the dropper applicator, not the most efficient.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say whether or not it&#x27;s actually helping prevent wrinkles based on the short amount of time that I&#x27;ve been using it, but it does make my skin feel great!&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviewers have covered this pretty well.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tacky or stiff.</li>
            <li> It absorbs really well into the skin and also leaves a small layer that feels very</li>
            <li> My skin felt really soft the next day</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when my bottle came in and only two ingredients that had mild-at-best warnings against them.</li>
            <li> The bottle has minimal directions regarding frequency of use and how much to apply.  </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable compared to other products I&#x27;ve seen in the market ($79.99 and up.)</li>
            <li> other users have commented, this product smells really yummy.</li>
            <li> It firmed, but did not dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> It smells like a funny spiced orange, and although not gross, its oddly scented.</li>
            <li> The second time I ordered two bottles and was a little disturbed when the first bottle I opened didn&#x27;t have the citrus scent at all.</li>
            <li> The cost of this product is also very comparable to other similar products; I would definitely recommend it to anyone searching for a Vitamin C serum!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get much sleep, and after just one use the wrinkles around my eyes were already less noticeable.</li>
            <li> One bottle is going to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> and I will see how long I can make it last.  </li>
            <li> I have dry skin so this is a definite plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I am 46 years old with some sun damage on my chin, a few age spots.</li>
            <li> While I like the smell and texture of this product, it didn&#x27;t last as long as the other vitamin C serums that I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Other products start to clump once you apply your regular moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Then, it became dry and I didn&#x27;t feel anything on my face at that point.</li>
            <li> I had a sheen and my skin was not as dry.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used other Vitamin C serums in the past but would definitely continue to use this, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found other anti-aging serums dry out my skin or cause breakouts</li>
            <li> You only apply a few drops to cover all your face.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not very keen of reading glasses!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding good skin products because I hate having &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; on my face.</li>
            <li> After a few minutes I could feel the serum drying but not making my face feel dry or tight</li>
            <li> It is packaged within a dark bottle and had a dropper to preserve freshness.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the print is microscopic and should be enlarged or easier reading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product about every other day for a few weeks</li>
            <li> It has a slight citrus scent, but it isn&#x27;t bothersome-</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t feel too heavy).</li>
            <li> You can see it working almost immediately; as soon as it dried I could see an improvement in my pores.</li>
            <li> Started using this product a few days ago</li>
            <li> Even after a few minutes, it stayed sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge buyer of skin products - although I might be after this...</li>
            <li> The writing on the label was a little small</li>
            <li> Hopefully, I can slow down the aging my face goes through</li>
            <li> so it was a little hard for me to see any directions or indications.</li>
            <li> text on the bottle is way TOO small.</li>
            <li> I have used Kheil&#x27;s Vitamin C in the past, but Jolie is already replaced it.  </li>
            <li> I tried it for two weeks to see if it would help make my face look a little brighter and less tired.</li>
            <li> it is hard to tell after just three days</li>
            <li> so I jumped at the chance to purchase this one at the crazy low sale price.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s either greasy or thick.</li>
            <li> then it subsided, I took this to mean it was going to work.</li>
            <li> I have used vitamin C serum in the past and have seen results, however, the product was extremely expensive.</li>
            <li> Very thick and sticky; made me break out.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed a difference in that horrible, wrinkly, chin sag thing that a 48 year old woman can get.</li>
            <li> I expect I will become addicted!</li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t awful but a little unpleasant.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for 3 days but I&#x27;m really liking it. It smells fantastic, the consistency is smooth and it&#x27;s light under my make up. I&#x27;m seeing a bit of redness reduction already that I hope will continue. I&#x27;ll try to update further after I&#x27;ve used it longer.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the price for the quality of this product. The serum helped my skin feel rejuvenated and reduced my fine lines on my forehead. The dropper had some air bubbles so you had to be quick to catch the serum in my hand before applying it, but otherwise I really enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised to wake up the first morning after use to find the fine lines around my eyes had largely disappeared. The smell is amazing. It&#x27;s very refreshing to use. I also love that they use organic ingredients! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using vitamin C for awhile. I really liked the citrus smell this one has. You only apply a few drops to cover all your face. It made mine feel quite refreshed. It gets absorbed quickly and it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feel behind. I will definitely get another one when I run out. It&#x27;s a great value. I would have liked it better if the instructions had a bigger font!, I&#x27;m not very keen of reading glasses! LOL</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m impressed with is the quick absorption and the feeling that nothing is being wasted or that it is watered down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum goes on nicely and the orange scent is just enough to give me an aromatherapy momentary lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The text on the bottle is way TOO small. I want to be reassured I&#x27;m using a good product by the text, not enough information on the bottle when I could read it. Perhaps it needs a booklet telling me why each ingredient is good for your skin because all that information wouldn&#x27;t fit on the bottle, at the very least put it on the sales page or a website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price has doubled since I bought it. I will keep using what I have to see if I would buy another bottle at double the price given the results I&#x27;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference within the first three days. After using the serum, I used coconut oil as my moisturizer which is what I normally use. My skin appeared more even and smoother after using the serum. I used this combination with and without cosmetics being applied afterward, both had favorable results. I am 46 years old with some sun damage on my chin, a few age spots. These aging skin issues may be better it is hard to tell after just three days but so far I&#x27;ll keep using the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I have only applied it twice, and already my skin feels smoother and tighter. It&#x27;s easy to apply and feels smooth in your fingers too; don&#x27;t be daunted by the fact that it looks more like melted sherbet then the light yellow liquid advertised. It smells very good, for other people their batch smelled more like orange, but mine smells like orange upfront but much more like lilac/light floral which I like. In any case, it only smells in the bottle and not on you. Loving this serum so far (the first I&#x27;ve used in a long time) but will have to update as to the long term effects in a few weeks or so :)</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I started using the serum was the smell. Clean and refreshing. But the texture blew me away. I have a hard time finding good skin products because I hate having &amp;#34;stuff&amp;#34; on my face. It&#x27;s either greasy or thick. But this one is perfect. I use it twice a day and I love how my skin feels afterwards. I even just went to get a facial after using the product for awhile and my facialist complemented me on how good my skin looked. A definite recommend. I will keep using.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I immediately felt a tingle then it subsided, I took this to mean it was going to work. It went on a little sticky but then it absorbed quickly, huge plus. I&#x27;m also using it to smooth out my thighs since I heard some of the ingredients are good for cellulite. Great scent.</li>
            <li> It has a great smell. It makes my skin feel younger.&lt;br /&gt;My spouse commented that my complexion looks softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this</li>
            <li> It smells great, similar to oranges. When putting it on my face it felt a bit sticky, but once rubbed on my face, it felt really smooth and natural. It does have a nice refreshing feeling (probably from the aloe that&#x27;s in it). In one day, my coworkers did notice that I was glowing! By the way, this item shipped really fast. I purchased the item on a Friday and they got it to me on Sunday! Yay for Amazon Prime!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product the moment I opened the bottle and smelled the lemony citrus fragrence. I slathered it all over my face and it felt so refreshing and moist. It dried within minutes (which is actually fine because I put my moisturizer right on top and it didn&#x27;t feel too heavy). My skin felt really soft the next day and I look forward to using this again every day!</li>
            <li> This was the first and only serum I have tried for my face. I can say that it feels light once applied. It smells like citrus. I liked the packaging, though I did not receive a box. The labeling and quality of the bottle and dropper was very great. Immediately after I applied and started rubbing my face, it started out moist. Then, it became dry and I didn&#x27;t feel anything on my face at that point. My face is so much smoother after the serum has dried off. Hopefully, I can slow down the aging my face goes through so my body can catch up!</li>
            <li> Loved this product! You can see it working almost immediately; as soon as it dried I could see an improvement in my pores. In the morning my skin was even and clear, as well as incredibly soft. Once it dries you forget it’s on your skin and the price point is great. My only complaint is the dropper applicator, not the most efficient. The smell isn’t my favorite, it has an odd citrusy smell, but its easily ignored and totally worth it, my complexion hasn’t looked this good in a while</li>
            <li> Hi applied once, and my skin already feels nicer. It made me feel cleaner, firmer, and moist. I will continue to use this, although it smells a bit too much like I&#x27;m dropping orange juice all over my skin. I would love if they could change the smell...but then again, it is vitamin C!</li>
            <li> This serum smells great and goes on to your skin very well. It isn&#x27;t too sticky, the texture is great.&lt;br /&gt;I have only been using this product for a few days but my skin feels incredibly smooth and soft so I am confident that in the longer term it will help reverse some of the effects of aging and the sun.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have never purchased anything quite like this for my face. I was pleasantly surprised at the smell and how light the serum went on. After a few minutes I could feel the serum drying but not making my face feel dry or tight as many masks and lotions have in the past, my skin feels smooth and I just love the smell! Looking forward to using it again tomorrow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always a little hesitant when buying anything to put on my face because I have very sensitive skin and have listened to one too many warnings against anything with chemicals in it. But! I was pleasantly surprised when my bottle came in and only two ingredients that had mild-at-best warnings against them. Everything else is things like ginger, turmeric, and lavender- things that I eat regularly and know that I don&#x27;t have to worry about when applying to my skin. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if it&#x27;s reducing my winkles or not, but it sure does make my face smell nice! And it has a nice design, which I always appreciate. All in all, pretty solid!</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this will actually reduce my wrinkles/ fine lines.  I plan to keep using it to find out.  One bottle is going to last a long time.  The citrus smell is overwhelming when you open the bottle.  However, I didn&#x27;t notice myself smelling like an orange, so I guess it went away.  It looks goopy but soaks into your face and feels light, not greasy when it dries.  Seems like it would work fine under makeup.</li>
            <li> The price of the product is great for it&#x27;s size. It is simple and easy to use. You can just easily put it on and get ready for the day. It&#x27;s easy to also take with you when your traveling. The ingredients is natural so you won&#x27;t have to worry about putting something that is unnatural on your skin.</li>
            <li> After 3 days of using Jolie Beauty Serum, i am very pleased. I applied it to my face, neck, upper chest and the back of my hands.  By today, my skin was lighter and my &amp;#34;freckles&amp;#34; were fading. I could feel and see that my skin was firmer, yet silky and smooth. I will definitely continue using Jolie as my anti-aging weapon.</li>
            <li> Overall, I had a great experience with purchasing this product. The delivery was executed timely and the packaging fulfilled the needs as the bottle wasn&#x27;t damaged. The product itself smells like citrus and I use multiple Vitamin C products and it&#x27;s similar to that - personally I am not crazy about the smell but it&#x27;s a personal preference. The packaging is solid but I would prefer a push-pump system over the syringe looking one that comes with this product. The serum is soft and benign on the skin. It is easy to apply and isn&#x27;t oily so it doesn&#x27;t require extensive hand washing after application. I wake up with very smooth skin and love it! I will continue to use it! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This face serum smells good enough to eat. It&#x27;s orange scented and reminds me of fresh orange juice. Yum! It&#x27;s soft and easy to apply with the dropper. It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tacky or stiff. After using it for about a week, I feel like the skin on my face is softer overall. I haven&#x27;t seen any reduction in wrinkles, but that might take more time. For the price and the amount you get, I think this is a great deal even if it only makes my skin softer. I look forward to continuing to use it and to see how my wrinkles respond.</li>
            <li> I have used many anti-aging serum in the past. I am one of those i&#x27;ve tried everything! I really like Jolie vitamin C serum. I felt the tightening of my skin after application. I applied moisturizer also and it doesn&#x27;t react to the serum unlike the ones i&#x27;ve used before. Other products start to clump once you apply your regular moisturizer. I didn&#x27;t feel any burning during and after application. no adverse reaction. I also love the subtle citrusy smell. I haven&#x27;t tried it in the eye area as it didn&#x27;t say it can be applied. I would like to know if i can use it in the eye area too... but overall I really like it... And it&#x27;s very affordable. I am switching from expensive serum to this awesome serum!</li>
            <li> This serum is one I use daily for the Vitamin C.  It smells good, comes in a good sized bottle, and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this product as I apply it to my face.  It dries quickly!  After using the product for a week I notice my skin tone is evening out.  The price is reasonable compared to other products I&#x27;ve seen in the market ($79.99 and up.)</li>
            <li> I have never used a product like this before, and look forward to integrating it into my personal care routine. The smell and texture are pleasant and clean, and my skin feels refreshed.</li>
            <li> After the birth of my first child, I found my skin care routine having to be quite short!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coupled with my coconut oil as moisturizer, I found this product to bring back life and vibrancy to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great buy and I will be purchasing again in the future!</li>
            <li> Using this product was a lovely experience. It was light and fragrant and a pleasure to use. I felt as if it were a mini spa treatment in a bottle. I noticed results after just one use. I am a mom of a newborn and two year old. I don&#x27;t get much sleep, and after just one use the wrinkles around my eyes were already less noticeable.</li>
            <li> While I like the smell and texture of this product, it didn&#x27;t last as long as the other vitamin C serums that I&#x27;ve used and it didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my skin.</li>
            <li> If you love using products such as Kiehl&#x27;s line-reducing concentrate or Ole Henriksen&#x27;s vitamin C truth serum, but are growing weary of the price, then look no further and pick up a bottle of Jolie&#x27;s Vitamin-C Serum.  At first glance, the liquid looked like it would be sticky and would apply in a gloopy fashion.  Surprisingly, it feels exactly like both of the products mentioned above (transparent and smooth), and it leaves a silky finish on the face.  Best of all, it smells like oranges leaving your face feeling light, refreshed, and looking vibrant!</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous about using a serum, thinking that it might be too oily, but to the contrary- this felt really light on my face.  It has a slight citrus scent, but it isn&#x27;t bothersome- it smells fresh.  I started out using it only on my face, but have started putting in on my chest and neck, too, to help with the fine lines that have crept up there- so far, so good!</li>
            <li> This serum is very light and has a pleasant smell. I have used vitamin C serum in the past and have seen results, however, the product was extremely expensive. I was excited to try out this product. My skin is extremely dry and this product is very light. It has more of a watery consistency versus creamy. Myself, I prefer it to be on the creamy side. I did not feel any tightening effects when using this serum. I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in my complexion yet, but I will continue to use the product for another couple fo weeks. The price is really affordable which I like and the packaging is excellent. It is packaged within a dark bottle and had a dropper to preserve freshness. All in all I would say this product is great for someone looking for a extremely light, non greasy, easily absorb-able, fresh smelling serum.</li>
            <li> I learned about this product from a friend. I tried it for two weeks to see if it would help make my face look a little brighter and less tired. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give it three stars mainly because it didn&#x27;t cause me any skin problems. I suffer from mild rosacea and have very sensitive skin. Often when I try new products they cause a flare-up of my skin condition. This product was gentle and did not cause any flare ups, my complexion stayed clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also smells nice (a mild orangey citrus smell) and is inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say if you&#x27;re interested in trying out a face serum and have sensitive skin you can try this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week, and I have only good things to say about it so far!&lt;br /&gt;I mainly am trying to prevent new wrinkles from popping up in the usual areas, and this product makes my skin feel very moisturized and smooth. I can&#x27;t really say whether or not it&#x27;s actually helping prevent wrinkles based on the short amount of time that I&#x27;ve been using it, but it does make my skin feel great!&lt;br /&gt;Like other users have commented, this product smells really yummy. Not that this makes or breaks a good product, but it definitely helps when you&#x27;re about to put something on your face. The cost of this product is also very comparable to other similar products; I would definitely recommend it to anyone searching for a Vitamin C serum!</li>
            <li> Still using it to see the benefits.</li>
            <li> Very thick and sticky; made me break out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this! I feel that my skin is much softer now. It absorbs really well into the skin and also leaves a small layer that feels very refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that it is important to take care of your skin early to help keep it fresh and youthful. This is definitely the product to help do so.</li>
            <li> Feels great, texture is awesome, but I would stick to Dr. Oz&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum instead. It does a little more work than this one.  I love the smell of this one wayyyy more though.</li>
            <li> Love the product - amazing price point and works as well as more expensive options.  Could improve with packaging and directions.</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviewers have covered this pretty well. It tightens imiedatley and appeared to shrink my pores. I was impressed with only one application. There are plent of more expensive products on the market, but for the money this gets 5 stars. If you want to try something cheap and effective this is great. I would give it a 5th star but I am not a big fan of the Eye dropper aplicator, nor am I a fan of the scent. It smells like a funny spiced orange, and although not gross, its oddly scented. My advice would be to use it at night rather then in the morning before your daily tasks.</li>
            <li> This product is a great price for the quality of the product.  It has a slight citrus smell which is fine if you like the smell of oranges but something to keep in mind if you are sensitive to smells.  Makes skin feel very smooth.</li>
            <li> I use serums daily so I jumped at the chance to purchase this one at the crazy low sale price.  I wish it would have included an insert though, the print on the bottle is microscopic so it was a little hard for me to see any directions or indications. It smells really nice, and feels great on my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy at all, and gives a nice boost of extra moisture to my skin.  I have dry skin so this is a definite plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too soon yet to tell how this product will work over time, but right now i&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I was so happy I tried this face serum. I love citrus smell. It makes me feel fresh! This serum is light and doesn&#x27;t clog up your pores and turn your skin into an oily mess. My skin feels very smooth in the areas I have applied the serum to. The price was very reasonable for an anti-aging serum. It was very easy to apply as well. So far, i am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an anti aging serum and I have to say, I was presently surprised. I applied at night before bed and the next morning my skin definitely felt smoother. Will definitely keep using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price, solid product and loved the citrus smell.</li>
            <li> I like the packaging of this product &amp; the smell of it is really refreshing. The writing on the label was a little small but you can still read it, nice to see the natural products listed. The price is good &amp; as soon as I started using it I felt my skin tighten. It will be interesting to see long term affects as I continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review based on my first application of Jolie.  I am amazed at the product&#x27;s ability to plump up fine lines with immediate visual results!  I noticed not only a plumping, but it appears that my mores are less visible, and I have a beautiful dewy healthy sheen to my face.  I have used Kheil&#x27;s Vitamin C in the past, but Jolie is already replaced it.  The texture of the product isn&#x27;t sticky or serum-y, it&#x27;s almost a liquid.  It smells of citrus, without any lingering after-scents.  I look forward to writing another review in 3 weeks to share some more results :) A+++</li>
            <li> The product smells great and feels fantastic on my skin - I have noticed that my skin seems smoother and brighter after using this for a week.  You definitely know it stays on because you need to wash it off with soap and water in the morning (I&#x27;ve been using it at night).  For some reason, I have slept very very fitfully each night I have used this product.  My only complaint is that the print is microscopic and should be enlarged or easier reading.</li>
            <li> Started using this product a few days ago and I&#x27;m already seeing the difference. I fly a lot so my skin get very dry and damaged my pores are staring to shrink and my skin is not drying out as quickly on the plane I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I decided to add this anti-aging serum to my skincare routine and was pleasantly surprised.  After only a few days of using this serum, my skin feels firmer and more taut.  I&#x27;m excited to see how it will continue to improve my skin over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sensitive to fragrances and the scent is a lovely orange without the smell of any harsh chemicals.  It dries quickly without alcohol so you can use moisturizer or makeup almost immediately after applying.  My skin type is combination (dry and oily), which is normally the hardest to find good products for, but I haven&#x27;t had this dry my skin or cause any acne.  I&#x27;ve found other anti-aging serums dry out my skin or cause breakouts so this is a BIG plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m giving this product 4 instead of 5 stars is because of packaging.  The bottle has minimal directions regarding frequency of use and how much to apply.  Other than that, a high quality product that doesn&#x27;t cost an exorbitant amount of money is definitely worth it!!  I&#x27;ll recommend to friends and family :)</li>
            <li> When first receiving the product, I immediately liked the packaging and how simple it looked. It matched the smell of the product well. One thing I did notice was that there wasn&#x27;t a box and it didn&#x27;t have a pamphlet with more details. I couldn&#x27;t tell too much about the product from that. I do like that the serum is light and smells like what I would imagine Vitamin C to smell like. However, it was a bit too sticky and actually felt like I was rubbing oranges on my face. Even after a few minutes, it stayed sticky. I do like the way that it made my skin feel the day after though. I had a sheen and my skin was not as dry. I would probably use this in the day time instead of at night, because of the stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I haven&#x27;t used other Vitamin C serums in the past but would definitely continue to use this, especially for the price. I do break out easily from certain products but this product did not have any adverse affects on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of it and the smooth way it goes on.  It&#x27;s really light and it&#x27;s not at all sticky.  I&#x27;ve used this product about every other day for a few weeks and I need to start paying attention to how it improves my skin.  I&#x27;m not a huge buyer of skin products - although I might be after this... I know it&#x27;s a great price and I will see how long I can make it last.  I expect I will become addicted!</li>
            <li> Love how this product made my skin feel!  It firmed, but did not dry my skin out. A bonus is that it had a great citrusy smell!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product three times now. The first bottle was fantastic; loved the non-greasy formula and the light citrus scent was very, very nice. The second time I ordered two bottles and was a little disturbed when the first bottle I opened didn&#x27;t have the citrus scent at all. The smell wasn&#x27;t awful but a little unpleasant. I instantly opened the second bottle and it was fine. Solved the problem by combining the two bottles together. After about a months use I started to see a decrease in the fine lines in my face. I have also noticed a difference in that horrible, wrinkly, chin sag thing that a 48 year old woman can get. It was just beginning to develop but is definitely reducing with continued use of the serum. I apply it in the morning and at night. The product dries quickly and leaves my skin feeling very soft, but with no residual feeling of &amp;#34;just applied&amp;#34; product. Just recently someone commented that my skin looks &amp;#34;so bright&amp;#34;. I just ordered two more bottles. Would love to see this product in a larger size so I don&#x27;t have to order so frequently.</li>
            <li> I have used the serum every day since I bought it. I like the citrus smell and the feel of it going on. However, I really have not noticed any difference in my skin. I will continue to use it in hopes of some changes.</li>
