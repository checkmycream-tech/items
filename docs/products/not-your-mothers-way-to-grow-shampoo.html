            <li>The shampoo feels rather nice in use.</li>
            <li>It has a great scent and leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>My hair is growing so quickly and has a great shine</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful and after using the shampoo with the conditioner my hair is so soft!</li>
            <li>but if you follow up with a good conditioner it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I have had great success with this shampoo and conditioner in growing stronger hair.  </li>
            <li>and my hair ALWAYS smells amazing after using it :)</li>
            <li>Sulfate free is extremely good for your hair.</li>
            <li>It is one of my all time favorite shampoos; with the conditioner, my hair always feels amazing, without any added weight</li>
            <li>and I have experienced some hair loss, but honestly, it&#x27;s completely worth it to me.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and purchased this product to help speed up growth.</li>
            <li>In any case, there&#x27;s no way to know for sure if it helps or not, but it sure does have a nice smell.</li>
            <li>Very light shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I have tried most of them that are out there.  </li>
            <li>but I lost more hair than I wanted to.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I ordered more.</li>
            <li>this shampoo create volume in my hair which I love.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, I dont like washing my hair more than 3 times a week and the smell definetly stays,</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t see any more changes with your hair.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I also love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Would repurchase again except for the fact that I found the shampoo love of my life: OGX&#x27;s Keratin Oil shampoo.</li>
            <li>but I may repurchase this :)</li>
            <li>and I see no change in my hair if any thing I see more hair in my tub take it from me</li>
            <li>is try some thing better.</li>
            <li>Such a great product and will be continuing to use it!!</li>
            <li>First of all, this product smells amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for around two months, I love everything about it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but i used most of the bottle then threw it out, WOULD NEVER BUY IT AGAIN</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>- I like combining the two. :)</li>
            <li>Which was more than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Probably would work better when paired with their conditioner.</li>
            <li>i do love how it smells like strawberries and cream and also how lightweight my hair feels.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I would like my shampoo to be a bit more strengthening.  </li>
            <li>I love the product though, and will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li>(and it&#x27;s usually socially more accepted for a woman to have hair on their head)</li>
            <li>Use the conditioner to have a better chance of regrowth of hair</li>
            <li>Love it, Great smell, and works fast depending on person to person.</li>
            <li>I take Biotin and that does work for sure.</li>
            <li>My hair is growing in, I love the fact it isn&#x27;t loaded with sulfites (allergies)</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smell lovely</li>
            <li>I have to imagine that whatever else is in this shampoo to degrease, instead of sulfates, has got to be more harmful for my hair.</li>
            <li>i couldnt believe how soft ,clean, and awesome my hair felt and looked...</li>
            <li>First, it smells good in the bottle</li>
            <li>Trust me it make your hair dry to best thing</li>
            <li>Lastly, it smells great, kind of a fruity, strawberry scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering once you leave the shower.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, and I do see a huge difference in my hair growth and strength of my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone trying to find a good sulfate-free system.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a more affordable SLS free shampoo</li>
            <li>smells amazing, but it doesn&#x27;t really make my hair feel hydrated and healthy.</li>
            <li>my hair is strong and never falls out.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely and you don&#x27;t need that much !</li>
            <li>, it lathers fine for me.</li>
            <li>In addition to my hair being fine, I have also noticed that since I&#x27;ve hit my 30&#x27;s that my hair seems thinner and takes longer to grow.</li>
            <li>Smelled fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine, medium length</li>
            <li>I have been using this &amp; murad&#x27;s shampoo for fine hair both to help with growing my hair out.</li>
            <li>and I feel like my hair is actually growing faster :) my new favorite kind that I will always use!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it that long, so I have no idea if my hair is growing longer and stronger, but it does smell really good!</li>
            <li>Not true if it helps to grow but smells delicious.</li>
            <li>It is also sulfate-free, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I bought this shampoo because it was sulfate free.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had great results with my hair being shinier, healthier looking, and I can definitely see a gradual difference in length.</li>
            <li>I liked the product but my hair did not grow all that much.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I read many great reviews of the Not Your Mothers Way to Grow Long and Strong line and thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>Firstly, it&#x27;s a sulfate free shampoo, which is better for your hair.</li>
            <li>It is a good shampoo, though it&#x27;s not my favorite because it tends to make my hair feel squeaky clean, stripped, and dry.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try it out because I&#x27;ve heard a lot about this product.</li>
            <li>After many, MANY, bottles of other brands of shampoos and conditioners (and I&#x27;m talking all over the dollar spectrum too), I&#x27;ve finally found that THIS shampoo &amp; conditioner is absolutely perfect for me.</li>
            <li>Co-workers &amp; friends keep commenting how long my hair has gotten &amp; how great it looks.</li>
            <li>My hair always feels ultra clean after using it,</li>
            <li>It literally was squeaky clean.</li>
            <li>The only upside to this shampoo is it smells good</li>
            <li>good for second day wash.</li>
            <li>YET after i was almost through one full bottle i had been noticeing ALOT of hair loss...</li>
            <li>my brush and comb full of my hair...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to write a review until a good amount of time later after buying.</li>
            <li>My hair already grows very quickly, but this stuff really seems to work!</li>
            <li>Also, I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the shedding that other reviewers have mentioned...</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>I even use it on my daughters super curly hair and she does not have to wash her hair as often and it does not relax her</li>
            <li>I most definitely recommend this product more than anything else.</li>
            <li>so I purchased this on a quick trip to the store.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and it left my scalp and hair clean.</li>
            <li>I recently donated hair to Locks of Love and got a pixie cut!</li>
            <li>This product DID take a while to get here, but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Compared to other sulfate-free shampoos i&#x27;ve used I would definitely consider this to be the best one.</li>
            <li>and it has stopped growing as quickly as it did when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>After a major surgery most of my hair fell out...</li>
            <li>The reasons are because I, like many other reviewers, have experienced significant hair loss with each use, but far more concerning than the hair loss are the large, itchy, red sores I developed at the hairline.</li>
            <li>Sulfate-less shampoos usually do not lather, but this one lathers just fine.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it made me hair grow super long and made it smell nice to.</li>
            <li>The only reason I rated it four stars is because I have experienced a tiny bit of hair falling out.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and strong</li>
            <li>Love it, at the beginning my hair does not feels soft, but then after the conditioner wow!!!</li>
            <li>At first you use this and</li>
            <li>First time I try</li>
            <li>only con is the scent...not exactly fruity, seems more chemically or something.</li>
            <li>Add more water if more suds are needed, not more product.</li>
            <li>but it has made my hair a lot shinier,stronger, and overall healthy</li>
            <li>You have to massage it in for 2-3 minutes but to do that you have to use sooo much of it!</li>
            <li>I has been trying so many different shampoos and this was is still not working</li>
            <li>but my hair is growing fast!</li>
            <li>Plus I smell vaguely of apples, and that&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li>cleans okay but leaves my hair piecy and stringy, would not recommend for daily use.</li>
            <li>My hair has really shown progress in its growth too!</li>
            <li>And you really can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>first day I changed to something</li>
            <li>Also it seems to work pretty well with my hair.</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>First time using this product.</li>
            <li>I use this daily with Aussie&#x27;s 3 minute miracle and that has helped my hair grow and become silky and healthy.</li>
            <li>However, the first time I used this, I had a lot hair in the bottom of my drain.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has helped so much!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve actually have gotten complements from everyone about how good my hair smells especially my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for the past 8 months now and my hair has never felt so healthy and strong.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair feel so clean and soft, and it really does help your hair grow--I noticed my hair getting longer after TWO washes (I also used the conditioner).  </li>
            <li>Really wanted to love this product since it is sulfate free, but it failed on many levels.</li>
            <li>In concentrated form, the chemical is so strong that it can burn human tissue.</li>
            <li>I was able to grow it out long enough in 2 weeks that I could pull it back and it had a nice shape to it in time for a wedding.</li>
            <li>Since using the shampoo and conditioner together I&#x27;ve grown out at least 4-5 inches of new, healthy hair :)</li>
            <li>Definitely don&#x27;t recommend for those with fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>Last I was using Matrix shampoo and my hair was falling out in huge clumps.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, and my hair feels a lot stronger and thicker since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li>Secondly, its sulfate free so I do not have to wash my hair as often.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo doesnt have as much lather as &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shampoo but don&#x27;t be alarmed.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t bleached it, or done much of anything to it to let it grow out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It works, and my hair has grown fast</li>
            <li>so you really don&#x27;t need much.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>Another thing I might add is that after using the shampoo you&#x27;re hair is very \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; that&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really noticed that my hair is longer and softer.</li>
            <li>like I&#x27;m straight outta the 80s.</li>
            <li>I however can&#x27;t justify paying the money when it goes so fast.</li>
            <li>You really have to use the conditioner though..</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my hair</li>
            <li>It really did make my hair fall out.</li>
            <li>I realized this company also makes a conditioner, and that both are available at CVS for the same price.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t happen overnight, but after about 2 months of using this shampoo I really noticed a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They r really working.</li>
            <li>Secondly, it really does contribute to hair growth.</li>
            <li>You can really feel the difference in your hair strength after using this product.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s because you really massage this into your hair</li>
            <li>Using the conditioner really makes a difference too.</li>
            <li>eventhough she has medical issues, she says you may notice more considerable results.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel really thick, in a good way.</li>
            <li>I used this product in along with the Long &amp; Strong Conditioner.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t noticed significant growth, but then again the product only promises to strengthen your hair, not lengthen it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited, never getting a different shampoo or conditioner again</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo for 2 reasons: My color does not fade as fast as with other shampoos!</li>
            <li>EPIC FAIL!!i used all 3 the sham, cond, and the leave in conditioner,while making your hair smell good and soft, I would have to agree with people that say there hair was falling out!</li>
            <li>Next with with the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However don&#x27;t expect super fast growing hair.</li>
            <li>After spending so much money on expensive products trying to grow my hair faster this has definitely left the best results.</li>
            <li>So even though my hair felt better than ever me losing my hair was not worth it....</li>
            <li>Some reviews say their hair falls out more, but mine has been falling out a lot less.</li>
            <li>I like how there are not as many additives in this product compared to regular shampoos, but I prefer Simply U.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item..</li>
            <li>;) So you can&#x27;t really blame the product, only your head.</li>
            <li>Leave In Conditioner after my shampoo &amp; normal conditioning..</li>
            <li>:) I have trouble growing my hair</li>
            <li>(I normally use volumizing shampoos and conditioners) without feeling</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use these products long enough to attest to whether they aid in speeding up hair growth.</li>
            <li>My hair became even flatter and my hair is normally shiney and the product just dulled my hair.  </li>
            <li>Only slight drawbacks are that it doesn&#x27;t lather as nicely as I am used to and seems to make my eyes water even without getting it in them.</li>
            <li>so it was dry now its much healthier and softer and i can tell its growing faster than it was this product really works!</li>
            <li>When I bought this product my expectations were pretty low.</li>
            <li>I have Asian straight hair.</li>
            <li>My hair has been so shiney, bouncy, and soft.</li>
            <li>Still too early to tell, but I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>The other problem I seem to notice is that the conditioner runs out very fast!</li>
            <li>and it made my hair soft and silky again.</li>
            <li>I have noticed no hair loss with this product so far.</li>
            <li>you use a moisturizing conditioner to keep hair soft and detangled.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair really soft as well.</li>
            <li>Only con is that it doesnt really have a scent.</li>
            <li>My hair is damaged from coloring and heat treating it, and this has done wonders for my hair, keeping it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>for a few months now and have noticed a significant increase in the rate my hair and nails grow.</li>
            <li>: The shampoo WILL make your hair dry, it will feel like wet straw, but the second you use a conditioner, any conditioner, its okay.</li>
            <li>I actually ended up shedding even more hair in the shower after I used this than usual</li>
            <li>I usually shed in the shower but after using this product the amount of hair I shed in the shower has increased tremendously!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely longer (I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little more than a month)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s color-treated, and very sensitive to sulfate-free color protective products - as in, most of them leave behind a residue that I can only get rid of by using &#x27;normal&#x27; shampoo that strips my color.</li>
            <li>I definitely have noticed my hair growing a bit faster than normal.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for people with thin straight hair since your hair is more likely to fall out with this product.</li>
            <li>After i wash it, i feel my hair dry, so I would not recomend it if you have very procesed hair...</li>
            <li>and then I switched back to my old shampoo and my hair felt almost like it&#x27;s old self again.</li>
            <li>while brushing my hair i use a pick my hair doesnt normally fall out, i thought maybe the first few days it would do that</li>
            <li>Since buying this, I&#x27;ve learned that it&#x27;s sold in stores for much much cheaper, however I have had some difficulty actually finding this specific type of this brand.</li>
            <li>I used it for a month and my hair is now super brittle, thin, and breaking left and right.</li>
            <li>far as new growth, I have not noticed a significant difference in growth, but I am growing out a stacked bob, so it is hard for me to tell how long my hair has grown with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>and it did the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that when using this product, I can wash my hair every other day or even every 2-3 days if I really push it.  </li>
            <li>At first I had trouble getting suds out of it</li>
            <li>It makes your hair very knotty and just clean, that sounds weird</li>
            <li>so I had to use a little more than I usually use.</li>
            <li>Love this product and my hair has definitely grown (which it never does) a few inches over the last few months I&#x27;ve been using it</li>
            <li>The first time I used this shampoo and rinsed it out my hair was stiff and notted.</li>
            <li>Usually when I switch shampoos my hair feels different but this product took feeling different to a whole new level.</li>
            <li>So far all it has done was dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks it started to calm down and become soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>but this particular product is a thumbs down.  </li>

            <li> I am thrilled.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best shampoo and conditioner ive used on my hair...</li>
            <li> For the price I thought this was a nice quality product.</li>
            <li> Its a nice smell.</li>
            <li> The shampoo feels rather nice in use.</li>
            <li> It has a great scent and leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing so quickly and has a great shine</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful and after using the shampoo with the conditioner my hair is so soft!</li>
            <li> but if you follow up with a good conditioner it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I have had great success with this shampoo and conditioner in growing stronger hair.  </li>
            <li> and my hair ALWAYS smells amazing after using it :)</li>
            <li> Sulfate free is extremely good for your hair.</li>
            <li> It is one of my all time favorite shampoos; with the conditioner, my hair always feels amazing, without any added weight</li>
            <li> and I have experienced some hair loss, but honestly, it&#x27;s completely worth it to me.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and purchased this product to help speed up growth.</li>
            <li> In any case, there&#x27;s no way to know for sure if it helps or not, but it sure does have a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Very light shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I have tried most of them that are out there.  </li>
            <li> but I lost more hair than I wanted to.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I ordered more.</li>
            <li> this shampoo create volume in my hair which I love.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, I dont like washing my hair more than 3 times a week and the smell definetly stays,</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t see any more changes with your hair.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I also love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Would repurchase again except for the fact that I found the shampoo love of my life: OGX&#x27;s Keratin Oil shampoo.</li>
            <li> but I may repurchase this :)</li>
            <li> and I see no change in my hair if any thing I see more hair in my tub take it from me</li>
            <li> is try some thing better.</li>
            <li> Such a great product and will be continuing to use it!!</li>
            <li> First of all, this product smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for around two months, I love everything about it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> but i used most of the bottle then threw it out, WOULD NEVER BUY IT AGAIN</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> - I like combining the two. :)</li>
            <li> Which was more than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Probably would work better when paired with their conditioner.</li>
            <li> i do love how it smells like strawberries and cream and also how lightweight my hair feels.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I would like my shampoo to be a bit more strengthening.  </li>
            <li> I love the product though, and will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> (and it&#x27;s usually socially more accepted for a woman to have hair on their head)</li>
            <li> Use the conditioner to have a better chance of regrowth of hair</li>
            <li> Love it, Great smell, and works fast depending on person to person.</li>
            <li> I take Biotin and that does work for sure.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing in, I love the fact it isn&#x27;t loaded with sulfites (allergies)</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smell lovely</li>
            <li> I have to imagine that whatever else is in this shampoo to degrease, instead of sulfates, has got to be more harmful for my hair.</li>
            <li> i couldnt believe how soft ,clean, and awesome my hair felt and looked...</li>
            <li> First, it smells good in the bottle</li>
            <li> Trust me it make your hair dry to best thing</li>
            <li> Lastly, it smells great, kind of a fruity, strawberry scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering once you leave the shower.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, and I do see a huge difference in my hair growth and strength of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone trying to find a good sulfate-free system.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a more affordable SLS free shampoo</li>
            <li> smells amazing, but it doesn&#x27;t really make my hair feel hydrated and healthy.</li>
            <li> my hair is strong and never falls out.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely and you don&#x27;t need that much !</li>
            <li> , it lathers fine for me.</li>
            <li> In addition to my hair being fine, I have also noticed that since I&#x27;ve hit my 30&#x27;s that my hair seems thinner and takes longer to grow.</li>
            <li> Smelled fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine, medium length</li>
            <li> I have been using this &amp; murad&#x27;s shampoo for fine hair both to help with growing my hair out.</li>
            <li> and I feel like my hair is actually growing faster :) my new favorite kind that I will always use!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it that long, so I have no idea if my hair is growing longer and stronger, but it does smell really good!</li>
            <li> Not true if it helps to grow but smells delicious.</li>
            <li> It is also sulfate-free, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo because it was sulfate free.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had great results with my hair being shinier, healthier looking, and I can definitely see a gradual difference in length.</li>
            <li> I liked the product but my hair did not grow all that much.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I read many great reviews of the Not Your Mothers Way to Grow Long and Strong line and thought it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Firstly, it&#x27;s a sulfate free shampoo, which is better for your hair.</li>
            <li> It is a good shampoo, though it&#x27;s not my favorite because it tends to make my hair feel squeaky clean, stripped, and dry.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try it out because I&#x27;ve heard a lot about this product.</li>
            <li> After many, MANY, bottles of other brands of shampoos and conditioners (and I&#x27;m talking all over the dollar spectrum too), I&#x27;ve finally found that THIS shampoo &amp; conditioner is absolutely perfect for me.</li>
            <li> Co-workers &amp; friends keep commenting how long my hair has gotten &amp; how great it looks.</li>
            <li> My hair always feels ultra clean after using it,</li>
            <li> It literally was squeaky clean.</li>
            <li> The only upside to this shampoo is it smells good</li>
            <li> good for second day wash.</li>
            <li> YET after i was almost through one full bottle i had been noticeing ALOT of hair loss...</li>
            <li> my brush and comb full of my hair...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to write a review until a good amount of time later after buying.</li>
            <li> My hair already grows very quickly, but this stuff really seems to work!</li>
            <li> Also, I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the shedding that other reviewers have mentioned...</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> I even use it on my daughters super curly hair and she does not have to wash her hair as often and it does not relax her</li>
            <li> I most definitely recommend this product more than anything else.</li>
            <li> so I purchased this on a quick trip to the store.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and it left my scalp and hair clean.</li>
            <li> I recently donated hair to Locks of Love and got a pixie cut!</li>
            <li> This product DID take a while to get here, but it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Compared to other sulfate-free shampoos i&#x27;ve used I would definitely consider this to be the best one.</li>
            <li> and it has stopped growing as quickly as it did when I first started using it.</li>
            <li> After a major surgery most of my hair fell out...</li>
            <li> The reasons are because I, like many other reviewers, have experienced significant hair loss with each use, but far more concerning than the hair loss are the large, itchy, red sores I developed at the hairline.</li>
            <li> Sulfate-less shampoos usually do not lather, but this one lathers just fine.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it made me hair grow super long and made it smell nice to.</li>
            <li> The only reason I rated it four stars is because I have experienced a tiny bit of hair falling out.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and strong</li>
            <li> Love it, at the beginning my hair does not feels soft, but then after the conditioner wow!!!</li>
            <li> At first you use this and</li>
            <li> First time I try</li>
            <li> only con is the scent...not exactly fruity, seems more chemically or something.</li>
            <li> Add more water if more suds are needed, not more product.</li>
            <li> but it has made my hair a lot shinier,stronger, and overall healthy</li>
            <li> You have to massage it in for 2-3 minutes but to do that you have to use sooo much of it!</li>
            <li> I has been trying so many different shampoos and this was is still not working</li>
            <li> but my hair is growing fast!</li>
            <li> Plus I smell vaguely of apples, and that&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> cleans okay but leaves my hair piecy and stringy, would not recommend for daily use.</li>
            <li> My hair has really shown progress in its growth too!</li>
            <li> And you really can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> first day I changed to something</li>
            <li> Also it seems to work pretty well with my hair.</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> First time using this product.</li>
            <li> I use this daily with Aussie&#x27;s 3 minute miracle and that has helped my hair grow and become silky and healthy.</li>
            <li> However, the first time I used this, I had a lot hair in the bottom of my drain.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has helped so much!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve actually have gotten complements from everyone about how good my hair smells especially my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for the past 8 months now and my hair has never felt so healthy and strong.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair feel so clean and soft, and it really does help your hair grow--I noticed my hair getting longer after TWO washes (I also used the conditioner).  </li>
            <li> Really wanted to love this product since it is sulfate free, but it failed on many levels.</li>
            <li> In concentrated form, the chemical is so strong that it can burn human tissue.</li>
            <li> I was able to grow it out long enough in 2 weeks that I could pull it back and it had a nice shape to it in time for a wedding.</li>
            <li> Since using the shampoo and conditioner together I&#x27;ve grown out at least 4-5 inches of new, healthy hair :)</li>
            <li> Definitely don&#x27;t recommend for those with fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Last I was using Matrix shampoo and my hair was falling out in huge clumps.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, and my hair feels a lot stronger and thicker since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> Secondly, its sulfate free so I do not have to wash my hair as often.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo doesnt have as much lather as &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shampoo but don&#x27;t be alarmed.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bleached it, or done much of anything to it to let it grow out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It works, and my hair has grown fast</li>
            <li> so you really don&#x27;t need much.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Another thing I might add is that after using the shampoo you&#x27;re hair is very \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; that&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really noticed that my hair is longer and softer.</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;m straight outta the 80s.</li>
            <li> I however can&#x27;t justify paying the money when it goes so fast.</li>
            <li> You really have to use the conditioner though..</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my hair</li>
            <li> It really did make my hair fall out.</li>
            <li> I realized this company also makes a conditioner, and that both are available at CVS for the same price.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t happen overnight, but after about 2 months of using this shampoo I really noticed a difference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They r really working.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it really does contribute to hair growth.</li>
            <li> You can really feel the difference in your hair strength after using this product.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s because you really massage this into your hair</li>
            <li> Using the conditioner really makes a difference too.</li>
            <li> eventhough she has medical issues, she says you may notice more considerable results.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel really thick, in a good way.</li>
            <li> I used this product in along with the Long &amp; Strong Conditioner.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t noticed significant growth, but then again the product only promises to strengthen your hair, not lengthen it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited, never getting a different shampoo or conditioner again</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo for 2 reasons: My color does not fade as fast as with other shampoos!</li>
            <li> EPIC FAIL!!i used all 3 the sham, cond, and the leave in conditioner,while making your hair smell good and soft, I would have to agree with people that say there hair was falling out!</li>
            <li> Next with with the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However don&#x27;t expect super fast growing hair.</li>
            <li> After spending so much money on expensive products trying to grow my hair faster this has definitely left the best results.</li>
            <li> So even though my hair felt better than ever me losing my hair was not worth it....</li>
            <li> Some reviews say their hair falls out more, but mine has been falling out a lot less.</li>
            <li> I like how there are not as many additives in this product compared to regular shampoos, but I prefer Simply U.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item..</li>
            <li> ;) So you can&#x27;t really blame the product, only your head.</li>
            <li> Leave In Conditioner after my shampoo &amp; normal conditioning..</li>
            <li> :) I have trouble growing my hair</li>
            <li> (I normally use volumizing shampoos and conditioners) without feeling</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use these products long enough to attest to whether they aid in speeding up hair growth.</li>
            <li> My hair became even flatter and my hair is normally shiney and the product just dulled my hair.  </li>
            <li> Only slight drawbacks are that it doesn&#x27;t lather as nicely as I am used to and seems to make my eyes water even without getting it in them.</li>
            <li> so it was dry now its much healthier and softer and i can tell its growing faster than it was this product really works!</li>
            <li> When I bought this product my expectations were pretty low.</li>
            <li> I have Asian straight hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has been so shiney, bouncy, and soft.</li>
            <li> Still too early to tell, but I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> The other problem I seem to notice is that the conditioner runs out very fast!</li>
            <li> and it made my hair soft and silky again.</li>
            <li> I have noticed no hair loss with this product so far.</li>
            <li> you use a moisturizing conditioner to keep hair soft and detangled.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair really soft as well.</li>
            <li> Only con is that it doesnt really have a scent.</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged from coloring and heat treating it, and this has done wonders for my hair, keeping it soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> for a few months now and have noticed a significant increase in the rate my hair and nails grow.</li>
            <li> : The shampoo WILL make your hair dry, it will feel like wet straw, but the second you use a conditioner, any conditioner, its okay.</li>
            <li> I actually ended up shedding even more hair in the shower after I used this than usual</li>
            <li> I usually shed in the shower but after using this product the amount of hair I shed in the shower has increased tremendously!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely longer (I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little more than a month)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s color-treated, and very sensitive to sulfate-free color protective products - as in, most of them leave behind a residue that I can only get rid of by using &#x27;normal&#x27; shampoo that strips my color.</li>
            <li> I definitely have noticed my hair growing a bit faster than normal.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for people with thin straight hair since your hair is more likely to fall out with this product.</li>
            <li> After i wash it, i feel my hair dry, so I would not recomend it if you have very procesed hair...</li>
            <li> and then I switched back to my old shampoo and my hair felt almost like it&#x27;s old self again.</li>
            <li> while brushing my hair i use a pick my hair doesnt normally fall out, i thought maybe the first few days it would do that</li>
            <li> Since buying this, I&#x27;ve learned that it&#x27;s sold in stores for much much cheaper, however I have had some difficulty actually finding this specific type of this brand.</li>
            <li> I used it for a month and my hair is now super brittle, thin, and breaking left and right.</li>
            <li> far as new growth, I have not noticed a significant difference in growth, but I am growing out a stacked bob, so it is hard for me to tell how long my hair has grown with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> and it did the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that when using this product, I can wash my hair every other day or even every 2-3 days if I really push it.  </li>
            <li> At first I had trouble getting suds out of it</li>
            <li> It makes your hair very knotty and just clean, that sounds weird</li>
            <li> so I had to use a little more than I usually use.</li>
            <li> Love this product and my hair has definitely grown (which it never does) a few inches over the last few months I&#x27;ve been using it</li>
            <li> The first time I used this shampoo and rinsed it out my hair was stiff and notted.</li>
            <li> Usually when I switch shampoos my hair feels different but this product took feeling different to a whole new level.</li>
            <li> So far all it has done was dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks it started to calm down and become soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> but this particular product is a thumbs down.  </li>
            <li> a week later your hair looks like it is growing long</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling dry and noticed a lot of hair loss during my shampoo/conditioning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no chemist, but even without he sulfates this left my hair so dry.</li>
            <li> At least not a dramatic one.</li>
            <li> it can go a long way.</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this shampoo and conditioner because I saw a lot of comments that it worked to grow long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to grow out my hair for so long and tried just about everything else without luck, so figured might as well try this.</li>
            <li> Not really a noticeable amount, just a few strands here and there, which is normal, but</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip your hair dry.</li>
            <li> However it does make my hair dry even with the conditioner</li>
            <li> The shampoo does leave the my hair feeling dry but my scalp tends to be oily</li>
            <li> However, I do loose a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> I have over half a bottle left</li>
            <li> if it was a little longer I would suggest following with an oil while it is damp.</li>
            <li> extreme hair loss and boy was I shocked to find this item really works well from the first try..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found it takes less time for me to flat iron my hair since using this product.</li>
            <li> Returned not what I expected</li>
            <li> Also I realized that they made a few changes to the product since the last time i used it.</li>
            <li> I ended up using it for a few months and noticed my hair definitely grew faster!</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> , I have already ordered my second shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: it&#x27;s been a few months</li>
            <li> I gave the whole bottle a chance, but to no avail, my hair looked worse than when I started.</li>
            <li> A little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> defiantly listen to the other reviews hair loss is a biggie...</li>
            <li> other than that...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s pretty expensive for an 8 oz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it is actually helping it grow</li>
            <li> I found a way around this however: use a smaller amount than usual, and rub it between your palms so that it&#x27;s easier to distribute through your hair.</li>
            <li> I just apply to my scalp and use other conditioners for my ends, but I am running out of it.</li>
            <li> Along with other methods for hair growth, my hair has grown five inches in under two months.</li>
            <li> my hair is at an awkward length almost to my shoulders but not quite so that&#x27;s the goal with this! :)</li>
            <li> I did not pay attention to other reviews and decided to try this product, despite the reviews saying it caused hair loss.</li>
            <li> Might work for other types of hair.</li>
            <li> and a little goes a very long way...</li>
            <li> It looked dull and dry and flat.</li>
            <li> hair grows so slowly that I only need to get my hair cut twice a year</li>
            <li> I could have done without the waiting everyday for the mail to come, but other than that..</li>
            <li> I pair this shampoo and conditioner with an anti-snap protein cream and my hair is way less damaged and brittle.</li>
            <li> Since I started using it my hair grew about half an inch.</li>
            <li> It is less than $5 in the drug stores.</li>
            <li> but it it also softer and less greasy.</li>
            <li> and you have thick, dry, curly hair like me</li>
            <li> and I want to put the rest down the drain!</li>
            <li> should, without leaving behind any weird oily/clumpy residues, and has kept my red hair relatively vibrant for the past month.</li>
            <li> I found these products to be extremely harsh and damaging.</li>
            <li> it smooths my hair, not recommended for heavily oiled hair.</li>
            <li> so i went to walmart and bought it just a few days ago</li>
            <li> This is the worst long and strong collection I have used</li>
            <li> It has made my hair fall out a lot less, thank God!</li>
            <li> but I already have almost a half inch growth!</li>
            <li> Also I discovered it&#x27;s half the price at Target!</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and this conditioner makes it a little to frizzy.</li>
            <li> so not sure if this helps hair to grow faster...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure if my hairs growing faster yet</li>
            <li> I was at first really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually read ingredients but shame on me for making a purchase without doing so.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past two months and will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it at my local Ulta store so ill</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any hair loss like the other review.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair and was worried that it would weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Started using it when my hair was at that really awkward stage where I couldn&#x27;t quite pull it back</li>
            <li> Within two weeks my hair was at least a quarter inch longer.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a problem for me because I have rather thick hair, but it may bother others.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I would defiantly rate this a five but because of the major hair loss issue i rate it a one star,two at the highest :(</li>
            <li> this stuff is not good.</li>
            <li> shampoo is very thick</li>
            <li> In the past month, my hair has grown 3 inches!!</li>
            <li> twice per week) for approximately two weeks.</li>
            <li> May make thin hair fall out though.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is extremely thin, I cannot afford to sacrifice any.</li>
            <li> I figured it was just because you have to massage this into your hair for two minutes, but each time it got worse and worse.</li>
            <li> ingredients show that among a barage of chemicals, it contains Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone: (meth-ul-chloro-iso-thia-zol-linone) Used in combination (in a dilute form) as a biocide to deter the growth of bacteria and other organisms.</li>
            <li> Not much success :(</li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD PRODUCT AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> I used this once and my scalp, face, neck, ears and back broke out into terrible hives.  </li>
            <li> I have been cutting my hair still and it has continued to grow, it&#x27;s now almost shoulder length</li>
            <li> In an attempt to correct a bad haircut I bought this to grow it out faster.</li>
            <li> Pricing isn&#x27;t bad at all considering how well this product has been working for me.</li>
            <li> It smells really bad.</li>
            <li> i could even go a couple days without it looking bad....</li>
            <li> The fact that no items are bad for the scalp..and have to admit..even used on my elderly puppy on bald spots where hair growth started after using it.</li>
            <li> Allergic to the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; preservative in this :(</li>
            <li> but when it comes out it smells awful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the worst long and strong collection I have used and I have tried most of them that are out there.  I had to throw it out.</li>
            <li> defiantly listen to the other reviews hair loss is a biggie...it grew out but I lost more hair than I wanted to.</li>
            <li> Love this product and my hair has definitely grown (which it never does) a few inches over the last few months I&#x27;ve been using it</li>
            <li> GREAT shampoo. My hair always feels ultra clean after using it, like there&#x27;s no build up at all.</li>
            <li> Its strips all and any oil from my hair and leaves it feeling brittle and weaker than before i used it.</li>
            <li> i purchased this product and it smelled good and was a good shampoo and conditioner but didnt make my hair grow any,..</li>
            <li> The smell is nice. But as for the job...not so nice. I actually ended up shedding even more hair in the shower after I used this than usual so it&#x27;s literally been sitting in my shower and not having been used for almost a year probably...NOT A GOOD PRODUCT AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> Item as described. Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Love it. I ordered more.</li>
            <li> Returned not what I expected</li>
            <li> Noticeable improvement before bottle was done.</li>
            <li> I have Asian straight hair. this shampoo create volume in my hair which I love. have been using this for 1 week but have not noticed any changes... so not sure if this helps hair to grow faster...</li>
            <li> I like how there are not as many additives in this product compared to regular shampoos, but I prefer Simply U. My hair is thick and this conditioner makes it a little to frizzy. After a few weeks it started to calm down and become soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, and my hair feels a lot stronger and thicker since I&#x27;ve started using it. It has made my hair fall out a lot less, thank God! Last I was using Matrix shampoo and my hair was falling out in huge clumps. (But, that&#x27;s just me.)&lt;br /&gt;For everyone that says it&#x27;s not making you&#x27;re hair grow, it could possibly be that your hair is in the &amp;#34;Telogen&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Resting Phase,&amp;#34; in which it won&#x27;t grow for up to two months.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed significant growth, but then again the product only promises to strengthen your hair, not lengthen it. Growing hair times TIME.;) So you can&#x27;t really blame the product, only your head.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and lather. Time will tell if it works</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo for 2 reasons: My color does not fade as fast as with other shampoos! Secondly, its sulfate free so I do not have to wash my hair as often.  I bought this shampoo because it was sulfate free.  I even use it on my daughters super curly hair and she does not have to wash her hair as often and it does not relax her curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as new growth, I have not noticed a significant difference in growth, but I am growing out a stacked bob, so it is hard for me to tell how long my hair has grown with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This product smells good, kind of like a strawberry smoothie, but I did not notice a change in my hair growth. At least not a dramatic one.</li>
            <li> I have had great success with this shampoo and conditioner in growing stronger hair.  It has a great scent and leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this shampoo + the conditioner and i love it. Compared to other sulfate-free shampoos i&#x27;ve used I would definitely consider this to be the best one. It lathers nicely and you don&#x27;t need that much ! it can go a long way. Also I realized that they made a few changes to the product since the last time i used it. They no longer add any dyes to the formula ! so thats just an added plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and my hair ALWAYS smells amazing after using it :)</li>
            <li> I love the smell, I dont like washing my hair more than 3 times a week and the smell definetly stays, After i wash it, i feel my hair dry, so I would not recomend it if you have very procesed hair... other than that... the product is great, and the sellers deliver on time..</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and was worried that it would weigh it down. However, I also need a good amount of conditioning because I color my hair every 3 weeks. The shampoo smells wonderful- like strawberries. The shampoo doesnt have as much lather as &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; shampoo but don&#x27;t be alarmed. This is actually a good thing. The shampoo doesn&#x27;t strip your hair dry. My hair has been so shiney, bouncy, and soft. The conditioner is the best I&#x27;ve ever used and I have been a licensed cosmetologist for 6 years. I stock up on it when I go to the store. Try it!!</li>
            <li> Waiting to see if it helps grow back some hair. Still too early to tell, but I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> I read in a magazine that this was a must have to grow your hair. In an attempt to correct a bad haircut I bought this to grow it out faster. So far all it has done was dry out my hair. I even bought the leave in conditioner. Not much success :(</li>
            <li> This product DID take a while to get here, but it was well worth it. I was already using the NYM Grow Leave In Conditioner after my shampoo &amp; normal conditioning.. I had no idea they made shampoo and conditioner in this set as well. The smell is amazing, strawberry like. I&#x27;ve read some people saying it doesn&#x27;t lather for them, it lathers fine for me. Sulfate free is extremely good for your hair. Also, the chemical they DO put in tho shampoo &amp; cone DOES promote hair growth. I used to have a &#x27;dike spike&#x27;, a fowhawk, so my hair was extremely short last year, around January. I had my son in March. Now today it&#x27;s about below my shoulders, even longer straightened. I haven&#x27;t bleached it, or done much of anything to it to let it grow out. This shampoo and conditioner is amazing. I give it 5*, smells good, feels good, and WORKS. I could have done without the waiting everyday for the mail to come, but other than that.. I most definitely recommend this product more than anything else.</li>
            <li> Have been using for about 2 weeks... hair is definitely thicker, silkier and stronger. Will update as it grows!  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it&#x27;s pretty expensive for an 8 oz. bottle.</li>
            <li> I used this once and my scalp, face, neck, ears and back broke out into terrible hives.  My daughter&#x27;s friend had the same reaction.</li>
            <li> At first you use this and a week later your hair looks like it is growing long but after that it like stops working and you don&#x27;t see any more changes with your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of this stuff and I love it. It does make your hair feel a bit dry/crunchy (?) after washing but if you follow up with a good conditioner it&#x27;s fine. I definitely have noticed my hair growing a bit faster than normal.</li>
            <li> My hair already grows very quickly, but this stuff really seems to work! Started using it when my hair was at that really awkward stage where I couldn&#x27;t quite pull it back and it looked a bit like a mullet. I was able to grow it out long enough in 2 weeks that I could pull it back and it had a nice shape to it in time for a wedding. It smells really nice too. Only slight drawbacks are that it doesn&#x27;t lather as nicely as I am used to and seems to make my eyes water even without getting it in them.</li>
            <li> First time I try and I think it would be mine forever</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It won&#x27;t actually make your hair GROW but it will help to make it stronger, which in turn will help it grow longer.  I&#x27;ve also found that when using this product, I can wash my hair every other day or even every 2-3 days if I really push it.  I also love the way it smells.  I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I was told about this and wanted to try it. I love this product. It works, and my hair has grown fast</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly sure if my hairs growing faster yet but I&#x27;ll give it some time.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo is very thick so you really don&#x27;t need much.&lt;br /&gt;My only con is the scent...not exactly fruity, seems more chemically or something. Eitherway its not enough to deter me from using it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! It leaves my hair soft and shiny. I&#x27;m not sure it is actually helping it grow but maybe?</li>
            <li> I thought I would try this shampoo and conditioner because I saw a lot of comments that it worked to grow long hair. Well I tried it and I hare it! First, it smells good in the bottle but when it comes out it smells awful. Second, the shampoo made my hair feel like rubber. It clumped my hair together and knotted it together. I usually shed in the shower but after using this product the amount of hair I shed in the shower has increased tremendously! Third, the conditioner made my hair clump together also. Usually when I switch shampoos my hair feels different but this product took feeling different to a whole new level. I will not be using this product again! I have over half a bottle left and I want to put the rest down the drain!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I ended up using it for a few months and noticed my hair definitely grew faster! I only wish I could buy it in big pump bottles!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo along with the matching conditioner. It is a good shampoo, though it&#x27;s not my favorite because it tends to make my hair feel squeaky clean, stripped, and dry. I found a way around this however: use a smaller amount than usual, and rub it between your palms so that it&#x27;s easier to distribute through your hair. Add more water if more suds are needed, not more product. I like the strawberry scent, and it dissipates after your hair dries if you don&#x27;t like it. Also, I haven&#x27;t experienced any of the shedding that other reviewers have mentioned... it just depends on the person I guess. It makes my hair feel really thick, in a good way. Would repurchase again except for the fact that I found the shampoo love of my life: OGX&#x27;s Keratin Oil shampoo.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased the shampoo and conditioner at Wal-mart about 2 weeks ago. I was looking for the mane-n-tail however they ran out so I decided to try this out. I was really excited to try it out because I&#x27;ve heard a lot about this product. I&#x27;ve only been using it for two weeks but it has made my hair a lot shinier,stronger, and overall healthy (I got a trim on the 23rd of July though so that may factor in). However, I do loose a lot of hair. It isn&#x27;t a problem for me because I have rather thick hair, but it may bother others. The other problem I seem to notice is that the conditioner runs out very fast! You have to massage it in for 2-3 minutes but to do that you have to use sooo much of it! I just apply to my scalp and use other conditioners for my ends, but I am running out of it. Another thing I might add is that after using the shampoo you&#x27;re hair is very \\&quot;squeaky clean\\&quot; that&#x27;s all I can say. It makes your hair very knotty and just clean, that sounds weird but you catch my drift. Lastly, I haven&#x27;t noticed a noticeable increase in growth, but it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks so idk. I just ordered my mane-n-tail but I may repurchase this :)</li>
            <li> its amazing it smells good and my hair has grown I only used it for a month and it is 1 inch longer its amazing I definitely would buy this aging</li>
            <li> I has been trying so many different shampoos and this was is still not working it has been a month and I see no change in my hair if any thing I see more hair in my tub take it from me this stuff is not good. Trust me it make your hair dry to best thing is try some thing better.</li>
            <li> I bought this so that it would make my hair stronger and it did the complete opposite. I used it for a month and my hair is now super brittle, thin, and breaking left and right. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what the cause was and then I switched back to my old shampoo and my hair felt almost like it&#x27;s old self again. Never would have thought this lengthening and strengthening shampoo would be the culprit! Definitely don&#x27;t recommend for those with fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li> Love love love this brand!!! The smell is wonderful and the results are even better! However it does make my hair dry even with the conditioner but my hair is growing fast! I started noticing the results after 3 uses and I&#x27;m so happy :) I have trouble growing my hair but since I started using the shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve really noticed that my hair is longer and softer. Such a great product and will be continuing to use it!! Pricing isn&#x27;t bad at all considering how well this product has been working for me. I recommend this product to everyone ! Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v been using this shampoo with the conditioner and product for thickening for 2 weeks. I&#x27;m finding clumps of hair in my tub and my hair is so brittle it is cracking.  I don&#x27;t know what they put in these products but it does not work for me.  BE CAREFUL.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in combination with [[ASIN:B004H7GB9G Natrol Biotin 10,000mcg, Maximum Strength, 100 Tablets]] for a few months now and have noticed a significant increase in the rate my hair and nails grow. I can&#x27;t attribute the significance to either specifically (though I know for a fact how efficient biotin is). I personally believe that the reason for any hair loss in the shower is because of the massaging you have to do for it, which should be done anyway if you&#x27;re trying to achieve optimal hair growth. In any case, there&#x27;s no way to know for sure if it helps or not, but it sure does have a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it that long, so I have no idea if my hair is growing longer and stronger, but it does smell really good! It is one of my all time favorite shampoos; with the conditioner, my hair always feels amazing, without any added weight so I can still get the volume I want (I normally use volumizing shampoos and conditioners) without feeling like I&#x27;m straight outta the 80s. Plus I smell vaguely of apples, and that&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> First of all, this product smells amazing! I purchased it because I have always struggled to grow my hair. In the past month, my hair has grown 3 inches!! It&#x27;s like a weed. People are noticing and complimenting me. The only two issues are that it doesn&#x27;t lather well and I have experienced some hair loss, but honestly, it&#x27;s completely worth it to me. I am thrilled.</li>
            <li> cleans okay but leaves my hair piecy and stringy, would not recommend for daily use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for around two months, I love everything about it. The smell, the way my hair feels. Along with other methods for hair growth, my hair has grown five inches in under two months.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick, curly hair. It&#x27;s color-treated, and very sensitive to sulfate-free color protective products - as in, most of them leave behind a residue that I can only get rid of by using &#x27;normal&#x27; shampoo that strips my color. After many, MANY, bottles of other brands of shampoos and conditioners (and I&#x27;m talking all over the dollar spectrum too), I&#x27;ve finally found that THIS shampoo &amp; conditioner is absolutely perfect for me. It cleans my hair like it should, without leaving behind any weird oily/clumpy residues, and has kept my red hair relatively vibrant for the past month. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend it to anyone trying to find a good sulfate-free system.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and purchased this product to help speed up growth. In addition to my hair being fine, I have also noticed that since I&#x27;ve hit my 30&#x27;s that my hair seems thinner and takes longer to grow. I read many great reviews of the Not Your Mothers Way to Grow Long and Strong line and thought it was worth a try. I used the shampoo, conditioner and leave in conditioner (twice per week) for approximately two weeks. I haven&#x27;t been able to use these products long enough to attest to whether they aid in speeding up hair growth. The reasons are because I, like many other reviewers, have experienced significant hair loss with each use, but far more concerning than the hair loss are the large, itchy, red sores I developed at the hairline. These sores took almost two weeks to heal while using only a PH specific shampoo as prescribed by my dermatologist.  I found these products to be extremely harsh and damaging. Please use with caution!</li>
            <li> The first time I used this shampoo and rinsed it out my hair was stiff and notted. I was at first really disappointed. After I washed it out since I didn&#x27;t have the conditioner I used a moisturizing conditioner and it made my hair soft and silky again. The only upside to this shampoo is it smells good and it helps your hair grow. It does not however make your hair grow it helps it grow. I have noticed no hair loss with this product so far. May make thin hair fall out though. I do recommend if you buy this shampoo and you have thick, dry, curly hair like me you use a moisturizing conditioner to keep hair soft and detangled. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for people with thin straight hair since your hair is more likely to fall out with this product.</li>
            <li> Noticed no change. Smelled fine.</li>
            <li> Bought this along with the conditioner, hoping to help grow my hair out. Didn&#x27;t do it. It smells really bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only shampoo I will use.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Leaves my hair really soft as well. Will have to track the length of growth.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Smells so great and it actually works! My hair is growing so quickly and has a great shine</li>
            <li> Read the reviews for the product before I bought it and figured I&#x27;d try it! I&#x27;ve been wanting to grow out my hair for so long and tried just about everything else without luck, so figured might as well try this. It works sooo good! The smell is wonderful and after using the shampoo with the conditioner my hair is so soft! I pair this shampoo and conditioner with an anti-snap protein cream and my hair is way less damaged and brittle. I would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I buy this product for my daughter and she loves it. I however can&#x27;t justify paying the money when it goes so fast.</li>
            <li> Very light shampoo. it smooths my hair, not recommended for heavily oiled hair. good for second day wash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for the past 8 months now and my hair has never felt so healthy and strong. My hair has really shown progress in its growth too! Since using the shampoo and conditioner together I&#x27;ve grown out at least 4-5 inches of new, healthy hair :) After spending so much money on expensive products trying to grow my hair faster this has definitely left the best results. And you really can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best shampoo and conditioner ive used on my hair...i couldnt believe how soft ,clean, and awesome my hair felt and looked...i could even go a couple days without it looking bad....YET after i was almost through one full bottle i had been noticeing ALOT of hair loss...my hair was clogging the bath tub drain,which NEVER happens....my hair was just pulling out in the shower....my brush and comb full of my hair...even in clumps!...my hair is strong and never falls out. So even though my hair felt better than ever me losing my hair was not worth it....first day I changed to something els my hair stopped falling out....I am a good judgment of products and I see alit of five stars on this but take it from me and just watch the amounts of hair loss if u try this product! I would defiantly rate this a five but because of the major hair loss issue i rate it a one star,two at the highest :( bummer</li>
            <li> This shampoo actually makes my hair grow! It smells yummy too! It came in efficient timing(:</li>
            <li> this stuff smells soooo good!! I bought it at CVS for $6. I can&#x27;t wait to use it! my hair is at an awkward length almost to my shoulders but not quite so that&#x27;s the goal with this! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner to help grow out a pixie cut. The scent is nice and it left my scalp and hair clean. The shampoo does leave the my hair feeling dry but my scalp tends to be oily so I didn&#x27;t mind--if it was a little longer I would suggest following with an oil while it is damp. For the price I thought this was a nice quality product.</li>
            <li> EPIC FAIL!!i used all 3 the sham, cond, and the leave in conditioner,while making your hair smell good and soft, I would have to agree with people that say there hair was falling out! it made my hair break off it was everywhere i looked, on my tshirt all threw the day, in the shower and while brushing my hair i use a pick my hair doesnt normally fall out, i thought maybe the first few days it would do that but i used most of the bottle then threw it out, WOULD NEVER BUY IT AGAIN NOR WOULD I RECOMMEND IT!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, and I do see a huge difference in my hair growth and strength of my hair. The shampoo and conditioner smell so good. You really have to use the conditioner though.. but thats okay - I like combining the two. :)</li>
            <li> I used this product in along with the Long &amp; Strong Conditioner. I have fine, medium length hair.&lt;br /&gt;It smells wonderful but my hair felt greasy afterwards, even with the shampoo alone.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference in my hair but I&#x27;ve only used it for a few weeks. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be continuing to use it given how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and leaves my hair feeling great. The only drawback to this shampoo is that is does not lather well. But it does make my hair feel stronger and I can see an increase in growth.</li>
            <li> I did not pay attention to other reviews and decided to try this product, despite the reviews saying it caused hair loss. Big mistake! It really did make my hair fall out. Since my hair is extremely thin, I cannot afford to sacrifice any. I will not be using this shampoo again.</li>
            <li> Allergic to the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; preservative in this :(</li>
            <li> When I bought this product my expectations were pretty low. I wanted to try something to help the growth of my hair as it seemed to have to slowed to a halt.I also wasn&#x27;t in the mood to spend a lot of money on something that probably wouldn&#x27;t work for me anyway. I noticed comments how this one smells like Strawberries. Since I like strawberries I thought to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell like strawberries. Its a nice smell. The shampoo feels rather nice in use. A little seems to go a long way. Also it seems to work pretty well with my hair. Within two weeks my hair was at least a quarter inch longer. Which was more than I was expecting. Probably would work better when paired with their conditioner. Will probably buy again when I run around. Next with with the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However don&#x27;t expect super fast growing hair. Since I started using it my hair grew about half an inch. This is over the course of 1 month. I didn&#x27;t want to write a review until a good amount of time later after buying.</li>
            <li> Love it, at the beginning my hair does not feels soft, but then after the conditioner wow!!! Soo perfect. Not true if it helps to grow but smells delicious.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I&#x27;ve had great results with my hair being shinier, healthier looking, and I can definitely see a gradual difference in length. BUT....DO NOT buy this product on Amazon. It is less than $5 in the drug stores. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes when I saw the price of it on here!</li>
            <li> i bought this so my hair could grow out but instead it fell out. i do love how it smells like strawberries and cream and also how lightweight my hair feels. however, i won&#x27;t be using this shampoo/conditioner ever again.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  It makes your hair feel so clean and soft, and it really does help your hair grow--I noticed my hair getting longer after TWO washes (I also used the conditioner).  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I definitely recommend this product.  I have not experienced any hair loss like the other review.  I will definitely continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> Works very well! Great if you color your hair. Only con is that it doesnt really have a scent. First time using this product. Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Works great! After I purchased it on amazon I realized this company also makes a conditioner, and that both are available at CVS for the same price. But the shampoo it&#x27;s self works he great.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it made me hair grow super long and made it smell nice to. I would defiantly buy this shampoo and conditioner again.</li>
            <li> smells amazing, but it doesn&#x27;t really make my hair feel hydrated and healthy. Might work for other types of hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. It smells amazing and is sulfate free--both good things for hair. I can&#x27;t say whether it actually made my hair grow because I&#x27;ve also been taking vitamins and getting regular trims. My hair  definitely seems a lot healthier . Since buying this, I&#x27;ve learned that it&#x27;s sold in stores for much much cheaper, however I have had some difficulty actually finding this specific type of this brand.</li>
            <li> Combined with the conditioner, this shampoo not only cleans but it definitely helps promote hair growth. It didn&#x27;t happen overnight, but after about 2 months of using this shampoo I really noticed a difference.&lt;br /&gt;My hair grows so slowly that I only need to get my hair cut twice a year but I just noticed that I dyed my hair 3 weeks ago but I already have almost a half inch growth! I&#x27;m so excited, never getting a different shampoo or conditioner again, maybe I&#x27;ll get the leave in conditioner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DISCLAIMER: The shampoo WILL make your hair dry, it will feel like wet straw, but the second you use a conditioner, any conditioner, its okay. I&#x27;ve never not used the conditioner but I don&#x27;t think the dryness is permanent.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this. She has noticed and improvement in hair growth eventhough she has medical issues, she says you may notice more considerable results. She says her hair seems thicker and healthier, she has noticed an inch growth after 1 bottle use, she uses the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! It smells amazing and I feel like my hair is actually growing faster :) my new favorite kind that I will always use!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a more affordable SLS free shampoo so I purchased this on a quick trip to the store. I usually read ingredients but shame on me for making a purchase without doing so. I used this and it made my hair look terrible.&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients show that among a barage of chemicals, it contains Methylchloroisothiazolinone and Methylisothiazolinone: (meth-ul-chloro-iso-thia-zol-linone) Used in combination (in a dilute form) as a biocide to deter the growth of bacteria and other organisms. In concentrated form, the chemical is so strong that it can burn human tissue. Some studies conclude that it is toxic, but it is not officially classified as known or probably carcinogen.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> Really wanted to love this product since it is sulfate free, but it failed on many levels. Left my hair feeling dry and noticed a lot of hair loss during my shampoo/conditioning.</li>
            <li> Professes volumize, strengthen and luxurious shine.  My hair became even flatter and my hair is normally shiney and the product just dulled my hair.  I like the shampoo but this particular product is a thumbs down.  I even emailed them and received no response.</li>
            <li> I have been using this &amp; murad&#x27;s shampoo for fine hair both to help with growing my hair out. They r really working. Co-workers &amp; friends keep commenting how long my hair has gotten &amp; how great it looks. I definitely will keep using!!</li>
            <li> This product is great for a multitude of reasons. Firstly, it&#x27;s a sulfate free shampoo, which is better for your hair. Sulfate-less shampoos usually do not lather, but this one lathers just fine. Secondly, it really does contribute to hair growth. My hair is damaged from coloring and heat treating it, and this has done wonders for my hair, keeping it soft and shiny. Lastly, it smells great, kind of a fruity, strawberry scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering once you leave the shower. The only reason I rated it four stars is because I have experienced a tiny bit of hair falling out. Not really a noticeable amount, just a few strands here and there, which is normal, but I would like my shampoo to be a bit more strengthening.  I love the product though, and will be repurchasing. I use this daily with Aussie&#x27;s 3 minute miracle and that has helped my hair grow and become silky and healthy.</li>
            <li> After a major surgery most of my hair fell out...this item is helping me regain hair (and it&#x27;s usually socially more accepted for a woman to have hair on their head) The fact that no items are bad for the scalp..and have to admit..even used on my elderly puppy on bald spots where hair growth started after using it. No issues with the speed of shipping or packing! Use the conditioner to have a better chance of regrowth of hair</li>
            <li> You can really feel the difference in your hair strength after using this product. It is also sulfate-free, which is a huge plus. I will be purchasing this shampoo in the future.</li>
            <li> I thought the concept of this was great! However, the first time I used this, I had a lot hair in the bottom of my drain. I figured it was just because you have to massage this into your hair for two minutes, but each time it got worse and worse. I am returning the rest of the product. It&#x27;s awful!</li>
            <li> Love it, Great smell, and works fast depending on person to person.</li>
            <li> No proof that this stuff works. I take Biotin and that does work for sure.</li>
            <li> I was a bit leery as to how it would respond after extreme hair loss and boy was I shocked to find this item really works well from the first try..I have body now..My hair is growing in, I love the fact it isn&#x27;t loaded with sulfites (allergies) and a little goes a very long way...I highly recommend this item..Hope it works as well for you as it did for me.. Thank you Amazon for having another great product&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I liked the product but my hair did not grow all that much. It also brock me out and i just don&#x27;t think this product is good for me.</li>
            <li> So this stuff is actually wonderful. It makes my hair smell lovely and I&#x27;ve actually have gotten complements from everyone about how good my hair smells especially my boyfriend. Haha so boyfriend approved! It also made my hair silkier and I&#x27;ve found it takes less time for me to flat iron my hair since using this product. It has no sulfate so I&#x27;ve seen 100% reduction on losing hair or split ends . I have been using it for the past two months and will continue to use. I&#x27;ve found it at my local Ulta store so ill be purchasing from there now since I don&#x27;t have to wait.</li>
            <li> Have yet to see results. There is some hair that falls out but I think it&#x27;s because you really massage this into your hair, there is bound to be.</li>
            <li> I had chopped off my hair into a bob and after hating the maintenance I decided to grow it out. This shampoo has helped so much! At first I had trouble getting suds out of it so I had to use a little more than I usually use. But oh man does it smell good! I have been cutting my hair still and it has continued to grow, it&#x27;s now almost shoulder length and I have only been using it for about a month now. Using the conditioner really makes a difference too. My hair is so soft and strong, I have already ordered my second shampoo!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: it&#x27;s been a few months and it has stopped growing as quickly as it did when I first started using it. So I think cycling it out with another shampoo might help. Also I discovered it&#x27;s half the price at Target!</li>
            <li> I saw this product on Urban Outfitters site and then did some research before I bought it. I recently donated hair to Locks of Love and got a pixie cut! But now I want to grow it out again. I&#x27;m almost done with my first bottle of shampoo, and conditioner as well, and I have seen a wonderful difference in my hair! It&#x27;s definitely longer (I&#x27;ve only been using it for a little more than a month) but it it also softer and less greasy. I can go a day or two without washing my hair and it still looks and feels like I did. It smells amazing, like strawberries! And the scent isn&#x27;t overpowering but lasts through the day and even the night! Some reviews say their hair falls out more, but mine has been falling out a lot less. I have had several days when I&#x27;ve used a different shampoo, so with my next bottle I will be using only NYM. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results!</li>
            <li> I had been reading all the reviews about this product so i went to walmart and bought it just a few days ago and already i see a difference in my hair ive been bleaching my hair so it was dry now its much healthier and softer and i can tell its growing faster than it was this product really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no chemist, but even without he sulfates this left my hair so dry. It literally was squeaky clean. I have to imagine that whatever else is in this shampoo to degrease, instead of sulfates, has got to be more harmful for my hair. I gave the whole bottle a chance, but to no avail, my hair looked worse than when I started. I had to do an olive oil treatment to put moisture back in my hair. Never again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the way it made my hair feel or smell. It looked dull and dry and flat. I will look for something else. Purchased with the conditioner.</li>
