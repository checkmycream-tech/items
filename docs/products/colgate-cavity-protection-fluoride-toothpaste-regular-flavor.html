    <ol>
            <li>Awesome!</li>
            <li>This is awesome, 6 toothpastes for $10?</li>
            <li>Its one of the oldest tooth pastes on the market, and time has proven it to be one of the best.</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal for name-brand paste.</li>
            <li>and I think that it is a great deal.</li>
            <li>This is always a great buy.</li>
            <li>Great product, hoping that will do the job</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>Great pricing, product as described.</li>
            <li>It has a good price and the packaging and product quality is great.</li>
            <li>Great deal, amazing price.</li>
            <li>A good deal and I like having it on hand.</li>
            <li>Good value.  </li>
            <li>It just what you&#x27;d expect and that&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to work and is a good price</li>
            <li>Bonus... good for polishing silver.</li>
            <li>Love it, been using them for years, great deal for pack of 6.</li>
            <li>Everything I found at stores had whitening (which hurt my teeth), some kind of chemicals that made the skin inside of my mouth peel, and tasted like they contained perfume.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d happily give it five stars if the tube was actually full of toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed, at a great price.</li>
            <li>Has a nice taste... not to strong like some gel toothpastes.</li>
            <li>It is toothpaste OK?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>I love the 8oz tube.</li>
            <li>I store them in the top shelf of the cupboard.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE not worrying about TP.</li>
            <li>After I posted my comments I recieved many phone calls from someone</li>
            <li>And for the price, even better.</li>
            <li>so I was glad to find this.  </li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t love the toothpaste.</li>
            <li>This is probably one of the most frugal purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less</li>
            <li>Ok, then... off to find another source...</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>This is just a very good regular toothpaste.</li>
            <li>Love the free Prime shipping.</li>
            <li>Good price and fast delivery</li>
            <li>great buy super fast shipping a+++</li>
            <li>I choose this toothpaste as being the best from all the other brands that I have used.</li>
            <li>Colgate original is my favorite toothpaste because it does not contain hydrated silica as a &#x27;whitener&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for strong mint flavored toothpaste.</li>
            <li>toothpaste, works fine.</li>
            <li>and they thought it was fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The flavor is mild and refreshing and my teeth feel squeaky clean afterward.  </li>
            <li>So in this case the lower cost product turns out to be better than the higher cost alternatives.</li>
            <li>Pretty inexpensive, pretty tasty, pretty effective at removing gunk from your teeth and tongue and gums.  </li>
            <li>My dentist tells me that he believes it&#x27;s better to skip all the latest toothpastes with additives such as brighteners, mouthwash, gum health, etc.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and I get it quickly with Prime shipping.</li>
            <li>After using this toothpaste consistently for 5 months (morning and at night before bed), I visited my dentist for my general cleaning and according to my dentist, there was nothing to clean!</li>
            <li>A fantastic option for the college student who doesn&#x27;t have the time to make frequent trips to the store.</li>
            <li>Just like I&#x27;ve always remembered it ;)</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s toothpaste.....not much to say after that!</li>
            <li>I came back to order more of this and the price has nearly doubled!</li>
            <li>I ordered it because I have braces and it is hard to find good toothpaste without whitening.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to go so much.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted the toothpaste which is what they said they were going to do when I called them, but it was asking too much</li>
            <li>This Colgate product is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This toothpaste is just your original, normal, white toothpaste.</li>
            <li>The bottom line is I recieved a lot of phone calls (at inappropriate times) and I could hardly understand what the gentleman was saying as his english was not too good.</li>
            <li>but... why do toothpaste companies waste packaging by injecting huge air bubbles into their tubes of product?</li>
            <li>+ year old neighbor what I bought</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth or make my mouth sensitive.</li>
            <li>Tooth paste shopping is like car shopping these days, there are so many models and versions of each model, that it gets completely confusing.</li>
            <li>I like to stick by the old, reliable, time tested products that you know are going to work, and that&#x27;s just what you get with this Colgate tooth paste.</li>
            <li>I got tired of not being able to find just normal toothpaste.</li>

            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t leave that lasting freshness that I get from other products.</li>
            <li> You definitely still need mouthwash just like any other toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Note the tube size is larger than average</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s getting more difficult to find the Regular flavor toothpaste lately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to find toothpaste without silica any more.</li>
            <li> I received what I bought\\&quot;, and I only typically bought a few items in bulk</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s half the price of what Colgate costs when it&#x27;s on sale in my area.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention that I got 6 of the largest tubes for the price of about  one and a half tubes when buying them one at a time.</li>
            <li> This is a no-brainer if you want to save a little money while stocking your household.</li>
            <li> This was never the case when I used other competing brands!!</li>
            <li> This is your everyday grocery store toothpaste with the added convenience of not having to get out of your house.</li>
            <li> The caps are the small version that do not allow the tube to stand on end</li>
            <li> No more expensive, little tubes and no more cutting them open with scissors to scrape the last bit out!</li>
            <li> It is really hard to find products without whitener in them</li>
            <li> No big stores with 35 checkout lanes and 2 clerks working, no waiting behind 6 dozen angry customers, no road rage, no gas, no hassle.  </li>
            <li> Got sick and tired of paying for a membership for the pleasure of buying goods at a store, only to have to stand in line to exit the place so someone could check my receipt to \\&quot;ensure</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It is toothpaste OK?  LOL. I ordered it because I have braces and it is hard to find good toothpaste without whitening. I recommend this product to anybody with braces!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this product. It leaves me with a refreshed mouth and sparkling teeth. I can actually feel my teeth being cleaned. I choose this toothpaste as being the best from all the other brands that I have used.</li>
            <li> I wish I did this a decade ago. I love the 8oz tube. Grew up in a big family; seemed like there was never ample tooth paste.  These big tubes come in 6. I store them in the top shelf of the cupboard.  I LOVE not worrying about TP. No more expensive, little tubes and no more cutting them open with scissors to scrape the last bit out! Wish AMZN was around when I was a kid.</li>
            <li> This is just a very good regular toothpaste. Just what we wanted and was recommended by dentist. A good deal and I like having it on hand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for strong mint flavored toothpaste. This stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I am accustomed to use this product but the price for a six-pack blew me away.</li>
            <li> This is your everyday grocery store toothpaste with the added convenience of not having to get out of your house. It has a good price and the packaging and product quality is great. A fantastic option for the college student who doesn&#x27;t have the time to make frequent trips to the store. A must buy.</li>
            <li> Sooooo, I ordered this as an 8-pack.... Unless there&#x27;s 2 resting in my mailbox, driveway, under my pillows ..... Only 6 came wrapped together. Disappointed...</li>
            <li> Umm yeah - I did buy toothpaste on Amazon.com.  Got sick and tired of paying for a membership for the pleasure of buying goods at a store, only to have to stand in line to exit the place so someone could check my receipt to \\&quot;ensure I received what I bought\\&quot;, and I only typically bought a few items in bulk so I wouldn&#x27;t have to go so much.  So, one Saturday I walked into a local Wal-Mart, looked around and asked myself, \\&quot;Why am I putting myself through this nonsense\\&quot;.  So, I turned around, went home, fired up my computer and voila - order razors, toothbrushes and toothpaste for several months.  No big stores with 35 checkout lanes and 2 clerks working, no waiting behind 6 dozen angry customers, no road rage, no gas, no hassle.  I told my 70+ year old neighbor what I bought and they thought it was fantastic.  I&#x27;m never paying for a membership to shop or standing in line again!</li>
            <li> toothpaste, works fine.</li>
            <li> I got tired of not being able to find just normal toothpaste. Everything I found at stores had whitening (which hurt my teeth), some kind of chemicals that made the skin inside of my mouth peel, and tasted like they contained perfume. This toothpaste is just your original, normal, white toothpaste. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my teeth or make my mouth sensitive.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Just like I&#x27;ve always remembered it ;)</li>
            <li> Great deal, amazing price.</li>
            <li> Good value.  The caps are the small version that do not allow the tube to stand on end</li>
            <li> Pretty inexpensive, pretty tasty, pretty effective at removing gunk from your teeth and tongue and gums.  What else could you ask for in a dentifrice?</li>
            <li> Love the free Prime shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this value pack to store for trading/bartering in the event the SHTF and we have some sort of disaster.  Also, for family use for the same reason.  It lasts a long time and is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Expire date is too short to use all up. There is no information about the expire date.  If the date would be specific on the site, I would not buy 6 packs of it. Please, Be specific the expire date for the next time.</li>
            <li> great buy super fast shipping a+++</li>
            <li> 1 of the tubes was smashed and they were going to send me another tube. After I posted my comments I recieved many phone calls from someone (1 was after I went to bed) and some were at dinnertime! It turns out all they wanted was for me to remove my feedback and they gave me a $2 refund for the smashed tube I really wanted the toothpaste which is what they said they were going to do when I called them, but it was asking too much I guess! The bottom line is I recieved a lot of phone calls (at inappropriate times) and I could hardly understand what the gentleman was saying as his english was not too good.</li>
            <li> After using this toothpaste consistently for 5 months (morning and at night before bed), I visited my dentist for my general cleaning and according to my dentist, there was nothing to clean! I had no tartar whatsoever on my teeth. This was never the case when I used other competing brands!! Colgate, you definitely have a customer for life with this product! And for the price, even better. I used to purchase toothpaste every 6 weeks for about $4!!! A pack of 6 for $10 is a steal. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> If you have the funds and the space, always buy things you&#x27;ll always need in bulk... like toothpaste!  Colgate has been my toothy friend since I was a kid.  The flavor is mild and refreshing and my teeth feel squeaky clean afterward.  Note the tube size is larger than average and you&#x27;ll get six tubes.  It&#x27;s a great deal for name-brand paste.</li>
            <li> Love it, been using them for years, great deal for pack of 6.</li>
            <li> Non-abrasive toothpaste without a premium price.</li>
            <li> Use it regularly for years.</li>
            <li> It just what you&#x27;d expect and that&#x27;s good.  My dentist tells me that he believes it&#x27;s better to skip all the latest toothpastes with additives such as brighteners, mouthwash, gum health, etc. etc.  He is especially against those that have extra abrasive quality because he says that they&#x27;ll actually tend to wear your enamel down over time.  So in this case the lower cost product turns out to be better than the higher cost alternatives.</li>
            <li> This is awesome, 6 toothpastes for $10? They are very big and I think that it is a great deal.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is always a great buy. It&#x27;s is bulk but we use a lot of toothpaste and the price just can not be beat at the store. It lasts a long time and the flavor is not over coming while you brush. It&#x27;s getting more difficult to find the Regular flavor toothpaste lately.</li>
            <li> My son has braces and can&#x27;t use any whitening toothpaste. It is really hard to find products without whitener in them so I was glad to find this.  The price is reasonable and I get it quickly with Prime shipping. However, I don&#x27;t love the toothpaste. It just doesn&#x27;t leave that lasting freshness that I get from other products.</li>
            <li> Great product, hoping that will do the job</li>
            <li> Colgate has been the preferred toothpaste for years.</li>
            <li> You cannot beat six tubes of ADA-approved toothpaste for under 10 bucks!</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the most frugal purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less than $2 a tube, and these are big tubes.  One tube has lasted us (2 people) for 3 months.  So extrapolating from that, this 6-pack of toothpaste will last us 18 months!  It&#x27;s half the price of what Colgate costs when it&#x27;s on sale in my area.  This is a no-brainer if you want to save a little money while stocking your household.</li>
            <li> What can you say about Colgate tooth paste? Its one of the oldest tooth pastes on the market, and time has proven it to be one of the best. Tooth paste shopping is like car shopping these days, there are so many models and versions of each model, that it gets completely confusing. I like to stick by the old, reliable, time tested products that you know are going to work, and that&#x27;s just what you get with this Colgate tooth paste. Not to mention that I got 6 of the largest tubes for the price of about  one and a half tubes when buying them one at a time. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s toothpaste.....not much to say after that! LOL. Has a nice taste... not to strong like some gel toothpastes. It does seem to work and is a good price but it is not a miracle worker. You definitely still need mouthwash just like any other toothpaste. Bonus... good for polishing silver.</li>
            <li> Good price and fast delivery but... why do toothpaste companies waste packaging by injecting huge air bubbles into their tubes of product? Colgate original is my favorite toothpaste because it does not contain hydrated silica as a &#x27;whitener&#x27;. Hydrated silica is a fancy term for sand. My dentist has told me to avoid that stuff because, &amp;#34;... you may as well brush with sandpaper&amp;#34;. His words. It&#x27;s very difficult to find toothpaste without silica any more. This Colgate product is the real deal. I&#x27;d happily give it five stars if the tube was actually full of toothpaste. Instead, it&#x27;s about 25%-30% air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Holy smokes! I came back to order more of this and the price has nearly doubled! Ok, then... off to find another source...</li>
            <li> Great pricing, product as described.</li>
