            <li>this product is perfect for styling short hair.</li>

            <li>so I could get more</li>
            <li>I love this product, my husband and I both use it.</li>
            <li>s well as it is organic and safe use</li>
            <li>It works much better than the waxy products sold in jars.</li>
            <li>Great product, takes very little so it is easy to overdo, but works great.  </li>
            <li>I have tried other texturizers and Neuma is the best.  </li>
            <li>Makes my curly frizzy hair smooth.</li>

            <li>However I would say it is slightly sticky, holds great.</li>

            <li>With long hair, it probably wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough.</li>
            <li>I love that it is organic and really takes very little to make a big difference.  </li>
            <li>This works really well for holding short hair in place.</li>
            <li>I love that they try to be earth friendly and not put bad chemicals</li>
            <li>The market is flooded with products that perform extremely well...why not support those companies that conduct themselves responsibly.</li>
            <li>Have fine, thin hair?  </li>

            <li> Have fine, thin hair?  </li>
            <li> You can re-form it by just getting your hands wet and running them through your hair.</li>
            <li> I prefer the mousse on the roots on wet hair and a gel in between shampoo.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way, too!!</li>
            <li> Does not weight down hair or make it sticky .</li>
            <li> Avoid this product - weighs hair down.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stick to combs or brushes, and provides a slight detangling effect.</li>
            <li> A little sticky</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look greasy or waxy; it just adds a little shine.</li>
            <li> and this seemed to help with texture and maybe a little volume too, except when I over applied then</li>
            <li> It does give texture but feels a little sticky for me.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would hold my short hair but not dry it out or make it feel dirty.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for A few yearsr.  </li>
            <li> it was too heavy.</li>
            <li> The stickiness won&#x27;t go away until you wash your hair again, so if you wash everyday, it will work for you.</li>
            <li> No greasy look left behind.  </li>
            <li> All others pale in comparison.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used this product for A few yearsr.  Just glad I found it on your site for a more affordable price.  I will continue to purchase it thru you from now on......product is terrific.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My stylist uses it all the tme. I am glad Amazon carries it. I am sure I will order it again</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, isn&#x27;t too greasy or light. I love how it makes my curls more defined...a little goes a long way, too!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would hold my short hair but not dry it out or make it feel dirty. This product allows me to style my hair and not feel dirty. It is paste type product and I apply it by putting a dab in each hand and then styling my hair with it. I like it a lot and will buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> A little sticky but it does what it is intended to do.</li>
            <li> This works really well for holding short hair in place. It dispenses a really convenient amount of goo. It smells great, but not too strongly. Best of all, it&#x27;s vegan and all of the ingredients are listed in terms of what plant they&#x27;re derived from. It doesn&#x27;t look greasy or waxy; it just adds a little shine. It works best about 10 or 20 minutes after a shower. You can re-form it by just getting your hands wet and running them through your hair. It doesn&#x27;t stick to combs or brushes, and provides a slight detangling effect. If you don&#x27;t store it upright, a tiny amount of goo will flow out into the cap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle, and would definitely recommend this to anyone with short hair. With long hair, it probably wouldn&#x27;t be strong enough.</li>
            <li> Great product, takes very little so it is easy to overdo, but works great.  I have very thin hair and this seemed to help with texture and maybe a little volume too, except when I over applied then it was too heavy.</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described. Was shipped timely and shopping package protected the product.  I will order again this product is perfect for styling short hair. Does not weight down hair or make it sticky . I will reorder!</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes my curly frizzy hair smooth.</li>
            <li> Good for the Hair&lt;br /&gt;Gives volume without stiffness. Helps style even short hair</li>
            <li> Only stuff i&#x27;ll use in my hair. works great and is a lot cheaper then getting it at the salon</li>
            <li> It does give texture but feels a little sticky for me. The stickiness won&#x27;t go away until you wash your hair again, so if you wash everyday, it will work for you. I prefer the mousse on the roots on wet hair and a gel in between shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love the Neuma line.  Works great and holds up well.  No greasy look left behind.  Would recommend to all my friends</li>
            <li> I am absolutely crazy about Neuma Style Texturizer.  No matter how I may look when I get up, I can place a bit in my hands, rub them together and pinch or twist.  I love that it is organic and really takes very little to make a big difference.  I can create a myriad of looks with this texturizer.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed many other texturizers,  but when my hair stylist used a sample of Neuma in my hair, I had to take the packet with me so I could get more and I haven&#x27;t looked back.  All others pale in comparison.</li>
            <li> I love this product, my husband and I both use it. However I would say it is slightly sticky, holds great.</li>
            <li> Ideal sheen and hold strike of balance.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for another product that was discontinued.  I tried this and it works well for me.</li>
            <li> LOVE,LOVE,LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Best hair product I&#x27;ve used. Been using now for 3 years. Doesn&#x27;t make your hair all hard but still maintains a great hold throughout the day!</li>
            <li> Great on course hair and a little goes a long way s well as it is organic and safe use</li>

            <li> Did not like this very much</li>
            <li> This Neuma product is great!</li>
            <li> great product.  You don&#x27;t need much and mix it w/ the Argaen oil.</li>
            <li> I use the smallest dab of this after drying and styling to set my hair. It works much better than the waxy products sold in jars.</li>
            <li> Have fine, thin hair?  Avoid this product - weighs hair down.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had this before and it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Mother-in-law says its the best</li>
