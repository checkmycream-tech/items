            <li>I know that Rebuild works great</li>
            <li>but I am still just as happy with the Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard really good things about seche, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot.  </li>

            <li>very favorite would be pear finish</li>
            <li>I love all things Seche!  </li>
            <li>It looks nice with 2 coats by itself.</li>
            <li>Nice thing is if I bump one and chip it</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over a year now and can say that I have given it a fair shot with a variety of nail polishes( mostly Essie).</li>
            <li>My polish peels and chips very easily after one or two days if I use this.</li>
            <li>This one goes on smoothly, has a bit of a shimmer which is good if you don&#x27;t want to apply polish.</li>
            <li>It goes on perfectly and make my nails look salon professional.</li>
            <li>I bought this reading good reviews, and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, it looks great and it does fill in any ridges, but with in a day or two it starts to peel off.</li>
            <li>This is just OK.  </li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t tried the top coat</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>but I do love the Essie.</li>
            <li>Makes lighter colors or sheers a bit more opaque.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Seche top coat</li>
            <li>My polish stays on better than that</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OKAY.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel it fills as well as some say, and I do not think it adheres any better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li>Love ALL the seche nail products.</li>
            <li>Works well -- love this product.</li>
            <li>And even when I try to buff my nails, I could do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>so the polish will adhere better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had to use as many coat, for some colors because of that.</li>
            <li>This bottom coat is okay.</li>
            <li>Love my seche vite products but not this one.</li>
            <li>Makes the nails look nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>This my favorite basecoat.</li>
            <li>It makes any polish layered on top streak and also get tacky.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m stuck with two full bottles!</li>
            <li>It also dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>It also dries very quickly and fills in my ridges.</li>
            <li>This filler works best under dark nail polish.</li>
            <li>this is exactly what i was hoping it would be - it smoothes out the ridges and other imperfections in my nail so that the polish looks perfect on top.</li>
            <li>It don&#x27;t polish on as smooth as i thought it would</li>
            <li>if I use no base at all.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for salon smooth nails, it starts with this.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s because it was always done incorrectly or cheaply.</li>
            <li>I have deep ridges in my nails and this does a great job to fill them in.</li>
            <li>I had originally been using Sally Hansen brand</li>
            <li>Totally worth every penny to this very tomboyish girl who&#x27;s trying to find a nice balance somewhere.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>About every three days I add another coat and my manicure can last a good two weeks before I remove it.  </li>
            <li>One coat or the ridge filler, two coats of polish, the Seche fast drying top coat</li>
            <li>It could be worn on your nails without nail polish for a nice natural look also.</li>
            <li>Looks great under dark colors.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hide all the spots but it certainly helps protect and smooth out my nails.</li>
            <li>works really well, leaves a light shimmer on nail</li>
            <li>It does not show even or smooth  under clear or light coats of polish.</li>
            <li>Good base coat, excellent service!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very sheer which makes it ok for light colored polish</li>
            <li>I am a dingbat; I was painting my nails without this and then wondering why they didn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>It is very good for weak and splitting nails.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s more than I can say for similar products.</li>
            <li>For more than ten years I have been trying every polish and &amp;#34;fix it&amp;#34; that came on the market and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li>With Seche ridge filler my nails look young again and so smooth.  </li>
            <li>After a year of trying so many different brands, I will stick with this one.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what I was looking for, it fills the ridges in my nails so the polish will stay on.</li>
            <li>I do not give it one star only, because in all honesty I do not know the severity of the ridges they claim to be able to cover, in my case there are many and deep, so perhaps I am beyond help.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Theory\\&quot; the deep Grand Canyon sized ravines on my nails drives me nuts.</li>
            <li>I switched to Seche brand and combined with the Seche Vite top coat (which I had been using with Sally Hansen) and the polish lasted twice as long!</li>
            <li>I also use the seche fast dry top coat, offers a super shin just like gel.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t fill as much as I had hoped so it took three coats, however it didn&#x27;t chip off yet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s irridescent and reflects light which adds to the ridgefilling effect and gives a visual effect of fewer divots in the nail.  </li>
            <li>but I really like this brand.  </li>
            <li>Will absolutely be reordering.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but it really wasn&#x27;t keeping my polish from chipping after a day or 2.</li>
            <li>I also notice how much easier it is to take off glitter polish with this product.</li>
            <li>fast shipping product as described</li>
            <li>It goes on much easier.</li>
            <li>so it makes your color really stand out.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Dries fast, and is very dependable.</li>
            <li>One star is too much.</li>
            <li>Long lasting with a beautiful sheen, it elevates polishes to the next level.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know if one is better than the other because I just got Retain and haven&#x27;t used it as much as Rebuild.</li>
            <li>it kept my nails long and strong for months at a time with none of them breaking.</li>
            <li>I bought this base coat instead of my regular one based on how much the top coat Seche Vite had impressed me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read several reviews that this dries quickly, but that hasn&#x27;t been my experience.  </li>
            <li>i would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, but it does have a tint to it (pale pink-ish) which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li>It seems like other products like this clump and don&#x27;t go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I use it for my pedicure base, works awesome my pedi&#x27;s never chip or peel off they last almost a full month.</li>
            <li>I think I found my new ridge filler.</li>
            <li>Fills the ridges, gives an opaque base to light colored polish and looks great alone as neutral color polish.  </li>
            <li>It fills little ridges and provides a nice, smooth base for polish, providing a much more professional look for at home manicures/pedicures.</li>
            <li>I thought that this was going to be clear, when you put it on it</li>
            <li>you wear your nails clear or matte</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 14 year old daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li>I do my natural nails myself about every week and</li>
            <li>This is the best base coat ever.</li>
            <li>Best ever base coat.  </li>
            <li>Extends the life of a manicure and provides an excellent base for color</li>
            <li>Not the best base coat</li>
            <li>Excellent price, however, it didn&#x27;t hold well as a base coat.</li>
            <li>It really dries quickly and fills in nail for a nice base nail canvas.</li>
            <li>When I tried it again last night, I let it dry for a full ten minutes, still streaked when I applied polish, and today my thumb nail is peeling.  </li>
            <li>but this ridge filler is nowhere near that standard.</li>
            <li>I have some deep ridges on my fingernails and it makes me feel like I&#x27;m as old as my grandmother.</li>
            <li>I bought this base coat (along with the top coat) to see if my manicures would look better and last longer.</li>
            <li>I have tried other ridge fillers and they are all pretty similar</li>
            <li>Generally love this fantastic base coat.  </li>
            <li>I love the Ridge Filling Base Coat because as I am getting more mature (hee, hee) I notice I do have some ridges on a few nails.</li>
            <li>this goes on like shiny white nail polish which is fine if you&#x27;re painting your nails with a light color like a white or pale pink but under a dark blue or purple its a little odd because sometimes you get these white corners which i don&#x27;t like</li>

            <li> When I tried it again last night, I let it dry for a full ten minutes, still streaked when I applied polish, and today my thumb nail is peeling.  </li>
            <li> but this ridge filler is nowhere near that standard.</li>
            <li> I have some deep ridges on my fingernails and it makes me feel like I&#x27;m as old as my grandmother.</li>
            <li> I bought this base coat (along with the top coat) to see if my manicures would look better and last longer.</li>
            <li> I have tried other ridge fillers and they are all pretty similar</li>
            <li> Generally love this fantastic base coat.  </li>
            <li> I love the Ridge Filling Base Coat because as I am getting more mature (hee, hee) I notice I do have some ridges on a few nails.</li>
            <li> this goes on like shiny white nail polish which is fine if you&#x27;re painting your nails with a light color like a white or pale pink but under a dark blue or purple its a little odd because sometimes you get these white corners which i don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> Long lasting, too</li>
            <li> I just ordered my second bottle, the first one lasted a little less than a year.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, one thin coat was still tacky several minutes later, and it streaked when I applied polish.  </li>
            <li> Lower rating due to only lasting for 2-3 days before chipping.  </li>
            <li> It does do a good job of filling in ridges but Seche should not be advertising this as a base coat.</li>
            <li> I could not even get polish to dry no matter which product, and I tried them all.  </li>
            <li> and your nails will be dry in 5 minutes</li>
            <li> It takes forever to dry.</li>
            <li> but it shows through when applying dark colors so you have to add an extra coat of polish just to hide this.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different ridge filling base coats and I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> It seems to fill ridges in a little, but maybe my ridges are just too deep.  </li>
            <li> Just read carefully</li>
            <li> arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> I like to change my polish often, but not every other day...</li>
            <li> While it may be debatable to some, I believe this Seche base coat is simply the best nail base coat I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I like this better than the Opi ridge filling base.</li>
            <li> Love this base coat.</li>
            <li> A few other Seche Vite products you should try are Rebuild, Retain, and Restore.</li>
            <li> Has a slightly opaque finish and is thicker than others, so does fill in.  </li>
            <li> Overall my polish goes on well and stays for at least 1 week if not more.</li>
            <li> but I use the seche thinner, and than I can finish off the bottle without any waste at all.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times.</li>
            <li> Instead, my polish begins to peel after a few days.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all for five bucks!&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff for filling the smaller ridges and smoothing edges.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent base coat!</li>
            <li> It does get thick half way through the bottles</li>
            <li> I usually wear it without another polish</li>
            <li> no more yellowing when i paint my nails.</li>
            <li> Seche Clear works as a better ridge filling base coat than this crap.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this base coat, I have used it multiple times with multiple polishes.</li>
            <li> I got this product based on the claim that it helps with ridged nails, I need badly such a product as base for my nail polish that otherwise looks terrible due to the ridges, no matter how many coats I do.</li>
            <li> Two coats give a hard protective finish.  </li>
            <li> I am just partial to my gel polish, but when I used regular polish I put this as my base coat.</li>
            <li> This sucks.</li>
            <li> Really like this base coat.</li>
            <li> It makes my polish peel within 2 days while I usually go all week with my regular base coat.</li>
            <li> This is the only base I&#x27;ll use for polish.</li>
            <li> this limits you to 1 thin coat of base.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I use mine almost every time I paint my nails to keep my polish from getting thick and gooey because thick polish doesn&#x27;t stay on and looks bad.</li>
            <li> I am not very demanding when it comes to a base coat.</li>
            <li> It performs worse than drug store base coats.</li>
            <li> Wrong move!</li>
            <li> if very faint ridges then yes, it might help you.</li>
            <li> Seche Base coat performs as promised.  </li>
            <li> I needed a ridge filling base coat for my nails.</li>
            <li> I used this base coat and my nails are still stained when I take the color off.  </li>
            <li> It says you can use Rebuild and Retain as a base coat</li>
            <li> but I like to use both Rebuild or Retain with this ridge filling base coat.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fill as much as I had hoped so it took three coats, however it didn&#x27;t chip off yet and it&#x27;s been a week. That&#x27;s more than I can say for similar products.</li>
            <li> This is the only base I&#x27;ll use for polish. It fills little ridges and provides a nice, smooth base for polish, providing a much more professional look for at home manicures/pedicures.</li>
            <li> While it may be debatable to some, I believe this Seche base coat is simply the best nail base coat I&#x27;ve ever used. Long lasting with a beautiful sheen, it elevates polishes to the next level.</li>
            <li> It don&#x27;t polish on as smooth as i thought it would and it appears to be white in color</li>
            <li> I bought this reading good reviews, and was not disappointed. I am not very demanding when it comes to a base coat. This one goes on smoothly, has a bit of a shimmer which is good if you don&#x27;t want to apply polish. Overall my polish goes on well and stays for at least 1 week if not more.</li>
            <li> I love the Ridge Filling Base Coat because as I am getting more mature (hee, hee) I notice I do have some ridges on a few nails.</li>
            <li> Seche Base coat performs as promised.  It fills ridges and serves as a great canvas for nail lacquer. It&#x27;s irridescent and reflects light which adds to the ridgefilling effect and gives a visual effect of fewer divots in the nail.  This is a solid product.</li>
            <li> This is just OK.  It seems to fill ridges in a little, but maybe my ridges are just too deep.  It does help some though.</li>
            <li> I have tried other ridge fillers and they are all pretty similar but I really like this brand.  If you haven&#x27;t tried the top coat I suggest you purchase it along with this ridge filler.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see where it stays on anybetter than  my double duty did was about the same im  having trouble with the whole designs peeling off was gioung wiy&#x3D;&#x3D;uld stay n</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t remove all of the ridges, but helps polish adhere to nail.</li>
            <li> This filler works best under dark nail polish. It does not show even or smooth  under clear or light coats of polish.</li>
            <li> This does a wonderful job of smoothing out the nail surface.  No ridges are visible and after 2 coats, you could leave the house if necessary without the color polish applied.  It looks nice with 2 coats by itself.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing!! I bought this base coat (along with the top coat) to see if my manicures would look better and last longer. This is the best base coat ever. It goes on perfectly and make my nails look salon professional. Will absolutely be reordering.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  For more than ten years I have been trying every polish and &amp;#34;fix it&amp;#34; that came on the market and nothing worked.  I could not even get polish to dry no matter which product, and I tried them all.  With Seche ridge filler my nails look young again and so smooth.  About every three days I add another coat and my manicure can last a good two weeks before I remove it.  Even then it is not chipped.  Nice thing is if I bump one and chip it I can just paint over it and it is invisible.  I usually wear it without another polish but I do love the Essie.</li>
            <li> Fills the ridges, gives an opaque base to light colored polish and looks great alone as neutral color polish.  Long lasting, too</li>
            <li> this is exactly what i was hoping it would be - it smoothes out the ridges and other imperfections in my nail so that the polish looks perfect on top. plus it protects my nails from discoloration. i highly recommend!</li>
            <li> works really well, leaves a light shimmer on nail</li>
            <li> Best ever base coat.  I love all things Seche!  This is a great base coat that indeed fills the ridges but also keeps my nails from being stained by polish.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, always as my nail polish because I like the way it looks.&lt;br /&gt;My very favorite would be pear finish but I can not find it anywhere.</li>
            <li> Extends the life of a manicure and provides an excellent base for color</li>
            <li> Been using this for about 14 years now and paying $10.00 a bottle.  GREAT Price.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of this base coat, I have used it multiple times with multiple polishes. When I first put it on, it looks great and it does fill in any ridges, but with in a day or two it starts to peel off. I can peel off the nail polish in one piece. I like to change my polish often, but not every other day...</li>
            <li> Has a slightly opaque finish and is thicker than others, so does fill in.  Looks great under dark colors. Makes lighter colors or sheers a bit more opaque.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a month and does help keep my nails from splitting.  Two coats give a hard protective finish.  Lower rating due to only lasting for 2-3 days before chipping.  After a year of trying so many different brands, I will stick with this one.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year now and can say that I have given it a fair shot with a variety of nail polishes( mostly Essie). It does do a good job of filling in ridges but Seche should not be advertising this as a base coat. My polish peels and chips very easily after one or two days if I use this. It also has toluene in it which is toxic. I absolutely love Seche top coat but this ridge filler is nowhere near that standard.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all for five bucks!&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff for filling the smaller ridges and smoothing edges.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent base coat!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard really good things about seche, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a shot.  I&#x27;m not overly impressed.  I&#x27;ve read several reviews that this dries quickly, but that hasn&#x27;t been my experience.  The first time I used it, one thin coat was still tacky several minutes later, and it streaked when I applied polish.  Two days later, it peeled.  When I tried it again last night, I let it dry for a full ten minutes, still streaked when I applied polish, and today my thumb nail is peeling.  My polish stays on better than that if I use no base at all.  Unsure if I&#x27;ll bother using it again.  I&#x27;ll probably be sticking with Julep from now on.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what I was looking for, it fills the ridges in my nails so the polish will stay on. Good price also!</li>
            <li> Good base coat, excellent service!</li>
            <li> I got this product based on the claim that it helps with ridged nails, I need badly such a product as base for my nail polish that otherwise looks terrible due to the ridges, no matter how many coats I do. This product has NOT helped me, made no substantial difference. I do not give it one star only, because in all honesty I do not know the severity of the ridges they claim to be able to cover, in my case there are many and deep, so perhaps I am beyond help.&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation... if deep ridges it won&#x27;t work, if very faint ridges then yes, it might help you.</li>
            <li> I thought that this was going to be clear, when you put it on it appears to white.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for salon smooth nails, it starts with this. One coat or the ridge filler, two coats of polish, the Seche fast drying top coat and your nails will be dry in 5 minutes and they nails won&#x27;t chip for a week.</li>
            <li> It is very good for weak and splitting nails.  i would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> it does not do well for ridge filling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OKAY.  I don&#x27;t feel it fills as well as some say, and I do not think it adheres any better than others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Just a product sitting on my nails doing nothing. Not the best base coat but im gonna use it anyways.</li>
            <li> Color polish placed over did not seem to stay on. Polish just peeled off within 24-hours.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! I use it for my pedicure base, works awesome my pedi&#x27;s never chip or peel off they last almost a full month. I also use the seche fast dry top coat, offers a super shin just like gel. It does get thick half way through the bottles but I use the seche thinner, and than I can finish off the bottle without any waste at all. Love ALL the seche nail products.</li>
            <li> I have used it a few times. It seems to work well. I am just partial to my gel polish, but when I used regular polish I put this as my base coat.</li>
            <li> I needed a ridge filling base coat for my nails. I had originally been using Sally Hansen brand but it really wasn&#x27;t keeping my polish from chipping after a day or 2. I switched to Seche brand and combined with the Seche Vite top coat (which I had been using with Sally Hansen) and the polish lasted twice as long! I think I found my new ridge filler.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 14 year old daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Works well -- love this product.</li>
            <li> On 2 occasions differnet sellers sent faulty product.  Contacted manufacturer about mislabelling.  Generally love this fantastic base coat.  Not here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of manicures but I think it&#x27;s because it was always done incorrectly or cheaply. I have some deep ridges on my fingernails and it makes me feel like I&#x27;m as old as my grandmother. If I don&#x27;t buff my nails while watching a 30 minute set of \\&quot;Big Bang Theory\\&quot; the deep Grand Canyon sized ravines on my nails drives me nuts. And even when I try to buff my nails, I could do a better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where this Godsend of a product comes in. It doesn&#x27;t hide all the spots but it certainly helps protect and smooth out my nails. I also notice how much easier it is to take off glitter polish with this product. Totally worth every penny to this very tomboyish girl who&#x27;s trying to find a nice balance somewhere.</li>
            <li> I bought this base coat instead of my regular one based on how much the top coat Seche Vite had impressed me. Wrong move! It performs worse than drug store base coats. It makes my polish peel within 2 days while I usually go all week with my regular base coat. It&#x27;s also very sheer which makes it ok for light colored polish but it shows through when applying dark colors so you have to add an extra coat of polish just to hide this. Now I&#x27;m stuck with two full bottles!</li>
            <li> I love the product.  But I didn&#x27;t read it close enough....I thought I was ordering one bottle and ended up with three - for 3 times the price, of course.  Just read carefully</li>
            <li> this goes on like shiny white nail polish which is fine if you&#x27;re painting your nails with a light color like a white or pale pink but under a dark blue or purple its a little odd because sometimes you get these white corners which i don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> fast shipping product as described</li>
            <li> I used this base coat and my nails are still stained when I take the color off.  I also do not see that my polish is lasting any longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brand and product for about a year now and it works great. I just ordered my second bottle, the first one lasted a little less than a year. I do my natural nails myself about every week and the #1 tip I have to keep nail polish on longer is to wipe your nails with white vinegar and water or rubbing alcohol before putting on any polish. It&#x27;s gets rid of the oil on your nail so the polish will adhere better. A few other Seche Vite products you should try are Rebuild, Retain, and Restore. Restore is a polish thinner which works wonders for your nail polish no matter what brand it is. I use mine almost every time I paint my nails to keep my polish from getting thick and gooey because thick polish doesn&#x27;t stay on and looks bad. I also use Rebuild and Retain but I don&#x27;t know if one is better than the other because I just got Retain and haven&#x27;t used it as much as Rebuild. I know that Rebuild works great it kept my nails long and strong for months at a time with none of them breaking. It says you can use Rebuild and Retain as a base coat but I like to use both Rebuild or Retain with this ridge filling base coat.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different ridge filling base coats and I always come back to this one. It goes on much easier. It seems like other products like this clump and don&#x27;t go on smoothly. The items were packaged well and received in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> It smooths your nail and has some grip, not holy grail quality though. Good to protect your nails from staining and adds some color coverage. I&#x27;ve not had to use as many coat, for some colors because of that. My manicure doesn&#x27;t seem to last any longer though.</li>
            <li> This bottom coat is okay. It is colors, like a shimmery white, so it does cover some imperfections. It seems that it does not increase the life of my manicure though. Instead, my polish begins to peel after a few days.</li>
            <li> I have deep ridges in my nails and this does a great job to fill them in. It also dries very quickly. It has a milky color so it makes your color really stand out. If you don&#x27;t want to spend the money on Seche, I am just as happy with Sally Hansen Salon Manicure base coat. It also dries very quickly and fills in my ridges. It does not have the milky color but I am still just as happy with the Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best ever but it gets the job done. I like this better than the Opi ridge filling base. Plus it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Excellent price, however, it didn&#x27;t hold well as a base coat. Had the polish chipping the next day. Love my seche vite products but not this one.</li>
            <li> I am a dingbat; I was painting my nails without this and then wondering why they didn&#x27;t look right. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this base coat. It really dries quickly and fills in nail for a nice base nail canvas. arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> Really like this base coat. Makes the nails look nice and smooth. It could be worn on your nails without nail polish for a nice natural look also.</li>
            <li> i have used this once or twice and i can already see the diffrence in my nail growth and no more yellowing when i paint my nails.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  I have bought Seche products before and they work.</li>
            <li> This my favorite basecoat. Dries fast, and is very dependable.</li>
            <li> This product fills ok, but has a white color that is difficult to mix uniformly.&lt;br /&gt;If you wear your nails clear or matte this limits you to 1 thin coat of base.&lt;br /&gt;If you use color and will shake shake shake give this a try.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, but it does have a tint to it (pale pink-ish) which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.</li>
            <li> One star is too much. This sucks. Seche Clear works as a better ridge filling base coat than this crap. It takes forever to dry. It&#x27;s tacky. It makes any polish layered on top streak and also get tacky. It doesn&#x27;t fill ridges.. it &#x27;minimizes the appearance&#x27; of ridges by being shimmery. Seche Vite even gets tacky and doesn&#x27;t fully harden over this.</li>
