            <li>I find that I am really taking better care of my hair now more so than before.  </li>
            <li>I saw thickness first, it really got nice and full....then came the length!  </li>
            <li>and I immediately began to feel embarrassed because everyone had long beautiful hair</li>

            <li>I am very excited to see how much my hair will grow. :)</li>
            <li>All in all, right now it&#x27;s just  an ok product.  </li>
            <li>what matters most right?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m purchasing more right now..</li>
            <li>Okay, so I can&#x27;t attest to hair growth right now, as I&#x27;m protective styling while taking my vitamins.</li>
            <li>it was so much thicker,  so strong,  and for someone who has grown up with eczema in the scalp ,I&#x27;ve never seen my hair so healthy and strong before.  </li>
            <li>Overall great vitamins and definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>The vitamins are easy to swallow and have no bad side effects for me.  </li>
            <li>They really do!!!.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend these pills for a healthy hair transformation!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen soo much growth!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks MANETABOLISM!!!</li>
            <li>The packaging is secure and the vitamins have a unique smell, but not funky at all.</li>
            <li>I was a skeptic at first because I couldn&#x27;t understand how so many people were seeing such great results.</li>
            <li>I felt more energetic after taking these and knowing that its not just for my &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and my hair had grown tremendously and is so much healthier the best state is ever been even with gold hair care for two years and</li>
            <li>I started out using hairfinity and thought they were good until I was getting major migranes, acne and my hair was falling out in the handfuls.</li>
            <li>Delivery time was very fast and she often does free shipping promos!</li>
            <li>not only will it make your hair grow, but it makes your skin, and nails look AMAZING!</li>
            <li>The pills are big, but work amazingly!</li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t seen significant growth in my nails</li>
            <li>I love these vitamins I notice a change already  in my hair already and this is my first bottle</li>
            <li>I love this product and will definitely purchase more!</li>
            <li>I am so excited to try Manetabolism.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking these vitamins since August and have noticed a significant amount of growth and  thickness in my hair.</li>
            <li>I originally tried this product b/c</li>
            <li>I see a significant difference in the volume of my hair, not just the length.</li>
            <li>I would just like to thank the maker for this smile that I have on my face and an air of confidence that I have never had before!</li>
            <li>The original reason I started taking these hair vitamins was because the nape of my hair seems to never grow.</li>
            <li>My hair has grown significantly as well as strengthened.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so excited.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these vitamins for almost three months and have seen a significant difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>The Manetabolism has become my &amp;#34;Mane&#x27;s Choice.&amp;#34; My hair has seen a significant change in growth as well as strength.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product, after originally using hairfinity for 4 month.</li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle in June and am very happy I did because since June my patch has grown back a whole five inches!</li>
            <li>I  saw rapid growth on the first bottle , so I ordered 3 more ,  </li>
            <li>oh boy, was I excited to visit the website.</li>
            <li>I originally thought I could give the pills to my daughter&#x27;s, asked the question on insyagram and got an immediate reply.</li>
            <li>For so many women our hair is included in our confidence so for women to feel like they can have that piece back that they thought was gone forever is such an amazing feeling!!!</li>
            <li>I have already gained an inch of hair and that is awesome for me because my hair usually grows 1/4- 1/2 inch a month.</li>
            <li>I was so excited</li>
            <li>I love these vitamins, I have noticed a change in length of my hair after the first bottle, my nails are stronger and longer.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much!</li>
            <li>Both me and my stylist (who also takes them) started to see a significant difference in the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li>They are well worth the $25 bucks!</li>
            <li>I was so excited.</li>
            <li>Anyways excited to start my journey with the mane choice.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t experience any side effects and it was worth the cost !</li>
            <li>I have also seen significant growth in between my protective styles.</li>
            <li>my eyebrows have grown which I&#x27;m so excited about</li>
            <li>pretty sure ita from these vitamins but no one else has mentioned...</li>
            <li>Everyone is unique</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 5th bottle and have noticed a significant amount of growth.</li>
            <li>I recommend buying its worth your money!</li>
            <li>Do you know how excited that has made me?</li>
            <li>so thought what have I got to lose (a little more hair lol).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ordering the product was fast&amp; easy, so was shipping!</li>
            <li>After my first bottle I had major growth and I am happy with my results.</li>
            <li>So many vendors are starting to post reviews on their own products.  </li>
            <li>lol seriously I am blown away by such awesome results !</li>
            <li>It is so amazing to have products that actually work for your hair type and smell absolutely fabulous!</li>
            <li>They are worth the investment and they are capsules and easy to swallow</li>
            <li>I am pleased to announce that i have fallen in love with  the results that i have seen thus far.</li>
            <li>I purchased a months supply of these vitamins and was pleasantly suprised the way it not only helped my hair to grow at a quicker rate than nomal but also strengthened my nails.</li>
            <li>My experience unlike most of the reviews here was not as positive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many positive reviews and everyone keeps asking me how?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently on my second bottle of these amazing vitamins and there the best thing ever made , when i was younger i had so much hair that my mother could not control</li>
            <li>I bought a two month supply directly from the manechoice website (much more cost effective that way)  and at the end of those 2 months I had over an inch of growth and healthy soft hair.</li>
            <li>Not only can I be a spokesperson for this GREAT vitamin on this amazing line of products but REAL people show REAL results EVERY DAY.  </li>
            <li>Purchased these pills for a specific reason and have received so many additional benefits, including healthy thick(er) hair, strong nails, and reduced shedding.</li>
            <li>I love them, and it will continue to buy them until my hair reaches a certain length.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to take special care of it since I bleached a spot in my head</li>
            <li>/&gt;Manetabolism is always having a special</li>
            <li>Certainly saw thickness changes but not insane growth like I&#x27;ve seen in photos.</li>
            <li>Make the right choice with the mane choice!</li>
            <li>These vitamins are my everything right now!</li>
            <li>but I hardly ever drink water and the results are wonderful.</li>
            <li>One of the positives is that I experienced absolutely no side effects.</li>
            <li>Ok I don&#x27;t really write comments or do surveys</li>
            <li>so I could have had this type of healthy hair my whole life.</li>
            <li>, i guess its true that sometimes you need to give pills 3 months to kick in</li>
            <li>I have two full bottles waiting to be taking</li>
            <li>I drank about 60 ounces of water a day, and took them with a full meal.</li>
            <li>Make sure you do your length checks these vitamins really work.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m going to take these pills for a full year</li>
            <li>I will recommend everybody who wants to grow their hair to make the hair healthy two bUy these pills because the work WONDERS</li>
            <li>Haha :)</li>
            <li>and I absolutely fell in love.</li>
            <li>I love these hair pills so much</li>
            <li>I love this  product so much.</li>
            <li>thanks a lot manechoice :)</li>
            <li>Also I haven&#x27;t had full edges since a fungus took them out years ago.</li>
            <li>Love this soo much.</li>
            <li>Like, when&#x27;s the last time the side effects were all good things.</li>
            <li>I had about a full inch of growth.</li>
            <li>But It really does boost your immune system to promote a healthy you all around inside and out.</li>
            <li>Not only the good skin outcome but</li>
            <li>It feels much thicker and fuller than before I have more confidence wearing my hair out.</li>
            <li>BTW my hair is relaxed and it worked just as effectively on my hair as it would natural hair.</li>
            <li>Find her on Instagram and see results from real people for yourself to ease your mind:)</li>
            <li>These vitamins make you want to take better care of your hair once you see how much progress you can get from them.</li>
            <li>I now have a ahead full of hair</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been taking them a full month</li>
            <li>I would do full sew-ins to get it to grow</li>
            <li>I love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It makes all the hair over our body grow faster and thicker, not a bad thing, but its definently there.</li>
            <li>Advertised with the pill was a beautiful woman with long, pretty hair.</li>
            <li>in mind however that these pills don&#x27;t only support the promotion of healthy hair growth, but also the growth of strong, sturdy fingernails!  </li>
            <li>I purchased my first bottle in July of 2014 and experienced a tremendous amount of growth in my hair and especially my nails.</li>
            <li>My hair grew so much within the first 30 days that I had to buy another supply!!!</li>
            <li>I liked that I had evidence and bragging right about my new vitamins.  </li>
            <li>but THICK AND HEALTHY !!!</li>
            <li>Anyway, I went a whole month on hairfinity and didn&#x27;t noticd much of a difference in my hair, though my skin looked pretty good.</li>
            <li>I am happy that it has not caused any headaches or stomach problems like other products.</li>
            <li>The owner is a sweetheart and has a great heart shes always helping other</li>
            <li>I experienced breakage due to chemicals  and heat damage.</li>
            <li>I stand behind this product completly and with this available, there is no reason we can&#x27;t all have beautiful, healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Since then, I haven&#x27;t experienced any other breakouts and I have been using this product for over two months now.</li>
            <li>I won a bottle of these amazing vitamins this past April on instagram, I was overjoyed because of so many great reviews that I had already seen on social media, so now it was my time to see what they would do for</li>
            <li>Long, strong, healthy hair is achievable w the ManeChoice Manetabolism vitamins!</li>
            <li>I saw so much thickness added to my hair after the first week, new growth was abundant!</li>
            <li>Give them try and see how  they work for your hair, who knows you  may be one of the lucky ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product you can actually see and feel the results I like this product better than hairfinity</li>

            <li>To me healthy hair is worth so much you can have length</li>
            <li>, my nails grow sooo quickly.</li>
            <li>I received the reference for it through a friend and noticed results quickly (I&#x27;d say within a week).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d heard many reviews about different hair vitamins, but the one that stuck out most of Manetabolism, so I did my research and</li>

            <li>I love the pills, I started using them when I was transitioning my hair to natural.</li>
            <li>as soon as I big chopped, i realised how effective these vitamins were.</li>

            <li>Money&#x27;s worth.</li>

            <li>Ladies if you wear weaves and your tired of having NO edges you better order this product ASAP!!!!!</li>
            <li>I started taking them the day after I got a fresh sewin and let just say</li>
            <li>Thank you Mane for making me fall in love with my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more to see how far my hair can grow.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>I felt confident to wear my natural hair out</li>
            <li>These are definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>I was soooo happy to finally find a product that was not harsh on my system and delivered the benefits it</li>
            <li>but it was worth</li>
            <li>And you don&#x27;t have to be natural to use this product, Buy it :)</li>
            <li>I feel so way better wearing my natural hair out and not having to cover it up with braids and weaves.</li>
            <li>As far as hair I&#x27;ve been taking it for about 1 1/2 weeks so not too too sure yet.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m in love</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it will help at all, but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I experienced abnormal hair growth like new eyelashes growing sideways lol, my hair breaking midway from the root to the ends and where I could grab it and pull it out (extreme breakage) and some other wierd things</li>
            <li>Giving it 3 stars bc not sure about the hair growth too much but my skin looks amazing!!</li>
            <li>I have hereditary thinning of my edges and since taking Manetabolism while simultaneously using their 100% pure Castor Oil, I have seen a significant improvement in the growth of edges.</li>
            <li>I bought a 2 month supply and I experienced an inch an half of hair growth within the first month.</li>
            <li>No negative reaction at all!!!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more excited to have my pre heat damage curls and length back.  </li>
            <li>It needs great healp due to stress breakage and too much heat.</li>
            <li>I had been following Courtney on IG for several months and loved how she transformed her hair and also watch her business with her husband grow from the ground up!</li>
            <li>Purchased a 4 month supply during the Labor Day sale so its been about 3 weeks that ive been taking them and people at work are complimenting me on clearer skin, and my nails are growing out so long and strong for the first time everrr!!!</li>
            <li>As I got older, I loved to cut my hair in bobs and then keep wanting my hair to grow back</li>
            <li>After consulting the manetabolism team (who are very customer friendly and interactive might I add)</li>
            <li>Just imagine the growth I would get if I would do it right.</li>
            <li>Your hair, nails and skin will be transformed right before your eyes.</li>
            <li>The Mane Choice is the right choice</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t sit there thinking about it, but instead be like Spike Lee and &amp;#34;Do The Right Thing.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>the ManeChoice was the right option for me.</li>
            <li>Shipped right away.</li>

            <li>and I recommend it to anyone who wants to jump start a new healthy hair regimen.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the growth that I saw after using my first bottle and really look forward to using my second bottle.</li>
            <li>Unlike the other hair vitamins that I have tried, I experienced no breakouts or no negative side effects</li>
            <li>For the first time in a looooooooooooooooooooooooong time I can wrap my hair at night with a smile and not wonder what it&#x27;s going to look like in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I had heard great things and seen success pictures about the Mane Choice products, but I didn&#x27;t personally &amp;#34;know&amp;#34; anyone that was actually taking the pills.  </li>
            <li>In the past, she experienced breakouts with *</li>
            <li>Long hair is nice, but nothing when you can see your scalp through your hair st</li>
            <li>I tried my first bottle of pills not to long ago and Love the results!</li>
            <li>Manetabolism is my new best friend and I cant wait to see how long my hair will be with the help of Mane Choice next year.  </li>
            <li>I had my hair colored right before opening my first bottle and after 2 weeks my color started growing out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone is different, another friend experienced the same results as me and others I know  </li>
            <li>I suffer from Alopecia and have had a great deal of hair loss in the middle region for the last 5.5 years.</li>
            <li>And the hype isn&#x27;t even enough - - this is a real and honest as it gets...</li>
            <li>I could not believe my hair had grown that much that quickly.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast and customer service swiftly responded to a question I had.</li>
            <li>I Purchased these vitamins a few months ago and they are the next best thing LITERALLY!!</li>
            <li>I big chopped in October of last year and while I was extremely happy with my haircut and the decision I had made, by December</li>
            <li>It has made my transistion to natural so easy.</li>
            <li>I only took a month supply but  that on the supply green my hair out and made it.thicker which is great for someone with then hair like mine!!</li>
            <li>and I can definitely tell you these are really worth trying wherever you are in the world :)</li>
            <li>all of those nights crying over the want for my original length was over!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is growing out very long full and healthy....</li>
            <li>It really does make your hair grow super fast!</li>
            <li>Also Courtney&#x27;s hair is AMAZING and very long through her use of the pills!</li>
            <li>I saw other natural hair people getting great results.</li>
            <li>so I am really excited when I take them out to see how much new growth I have.</li>
            <li>ok, SOOO I&#x27;m usually not the person to try new products for the body</li>
            <li>I am starting to drink more water to see if that will flush the product out of my system and alleviate the problem.  </li>
            <li>Again as with hairfinity, I did not see a difference in my hair the first month of taking the product.  </li>
            <li>The first month of trying out this product, there was not results, and</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d worn weave consistently for almost 9 years.</li>
            <li>love it starting to see some results</li>
            <li>Also my hair didn&#x27;t grow like it did the first I took the pills.</li>
            <li>I noticed that my hair didn&#x27;t shed as much and that its thicker than ever!</li>
            <li>Notice how most of the 5 star reviews are all from the same day?</li>
            <li>But, my nails grew stronger (not necessarily longer, but i was able to retain length) with these and my hair did gain some texture.</li>
            <li>My first month on the pills I had just started college</li>
            <li>My second month I cleaned up my diet and drank more water and non - sugary drinks</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even finished with my first bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;naturalista&amp;#34;, but earlier this year i decided to color my hair and did one too many Dominican blow outs.</li>
            <li>Looking forward to receiving my next order so that I can continue on my healthy hair journey.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the mane choice hair vitamins to everyone!!</li>
            <li>Thanks Mane Choice!</li>
            <li>I first purchased these vitamins in the spring hoping to thicken my hair.  </li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle and I love this pills..</li>
            <li>When she launched her business I simply wanted to support her because I love seeing people go after their dreams.</li>
            <li>I so wish I had found these when I first started losing my hair</li>
            <li>My hair grew a whole two inches in just one month!</li>
            <li>the first month my hair was thicker, stronger</li>
            <li>Thanks Manechoice!</li>
            <li>I only purchased 1 bottle as a trial, but I&#x27;ll be ordering 6 more on Friday.  </li>
            <li>Well the first hair growth pills I heard of were hairfinity</li>
            <li>You should definitely try this product I didn&#x27;t their was another out there and when doing some research I was able to run into this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle of Manetabolism and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>These helped me fall back in love with my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love what these vitamins have done to the overall health of my hair.</li>
            <li>the first 6 months without it.</li>
            <li>My first two weeks my hair was growing my nails</li>
            <li>First this make you gain weight??</li>
            <li>They are very efficient!</li>
            <li>and i said i must have these , with my first bottle my edges thicken now there growing</li>
            <li>I first started off taking just biotin</li>
            <li>oh and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>I suggest anyone interested give it a try.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these pills for various reasons.</li>
            <li>There are no side effects and you see results within the first week.</li>
            <li>My face seems to be clearing out, I thought it was an illusion at first</li>
            <li>I try to drink about 9 (8oz) or more glasses of water daily.</li>
            <li>I chose this product over Hair Infinity because it had better reviews for faster hair growth and fewer facial and scalp breakouts (according to my research).</li>
            <li>, I have had them before, but the first time I got just the one bottle from a friend</li>
            <li>I not only saw my hair getting thicker but growing out even more than I would without them.</li>
            <li>:) Not only does this pill make your hair grow, but it&#x27;s a multivitamin</li>
            <li>BUT with the help of these vitamins, I&#x27;ve noticed growth within my first month of using them.</li>
            <li>I was a skeptic at first.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to say the spots where the psoriasis took over are finally growing hair, I&#x27;m on my second bottle and the patches are pretty much gone</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t pretty</li>
            <li>First and foremost I would like to thank God because I truly believe that there was a reason I came across Courtney.</li>
            <li>Thanks manetabolism!</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!</li>
            <li>and I have only used one bottle going to buy more again.</li>
            <li>#34;What do I have to lose?&amp;#34; I started seeing results within the first two weeks</li>
            <li>but after the first time I saw all the reviews on Amazon, Instagram, FaceBook, and even Twitter</li>
            <li>I am currently on my third bottle and I love these vitamins.</li>
            <li>First, Length Second&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>it only took 1 bottle and I&#x27;m in love....</li>
            <li>I finished my first months supply and noticed the growth after trying to go &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, let&#x27;s saaaay</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>I just bought two more bottles last night!</li>
            <li>I used to have to do imaginary hair flips, but now with the help of Manetabolism, I can hair flip on fees with my REAL HAIR!</li>
            <li>In about a month or my first bottle I seen results.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first but took a chance.</li>
            <li>Ive had sooooo much growth since i started talking them in April!</li>
            <li>Most people learn by trial and error; trying one thing after another, but that isn&#x27;t necessary with Manetabolism.</li>
            <li>The first 3 weeks I got 1&amp;#34; of growth.</li>
            <li>But, not only is my hair growing, it&#x27;s healthy.</li>
            <li>and my hair has grown so much !</li>
            <li>I really like this product!  </li>
            <li>I am on my second bottle and have two more waiting for me.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to try the manetabolism, my mother used it first</li>
            <li>I first ordered these vitamins after suffering chemical damage.</li>
            <li>The creator Courtney &amp; her husband REALLY know what they are doing!</li>
            <li>but these are the real deal!</li>
            <li>At first I debated against either this brand or hair infinity</li>
            <li>Plus, the customer service is more like family then a third party company selling merchandise!!!!</li>
            <li>and it provides so much stretch and retention that I could just cry!</li>
            <li>I have used countless companies such as Hairfinity, phyto, natures best, Nixon, and only one that has worked for me is Mane Choice!</li>
            <li>I have been using them for about four months now and have notice my hair first getting thicker</li>
            <li>She even saw some change in length within the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>but as soon as I get back on my feet I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>first I just took Biotin</li>
            <li>Then I came across the mane choice at first</li>
            <li>and I am getting ready to order again soon since I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li>and I can absolutely say that this product works!  </li>
            <li>I was able to see my friend&#x27;s edges grow back and my hair gaining inches within a matter of a month.</li>
            <li>I am not big on leaving reviews on product&#x27;s unless I am sure they will work.</li>
            <li>And in the first 2 weeks I began to see results.</li>
            <li>Not only has my hair began to grow more but it has gotten thicker as well.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Mane Choice for 3 months now and have seen outstanding results not only for myself but also in my mother.</li>
            <li>When I first tried these vitamins I noticed a difference in my hair within 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s more than likely my fault.</li>
            <li>Her hair looked so healthy and had grown since the last time I saw her</li>
            <li>During the first month of taking the vitamins</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore them and will continue to use them!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a definite improvement in hair AND nails almost immediately (wherever you need the vitamins most).</li>
            <li>When I get the money, I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>have helped out so much!</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product and definitely adding it to my hair regimen.</li>
            <li>The first two weeks of me taking the vitamins..</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels overall more healthier..</li>
            <li>but these vitamins have made my hair grow within the first two weeks</li>
            <li>I love it and would definitely recommend it to others !</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens by the end of my first month, I will definitely order more bottles.</li>
            <li>really recommand these pills !</li>
            <li>even my hair dresser was like your hair is really trying to grow out!  </li>
            <li>Just purchased my first bottle off of eBay.</li>
            <li>The first picture it was just at my bra strap now</li>
            <li>This pill (just as everyone said) will most likely give you break outs.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant at first but after reading the reviews and researching the ingredients, I decided to give the product a try.  </li>
            <li>I will most definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>am writing this to make others aware that some of ingredients may cause you to have a reaction not to bash the maker of this vitamin.  </li>
            <li>My hair sheds a lot, I&#x27;m at the higher end of the numbers.</li>
            <li>I did not take them regularly but hope that when I purchase again I will see more results.</li>
            <li>These vitamins are truly a blessing for everyone who wants and needs their hair to grow!</li>
            <li>There are many vitamins out there that claim to do these things but the mane choice actually owns up to every thing they claim to be and claim to do!</li>
            <li>I am now comfortable wearing my natural hair out.</li>
            <li>My hair and nails have grown soo much since adding these pills to my regimen!</li>
            <li>I ordered my first 2-month supply of manetabolism during their 4th of July sale.</li>
            <li>I finished my first bottle as directed and saw a noticeable increase in hair growth AND manageability.</li>
            <li>I love these vitamins and plan on continuing to buy them in the future!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these pills!!</li>
            <li>If you are on a journey to healthy hair I definitely recommend these vitamins</li>

            <li>you first start the pills you&#x27;ll be amazed that your hair can grow 1/2&amp;#34; in two weeks.</li>

            <li>I also love that Courtney is a Christian and gives all credit and Glory to God.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these pills, my hair has grown back and its thicker then it has ever been!</li>
            <li>My cousin started taking these pills first</li>
            <li>I first started taking these the end of July and the first change I noticed was my hair  </li>
            <li>I first thought to use the product because I was getting a sew-in</li>
            <li>it really is a multivitamin as well!</li>
            <li>so I made that mane choice and switched over and have been taking these for 3 months and for the first time in my 22 years of living my nails are growing &amp; breaking .</li>
            <li>Thanks Courtney !</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Courtney and the Manechoice!</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue my healthy hair journey with manetabolism vitamins and mane choice hair care products</li>
            <li>is when I first came across The Mane Choice.</li>
            <li>My hair growth within the first month was almost 2ins.</li>
            <li>Im on month two and ready to see what this product can do for me in a year.!</li>
            <li>ordered my first bottle</li>
            <li>But the manetabolism pills did EXACTLY what they said they would do</li>
            <li>I tried Hairfinity first and broke out.</li>
            <li>After doing as drastic haircut, I&#x27;m ready for my hair to grow like weeds again!</li>
            <li>It really is the MANE choice!</li>
            <li>and I just finished my first bottle...</li>
            <li>I hear so much about this product!</li>
            <li>My skin suddenly looks healthy and glows.</li>
            <li>many very very short hair cuts my husband</li>
            <li>shipping is fast !  </li>
            <li>Thanks Courtney!</li>
            <li>and I got my ends trimmed after the first month</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this product to all of my family and friends who are interested in hair growth and retention.</li>
            <li>I have never seen my hair in such a healthy condition.</li>
            <li>Within the first 2 weeks I saw growth with my hair and my nails</li>
            <li>i must admit i was hesitate to try them at first.</li>
            <li>If you want healthy longer fuller hair you should definitely give these pills a try.</li>
            <li>All things I haven&#x27;t been doing consistently but will def start</li>
            <li>On my second jar will be ordering more</li>
            <li>just finished my first bottle</li>
            <li>Thanks Mane Choice!</li>
            <li>but they either did not work at all or  made my face break out even with the consumption of more water daily as recommended.</li>
            <li>It is not an exact science and will not work for everybody.</li>
            <li>my hair does not like cooperating with me and ultimately breaks more.</li>
            <li>it provides but unfortunately not.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost done my first bottle and yesterday was the first time since I started them that I had my hair blown out and straightened since I started them.....</li>
            <li>and she loved it and let me try a few and within a week I began to see a change in my hair texture</li>
            <li>I wanted to try something new and these are by far my favorite hair supplements.</li>
            <li>and wow!!!!</li>
            <li>Wow!!!!</li>
            <li>wow!!!!</li>
            <li>This all natural hair formula has a unique blend of ingredients necessary for the healthy head of hair</li>
            <li>But This Manetabolism is the real deal right here...</li>
            <li>I have had such positive results that I am about to order me 2 more bottles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a major change in the texture of my hair and although I keep my hair in a high puff, I&#x27;m still able to see that it&#x27;s growing.</li>
            <li>now embrace my natural ethnic coils and absolutely just love what manetabolism is doing for my hair,  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>And best of all, no side effects other than increased energy due to the B12 in these!</li>
            <li>Also, I did NOT have any breakouts with taking these &amp; my nails grew ridiculously long as well &amp; super strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve order other popular hair vitiamis</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Manetabolism to anyone interested in growing out bald spots or hair!</li>
            <li>I had no negative side effects at all!!</li>
            <li>First off I must start by saying I am an overseas customer(meaning that getting the right product is paramount because of shipping prices etc) and had been reading reviews, watching videos and looking at transformation photo&#x27;s since March and one of my closest friends decided to try your product in June and saw a decent amount of change...</li>
            <li>I am currently transitioning from relaxed to natural and the thickness and growth I have received is amazing.  </li>
            <li>so far I&#x27;m loving this product and it only been a month yessssss</li>
            <li>I love healthy thick hair</li>
            <li>Not only is it growing like a weed but its soooo thick and beautiful !</li>
            <li>4months late still taking them and my hair is longer , thicker, and most importantly healthier and the icing on the cake is my skin , nails and eyelashes have also improved!</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I already ordered next month&#x27;s supply!</li>
            <li>I have finally reached ultimate happiness.</li>
            <li>Overall I would recommend this product to any and everyone who is natural, relaxed, or transitioning that wants the solution to healthy hair!</li>
            <li>hair normally grew half inch per month but for the 30 days that I took the vitamins; my hair grew an inch which was the first for me, my nails also grew very rapidly and were very strong!</li>
            <li>That bright yellow secretion meant that something I was taking wasn&#x27;t absorbing properly, and my body had to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>I tried the first 30 day supply just to see how much growth would be added to my hair and it truly works</li>
            <li>i am so happy i found them due to following the owner&#x27;s IG page, Courtney!</li>
            <li>and there my nails are growing long toooo better</li>
            <li>to use this for my journey to long &amp; healthy hair</li>
            <li>I should have gotten more than a month supply because I know I will be using for a long time.</li>
            <li>Of course it works for everyone differently and alternate paces, but for me it has been great so far.</li>
            <li>I purchased the two month supply pretty much on a &amp;#34;he</li>
            <li>Just started my first bottle today, ready to see my progress...</li>
            <li>My nails started to grow pretty fast and my hair grew about an inch.</li>
            <li>but when I heard about manetabolism I got excited it has grown my natural hair out and made my transition much easier</li>
            <li>My hair grows pretty fast</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t even used up my first month&#x27;s supply and my hair has already grown so much.</li>
            <li>I did another BC in September 2013 and have been dying for my hair to be long and healthy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things &amp; their customer testimonials are unbelievable.</li>
            <li>This Product Has Made them Completely Grow In Full.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered my first bottle (on the official site) and my order came SUPER FAST!!</li>
            <li>I started using HAIRFINITY last year it worked perfectly fine for the first 3 months</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never met her personally, but if you follow her on social networks it&#x27;s very obvious of how beautiful her spirit</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost certain that you will have a positive and productive experience.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative side effects and I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>then I heard about manetabolism but wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to lose more money, because the other products said the same thing.</li>
            <li>I live in the uk and pay shipping fees to receive all the mane choice products, because it&#x27;s 100% worth it.</li>
            <li>The most amazing thing was I had just colored my hair and by August I had 1 1/2 of new growth, which means my roots were back dark again.</li>
            <li>I have been using manetabolism for less than a month I have already received amazing results.  </li>
            <li>I personally think Hair skin and nails (easy pickup at the store)</li>
            <li>My nails use to be super soft and it took everything to keep them from breaking</li>
            <li>but it was ok because of the growth I had gotten from the vitamins my hair stopped shedding clumps and was back to normal</li>
            <li>I find the pills are quiet easy to swallow, I take the recommended two pills together in the morning and drink plenty of water through out the day.</li>
            <li>So, if your serious about growing your hair and making good life choices, this will most likely help.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t want to break out because my skin is super sensitive</li>
            <li>They may not have hundreds of celebrity ambassadors saying \\&quot;get long healthy hair like mine\\&quot; (as they wear 24 inch Brazilian straight) misleading the consumer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thicker and has definitely grown a lot more than it normally grows in this time frame.  </li>
            <li>The pills are easy to swallow definitely a +</li>
            <li>Most importantly along with a structured routine and taking the pills, in my first month I retained 1inch of growth and my shedding has decreased tremendously.</li>
            <li>but I was told that The Mane Choice is a more natural brand which uses more natural and organic products then the other leading brands.</li>
            <li>so I am probably one of thoses persons who just cannot handle large amounts of biotin in my system</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think they would work for me because I am anemic,but I started taking these,and of course I realized if I can take 2 hair vitamins,I could certainly take my iron pills also.</li>
            <li>They were too large for me to swallow</li>
            <li>I been taking them since March becase I wanted my hair to be a certain length for my wedding in July.</li>
            <li>For a person who has a oily skin type I&#x27;m hesitate to use certain hair pills because I fear the biotin in the pill will break me out</li>
            <li>My friend who is having great results with her hair,  manetabolism had no affect on her nails,  her nails are still weak, go figure?</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative side effects!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used hair vitamins in the past but these are by far the best, I&#x27;ve actually seen results.  </li>
            <li>lol I had previously taken Hairfinity and it not only broke my son out</li>
            <li>Before I was skeptical, a month trial quickly turned into 4 months and I&#x27;m so happy I made the mane choice.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and does wonders for my hair which always seems to be extra dry.</li>
            <li>The capsules themselves are a pretty decent size, not horse pills.</li>
            <li>Within the first month I got about an inch of growth, and steady growth has continued.</li>
            <li>The Mane Choice is the Main Choice !</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy, strong and the length is unbelievable!</li>
            <li>lol before taking these pills, my hair grew very slowly.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who wants to grown long, healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hardly ever consistent when taking vitamins of any kind, and when taking these I may have missed a dose or two, sometimes even missed a whole day!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to continue to take it because I started washing my face with a new acne treatment called Clean and Clear Advantage.</li>
            <li>These pills are amazing, I&#x27;m three days away from starting my third bottle.</li>
            <li>And if that&#x27;s not enough, go to the Mane Choice&#x27;s website or Instagram for a number of amazing personal testimonies.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really rate it, just started taking it</li>
            <li>I do not have as much shedding as before taking Manetabolism.  </li>
            <li>Hair is growing fast</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like manetabolism</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing these from the actual website since shipping was free</li>
            <li>This really upset me</li>
            <li>so I didnt get that much breakouts.</li>
            <li>I literally can&#x27;t express how much these vitamins have helped my life.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping will buy again</li>
            <li>I feel as though those who claim to have success with it are under a sort of placebo effect because I am seeing no difference at all in time it takes to regrow or the health of it compared to natural growth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 instead because it made me break out no matter how much water I drank.</li>
            <li>Thank You so much</li>
            <li>The delivery was too fast ..</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say about the product since I just started taking it for a week.</li>
            <li>I believe this product really does work.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get ravaging growth, but it did jump start my growth because before I started I was getting absolutely none.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do measurements because I really bought it for shedding.</li>
            <li>, I really don&#x27;t seed any advantange.</li>
            <li>but I really need to do this one.</li>
            <li>but the breakouts are too much.</li>
            <li>These really work, my hair is much thicker and longer.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot I was expecting it on August 6</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for creating a product that grants faith and confidence in your customers.</li>
            <li>This product is the BOMB, it really really works.</li>
            <li>(REALLY)</li>
            <li>this product has made my skin much healthier</li>
            <li>not so much for the style.&lt;br /&gt;By</li>
            <li>Thanks The Mane Choice</li>
            <li>I immediately noticed how my nails were growing much longer than they had before, and I&#x27;m a nail biter.</li>
            <li>Thanks Mane Choice.</li>
            <li>It made it so much thicker</li>
            <li>And the nail bed was so much stronger that I couldn&#x27;t trim my nails.</li>
            <li>i recommend them to anyone who wants healthier hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve achieved so much growth since taking them.  </li>
            <li>My husband noticed how much and how fast my hair has grown</li>
            <li>They did not taste very well, but probably because they&#x27;re intended to be taken that way.</li>
            <li>and then I am going to cut away all the relaxer and start a fresh with natural hair and keep taking the vitamins.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very grateful.</li>
            <li>They gave me so much hope for my hair.</li>
            <li>And these vitamins helped so much.</li>
            <li>And it feels and looks so much healthier now.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t ever remember my hair growing this fast and lets not talk about nails.  </li>
            <li>My nails are growing so fast</li>
            <li>My nails are growing so fast</li>
            <li>I will be ordering a 3 month supply very soon.</li>
            <li>I cannot wait to try the line as  whole as their prices are very reliable as well.</li>
            <li>I was very cautious about trying a hair vitamin.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering my 6 month order of vitamins very soon.</li>
            <li>My hair is growing so fast</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>But these pills really work</li>
            <li>Well, after taking these supplements (I bought the 60 day supply), I noticed that my puff was poofier after my 30 day bottle was empty. :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much thicker.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I used my sister as a Guinea pig for these pills and it really works .</li>
            <li>and so so much healthier feeling.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, ladies you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li>, however I do have extremely high hopes!</li>
            <li>Thanks to The Mane Choice hair vitamins, I have now reached Bra strap length in a 2 years span.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have so much energy when I take these vitamins.</li>
            <li>In addition, I truly believe that my body is absorbing all of the nutrients in these pills.</li>
            <li>The mane choice is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>I really do enjoy this product because it actually works.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in all that my hair need to be taking out just after three weeks because it&#x27;s growing so fast.</li>
            <li>The shipping was incredibly fast</li>
            <li>Although I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in length (yet) my hair is so much thicker and healthier and that ls</li>
            <li>but it has made it so much healthier.</li>
            <li>Before I brought the vitamins I read the reviews on here and compared it to hairfinity and didnt really like what I heard about hairfinity causing break outs.</li>
            <li>Thanks Courtney you inspire me.&lt;br /&gt;Follow my HHJ on Instagram</li>
            <li>The Manetabolism Vitamins have given my hair so much shine and thickness.</li>
            <li>but overall, I can say I truly did enjoy my hair growth experience with manetabolism</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for people tryiing to re-grow their edges!</li>
            <li>My hair is so much stronger and fuller.  </li>
            <li>I was really getting discouraged.</li>
            <li>My nails have grown much much faster.</li>
            <li>&amp; I also don&#x27;t drink water as much as you&#x27;re suppose to</li>
            <li>I absolutely have to keep drinking lots of water (6-8 bottles)</li>

            <li>My hair grew so fast and it was easier for me take the Mane pill than the Hairfinity one.</li>

            <li>My nails have also grown and gotten much stronger.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice thickness, I will not buy again.</li>
            <li>My sister introduced this product to me in a challenge to see how much our hair could grow after using this Mane Choice product for one year.  </li>
            <li>My hair has grown very well and my hair has stopped shedding so much.</li>
            <li>I had no nausea and they really work.</li>
            <li>I really recommend trying these.</li>
            <li>They made my hair geow so much.</li>
            <li>my cousin showed me these and how much her hair was growing and just had to order me some as well</li>
            <li>Within 2 weeks I could really see a difference.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s almost there all thanks to the mane choice manetabolism pills.</li>
            <li>After continuing with these vitamins I saw the real difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so ready for this hair journey</li>
            <li>Very thankful to have found these pills.</li>
            <li>and I had to get my braids redone very often to keep up with the growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This fact alone really made me eager to try them since their effiency is backed by science.</li>
            <li>I began using the vitamins with Senegalese twist, and they grew out so fast.</li>
            <li>I even got my sister to buy them and she loves them as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast my hair was and is still growing.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering a second third fourth bottle lol</li>
            <li>Thanks to this product I am very close to reaching my hair goal</li>
            <li>If you haven&#x27;t gotten your vitamins then you really need to.</li>
            <li>I am a college student and I never had the time to really take care of my hair or even afford to do so.</li>
            <li>I was embarrassed to wear my real hair.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my hair has grown in much thicker and fuller.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these vitamins for four months now and they are the real deal.</li>
            <li>Tried 2 bottles of these and just absolutely loveeed it.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I cried for a week straight because my hair was then shoulder length.</li>
            <li>One person said their hair grew so fast they stopped taking them because they were wearing braids</li>
            <li>This product made my hair soo much stronger and shinier.</li>
            <li>, my edges had filled completely back in, in just SIXTEEN (16) days!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Since starting these pills, the spot has filled in and my weaker spots are also growing too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only have I noticed substantial growth/length retention in my hair since taking them (about 4 total inches), but the manageability of my unprocessed natural hair has improved greatly!  </li>
            <li>I decided to give it a shot, and these vitamins really work.</li>
            <li>I been using them now for 6 months &amp; my hair has grown so much.</li>
            <li>I really hope it works.</li>
            <li>I have been taking it for 3 months straight</li>
            <li>, these vitamins really grew out my hair</li>
            <li>Hey are much much cheaper on the website.</li>
            <li>and I decided to go with the Mane Choice because they had real people giving real reviews and not a lot of celebrity spokesman.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t see much progress</li>
            <li>This is my 5th bottle and i have seen so much growth and thickness in my hair.</li>
            <li>After takin Manetabolism my hair grew soooooo much thicker, stronger and healthier.</li>
            <li>However, I found my hair not to be growing much.</li>
            <li>Thanks manechoice</li>
            <li>My nails have also grown so much and they are stronger.</li>
            <li>and I think these pills are responsible for it since I don&#x27;t do or take anything else.</li>
            <li>I have never had a problem with shipping when I ordered and received very promptly.</li>
            <li>These pills really do promotes growth and you will start to see growth within a week</li>
            <li>I really could not afford it.</li>
            <li>It really is living up to all the hype.</li>
            <li>These pills really work.</li>
            <li>They contain wayyyyy to much vitamin A</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more in the near future.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say hair is starting to fill back in...</li>
            <li>I tried another brand for about 3 months and saw results slowly, but I decided to switch over to this brand because of Courtney&#x27;s own success with her products.</li>
            <li>After cutting my hair into a bob, I saw so much new growth in such a short time, it honestly seemed too good to be true, clearly it wasn&#x27;t :) &amp; the BONUS is, that there are NO side effects.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost done with the first bottle and ready I&#x27;ve noticed my hair has gotten thicker,especially around the edges and has plenty of new growth.</li>
            <li>All I can say is WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Manetabolism for three months now, and wow!!!</li>
            <li>I started June 28th, right after receiving a fresh relaxer earlier than month.  </li>
            <li>and I first noticed less shedding and more length retention.</li>
            <li>I could tell exactly where the new hair was growing in and</li>
            <li>The cost of this product is worth more than buying packages after packages of other creams or hair &amp;#34;vitamins&amp;#34; when this right here is the key!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken other hair skin &amp; nail pills, and when I did my urine would often be a bright yellow</li>
            <li>We are ready for our third month supply and excited to continue on with our journey.</li>
            <li>My hair never stops growing now, my nails are so strong and long</li>
            <li>I really recommend The Mane Choice brand, especially if your natural and want your hair to grow back healthy and full.</li>
            <li>Although considered &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; by most standards (mid-back length), the hair around my temples has always been much shorter and thinner than the other hair on my head.  </li>
            <li>I bought a two month supply of these pills from the original website ( I came to Amazon to see if I can get my next supply cheaper, and I can&#x27;t)</li>
            <li>questions: no, I didn&#x27;t break out, and no, hair does not grow more in other places.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other supplements with no results.</li>
            <li>This has more of the ingredients i need for hair/skin/nail nourishment and seems to be working quicker than the other pills.  </li>
            <li>So excited to start this one since My hair and body has responsed so well to the regular pills.   </li>
            <li>My hair which was once stunted in growth and thinning at the crown has shown a significant amount of improvement overall.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other hair supplements ( Hairfinty, biotin, hair skin and nails)</li>
            <li>We all need vitamins in our daily lives and Courtney has come up with a unique formula that works wonders.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken about three months supply, one month between each bottle and my hair has significantly grown 3 extra inches.</li>
            <li>I noticed a significant amount of growth within weeks of starting my regimen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a major improvement in my hair&#x27;s overall health:)</li>
            <li>I received my hair vitamins last week and I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
            <li>I tried the other hair growth pills (I won&#x27;t use the name, to protect the innocent, but the initials are H.F.)</li>
            <li>I love this product and the other products from this line.</li>
            <li>Overall, it has done what it says and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to order more and the other products.</li>
            <li>Its the best on allllll types of hair trust and believe from a woman that has tired everything! !</li>
            <li>I am so excited to have not only myself</li>
            <li>I have recommended these pills to two other family members and they love them as well.</li>
            <li>I have try many other hair vitamins</li>
            <li>Formulated by people within a medical field these vitamins have the right proportion of everything you need to have healthy, long, luscious hair with no adverse side effects.</li>
            <li>lol usually, my hair grows back at a &amp;#34;regular pace&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>When I decided to go natural it was all because I saw everyone else&#x27;s pictures with long healthy hair</li>
            <li>My hair has had remarkable growth, no more shedding!!  </li>
            <li>I just recently started my transition from relaxed to natural and it hasn&#x27;t been easy</li>
            <li>My point is that if I&#x27;m seeing this kind of growth with my current diet, I can only imagine my results if I actually ate (and drank) right.</li>
            <li>I will be continuing taking these pills as long as they are available.</li>
            <li>@Courtney thank you for sharing such greatness with the world, especially me as I am on a mission for long healthy natural hair :)</li>
            <li>MY HAIR IS GROWING MUCH FASTER than it normally would; thicker as well.</li>
            <li>Love these vitamins they have helped me so much can&#x27;t wait to start back up on them as soon as possible</li>
            <li>My hair was always full in the middle.</li>
            <li>I had that&#x27;s had no hair growth is starting full in.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of new growth!</li>
            <li>I had so much new growth packed on top of each other.</li>
            <li>I live by this!</li>
            <li>&amp; don&#x27;t get me started on the new growth !</li>
            <li>and you could notice all the new growth !&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the vitamins for 3 months now and have over 6 inches of new growth!</li>
            <li>A month after my texlax, my new growth looked much closer to 3 months post.</li>
            <li>Less shedding, more growth, thickness, and shine.</li>
            <li>Zinc and iron worked out much better for a lot less cheaper.</li>
            <li>I purchased these pills with hopes of quick regrowth after shaving bald for the army back in 2012.</li>
            <li>There are no ingredients listed on the main Amazon page.</li>
            <li>and my hair is STILL growing :) I&#x27;m on my second bottle and about to put in my third order....</li>
            <li>Plus, the vitamins made me super nauseous, daily.</li>
            <li>Purchased these pills for the first last month and my hair has gotta thicker and looks much healthier!</li>
            <li>I love how it not only promotes hair growth but also improves your hairs overall health!</li>
            <li>I purchased my first two month supply of the manetabolism back when Courtney first started selling them.</li>
            <li>but my edges were particularly none existent and I needed a breakthrough..</li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s saying something because I&#x27;m usually quite the skeptic about so-called &amp;#34;mystical magical hair growth pills&amp;#34; but this stuff really is the truth!</li>
            <li>Mane Choice is made by a African American woman and just looking at the reviews they are 100% better.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been taking the Mane Choice supplements, not only have I experience no side effects, but I&#x27;m more concerned in the overall HEALTH of my hair, not just inches.</li>
            <li>Manetabolism gave me a steady inch per month.</li>
            <li>I always had problems with my edges due to perming and tight hair styles, but I can see great results already.</li>
            <li>the first day I took these pills I got major pimples!</li>
            <li>It only happened around my monthly time slightly more than usual, but nothing huge.</li>
            <li>and I only saw growth the very first month.</li>
            <li>My nails are so long and strong and my family have been going on and on about how clear my skin is.</li>
            <li>After taking these pills my hair is so much thicker, fuller, and never dry or brittle and this happened within the first week.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these vitamins.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend you try this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend EVERYBODY to order these vitamins.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product .</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it,</li>
            <li>Highly recommended hair care products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>If you suffer from hair loss or feel as though your hair is not growing I would highly recommend trying these vitamins!&lt;br /&gt;-Mimi C.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these vitamins and have not had any issues of breakouts at all.</li>
            <li>Not only is my hair healthier than it has ever been, but I also see other amazing benefits.</li>
            <li>Amazing product only got A one month supply due that I&#x27;m moving from FL to NJ</li>
            <li>If you start to break out &amp; you know you need a clear face by a certain date all I gotta say is don&#x27;t take the pills.</li>
            <li>my hair is filing in and I see new growth more often than the previous hair pills I was taking.</li>
            <li>If you are reading this, just because I gave it 3 stars, does not mean it will not work for you...</li>
            <li>After thirty days, I thought I needed a little more time</li>
            <li>however I did not see many results, my hair was a little thicker, but not what I imagined to achieve.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month and the results are astonishing.  </li>
            <li>Ran out of pills 2 days ago and ordered a new bottle to my surprise I got the NEW ONE!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been real sensitive about my edges but after taking these and</li>
            <li>This is a genuine review and I would not even bother reviewing if the results were not real.</li>
            <li>I cut all my hair off to start over natural and these vitamins have really helped grow my hair out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m skeptical reading all those great reviews dated September 22 seems suspect to me</li>
            <li>After much research I found out about Hair finity and decided to give them a try, I took these vitamins from September until early this year.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I love these vitamins\\&quot;,  not only can my friends notice how long my hair is getting.</li>
            <li>I buy my pills from a local retailer but they are definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>but I wasted more results.</li>
            <li>I ordered my vitamins last Sunday and they were delivered on Friday which was exciting.</li>
            <li>I am hoping for success with my bald spots in the middle of my head.</li>
            <li>No negative side effects for me either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually able to keep extensions for at least a month but after using these I have to keep re doing my hair because that&#x27;s how much growth I have!</li>
            <li>I just recently started to really take care of my hair and taking these for the first two months my hair is thicker and my lenght is now bra strap length.</li>
            <li>The pills are about the size of a normal multivitamin.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t take them daily as I should, but I did take two a day, and now my hair is so healthy and it&#x27;s growing so long.</li>
            <li>Finally bought 60 days worth of the mane choice vitamins.</li>
            <li>Also, my skin looks brighter (all over) and my nails have grown faster than normal.</li>
            <li>So I went ahead and purchase two more bottles, along with the butter and the green tea conditioner</li>
            <li>I normally would go threw months with my protective style( a sew in)</li>
            <li>These pills definitely are worth the price.</li>
            <li>Love the product have it for a few days can see the grow on my edges will recommend to friends and family</li>
            <li>I normally take energy pills to get me started my day</li>
            <li>(My hair grew at normal rate).</li>
            <li>Normal hair growth for me is .5 of an inch.</li>
            <li>overall i think its worth it</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t do reviews but for this product I had to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s for all hair types and backgrounds, some people assume its only for female afro-centric hair types from their reviews and photos, but I am a caucasian male with ultra-fine hair, it wasn&#x27;t budging in length for months, I started taking this in february, and by may I have grown 4.5 inches of thick, strong tresses, which is remarkable because hair growth is averaged out at 1/2 and inch a month.</li>
            <li>in all, I would highly recommend this product to anyone tired of stagnant hair growth and ready to experience the type of healthy hair and length retention you never thought you could achieve before!</li>
            <li>Astonishing my hair grew a inch in a half!</li>
            <li>I saved up money to buy my first bottle, and in the month that I used it up, my hair had grown more than it has been the past 6 years!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 20 years old and lost a patch of hair when I was pregnant back in may</li>
            <li>pic on the left was Thanksgiving and the pic on the right was October.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I began taking the vitamins right around March or April (despite ordering them earlier in the year).</li>
            <li>but I wanted to give my hair an extra boost and this was the right product to do so.</li>
            <li>I would get it right above neck length</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle right now</li>
            <li>remember the time in which it takes your hair to grow back is not important, what&#x27;s important is your hair growing!!</li>
            <li>Great product with fast results took one bottle of pills and noticed results in hair and nail growth I will order a longer supply to track the results better you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li>I already have thick hair, but my hair has become much thicker and since being natural for over a year, I am finally able to see my natural curl pattern!!!</li>
            <li>so they&#x27;ll slide down easily.</li>
            <li>There were no annoying side effects like some other vitamins.</li>

            <li>and I have not noticed ANY new growth.</li>
            <li>and I always know when I have new growth because of the difference of textures</li>
            <li>and I have new growth jumping out my roots.</li>
            <li>I thought this was something I just had to live with.  </li>
            <li>and i have so much new growth.</li>

            <li>and I noticed new growth.</li>
            <li>These vitamins make my new growth feel thicker.</li>
            <li>These Pills have worked wonders for me, I Live in Canada</li>
            <li>I new</li>
            <li>This has become my new addition.  </li>
            <li>I had a sew in and its def time to take it out with this new growth.  </li>
            <li>but soon has I get my new address</li>
            <li>but now I have up to 2 inches of new growth.</li>
            <li>I immediately started my new bottle</li>
            <li>And just 3 weeks in, I have about 1/2 to an inch of new growth already.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait until my new shipment arrives.</li>
            <li>After a week I already see new growth .</li>
            <li>will be a new experience...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hard to find products that really help your hair grow and stay healthy.</li>
            <li>my nails were amazing , my hair is now on my back  in just a few months , I will forever take  my mane choice pills ..</li>
            <li>Also, my nails are much stronger, my edges are fuller and my hair has grown so much in places where it was really short.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I didnt pay much attention to how fast my hair was growing until I started my second month.</li>
            <li>I really recommend these pills to anyone looking to grow thick, healthy, longer hair.</li>
            <li>I made the the choice after much review and seeing real results from people who had only used the manetabolism for two weeks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone transitioning to natural hair, or if you just want length.  </li>
            <li>I stopped taking them because my braids started to look bad because my hair was growing so much, which is a good thing!</li>
            <li>my skin remains clear and I have not had a headache once!  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it consistently but can definitely see fullness and growth</li>
            <li>First it was generic brands, then hairfinity.</li>
            <li>I started taken them may 29th,and the first month, I didn&#x27;t see ANY results, so I thought maybe I should try a second bottle,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s a hair bump because not to take anything away from the pills because I did notice I was shaving more often than usual</li>
            <li>The Mane Choice vitamins are the first to actually show results.</li>
            <li>Within the first 2 weeks I noticed NOT ONLY 1 inch of hair growth, but I had stronger nail growth, and longer lashes.</li>
            <li>First thickness throughout my entire head now</li>
            <li>After taking these vitamins it gave me courage to go through with the big chop to finally get my hair back in healthy shape.</li>
            <li>and I am willing to try this product to see the same result!!</li>
            <li>I bought these pills for the first time back in June.</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered the pill I used it for 2weeks and notice that my sides started to grow back</li>
            <li>At first I was worried about taking these pills because I was worried about possible side effects or that the pills just won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Before finishing my first bottle, I noticed growth not only in my hair but my nails as well.</li>
            <li>I am transitioning to natural and The Mane Choice is making the process a breeze!</li>
            <li>I tried Manetabteolism last year, but will admit that I did not use it consistently.</li>
            <li>but my nails also grew like wild flowers!</li>
            <li>All I can say is wow!.</li>
            <li>My mom had been trying to grow her hair for a while and, following @courtneynaturalhair on Instagram and seeing raves &amp; raves about them, I decided to try them for myself first.</li>
            <li>I started wearing box braids and started taking my first vitamin on the same day.</li>
            <li>I noticed after my first bottle that my hair was definitely thicker, longer &amp; stronger!</li>
            <li>Keep those razors sharp and that wax fresh!).</li>
            <li>and I was still taking the pills with 0 break outs :) my hair is almost past my breast</li>
            <li>Ive also had my edges to start coming back in, and we all know the edge struggle is REAL!</li>
            <li>Definitely noticed results the first month.  </li>
            <li>When i first started I got results from only 1 week of use!</li>
            <li>Because it causes bald spots on the scalp, especially in the first stages, it is sometimes called spot baldness.</li>
            <li>You will definitely see results in the first month.</li>
            <li>I am recently finished my first bottle of Manetabolism Hair Vitamins</li>
            <li>I now have my other sister and my boyfriend taking this pills and excited about the growth.</li>
            <li>A downside to me would be the fact that I like to keep my nails naturally short, and I have to cut them more frequently due to the growth I&#x27;m experiencing with the vitamins.</li>
            <li>I only been using the pills for 2 months now, and I swear within the first 2 weeks I saw changes in my hair.</li>
            <li>I was initially hesitant about buying this product because I was sure it wasn&#x27;t going to work but after reading other reviews and people&#x27;s successes, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I am so pleasantly surprised by the results after just 3 bottle of this product!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s most definitely past it.</li>
            <li>Unlike the other vitamins The Mane Choice not only increases growth rate in length but it also thickens and promotes retention which is just as important as growth!</li>
            <li>First, I did notice some growth in the length of my hair but it has only been 30 days.</li>
            <li>I decided to transition from relaxed to natural an decided to give manetabolism a try!</li>
            <li>also I was nervous at first to take the pills just because of possible side effects</li>
            <li>My hair was falling out in the back due to lack of moisture and too many relaxers.</li>
            <li>My natural hair loves them &amp; I do too!</li>
            <li>I believe not only do you have to take the pills consistently</li>
            <li>I still have some breakage, so I&#x27;m hoping that if I continue with this, it will completely go away!</li>
            <li>After I finished my first bottle, I orders my second!</li>
            <li>I will continue on with the #manesociety because thus far this product is a miracle worker!</li>
            <li>The first month I took these, I did experience some break out on my face during the second week.</li>
            <li>But a true testament that these work is because I suffer with anxiety,something that I have been dealing with since I joined the military in 2007-2011 and still suffered with.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this product especially to new natural hair virgins.</li>
            <li>My skin also looks amazing and my nails are very strong and long, people always think they are fake!</li>
            <li>I ordered a 2 month supply &amp; by 3 weeks I noticed a major difference!!!</li>
            <li>To be honest, I was a little hesitant to spend my money on them, (I&#x27;ve tried other vitamins, but didn&#x27;t really get the results that I wanted)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no break outs of the skin, your hair grows thicker , your edges grow thick and strong not to mention the shine it gives my hair !</li>
            <li>I am extremely please with my purchase and will definitely be purchasing more before this bottle is complete.</li>
            <li>I have been transitioning to  natural (still new to me) and disovered the mane choice</li>
            <li>My new growth was sooo lush.</li>
            <li>I also tried hair infinity which only showed normal growth compared to The Mane Choice!!</li>
            <li>I heard about this product on social media and decided to see if the hype was real.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d advise women to be super careful with who they let braid their hair</li>
            <li>I started following Courtney on YouTube and her spirit was so sweet that I started following her on Instagram.</li>
            <li>At the end of my first month of the product I removed the sew in and noticed my edges COMPLETELY grew back in.</li>
            <li>and i can only say positive things.</li>
            <li>So i ordered more this time I give my mom a bottle from a little girl my mom only had hair in the middle of her hair and after one month of the mane choice my mom sides and nape area grew hair for the first time in her life.</li>
            <li>However, with Manetabolism my hair is full and doesn&#x27;t have extreme breakage anymore.</li>
            <li>within the first two weeks of taking them I seen a nice amount of growth I would recommend these my edges are also really thin from year of pulling when I was younger</li>
            <li>I do however see a lot of growth and my hair definitely feels a lot healthier (stronger, less breakage, and more elasticity).</li>
            <li>I have less breakage which leads to more growth and overall health hair.</li>
            <li>As a broke college student, most of my budget goes to ramen noodles and textbooks, but at only about $30 a month (less if you catch a discount sale on their instagram @themanechoice)</li>
            <li>I am excited to try all other products!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m well past excited to get them again!</li>
            <li>I recently just cut my hair &amp;am excited to see how long my hair grows.</li>
            <li>My edges are fuller and from the looks of my new growth my hair is definitely growing in thicker and faster than my normal hair growth rate!</li>
            <li>My edges broke because of gettin my weave so tight and almost everything grew back so Im satisfied</li>
            <li>After doing a big chop I started my hair journey with main choice and it has done my hair justice !</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely damaged from a quick weave with glue.</li>
            <li>Not only have i noticed significant hair growth, i have also noticed less shedding when I wash my hair, and my hair is much fuller and thicker.  </li>
            <li>So if the breakout continues to clear and nothing else happens</li>
            <li>Took about a month to clear up.</li>
            <li>Not only has my hair grown, I began transitioning to natural hair because my hair was growing so fast my relaxer appointments couldn&#x27;t keep up.</li>
            <li>My skin is so clear.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I&#x27;ve seen such great results..</li>
            <li>Hopefully this will go away as I keep taking them but that scares me, I want my face to stay clear and my hair to be longer and stronger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the vitamins for about 2 months and so far my hair has grown 2 inches and is much healthier overall!</li>
            <li>They have also started to clear my face up and made my nails grow.</li>
            <li>I so clear</li>
            <li>I would probably still take them just to keep my face clear.  </li>
            <li>I am currently on my fourth bottle and have seen so much improvement in the thickness and texture of my hair and natural curls.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my second day, but my face feel very irritated and itchy.....</li>
            <li>product claims to provide the body with natural nourishments to promote thickness and faster growth</li>
            <li>So far I noticed a difference with my hair.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive but I&#x27;ve never had acne before.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say because I only been use it for 5 days</li>
            <li>Get Much BUTTER Than This&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;Green Tea &amp; Carrot Deep Conditioning Mask&amp;#34; using these products while taking these vitamins works wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li>Not only did I start seeing results fast within my hair, but my nails were growing stronger and healthier too.</li>
            <li>After making a collage on July 3rd, I can&#x27;t tell you how much it made my day seeing that there was hair in that bald spot.</li>
            <li>Hair can have so much meaning and for me it was getting my confidence back.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m definitely going to be purchasing a six month supply real soon.</li>
            <li>My stylist was amazed at how much my hair had grown in that short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>so my patches are nearly all covered.</li>
            <li>Their All natural  &amp; no side affects.</li>
            <li>chopped my hair and became natural</li>
            <li>And even though you&#x27;re supposed to drink a lot of water, sometimes in my busy schedule</li>
            <li>Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a naturally curly girl.</li>
            <li>Do u think these pills help with young girls age 8 or people with alopicha</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for 3 years now</li>
            <li>I was like people hair can be growing this fast especially Ms. Courtney&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li>Since taking the vitamins my shedding has completely stopped.</li>
            <li>I have had any breakouts so far</li>
            <li>I have natural 4 type hair.</li>
            <li>So much so that I bought another pair for back up.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair</li>
            <li>I had cut off all my hair because of heat and color damage, and wanted to start my natural hair journey all over again.</li>
            <li>Mane Choice is the better than Hairfinity because you need at least 3 bottles of Hairfinity to see what ManeChoice does in one month with one bottle.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really review how well it works obviously</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these pills for about 5 months now, and I can&#x27;t say enough how much they&#x27;ve been a &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Before taking these vitamins my energy level was extremely low, and I was very sluggish throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I do have my hair in a protective style which definitely helps the growth of my hair, but I give all thanks to manetabolism for growing my hair faster and healthier.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for 4 years now.</li>
            <li>So far I have not experience anything except my nails</li>
            <li>#34;Doesn&#x27;t get much Butter Than This&amp;#34;, with that product I use once a day at night before I moisturize and seal my hair as well Deep Conditioning Mask...I use this mask biweekly and my hair just loves it!</li>
            <li>I tried these for a month and notice my hair didn&#x27;t shed as much and my hair that was damaged and broke off started to grow back.</li>
            <li>good.(I am a natural curly girl)  </li>
            <li>But these have by far met and passed my expectations.</li>
            <li>I also have noticed my hair feels stronger by far...</li>
            <li>No side effects so far</li>
            <li>This young lady said that she was in fact taking the pills, and has/had done wonders for her hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used 2 bottles of Manetabolism thus far</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I think the biggest UNEXPECTED benefit is the boost of energy I get.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had edges in years from wearing braids in my early 20s.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for 2 years now and wish I would&#x27;ve known about this product years ago.</li>
            <li>Its cheaper if you buy directly from their website.</li>
            <li>I noticed a change as early as two weeks.</li>
            <li>I purchased these pills after getting a Dominican blow out (which completely thinned my hair).</li>
            <li>im a college student, and ive been natural for 1yr and a couple of months now</li>
            <li>i follow her on instagram and check out her website daily before i made a choice to get her products, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the manetabolism vitamins!</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I started using this product when I went natural</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking progress photos to keep up with the growth and that&#x27;s really the only way you&#x27;ll notice.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE REAL DEAL, look no further.  </li>
            <li>, both of us are natural.</li>
            <li>if i had gotten a year supply, my hair could&#x27;ve been to my ankles by now!&amp;#34; Haha, I definitely recommend these pills!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stopped getting acrylic nails also and growing out my natural nails</li>
            <li>I went natural about a year ago</li>
            <li>I am on a natural hair journey and have been looking for ways to speed up growth AND improve health.</li>
            <li>I now have to wax my lip at least every two weeks, shave my legs and underarms more often too.  </li>
            <li>I am very grateful for this product and the product line that I have convinced several people to give it a try!!</li>
            <li>and I rock my natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>and I am 31 years old).</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend these vitamins to anyone suffering from hair loss or anyone who wants to grow their hair.</li>
            <li>I been growing my hair naturally for about 3 months</li>
            <li>, I had to get my entire head done over because my hair had grown just that much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve definitely received noticeable growth and everyone tells me how much.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the extra thickness to my hair!</li>
            <li>I have heard that you get breakouts while taking them, but i haven&#x27;t gotten anything so far.</li>
            <li>After a year of being natural</li>
            <li>The shipping speed is also fast when ordered from the actual website.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to any and everyone; regardless of race, hair texture, natural or relaxed.</li>
            <li>6 months ago I decided to go natural and felt I needed something to aid me in growing my hair.</li>
            <li>The hair that grows is really soft, too.</li>
            <li>but so far I can see some growth within my edges</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m just in complete shock</li>
            <li>So I only really review on books</li>
            <li>my nails have grown rapidly, my skin is clearer than ever and my hair has grown nearly two inches</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for about a 1/12 after transitioning for a year while in college, which was a struggle.</li>
            <li>I am in the process of going natural</li>
            <li>My hair was near waist length but not quite by the time I graduated.</li>
            <li>Definately helped with the heat damage on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>So naturally I was devastated, and completely heartbroken over the loss of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought oh she&#x27;s just trying to fool us with the old okie doke.</li>
            <li>These vitamins have strengthen and thickened my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended these vitamins to about 3 people thus far and would keep recommending them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m recently natural...</li>
            <li>I got the 5 month supply and 4 for my sister and my hair has grown 2 inches so far in 2 month, it&#x27;s also thicker and healthier.</li>
            <li>I tried these vitamins early July because I&#x27;ve been seeing people post progress pictures on Instagram.</li>
            <li>I am transitioning from a relaxer to natural.</li>
            <li>I just went natural 6 months ago</li>
            <li>My mom put me on to these when I started my natural hair journey.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve only had the product for a few weeks :)</li>
            <li>My hair is so thick and healthy.</li>
            <li>Even my thin edges are coming in nicely.</li>
            <li>my hair haa become wven more thick.</li>
            <li>also she said my hair was growing in so thick and healthy.</li>
            <li>I also have major new growth under my protective style.</li>
            <li>and now I find myself clipping them down often (not a bad thing)</li>
            <li>My hair feels full and when I blow dry it my boyfriend can definitely see and feel it.</li>
            <li>I plan on ordering more later in the future as well as other products.</li>
            <li>My hair was almost shoulder length and after a month supply I have reached past shoulder length! :)</li>
            <li>After taking a Biotin supplement for years and barely seeing any results I decided to try a new product.</li>
            <li>I had hopes but not high hopes after pretty much maintaining the same length hair for 3 years.</li>
            <li>and I never really saw significant growth except for my bodily hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry but most of these reviews or at least the top ones on the first page are planted, clearly.</li>
            <li>Recommend this for women (like myself) that wears a lot of weave and  lost a lot of it due to having too many center parts.</li>
            <li>I have been taking manetabolisms for the past 6months and they have truly been a blessing not only to the growth and strength of my natural hair, but It has also supported the health of my skin and nails, unlike most vitamins the manetabolisms has never given me any negative side affects I have found that it has boosted the health of my immune system along side my healthy eating diet change..</li>
            <li>The shipping was so fast and the pills were at my house in 2 days flat.</li>
            <li>I love these pills, I&#x27;ve done research on Youtube firstly about Hairfinity vitamins and heard some bad reviews on how while taking them the new growth is thinner than it would be if you weren&#x27;t taking them so my first thought was</li>
            <li>but I never looked into it until I became serious with having healthy hair.</li>
            <li>I had been taking hairfinity  for the last 6-8 months and remembered having the same  breakout problem within the first couple of weeks of taking it as well.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the healthy hair vitamins for the past couple of months and they definitely work!!!</li>
            <li>I have struggled with my hair and have tried many different options in the past.</li>
            <li>Definitely cheaper on the main website, but if you have Prime, you can get it quicker through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I was so skeptical when I first bought them because I&#x27;ve heard so many people tell me their stories about hairfinity &amp; I</li>
            <li>Even so, I noticed a real difference in my edges within the first few weeks of taking these.</li>
            <li>I ordered the pills off of the main website in June, and my edges started growing back.</li>
            <li>To say I was pleasantly surprised, was a major understatement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There have been many occasions when I&#x27;ve banged my hand and broken a nail, only to see it growing back long and strong in about a week to two week&#x27;s time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I would wash my hair every week I would have TONS of shedding, but these vitamins have tremendously cut down on that shedding I barely see any on some washes!</li>
            <li>Additionally: the deep conditioner that she sells is HIGHLY overpriced</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these vitamins and not only to women but men also.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these for anyone transitioning, big chopped, or if you just want to add fullness and thickness to your hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and I&#x27;ll be purchasing my next two month supply!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking to improve the overall health of their hair.</li>
            <li>I did my big chop my after my senior year of high school in 2011</li>
            <li>and I have seen major results!</li>
            <li>results may not be as fast and long than others</li>
            <li>Normally my hair grows on about 1/2 an inch every couple of months and it grew like 1 1/2 inch in only 3 weeks of taking manetabolism.</li>
            <li>You will experience growth before that first bottle is empty.</li>
            <li>Also no break outs and no dark urine</li>
            <li>which is faster than my regular normal rate of growth.</li>
            <li>I started these vitamins back in March and since then my hair has become more thick and also they have helped with my transition from relaxed hair to natural.</li>
            <li>The vitamins have caused my edges that have been missing for a long time to come back in so full!!</li>
            <li>I cant wait til my first trimester is over (thats when my Dr say I can get back on them once the sickness is over) because my hair is about to be a true MANEchoice if you know what I mean....</li>
            <li>First for me personally my two month supply in less than a month tops gave me much thicker hair along with length.</li>
            <li>(always a plus)...no increase in hair growth in other less appealing places though.</li>
            <li>They are within a normal size so no worries about having a hard time swallowing them and no bad taste.</li>
            <li>but I check my new growth daily</li>
            <li>Let me just tell you, this style usually last a month and after 2 weeks is time to get it redone because all of my new growth.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased a new bottle.</li>
            <li>will add that I am in the southern New Mexico area</li>
            <li>hair texture is very corse  and tends to get dry and brittle and break easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am African American and nothing has ever made my hair grow so FAST not just that</li>
            <li>Ive always had long hair, however, these vitamins gave me a definite legnth boost within finishing my first bottle.</li>
            <li>Not only are my edges fuller only after 1.5 months, but my nails are so much stronger and longer</li>
            <li>So much growth in such a short time..</li>
            <li>I found the Mane Choice Vitamins on social media, with some research I decided to give them a try, and boy was I surprised.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my second year of being completely all natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle &amp; not only has these pills made my hair longer but also thicker (which I really needed).</li>
            <li>I hate swallowing pills and stopped taking the vitamins and surely enough I have not seen hair growth results like I did with these wonderful vitamins.</li>
            <li>He took them for a month and slowly but surely his hair grew back.</li>
            <li>You will be glad you did because your days of thinning, breaking, slow growing, shedding hair will FINALLY come to an end with this product!!</li>
            <li>I have a difficult time swallowing pills but you can open these and use them that way which is really good.</li>
            <li>I was soooo upset and was looking for something to help me grow my healthy thick hair back.</li>
            <li>(Sidebar: I highly recommend following the website and their social media to keep up to date with all the products and promos.)</li>
            <li>Before I knew it I couldn&#x27;t keep my hair in any protected styles because the growth was so major.</li>
            <li>No other vitamin for me.</li>
            <li>and I actually had to have the outter retouched 3 weeks earlier than I normally do!</li>
            <li>I seen growth starting as early as two weeks!</li>
            <li>I had major hair growth before th 30 days were up.  </li>
            <li>About 6 months ago I had a major setback after having twists installed and today you would have no idea, partly because of additional help from these vitamins.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I see a major difference.  </li>
            <li>Before my hair was trying to recover from MAJOR damage.</li>
            <li>I am known as a product junkie, I have spent countless time and money on trying to find the right hair vitamins.</li>
            <li>My hair has grown so much and has gotten so full and thick since using these products!</li>
            <li>After a terrible flat ironing incident, I had to cut most of my beautiful hair off, reverting me back to big chop length.</li>
            <li>I started using this product with high hopes for my hair to be restored back to its former luster.  </li>
            <li>and these vitamins are pushing my new growth in nice and thick!!!</li>
            <li>I experienced bad breakage..</li>
            <li>4  years ago I decided to no longer relax my hair and focus on healthier hair practices and a healthier lifestyle in general.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was just an illusion because I as so desperate for healthy hair</li>
            <li>I am waiting until I complete this bottle to give my final review and decide whether I will continue to take this for three months as I did with harifinity.  </li>
            <li>Not going to complete this last bottle.</li>
            <li>and I barely saw any improvement, but with the Manetabolism pills my hair has grown a lot</li>
            <li>I have been natural for the last 10 years but did a big chop about 2 years ago and have been wearing my hair naturally curly.</li>
            <li>BARELY ANY shedding or anything.</li>
            <li>I noticed that the breakage that I used to have directly in the middle of my hair is gone.</li>
            <li>I have been incorporating these vitamins in my daily natural hair care for almost a year.</li>
            <li>Well guys, I have nearly finished my 3rd bottle!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cannot wait to take out my protective style next week and wear my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I have been natural for about 3yrs and just recently</li>
            <li>These were the second type of hair vitamins I took, anf by far the best!At</li>
            <li>that if the middle of her crown was still growing (like wild fire mind you) why can&#x27;t the rest of it?</li>
            <li>I have been natural since 7thgrade and last my 10th grade year I decided to uses these pills</li>
            <li>I have been natural for 2 years prior to using it</li>
            <li>but I could barely make it to 1.5 with taking these vitamins.</li>
            <li>I have recently began transitioning to my natural hair and this product has truly helped speed the process.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m near finishing my second bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m newly natural so my hair is still very short</li>
            <li>Not only is my natural hair growing</li>
            <li>I have been taking these vitamins for nearly a month now and have only missed one day</li>
            <li>I am currently on a natural hair journey and I am using protective hairstyles to grow my hair and the manetabolism vitamins are definitely showing results by growing out my protective hairstyles.</li>
            <li>This hadn&#x27;t been readily apparent to me until I started comparing pictures over this period of time.  </li>
            <li>As of last year I decided I wanted to make the transition to natural hair.</li>
            <li>Started taking the pills last month and I&#x27;ve been wowed with the length its grown; I had my braids redone four weeks ago and within a week the braids were slipping off because my hair was growing THAT fast!</li>
            <li>when normally after the twists are taken out it would eventually work its way back into the different textures.  </li>
            <li>it made mostly my edges thin out</li>
            <li>she was talking about this hair vitamins that you created that helped her hair grow long thick and healthy....</li>
            <li>I honestly have always felt it was a myth, and that results were always exaggerated and  I &#x27;m not one to subscribe to the &amp;#34;hype&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>My strands were no longer thin and stringy but healthy</li>
            <li>I now have thick have thick healthy hair with full edges after finishing my third bottle.</li>
            <li>When I first began taking them I had just gotten my braids (protective style) and within 2.5 weeks I had new growth, I ended up removing my braids because within 3.5 weeks it was ridiculous new growth.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend to anyone with dry brittle hair trying to get a healthier head of hair.</li>
            <li>my nails are long and hard and my face is smooth in clear!</li>
            <li>My nails have became extremely strong and the length of my hair is unbelievable in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>Of course I wash my face a lot, but no more than normal.im convinced that the vitamins are the reason my skin is clear right now.</li>
            <li>Im excited to see where I&#x27;ll be in the next few months with it!</li>
            <li>After hair infinity I didn&#x27;t want to try another hair growth pill, but after looking at all the pictures with significant hair growth it was hard Not to buy in.</li>
            <li>But if you are serious  about getting long healthy hair</li>
            <li>My edges werw finally growing back since I was pregnant, but then started falling out because a stylist braided my hair TOO TIGHT for this sew in</li>
            <li>the reviews here are very misleading be careful!</li>
            <li>As much as I didn&#x27;t want these pills to work (I just assumed they wouldn&#x27;t like other supplements)</li>
            <li>It is the real deal and not like the other hair vitaams that take 3 months to show that your hair has grown an inch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products to get real results</li>
            <li>I first started off taking regular Biotin pills from your local grocery store just to regain the length I once had, but I noticed a lot of side effects such as dry irritated skin on my face and bumps.</li>
            <li>I social media stalked before going forth and committing...</li>
            <li>type of thing and by monitoring the creators social media page with tons of reviews and pictures.</li>
            <li>I finished bottle number 2 and currently transitioning back to natural.</li>
            <li>the creator is a former Medical professional</li>
            <li>These are very easy to take and they don&#x27;t have a weird smell to them.</li>
            <li>I decided to take the plunge and 5 months later I have no regrets!</li>
            <li>At first I was a little skeptic about trying this product.  </li>
            <li>The first month, I gained a little over an inch of growth.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical about buying a hair product offline but being that I follow them on social media and saw that they had such great reviews I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Within just 3 months NO MORE IV, my hair has grown RIDICULOUSLY, I actually have nails that are worthy of a manicure</li>
            <li>barely grew , I even tried the &amp;#34;Inverse method&amp;#34; which is a claim that you can get your hair to grow an extra inch within a week.</li>
            <li>I was kind of skeptical because prior to purchasing these I was on a different hair vitamin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie, at first I was had a few doubts.</li>
            <li>The results are real and can&#x27;t wait to explore to the other products they offer !</li>
            <li>there BEAUTIFULLY healthy little CURLS sprouting through!!!!</li>
            <li>I also use some of their other products and HIGHLY recommend that you use their products.</li>
            <li>but after taking them for just a couple weeks my hair had grown a little more than half an inch!!</li>
            <li>My hair is so much thicker than it previously was before I started taking these vitamins.  </li>
            <li>A WHOLE INCH AND A HALF OF GROWTH.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t take them for an extended period of time because I decided to cut my hair but in the time that I did take them I noticed a lot less shedding, and my nails were and still are growing very</li>
            <li>I am natural and my bangs stretched was to the mid section of the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li>It was full in the front, back, and sides but because i was a braid fanatic, my edges and nape were always broken.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed how thick and full my hair is too, I had lost some hair around the front of my hairline and thought it would never grow back.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s growing my hair out extremely quickly and thick.</li>
            <li>For shiny thick and quick hair growth.  </li>
            <li>At first I was a little skeptical about taking these pills, but boy am I GLAD I ORDERED THEM.</li>
            <li>But with this last sew-in I received when I started taking these vitamins came a loose from the new growth and not be pulling my hair out in the back.</li>
            <li>The pills are a little large</li>
            <li>the past 7 months.&lt;br /&gt;Normally my hair growth is really slow to actually have it touch my shoulders is amazing.</li>
            <li>, my hair grows like crazy and I love it!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first because I wanted to notice results right away.  </li>
            <li>These pills paired with protective styling and various tips/tricks shared on social media by founder Courtney have taken my hair to the next level!</li>
            <li>I first started these vitamins after being so deficient in numerous vitamins and minerals that I had take several supplements intravenously (IV) for 6 months straight.</li>
            <li>and I do mean everything, such as JBCO, megatek mixes, oils, various deep conditioners and even other hair vitamins such as Hairfinity; but over the years nothing has helped my edges grow back as healthy as my hair is...</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that after taking them for two months my hair has thickened up and grew at least 2 inches(Yes!!!)</li>
            <li>Ive tried what feels like every vitamin for hair growth and was about to give up on the whole thing until I stumbled across these little gems of awesomeness.</li>
            <li>I had just recently did a large cut and was missing my length.</li>
            <li>A little over a year ago I started following the Mane Choice on IG but was very nervous to order.  </li>
            <li>My hair is half way down my back now and im back on track with quick hair growth finally.</li>
            <li>I had a lot of really bad breakage and had to get a good bit of my hair cut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very bold and dramatic when it comes to my hair, so for that I&#x27;m picky.</li>

            <li> and it makes my hair fell STRONg and HEALTHY !</li>
            <li> I experienced so much unimaginable shedding of hair from my head since taking them: hair on the floor, hair in the drain, hair on my clothes, hair practically falling out on wash day, hair falling on others!</li>
            <li> After my first bottle I saw great results.</li>
            <li> These vitamins are great, does exactly what it says on the bottle.</li>
            <li> I will certainly be ordering again once I am finished with this bottle!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is extraordinary!!</li>
            <li> I posted a picture of my growth on my social media site and people were really impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited that this is not JUST a vitamin for your hair, but chock full of stuff that great for your body as well.</li>
            <li> Those pills are just amazing, I had a huge issues with my hair loss and breakage.</li>
            <li> These work amazing for me, I use them for retention which is a huge problem for me.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product.  </li>
            <li> Most of the breakout is gone and they lasted for three days at the most.  </li>
            <li> was absolutely enjoyable</li>
            <li> its armpit length I love these vitamins.</li>
            <li> and you pay more on</li>
            <li> I cried a many of nights because  of it.</li>
            <li> And it threw my cycle off, but I&#x27;m  sure  </li>
            <li> LOve</li>
            <li> but my nails break more than they grow</li>
            <li> It has helped my hair grow a bit faster but most of all I see more baby hairs than anything.</li>
            <li> My friend from school got me on this product and I love it ...</li>
            <li> Im ordering more</li>
            <li> Better than the others I tried, like Hairfinity.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!Great product</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> and I saw better results.</li>
            <li> so I ordered 2 more bottles from amazon and to date</li>
            <li> In my opinion its better to see results then nothing at all.</li>
            <li> but I DID experience more thickness in my hair consistentlyconsistently over 40 days out a 60 Day supply...</li>
            <li> 1 biotin a day is better for length.</li>
            <li> I have used over the counter pills , nature made, that have produced better outcomes.</li>
            <li> I just love these vitamins.</li>
            <li> but I feel that the Manetabolism Healthy Hair Vitamins has helped to speed up the process.  </li>
            <li> better yet, a four month supply.</li>
            <li> We have never been more happier with the results and more satisfied with our appearance.</li>
            <li> Now, looking back from June 4th to June 29th my hair looked great!!</li>
            <li> These pills are awesome as simple as that!!!!</li>
            <li> I kept seeing the reviews for these pills all over my instagram and the hair growth was phenomenal like I couldn&#x27;t believe you in just one month you could gain all that hair growth.</li>

            <li> I find that I am really taking better care of my hair now more so than before.  </li>
            <li> I saw thickness first, it really got nice and full....then came the length!  </li>

            <li> Okay, so I can&#x27;t attest to hair growth right now, as I&#x27;m protective styling while taking my vitamins.</li>
            <li> it was so much thicker,  so strong,  and for someone who has grown up with eczema in the scalp ,I&#x27;ve never seen my hair so healthy and strong before.  </li>

            <li> Thanks MANETABOLISM!!!</li>
            <li> The packaging is secure and the vitamins have a unique smell, but not funky at all.</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic at first because I couldn&#x27;t understand how so many people were seeing such great results.</li>
            <li> I felt more energetic after taking these and knowing that its not just for my &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and my hair had grown tremendously and is so much healthier the best state is ever been even with gold hair care for two years and</li>
            <li> I started out using hairfinity and thought they were good until I was getting major migranes, acne and my hair was falling out in the handfuls.</li>
            <li> Delivery time was very fast and she often does free shipping promos!</li>
            <li> not only will it make your hair grow, but it makes your skin, and nails look AMAZING!</li>
            <li> The pills are big, but work amazingly!</li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t seen significant growth in my nails</li>
            <li> I love these vitamins I notice a change already  in my hair already and this is my first bottle</li>
            <li> I love this product and will definitely purchase more!</li>
            <li> I am so excited to try Manetabolism.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these vitamins since August and have noticed a significant amount of growth and  thickness in my hair.</li>
            <li> I originally tried this product b/c</li>
            <li> I see a significant difference in the volume of my hair, not just the length.</li>
            <li> I would just like to thank the maker for this smile that I have on my face and an air of confidence that I have never had before!</li>
            <li> The original reason I started taking these hair vitamins was because the nape of my hair seems to never grow.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown significantly as well as strengthened.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so excited.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these vitamins for almost three months and have seen a significant difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> The Manetabolism has become my &amp;#34;Mane&#x27;s Choice.&amp;#34; My hair has seen a significant change in growth as well as strength.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product, after originally using hairfinity for 4 month.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle in June and am very happy I did because since June my patch has grown back a whole five inches!</li>
            <li> I  saw rapid growth on the first bottle , so I ordered 3 more ,  </li>
            <li> oh boy, was I excited to visit the website.</li>
            <li> I originally thought I could give the pills to my daughter&#x27;s, asked the question on insyagram and got an immediate reply.</li>
            <li> For so many women our hair is included in our confidence so for women to feel like they can have that piece back that they thought was gone forever is such an amazing feeling!!!</li>
            <li> I have already gained an inch of hair and that is awesome for me because my hair usually grows 1/4- 1/2 inch a month.</li>
            <li> I was so excited</li>
            <li> I love these vitamins, I have noticed a change in length of my hair after the first bottle, my nails are stronger and longer.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much!</li>
            <li> Both me and my stylist (who also takes them) started to see a significant difference in the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> They are well worth the $25 bucks!</li>
            <li> I was so excited.</li>
            <li> Anyways excited to start my journey with the mane choice.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any side effects and it was worth the cost !</li>
            <li> I have also seen significant growth in between my protective styles.</li>
            <li> my eyebrows have grown which I&#x27;m so excited about</li>
            <li> pretty sure ita from these vitamins but no one else has mentioned...</li>
            <li> Everyone is unique</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 5th bottle and have noticed a significant amount of growth.</li>
            <li> I recommend buying its worth your money!</li>
            <li> Do you know how excited that has made me?</li>
            <li> so thought what have I got to lose (a little more hair lol).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ordering the product was fast&amp; easy, so was shipping!</li>
            <li> After my first bottle I had major growth and I am happy with my results.</li>
            <li> So many vendors are starting to post reviews on their own products.  </li>
            <li> lol seriously I am blown away by such awesome results !</li>
            <li> It is so amazing to have products that actually work for your hair type and smell absolutely fabulous!</li>
            <li> They are worth the investment and they are capsules and easy to swallow</li>
            <li> I am pleased to announce that i have fallen in love with  the results that i have seen thus far.</li>
            <li> I purchased a months supply of these vitamins and was pleasantly suprised the way it not only helped my hair to grow at a quicker rate than nomal but also strengthened my nails.</li>
            <li> My experience unlike most of the reviews here was not as positive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many positive reviews and everyone keeps asking me how?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently on my second bottle of these amazing vitamins and there the best thing ever made , when i was younger i had so much hair that my mother could not control</li>
            <li> I bought a two month supply directly from the manechoice website (much more cost effective that way)  and at the end of those 2 months I had over an inch of growth and healthy soft hair.</li>
            <li> Not only can I be a spokesperson for this GREAT vitamin on this amazing line of products but REAL people show REAL results EVERY DAY.  </li>
            <li> Purchased these pills for a specific reason and have received so many additional benefits, including healthy thick(er) hair, strong nails, and reduced shedding.</li>
            <li> I love them, and it will continue to buy them until my hair reaches a certain length.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to take special care of it since I bleached a spot in my head</li>
            <li> /&gt;Manetabolism is always having a special</li>
            <li> Certainly saw thickness changes but not insane growth like I&#x27;ve seen in photos.</li>
            <li> Make the right choice with the mane choice!</li>
            <li> These vitamins are my everything right now!</li>
            <li> but I hardly ever drink water and the results are wonderful.</li>
            <li> One of the positives is that I experienced absolutely no side effects.</li>
            <li> Ok I don&#x27;t really write comments or do surveys</li>
            <li> so I could have had this type of healthy hair my whole life.</li>
            <li> , i guess its true that sometimes you need to give pills 3 months to kick in</li>
            <li> I have two full bottles waiting to be taking</li>
            <li> I drank about 60 ounces of water a day, and took them with a full meal.</li>
            <li> Make sure you do your length checks these vitamins really work.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to take these pills for a full year</li>
            <li> I will recommend everybody who wants to grow their hair to make the hair healthy two bUy these pills because the work WONDERS</li>
            <li> Haha :)</li>
            <li> and I absolutely fell in love.</li>
            <li> I love these hair pills so much</li>
            <li> I love this  product so much.</li>
            <li> thanks a lot manechoice :)</li>
            <li> Also I haven&#x27;t had full edges since a fungus took them out years ago.</li>
            <li> Love this soo much.</li>
            <li> Like, when&#x27;s the last time the side effects were all good things.</li>
            <li> I had about a full inch of growth.</li>
            <li> But It really does boost your immune system to promote a healthy you all around inside and out.</li>
            <li> Not only the good skin outcome but</li>
            <li> It feels much thicker and fuller than before I have more confidence wearing my hair out.</li>
            <li> BTW my hair is relaxed and it worked just as effectively on my hair as it would natural hair.</li>
            <li> Find her on Instagram and see results from real people for yourself to ease your mind:)</li>
            <li> These vitamins make you want to take better care of your hair once you see how much progress you can get from them.</li>
            <li> I now have a ahead full of hair</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been taking them a full month</li>
            <li> I would do full sew-ins to get it to grow</li>
            <li> I love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It makes all the hair over our body grow faster and thicker, not a bad thing, but its definently there.</li>
            <li> Advertised with the pill was a beautiful woman with long, pretty hair.</li>
            <li> in mind however that these pills don&#x27;t only support the promotion of healthy hair growth, but also the growth of strong, sturdy fingernails!  </li>
            <li> I purchased my first bottle in July of 2014 and experienced a tremendous amount of growth in my hair and especially my nails.</li>
            <li> My hair grew so much within the first 30 days that I had to buy another supply!!!</li>
            <li> I liked that I had evidence and bragging right about my new vitamins.  </li>
            <li> but THICK AND HEALTHY !!!</li>
            <li> Anyway, I went a whole month on hairfinity and didn&#x27;t noticd much of a difference in my hair, though my skin looked pretty good.</li>
            <li> I am happy that it has not caused any headaches or stomach problems like other products.</li>
            <li> The owner is a sweetheart and has a great heart shes always helping other</li>
            <li> I experienced breakage due to chemicals  and heat damage.</li>
            <li> I stand behind this product completly and with this available, there is no reason we can&#x27;t all have beautiful, healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Since then, I haven&#x27;t experienced any other breakouts and I have been using this product for over two months now.</li>
            <li> I won a bottle of these amazing vitamins this past April on instagram, I was overjoyed because of so many great reviews that I had already seen on social media, so now it was my time to see what they would do for</li>
            <li> Long, strong, healthy hair is achievable w the ManeChoice Manetabolism vitamins!</li>
            <li> I saw so much thickness added to my hair after the first week, new growth was abundant!</li>
            <li> Give them try and see how  they work for your hair, who knows you  may be one of the lucky ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product you can actually see and feel the results I like this product better than hairfinity</li>

            <li> My boyfriend never stopped taking them and the bald spot on the crown of his head has resolved tremendously.</li>
            <li> I already have steady acne, but there was significantly more acne when I was taking these pills.</li>
            <li> To me healthy hair is worth so much you can have length</li>
            <li> , my nails grow sooo quickly.</li>
            <li> I received the reference for it through a friend and noticed results quickly (I&#x27;d say within a week).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard many reviews about different hair vitamins, but the one that stuck out most of Manetabolism, so I did my research and</li>

            <li> These vitamins have also made my nails grow quickly</li>

            <li> I was soooo happy to finally find a product that was not harsh on my system and delivered the benefits it</li>
            <li> but it was worth</li>
            <li> And you don&#x27;t have to be natural to use this product, Buy it :)</li>
            <li> I feel so way better wearing my natural hair out and not having to cover it up with braids and weaves.</li>
            <li> As far as hair I&#x27;ve been taking it for about 1 1/2 weeks so not too too sure yet.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m in love</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it will help at all, but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I experienced abnormal hair growth like new eyelashes growing sideways lol, my hair breaking midway from the root to the ends and where I could grab it and pull it out (extreme breakage) and some other wierd things</li>
            <li> Giving it 3 stars bc not sure about the hair growth too much but my skin looks amazing!!</li>
            <li> I have hereditary thinning of my edges and since taking Manetabolism while simultaneously using their 100% pure Castor Oil, I have seen a significant improvement in the growth of edges.</li>
            <li> I bought a 2 month supply and I experienced an inch an half of hair growth within the first month.</li>
            <li> No negative reaction at all!!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more excited to have my pre heat damage curls and length back.  </li>
            <li> It needs great healp due to stress breakage and too much heat.</li>
            <li> I had been following Courtney on IG for several months and loved how she transformed her hair and also watch her business with her husband grow from the ground up!</li>
            <li> Purchased a 4 month supply during the Labor Day sale so its been about 3 weeks that ive been taking them and people at work are complimenting me on clearer skin, and my nails are growing out so long and strong for the first time everrr!!!</li>
            <li> As I got older, I loved to cut my hair in bobs and then keep wanting my hair to grow back</li>
            <li> After consulting the manetabolism team (who are very customer friendly and interactive might I add)</li>
            <li> Just imagine the growth I would get if I would do it right.</li>
            <li> Your hair, nails and skin will be transformed right before your eyes.</li>
            <li> The Mane Choice is the right choice</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t sit there thinking about it, but instead be like Spike Lee and &amp;#34;Do The Right Thing.&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> my nails were strong and growing,  and i had an inch of new growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had short, brittle fingernails my ENTIRE life and they are growing beautifully.  </li>
            <li> Not only did my hair grow, but my nails became very strong.</li>
            <li> and I recommend it to anyone who wants to jump start a new healthy hair regimen.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the growth that I saw after using my first bottle and really look forward to using my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other hair vitamins that I have tried, I experienced no breakouts or no negative side effects</li>
            <li> For the first time in a looooooooooooooooooooooooong time I can wrap my hair at night with a smile and not wonder what it&#x27;s going to look like in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I had heard great things and seen success pictures about the Mane Choice products, but I didn&#x27;t personally &amp;#34;know&amp;#34; anyone that was actually taking the pills.  </li>
            <li> In the past, she experienced breakouts with *</li>
            <li> Long hair is nice, but nothing when you can see your scalp through your hair st</li>
            <li> I tried my first bottle of pills not to long ago and Love the results!</li>
            <li> Manetabolism is my new best friend and I cant wait to see how long my hair will be with the help of Mane Choice next year.  </li>
            <li> I had my hair colored right before opening my first bottle and after 2 weeks my color started growing out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone is different, another friend experienced the same results as me and others I know  </li>
            <li> I suffer from Alopecia and have had a great deal of hair loss in the middle region for the last 5.5 years.</li>
            <li> And the hype isn&#x27;t even enough - - this is a real and honest as it gets...</li>
            <li> I could not believe my hair had grown that much that quickly.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast and customer service swiftly responded to a question I had.</li>
            <li> I Purchased these vitamins a few months ago and they are the next best thing LITERALLY!!</li>
            <li> I big chopped in October of last year and while I was extremely happy with my haircut and the decision I had made, by December</li>
            <li> It has made my transistion to natural so easy.</li>
            <li> I only took a month supply but  that on the supply green my hair out and made it.thicker which is great for someone with then hair like mine!!</li>
            <li> and I can definitely tell you these are really worth trying wherever you are in the world :)</li>
            <li> all of those nights crying over the want for my original length was over!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is growing out very long full and healthy....</li>
            <li> It really does make your hair grow super fast!</li>
            <li> Also Courtney&#x27;s hair is AMAZING and very long through her use of the pills!</li>
            <li> I saw other natural hair people getting great results.</li>
            <li> so I am really excited when I take them out to see how much new growth I have.</li>
            <li> ok, SOOO I&#x27;m usually not the person to try new products for the body</li>
            <li> I am starting to drink more water to see if that will flush the product out of my system and alleviate the problem.  </li>
            <li> Again as with hairfinity, I did not see a difference in my hair the first month of taking the product.  </li>
            <li> The first month of trying out this product, there was not results, and</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d worn weave consistently for almost 9 years.</li>
            <li> love it starting to see some results</li>
            <li> Also my hair didn&#x27;t grow like it did the first I took the pills.</li>
            <li> I noticed that my hair didn&#x27;t shed as much and that its thicker than ever!</li>
            <li> Notice how most of the 5 star reviews are all from the same day?</li>
            <li> But, my nails grew stronger (not necessarily longer, but i was able to retain length) with these and my hair did gain some texture.</li>
            <li> My first month on the pills I had just started college</li>
            <li> My second month I cleaned up my diet and drank more water and non - sugary drinks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even finished with my first bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;naturalista&amp;#34;, but earlier this year i decided to color my hair and did one too many Dominican blow outs.</li>
            <li> Looking forward to receiving my next order so that I can continue on my healthy hair journey.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the mane choice hair vitamins to everyone!!</li>
            <li> Thanks Mane Choice!</li>
            <li> I first purchased these vitamins in the spring hoping to thicken my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and I love this pills..</li>
            <li> When she launched her business I simply wanted to support her because I love seeing people go after their dreams.</li>
            <li> I so wish I had found these when I first started losing my hair</li>
            <li> My hair grew a whole two inches in just one month!</li>
            <li> the first month my hair was thicker, stronger</li>
            <li> Thanks Manechoice!</li>
            <li> I only purchased 1 bottle as a trial, but I&#x27;ll be ordering 6 more on Friday.  </li>
            <li> Well the first hair growth pills I heard of were hairfinity</li>
            <li> You should definitely try this product I didn&#x27;t their was another out there and when doing some research I was able to run into this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle of Manetabolism and I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> These helped me fall back in love with my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love what these vitamins have done to the overall health of my hair.</li>
            <li> the first 6 months without it.</li>
            <li> My first two weeks my hair was growing my nails</li>
            <li> First this make you gain weight??</li>
            <li> They are very efficient!</li>
            <li> and i said i must have these , with my first bottle my edges thicken now there growing</li>
            <li> I first started off taking just biotin</li>
            <li> oh and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I suggest anyone interested give it a try.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these pills for various reasons.</li>
            <li> There are no side effects and you see results within the first week.</li>
            <li> My face seems to be clearing out, I thought it was an illusion at first</li>
            <li> I try to drink about 9 (8oz) or more glasses of water daily.</li>
            <li> I chose this product over Hair Infinity because it had better reviews for faster hair growth and fewer facial and scalp breakouts (according to my research).</li>
            <li> , I have had them before, but the first time I got just the one bottle from a friend</li>
            <li> I not only saw my hair getting thicker but growing out even more than I would without them.</li>
            <li> :) Not only does this pill make your hair grow, but it&#x27;s a multivitamin</li>
            <li> BUT with the help of these vitamins, I&#x27;ve noticed growth within my first month of using them.</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic at first.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to say the spots where the psoriasis took over are finally growing hair, I&#x27;m on my second bottle and the patches are pretty much gone</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t pretty</li>
            <li> First and foremost I would like to thank God because I truly believe that there was a reason I came across Courtney.</li>
            <li> Thanks manetabolism!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!</li>
            <li> and I have only used one bottle going to buy more again.</li>
            <li> #34;What do I have to lose?&amp;#34; I started seeing results within the first two weeks</li>
            <li> but after the first time I saw all the reviews on Amazon, Instagram, FaceBook, and even Twitter</li>
            <li> I am currently on my third bottle and I love these vitamins.</li>
            <li> First, Length Second&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> it only took 1 bottle and I&#x27;m in love....</li>
            <li> I finished my first months supply and noticed the growth after trying to go &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, let&#x27;s saaaay</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> I just bought two more bottles last night!</li>
            <li> I used to have to do imaginary hair flips, but now with the help of Manetabolism, I can hair flip on fees with my REAL HAIR!</li>
            <li> In about a month or my first bottle I seen results.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first but took a chance.</li>
            <li> Ive had sooooo much growth since i started talking them in April!</li>
            <li> Most people learn by trial and error; trying one thing after another, but that isn&#x27;t necessary with Manetabolism.</li>
            <li> The first 3 weeks I got 1&amp;#34; of growth.</li>
            <li> But, not only is my hair growing, it&#x27;s healthy.</li>
            <li> and my hair has grown so much !</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  </li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and have two more waiting for me.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to try the manetabolism, my mother used it first</li>
            <li> I first ordered these vitamins after suffering chemical damage.</li>
            <li> The creator Courtney &amp; her husband REALLY know what they are doing!</li>
            <li> but these are the real deal!</li>
            <li> At first I debated against either this brand or hair infinity</li>
            <li> Plus, the customer service is more like family then a third party company selling merchandise!!!!</li>
            <li> and it provides so much stretch and retention that I could just cry!</li>
            <li> I have used countless companies such as Hairfinity, phyto, natures best, Nixon, and only one that has worked for me is Mane Choice!</li>
            <li> I have been using them for about four months now and have notice my hair first getting thicker</li>
            <li> She even saw some change in length within the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> but as soon as I get back on my feet I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> first I just took Biotin</li>
            <li> Then I came across the mane choice at first</li>
            <li> and I am getting ready to order again soon since I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li> and I can absolutely say that this product works!  </li>
            <li> I was able to see my friend&#x27;s edges grow back and my hair gaining inches within a matter of a month.</li>
            <li> I am not big on leaving reviews on product&#x27;s unless I am sure they will work.</li>
            <li> And in the first 2 weeks I began to see results.</li>
            <li> Not only has my hair began to grow more but it has gotten thicker as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Mane Choice for 3 months now and have seen outstanding results not only for myself but also in my mother.</li>
            <li> When I first tried these vitamins I noticed a difference in my hair within 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s more than likely my fault.</li>
            <li> Her hair looked so healthy and had grown since the last time I saw her</li>
            <li> During the first month of taking the vitamins</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore them and will continue to use them!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a definite improvement in hair AND nails almost immediately (wherever you need the vitamins most).</li>
            <li> When I get the money, I will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> have helped out so much!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product and definitely adding it to my hair regimen.</li>
            <li> The first two weeks of me taking the vitamins..</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels overall more healthier..</li>
            <li> but these vitamins have made my hair grow within the first two weeks</li>
            <li> I love it and would definitely recommend it to others !</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens by the end of my first month, I will definitely order more bottles.</li>
            <li> really recommand these pills !</li>
            <li> even my hair dresser was like your hair is really trying to grow out!  </li>
            <li> Just purchased my first bottle off of eBay.</li>
            <li> The first picture it was just at my bra strap now</li>
            <li> This pill (just as everyone said) will most likely give you break outs.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant at first but after reading the reviews and researching the ingredients, I decided to give the product a try.  </li>
            <li> I will most definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> am writing this to make others aware that some of ingredients may cause you to have a reaction not to bash the maker of this vitamin.  </li>
            <li> My hair sheds a lot, I&#x27;m at the higher end of the numbers.</li>
            <li> I did not take them regularly but hope that when I purchase again I will see more results.</li>
            <li> These vitamins are truly a blessing for everyone who wants and needs their hair to grow!</li>
            <li> There are many vitamins out there that claim to do these things but the mane choice actually owns up to every thing they claim to be and claim to do!</li>
            <li> I am now comfortable wearing my natural hair out.</li>
            <li> My hair and nails have grown soo much since adding these pills to my regimen!</li>
            <li> I ordered my first 2-month supply of manetabolism during their 4th of July sale.</li>
            <li> I finished my first bottle as directed and saw a noticeable increase in hair growth AND manageability.</li>
            <li> I love these vitamins and plan on continuing to buy them in the future!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these pills!!</li>
            <li> If you are on a journey to healthy hair I definitely recommend these vitamins</li>
            <li> Will definitely be ordering more.  </li>
            <li> you first start the pills you&#x27;ll be amazed that your hair can grow 1/2&amp;#34; in two weeks.</li>
            <li> This is my first customer review on Amazon.</li>

            <li> I absolutely love these pills, my hair has grown back and its thicker then it has ever been!</li>
            <li> My cousin started taking these pills first</li>
            <li> I first started taking these the end of July and the first change I noticed was my hair  </li>
            <li> I first thought to use the product because I was getting a sew-in</li>
            <li> it really is a multivitamin as well!</li>
            <li> so I made that mane choice and switched over and have been taking these for 3 months and for the first time in my 22 years of living my nails are growing &amp; breaking .</li>
            <li> Thanks Courtney !</li>
            <li> Thank you so much Courtney and the Manechoice!</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue my healthy hair journey with manetabolism vitamins and mane choice hair care products</li>
            <li> is when I first came across The Mane Choice.</li>
            <li> My hair growth within the first month was almost 2ins.</li>
            <li> Im on month two and ready to see what this product can do for me in a year.!</li>
            <li> ordered my first bottle</li>
            <li> But the manetabolism pills did EXACTLY what they said they would do</li>
            <li> I tried Hairfinity first and broke out.</li>
            <li> After doing as drastic haircut, I&#x27;m ready for my hair to grow like weeds again!</li>
            <li> It really is the MANE choice!</li>
            <li> and I just finished my first bottle...</li>
            <li> I hear so much about this product!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this product to all of my family and friends who are interested in hair growth and retention.</li>
            <li> I have never seen my hair in such a healthy condition.</li>
            <li> Within the first 2 weeks I saw growth with my hair and my nails</li>
            <li> i must admit i was hesitate to try them at first.</li>
            <li> If you want healthy longer fuller hair you should definitely give these pills a try.</li>

            <li> On my second jar will be ordering more</li>
            <li> just finished my first bottle</li>
            <li> Thanks Mane Choice!</li>
            <li> but they either did not work at all or  made my face break out even with the consumption of more water daily as recommended.</li>
            <li> It is not an exact science and will not work for everybody.</li>
            <li> my hair does not like cooperating with me and ultimately breaks more.</li>
            <li> it provides but unfortunately not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done my first bottle and yesterday was the first time since I started them that I had my hair blown out and straightened since I started them.....</li>
            <li> and she loved it and let me try a few and within a week I began to see a change in my hair texture</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new and these are by far my favorite hair supplements.</li>
            <li> and wow!!!!</li>
            <li> Wow!!!!</li>
            <li> wow!!!!</li>
            <li> This all natural hair formula has a unique blend of ingredients necessary for the healthy head of hair</li>
            <li> But This Manetabolism is the real deal right here...</li>
            <li> I have had such positive results that I am about to order me 2 more bottles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a major change in the texture of my hair and although I keep my hair in a high puff, I&#x27;m still able to see that it&#x27;s growing.</li>
            <li> now embrace my natural ethnic coils and absolutely just love what manetabolism is doing for my hair,  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> And best of all, no side effects other than increased energy due to the B12 in these!</li>
            <li> Also, I did NOT have any breakouts with taking these &amp; my nails grew ridiculously long as well &amp; super strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve order other popular hair vitiamis</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Manetabolism to anyone interested in growing out bald spots or hair!</li>
            <li> I had no negative side effects at all!!</li>
            <li> First off I must start by saying I am an overseas customer(meaning that getting the right product is paramount because of shipping prices etc) and had been reading reviews, watching videos and looking at transformation photo&#x27;s since March and one of my closest friends decided to try your product in June and saw a decent amount of change...</li>
            <li> I am currently transitioning from relaxed to natural and the thickness and growth I have received is amazing.  </li>
            <li> so far I&#x27;m loving this product and it only been a month yessssss</li>
            <li> I love healthy thick hair</li>
            <li> Not only is it growing like a weed but its soooo thick and beautiful !</li>
            <li> 4months late still taking them and my hair is longer , thicker, and most importantly healthier and the icing on the cake is my skin , nails and eyelashes have also improved!</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I already ordered next month&#x27;s supply!</li>
            <li> I have finally reached ultimate happiness.</li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend this product to any and everyone who is natural, relaxed, or transitioning that wants the solution to healthy hair!</li>
            <li> hair normally grew half inch per month but for the 30 days that I took the vitamins; my hair grew an inch which was the first for me, my nails also grew very rapidly and were very strong!</li>
            <li> That bright yellow secretion meant that something I was taking wasn&#x27;t absorbing properly, and my body had to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> I tried the first 30 day supply just to see how much growth would be added to my hair and it truly works</li>
            <li> i am so happy i found them due to following the owner&#x27;s IG page, Courtney!</li>
            <li> and there my nails are growing long toooo better</li>
            <li> to use this for my journey to long &amp; healthy hair</li>
            <li> I should have gotten more than a month supply because I know I will be using for a long time.</li>
            <li> Of course it works for everyone differently and alternate paces, but for me it has been great so far.</li>
            <li> I purchased the two month supply pretty much on a &amp;#34;he</li>
            <li> Just started my first bottle today, ready to see my progress...</li>
            <li> My nails started to grow pretty fast and my hair grew about an inch.</li>
            <li> but when I heard about manetabolism I got excited it has grown my natural hair out and made my transition much easier</li>
            <li> My hair grows pretty fast</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even used up my first month&#x27;s supply and my hair has already grown so much.</li>
            <li> I did another BC in September 2013 and have been dying for my hair to be long and healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things &amp; their customer testimonials are unbelievable.</li>
            <li> This Product Has Made them Completely Grow In Full.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered my first bottle (on the official site) and my order came SUPER FAST!!</li>
            <li> I started using HAIRFINITY last year it worked perfectly fine for the first 3 months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never met her personally, but if you follow her on social networks it&#x27;s very obvious of how beautiful her spirit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost certain that you will have a positive and productive experience.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative side effects and I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> then I heard about manetabolism but wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to lose more money, because the other products said the same thing.</li>
            <li> I live in the uk and pay shipping fees to receive all the mane choice products, because it&#x27;s 100% worth it.</li>
            <li> The most amazing thing was I had just colored my hair and by August I had 1 1/2 of new growth, which means my roots were back dark again.</li>
            <li> I have been using manetabolism for less than a month I have already received amazing results.  </li>
            <li> I personally think Hair skin and nails (easy pickup at the store)</li>
            <li> My nails use to be super soft and it took everything to keep them from breaking</li>
            <li> but it was ok because of the growth I had gotten from the vitamins my hair stopped shedding clumps and was back to normal</li>
            <li> I find the pills are quiet easy to swallow, I take the recommended two pills together in the morning and drink plenty of water through out the day.</li>
            <li> So, if your serious about growing your hair and making good life choices, this will most likely help.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t want to break out because my skin is super sensitive</li>
            <li> They may not have hundreds of celebrity ambassadors saying \\&quot;get long healthy hair like mine\\&quot; (as they wear 24 inch Brazilian straight) misleading the consumer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thicker and has definitely grown a lot more than it normally grows in this time frame.  </li>
            <li> The pills are easy to swallow definitely a +</li>
            <li> Most importantly along with a structured routine and taking the pills, in my first month I retained 1inch of growth and my shedding has decreased tremendously.</li>
            <li> but I was told that The Mane Choice is a more natural brand which uses more natural and organic products then the other leading brands.</li>
            <li> so I am probably one of thoses persons who just cannot handle large amounts of biotin in my system</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think they would work for me because I am anemic,but I started taking these,and of course I realized if I can take 2 hair vitamins,I could certainly take my iron pills also.</li>
            <li> They were too large for me to swallow</li>
            <li> I been taking them since March becase I wanted my hair to be a certain length for my wedding in July.</li>
            <li> For a person who has a oily skin type I&#x27;m hesitate to use certain hair pills because I fear the biotin in the pill will break me out</li>
            <li> My friend who is having great results with her hair,  manetabolism had no affect on her nails,  her nails are still weak, go figure?</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative side effects!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used hair vitamins in the past but these are by far the best, I&#x27;ve actually seen results.  </li>
            <li> lol I had previously taken Hairfinity and it not only broke my son out</li>
            <li> Before I was skeptical, a month trial quickly turned into 4 months and I&#x27;m so happy I made the mane choice.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and does wonders for my hair which always seems to be extra dry.</li>
            <li> The capsules themselves are a pretty decent size, not horse pills.</li>
            <li> Within the first month I got about an inch of growth, and steady growth has continued.</li>
            <li> The Mane Choice is the Main Choice !</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy, strong and the length is unbelievable!</li>
            <li> lol before taking these pills, my hair grew very slowly.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who wants to grown long, healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hardly ever consistent when taking vitamins of any kind, and when taking these I may have missed a dose or two, sometimes even missed a whole day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to continue to take it because I started washing my face with a new acne treatment called Clean and Clear Advantage.</li>
            <li> These pills are amazing, I&#x27;m three days away from starting my third bottle.</li>
            <li> And if that&#x27;s not enough, go to the Mane Choice&#x27;s website or Instagram for a number of amazing personal testimonies.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really rate it, just started taking it</li>
            <li> I do not have as much shedding as before taking Manetabolism.  </li>
            <li> Hair is growing fast</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like manetabolism</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing these from the actual website since shipping was free</li>
            <li> This really upset me</li>
            <li> so I didnt get that much breakouts.</li>
            <li> I literally can&#x27;t express how much these vitamins have helped my life.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping will buy again</li>
            <li> I feel as though those who claim to have success with it are under a sort of placebo effect because I am seeing no difference at all in time it takes to regrow or the health of it compared to natural growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 instead because it made me break out no matter how much water I drank.</li>
            <li> Thank You so much</li>
            <li> The delivery was too fast ..</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about the product since I just started taking it for a week.</li>
            <li> I believe this product really does work.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get ravaging growth, but it did jump start my growth because before I started I was getting absolutely none.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do measurements because I really bought it for shedding.</li>
            <li> , I really don&#x27;t seed any advantange.</li>
            <li> but I really need to do this one.</li>
            <li> but the breakouts are too much.</li>
            <li> These really work, my hair is much thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot I was expecting it on August 6</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for creating a product that grants faith and confidence in your customers.</li>
            <li> This product is the BOMB, it really really works.</li>
            <li> (REALLY)</li>
            <li> this product has made my skin much healthier</li>
            <li> not so much for the style.&lt;br /&gt;By</li>
            <li> Thanks The Mane Choice</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed how my nails were growing much longer than they had before, and I&#x27;m a nail biter.</li>
            <li> Thanks Mane Choice.</li>
            <li> It made it so much thicker</li>
            <li> And the nail bed was so much stronger that I couldn&#x27;t trim my nails.</li>
            <li> i recommend them to anyone who wants healthier hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve achieved so much growth since taking them.  </li>
            <li> My husband noticed how much and how fast my hair has grown</li>
            <li> They did not taste very well, but probably because they&#x27;re intended to be taken that way.</li>
            <li> and then I am going to cut away all the relaxer and start a fresh with natural hair and keep taking the vitamins.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very grateful.</li>
            <li> They gave me so much hope for my hair.</li>
            <li> And these vitamins helped so much.</li>
            <li> And it feels and looks so much healthier now.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever remember my hair growing this fast and lets not talk about nails.  </li>
            <li> My nails are growing so fast</li>
            <li> My nails are growing so fast</li>
            <li> I will be ordering a 3 month supply very soon.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to try the line as  whole as their prices are very reliable as well.</li>
            <li> I was very cautious about trying a hair vitamin.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering my 6 month order of vitamins very soon.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing so fast</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> But these pills really work</li>
            <li> Well, after taking these supplements (I bought the 60 day supply), I noticed that my puff was poofier after my 30 day bottle was empty. :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also much thicker.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I used my sister as a Guinea pig for these pills and it really works .</li>
            <li> and so so much healthier feeling.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, ladies you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> , however I do have extremely high hopes!</li>
            <li> Thanks to The Mane Choice hair vitamins, I have now reached Bra strap length in a 2 years span.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have so much energy when I take these vitamins.</li>
            <li> In addition, I truly believe that my body is absorbing all of the nutrients in these pills.</li>
            <li> The mane choice is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> I really do enjoy this product because it actually works.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in all that my hair need to be taking out just after three weeks because it&#x27;s growing so fast.</li>
            <li> The shipping was incredibly fast</li>
            <li> Although I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in length (yet) my hair is so much thicker and healthier and that ls</li>
            <li> but it has made it so much healthier.</li>
            <li> Before I brought the vitamins I read the reviews on here and compared it to hairfinity and didnt really like what I heard about hairfinity causing break outs.</li>
            <li> Thanks Courtney you inspire me.&lt;br /&gt;Follow my HHJ on Instagram</li>
            <li> The Manetabolism Vitamins have given my hair so much shine and thickness.</li>

            <li> but it&#x27;s almost there all thanks to the mane choice manetabolism pills.</li>
            <li> After continuing with these vitamins I saw the real difference.</li>

            <li> Very thankful to have found these pills.</li>
            <li> and I had to get my braids redone very often to keep up with the growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This fact alone really made me eager to try them since their effiency is backed by science.</li>
            <li> I began using the vitamins with Senegalese twist, and they grew out so fast.</li>
            <li> I even got my sister to buy them and she loves them as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>

            <li> I was embarrassed to wear my real hair.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my hair has grown in much thicker and fuller.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these vitamins for four months now and they are the real deal.</li>
            <li> Tried 2 bottles of these and just absolutely loveeed it.</li>

            <li> I cried for a week straight because my hair was then shoulder length.</li>
            <li> One person said their hair grew so fast they stopped taking them because they were wearing braids</li>
            <li> This product made my hair soo much stronger and shinier.</li>
            <li> , my edges had filled completely back in, in just SIXTEEN (16) days!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Since starting these pills, the spot has filled in and my weaker spots are also growing too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only have I noticed substantial growth/length retention in my hair since taking them (about 4 total inches), but the manageability of my unprocessed natural hair has improved greatly!  </li>
            <li> I decided to give it a shot, and these vitamins really work.</li>
            <li> I been using them now for 6 months &amp; my hair has grown so much.</li>
            <li> I really hope it works.</li>
            <li> I have been taking it for 3 months straight</li>
            <li> , these vitamins really grew out my hair</li>
            <li> Hey are much much cheaper on the website.</li>
            <li> and I decided to go with the Mane Choice because they had real people giving real reviews and not a lot of celebrity spokesman.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t see much progress</li>
            <li> This is my 5th bottle and i have seen so much growth and thickness in my hair.</li>
            <li> After takin Manetabolism my hair grew soooooo much thicker, stronger and healthier.</li>
            <li> However, I found my hair not to be growing much.</li>
            <li> Thanks manechoice</li>
            <li> My nails have also grown so much and they are stronger.</li>
            <li> and I think these pills are responsible for it since I don&#x27;t do or take anything else.</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with shipping when I ordered and received very promptly.</li>
            <li> These pills really do promotes growth and you will start to see growth within a week</li>
            <li> I really could not afford it.</li>
            <li> It really is living up to all the hype.</li>
            <li> These pills really work.</li>
            <li> They contain wayyyyy to much vitamin A</li>
            <li> I will be ordering more in the near future.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say hair is starting to fill back in...</li>
            <li> I tried another brand for about 3 months and saw results slowly, but I decided to switch over to this brand because of Courtney&#x27;s own success with her products.</li>
            <li> After cutting my hair into a bob, I saw so much new growth in such a short time, it honestly seemed too good to be true, clearly it wasn&#x27;t :) &amp; the BONUS is, that there are NO side effects.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done with the first bottle and ready I&#x27;ve noticed my hair has gotten thicker,especially around the edges and has plenty of new growth.</li>
            <li> All I can say is WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Manetabolism for three months now, and wow!!!</li>
            <li> I started June 28th, right after receiving a fresh relaxer earlier than month.  </li>
            <li> and I first noticed less shedding and more length retention.</li>
            <li> I could tell exactly where the new hair was growing in and</li>
            <li> The cost of this product is worth more than buying packages after packages of other creams or hair &amp;#34;vitamins&amp;#34; when this right here is the key!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken other hair skin &amp; nail pills, and when I did my urine would often be a bright yellow</li>
            <li> We are ready for our third month supply and excited to continue on with our journey.</li>
            <li> My hair never stops growing now, my nails are so strong and long</li>
            <li> I really recommend The Mane Choice brand, especially if your natural and want your hair to grow back healthy and full.</li>
            <li> Although considered &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; by most standards (mid-back length), the hair around my temples has always been much shorter and thinner than the other hair on my head.  </li>
            <li> I bought a two month supply of these pills from the original website ( I came to Amazon to see if I can get my next supply cheaper, and I can&#x27;t)</li>
            <li> questions: no, I didn&#x27;t break out, and no, hair does not grow more in other places.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other supplements with no results.</li>
            <li> This has more of the ingredients i need for hair/skin/nail nourishment and seems to be working quicker than the other pills.  </li>
            <li> So excited to start this one since My hair and body has responsed so well to the regular pills.   </li>
            <li> My hair which was once stunted in growth and thinning at the crown has shown a significant amount of improvement overall.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other hair supplements ( Hairfinty, biotin, hair skin and nails)</li>
            <li> We all need vitamins in our daily lives and Courtney has come up with a unique formula that works wonders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken about three months supply, one month between each bottle and my hair has significantly grown 3 extra inches.</li>
            <li> I noticed a significant amount of growth within weeks of starting my regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a major improvement in my hair&#x27;s overall health:)</li>
            <li> I received my hair vitamins last week and I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
            <li> I tried the other hair growth pills (I won&#x27;t use the name, to protect the innocent, but the initials are H.F.)</li>
            <li> I love this product and the other products from this line.</li>
            <li> Overall, it has done what it says and I am not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to order more and the other products.</li>
            <li> Its the best on allllll types of hair trust and believe from a woman that has tired everything! !</li>
            <li> I am so excited to have not only myself</li>
            <li> I have recommended these pills to two other family members and they love them as well.</li>
            <li> I have try many other hair vitamins</li>
            <li> Formulated by people within a medical field these vitamins have the right proportion of everything you need to have healthy, long, luscious hair with no adverse side effects.</li>
            <li> lol usually, my hair grows back at a &amp;#34;regular pace&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> When I decided to go natural it was all because I saw everyone else&#x27;s pictures with long healthy hair</li>
            <li> My hair has had remarkable growth, no more shedding!!  </li>
            <li> I just recently started my transition from relaxed to natural and it hasn&#x27;t been easy</li>
            <li> My point is that if I&#x27;m seeing this kind of growth with my current diet, I can only imagine my results if I actually ate (and drank) right.</li>
            <li> I will be continuing taking these pills as long as they are available.</li>
            <li> @Courtney thank you for sharing such greatness with the world, especially me as I am on a mission for long healthy natural hair :)</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS GROWING MUCH FASTER than it normally would; thicker as well.</li>
            <li> Love these vitamins they have helped me so much can&#x27;t wait to start back up on them as soon as possible</li>
            <li> My hair was always full in the middle.</li>
            <li> I had that&#x27;s had no hair growth is starting full in.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of new growth!</li>
            <li> I had so much new growth packed on top of each other.</li>
            <li> I live by this!</li>
            <li> &amp; don&#x27;t get me started on the new growth !</li>
            <li> and you could notice all the new growth !&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the vitamins for 3 months now and have over 6 inches of new growth!</li>
            <li> A month after my texlax, my new growth looked much closer to 3 months post.</li>
            <li> Less shedding, more growth, thickness, and shine.</li>
            <li> Zinc and iron worked out much better for a lot less cheaper.</li>
            <li> I purchased these pills with hopes of quick regrowth after shaving bald for the army back in 2012.</li>
            <li> There are no ingredients listed on the main Amazon page.</li>
            <li> and my hair is STILL growing :) I&#x27;m on my second bottle and about to put in my third order....</li>
            <li> Plus, the vitamins made me super nauseous, daily.</li>
            <li> Purchased these pills for the first last month and my hair has gotta thicker and looks much healthier!</li>
            <li> I love how it not only promotes hair growth but also improves your hairs overall health!</li>
            <li> I purchased my first two month supply of the manetabolism back when Courtney first started selling them.</li>
            <li> but my edges were particularly none existent and I needed a breakthrough..</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s saying something because I&#x27;m usually quite the skeptic about so-called &amp;#34;mystical magical hair growth pills&amp;#34; but this stuff really is the truth!</li>
            <li> Mane Choice is made by a African American woman and just looking at the reviews they are 100% better.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been taking the Mane Choice supplements, not only have I experience no side effects, but I&#x27;m more concerned in the overall HEALTH of my hair, not just inches.</li>
            <li> Manetabolism gave me a steady inch per month.</li>
            <li> I always had problems with my edges due to perming and tight hair styles, but I can see great results already.</li>
            <li> the first day I took these pills I got major pimples!</li>
            <li> It only happened around my monthly time slightly more than usual, but nothing huge.</li>
            <li> and I only saw growth the very first month.</li>
            <li> My nails are so long and strong and my family have been going on and on about how clear my skin is.</li>
            <li> After taking these pills my hair is so much thicker, fuller, and never dry or brittle and this happened within the first week.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these vitamins.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend you try this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend EVERYBODY to order these vitamins.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product .</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it,</li>
            <li> Highly recommended hair care products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from hair loss or feel as though your hair is not growing I would highly recommend trying these vitamins!&lt;br /&gt;-Mimi C.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these vitamins and have not had any issues of breakouts at all.</li>
            <li> Not only is my hair healthier than it has ever been, but I also see other amazing benefits.</li>
            <li> Amazing product only got A one month supply due that I&#x27;m moving from FL to NJ</li>
            <li> If you start to break out &amp; you know you need a clear face by a certain date all I gotta say is don&#x27;t take the pills.</li>
            <li> my hair is filing in and I see new growth more often than the previous hair pills I was taking.</li>
            <li> If you are reading this, just because I gave it 3 stars, does not mean it will not work for you...</li>
            <li> After thirty days, I thought I needed a little more time</li>
            <li> however I did not see many results, my hair was a little thicker, but not what I imagined to achieve.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month and the results are astonishing.  </li>
            <li> Ran out of pills 2 days ago and ordered a new bottle to my surprise I got the NEW ONE!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been real sensitive about my edges but after taking these and</li>
            <li> This is a genuine review and I would not even bother reviewing if the results were not real.</li>
            <li> I cut all my hair off to start over natural and these vitamins have really helped grow my hair out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical reading all those great reviews dated September 22 seems suspect to me</li>
            <li> After much research I found out about Hair finity and decided to give them a try, I took these vitamins from September until early this year.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I love these vitamins\\&quot;,  not only can my friends notice how long my hair is getting.</li>
            <li> I buy my pills from a local retailer but they are definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> but I wasted more results.</li>
            <li> I ordered my vitamins last Sunday and they were delivered on Friday which was exciting.</li>
            <li> I am hoping for success with my bald spots in the middle of my head.</li>
            <li> No negative side effects for me either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually able to keep extensions for at least a month but after using these I have to keep re doing my hair because that&#x27;s how much growth I have!</li>
            <li> I just recently started to really take care of my hair and taking these for the first two months my hair is thicker and my lenght is now bra strap length.</li>
            <li> The pills are about the size of a normal multivitamin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t take them daily as I should, but I did take two a day, and now my hair is so healthy and it&#x27;s growing so long.</li>
            <li> Finally bought 60 days worth of the mane choice vitamins.</li>
            <li> Also, my skin looks brighter (all over) and my nails have grown faster than normal.</li>
            <li> So I went ahead and purchase two more bottles, along with the butter and the green tea conditioner</li>
            <li> I normally would go threw months with my protective style( a sew in)</li>
            <li> These pills definitely are worth the price.</li>
            <li> Love the product have it for a few days can see the grow on my edges will recommend to friends and family</li>
            <li> I normally take energy pills to get me started my day</li>
            <li> (My hair grew at normal rate).</li>
            <li> Normal hair growth for me is .5 of an inch.</li>
            <li> overall i think its worth it</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t do reviews but for this product I had to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s for all hair types and backgrounds, some people assume its only for female afro-centric hair types from their reviews and photos, but I am a caucasian male with ultra-fine hair, it wasn&#x27;t budging in length for months, I started taking this in february, and by may I have grown 4.5 inches of thick, strong tresses, which is remarkable because hair growth is averaged out at 1/2 and inch a month.</li>
            <li> in all, I would highly recommend this product to anyone tired of stagnant hair growth and ready to experience the type of healthy hair and length retention you never thought you could achieve before!</li>
            <li> Astonishing my hair grew a inch in a half!</li>
            <li> I saved up money to buy my first bottle, and in the month that I used it up, my hair had grown more than it has been the past 6 years!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 years old and lost a patch of hair when I was pregnant back in may</li>
            <li> pic on the left was Thanksgiving and the pic on the right was October.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I began taking the vitamins right around March or April (despite ordering them earlier in the year).</li>
            <li> but I wanted to give my hair an extra boost and this was the right product to do so.</li>
            <li> I would get it right above neck length</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle right now</li>
            <li> remember the time in which it takes your hair to grow back is not important, what&#x27;s important is your hair growing!!</li>
            <li> Great product with fast results took one bottle of pills and noticed results in hair and nail growth I will order a longer supply to track the results better you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I already have thick hair, but my hair has become much thicker and since being natural for over a year, I am finally able to see my natural curl pattern!!!</li>
            <li> so they&#x27;ll slide down easily.</li>
            <li> There were no annoying side effects like some other vitamins.</li>
            <li> I take customer service very seriously and hands down, The Mane Choice has some of the BEST customer service around!</li>
            <li> and I have not noticed ANY new growth.</li>
            <li> and I always know when I have new growth because of the difference of textures</li>
            <li> and I have new growth jumping out my roots.</li>
            <li> I thought this was something I just had to live with.  </li>
            <li> and i have so much new growth.</li>
            <li> but I can insure you that I see the new growth I can&#x27;t wait to see my progression sn:</li>

            <li> and I noticed new growth.</li>
            <li> These vitamins make my new growth feel thicker.</li>
            <li> These Pills have worked wonders for me, I Live in Canada</li>
            <li> I new</li>
            <li> This has become my new addition.  </li>
            <li> I had a sew in and its def time to take it out with this new growth.  </li>
            <li> but soon has I get my new address</li>
            <li> but now I have up to 2 inches of new growth.</li>
            <li> I immediately started my new bottle</li>
            <li> And just 3 weeks in, I have about 1/2 to an inch of new growth already.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait until my new shipment arrives.</li>
            <li> After a week I already see new growth .</li>
            <li> will be a new experience...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find products that really help your hair grow and stay healthy.</li>
            <li> my nails were amazing , my hair is now on my back  in just a few months , I will forever take  my mane choice pills ..</li>
            <li> Also, my nails are much stronger, my edges are fuller and my hair has grown so much in places where it was really short.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I didnt pay much attention to how fast my hair was growing until I started my second month.</li>
            <li> I really recommend these pills to anyone looking to grow thick, healthy, longer hair.</li>
            <li> I made the the choice after much review and seeing real results from people who had only used the manetabolism for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone transitioning to natural hair, or if you just want length.  </li>
            <li> I stopped taking them because my braids started to look bad because my hair was growing so much, which is a good thing!</li>
            <li> my skin remains clear and I have not had a headache once!  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it consistently but can definitely see fullness and growth</li>
            <li> First it was generic brands, then hairfinity.</li>
            <li> I started taken them may 29th,and the first month, I didn&#x27;t see ANY results, so I thought maybe I should try a second bottle,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s a hair bump because not to take anything away from the pills because I did notice I was shaving more often than usual</li>
            <li> The Mane Choice vitamins are the first to actually show results.</li>
            <li> Within the first 2 weeks I noticed NOT ONLY 1 inch of hair growth, but I had stronger nail growth, and longer lashes.</li>
            <li> First thickness throughout my entire head now</li>
            <li> After taking these vitamins it gave me courage to go through with the big chop to finally get my hair back in healthy shape.</li>
            <li> and I am willing to try this product to see the same result!!</li>
            <li> I bought these pills for the first time back in June.</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered the pill I used it for 2weeks and notice that my sides started to grow back</li>
            <li> At first I was worried about taking these pills because I was worried about possible side effects or that the pills just won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Before finishing my first bottle, I noticed growth not only in my hair but my nails as well.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning to natural and The Mane Choice is making the process a breeze!</li>
            <li> I tried Manetabteolism last year, but will admit that I did not use it consistently.</li>
            <li> but my nails also grew like wild flowers!</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow!.</li>
            <li> My mom had been trying to grow her hair for a while and, following @courtneynaturalhair on Instagram and seeing raves &amp; raves about them, I decided to try them for myself first.</li>
            <li> I started wearing box braids and started taking my first vitamin on the same day.</li>
            <li> I noticed after my first bottle that my hair was definitely thicker, longer &amp; stronger!</li>
            <li> Keep those razors sharp and that wax fresh!).</li>
            <li> and I was still taking the pills with 0 break outs :) my hair is almost past my breast</li>
            <li> Ive also had my edges to start coming back in, and we all know the edge struggle is REAL!</li>
            <li> Definitely noticed results the first month.  </li>
            <li> When i first started I got results from only 1 week of use!</li>
            <li> Because it causes bald spots on the scalp, especially in the first stages, it is sometimes called spot baldness.</li>
            <li> You will definitely see results in the first month.</li>
            <li> I am recently finished my first bottle of Manetabolism Hair Vitamins</li>
            <li> I now have my other sister and my boyfriend taking this pills and excited about the growth.</li>
            <li> A downside to me would be the fact that I like to keep my nails naturally short, and I have to cut them more frequently due to the growth I&#x27;m experiencing with the vitamins.</li>
            <li> I only been using the pills for 2 months now, and I swear within the first 2 weeks I saw changes in my hair.</li>
            <li> I was initially hesitant about buying this product because I was sure it wasn&#x27;t going to work but after reading other reviews and people&#x27;s successes, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I am so pleasantly surprised by the results after just 3 bottle of this product!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s most definitely past it.</li>
            <li> Unlike the other vitamins The Mane Choice not only increases growth rate in length but it also thickens and promotes retention which is just as important as growth!</li>
            <li> First, I did notice some growth in the length of my hair but it has only been 30 days.</li>
            <li> I decided to transition from relaxed to natural an decided to give manetabolism a try!</li>
            <li> also I was nervous at first to take the pills just because of possible side effects</li>
            <li> My hair was falling out in the back due to lack of moisture and too many relaxers.</li>
            <li> My natural hair loves them &amp; I do too!</li>
            <li> I believe not only do you have to take the pills consistently</li>
            <li> I still have some breakage, so I&#x27;m hoping that if I continue with this, it will completely go away!</li>
            <li> After I finished my first bottle, I orders my second!</li>
            <li> I will continue on with the #manesociety because thus far this product is a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> The first month I took these, I did experience some break out on my face during the second week.</li>
            <li> But a true testament that these work is because I suffer with anxiety,something that I have been dealing with since I joined the military in 2007-2011 and still suffered with.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product especially to new natural hair virgins.</li>
            <li> My skin also looks amazing and my nails are very strong and long, people always think they are fake!</li>
            <li> I ordered a 2 month supply &amp; by 3 weeks I noticed a major difference!!!</li>
            <li> To be honest, I was a little hesitant to spend my money on them, (I&#x27;ve tried other vitamins, but didn&#x27;t really get the results that I wanted)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no break outs of the skin, your hair grows thicker , your edges grow thick and strong not to mention the shine it gives my hair !</li>
            <li> I am extremely please with my purchase and will definitely be purchasing more before this bottle is complete.</li>
            <li> I have been transitioning to  natural (still new to me) and disovered the mane choice</li>
            <li> My new growth was sooo lush.</li>
            <li> I also tried hair infinity which only showed normal growth compared to The Mane Choice!!</li>
            <li> I heard about this product on social media and decided to see if the hype was real.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d advise women to be super careful with who they let braid their hair</li>
            <li> I started following Courtney on YouTube and her spirit was so sweet that I started following her on Instagram.</li>
            <li> At the end of my first month of the product I removed the sew in and noticed my edges COMPLETELY grew back in.</li>
            <li> and i can only say positive things.</li>
            <li> So i ordered more this time I give my mom a bottle from a little girl my mom only had hair in the middle of her hair and after one month of the mane choice my mom sides and nape area grew hair for the first time in her life.</li>
            <li> However, with Manetabolism my hair is full and doesn&#x27;t have extreme breakage anymore.</li>
            <li> within the first two weeks of taking them I seen a nice amount of growth I would recommend these my edges are also really thin from year of pulling when I was younger</li>
            <li> I do however see a lot of growth and my hair definitely feels a lot healthier (stronger, less breakage, and more elasticity).</li>
            <li> I have less breakage which leads to more growth and overall health hair.</li>
            <li> As a broke college student, most of my budget goes to ramen noodles and textbooks, but at only about $30 a month (less if you catch a discount sale on their instagram @themanechoice)</li>
            <li> I am excited to try all other products!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m well past excited to get them again!</li>
            <li> I recently just cut my hair &amp;am excited to see how long my hair grows.</li>
            <li> My edges are fuller and from the looks of my new growth my hair is definitely growing in thicker and faster than my normal hair growth rate!</li>
            <li> My edges broke because of gettin my weave so tight and almost everything grew back so Im satisfied</li>
            <li> After doing a big chop I started my hair journey with main choice and it has done my hair justice !</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely damaged from a quick weave with glue.</li>
            <li> Not only have i noticed significant hair growth, i have also noticed less shedding when I wash my hair, and my hair is much fuller and thicker.  </li>
            <li> So if the breakout continues to clear and nothing else happens</li>
            <li> Took about a month to clear up.</li>
            <li> Not only has my hair grown, I began transitioning to natural hair because my hair was growing so fast my relaxer appointments couldn&#x27;t keep up.</li>
            <li> My skin is so clear.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;ve seen such great results..</li>
            <li> Hopefully this will go away as I keep taking them but that scares me, I want my face to stay clear and my hair to be longer and stronger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the vitamins for about 2 months and so far my hair has grown 2 inches and is much healthier overall!</li>
            <li> They have also started to clear my face up and made my nails grow.</li>
            <li> I so clear</li>
            <li> I would probably still take them just to keep my face clear.  </li>
            <li> I am currently on my fourth bottle and have seen so much improvement in the thickness and texture of my hair and natural curls.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s my second day, but my face feel very irritated and itchy.....</li>
            <li> product claims to provide the body with natural nourishments to promote thickness and faster growth</li>
            <li> So far I noticed a difference with my hair.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive but I&#x27;ve never had acne before.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say because I only been use it for 5 days</li>
            <li> Get Much BUTTER Than This&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;Green Tea &amp; Carrot Deep Conditioning Mask&amp;#34; using these products while taking these vitamins works wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> Not only did I start seeing results fast within my hair, but my nails were growing stronger and healthier too.</li>
            <li> After making a collage on July 3rd, I can&#x27;t tell you how much it made my day seeing that there was hair in that bald spot.</li>
            <li> Hair can have so much meaning and for me it was getting my confidence back.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m definitely going to be purchasing a six month supply real soon.</li>
            <li> My stylist was amazed at how much my hair had grown in that short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> so my patches are nearly all covered.</li>
            <li> Their All natural  &amp; no side affects.</li>
            <li> chopped my hair and became natural</li>
            <li> And even though you&#x27;re supposed to drink a lot of water, sometimes in my busy schedule</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a naturally curly girl.</li>
            <li> Do u think these pills help with young girls age 8 or people with alopicha</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for 3 years now</li>
            <li> I was like people hair can be growing this fast especially Ms. Courtney&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly</li>
            <li> Since taking the vitamins my shedding has completely stopped.</li>
            <li> I have had any breakouts so far</li>
            <li> I have natural 4 type hair.</li>
            <li> So much so that I bought another pair for back up.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair</li>
            <li> I had cut off all my hair because of heat and color damage, and wanted to start my natural hair journey all over again.</li>
            <li> Mane Choice is the better than Hairfinity because you need at least 3 bottles of Hairfinity to see what ManeChoice does in one month with one bottle.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really review how well it works obviously</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these pills for about 5 months now, and I can&#x27;t say enough how much they&#x27;ve been a &amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Before taking these vitamins my energy level was extremely low, and I was very sluggish throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I do have my hair in a protective style which definitely helps the growth of my hair, but I give all thanks to manetabolism for growing my hair faster and healthier.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for 4 years now.</li>
            <li> So far I have not experience anything except my nails</li>
            <li> #34;Doesn&#x27;t get much Butter Than This&amp;#34;, with that product I use once a day at night before I moisturize and seal my hair as well Deep Conditioning Mask...I use this mask biweekly and my hair just loves it!</li>
            <li> I tried these for a month and notice my hair didn&#x27;t shed as much and my hair that was damaged and broke off started to grow back.</li>
            <li> good.(I am a natural curly girl)  </li>
            <li> But these have by far met and passed my expectations.</li>
            <li> I also have noticed my hair feels stronger by far...</li>
            <li> No side effects so far</li>
            <li> This young lady said that she was in fact taking the pills, and has/had done wonders for her hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used 2 bottles of Manetabolism thus far</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I think the biggest UNEXPECTED benefit is the boost of energy I get.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had edges in years from wearing braids in my early 20s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for 2 years now and wish I would&#x27;ve known about this product years ago.</li>
            <li> Its cheaper if you buy directly from their website.</li>
            <li> I noticed a change as early as two weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased these pills after getting a Dominican blow out (which completely thinned my hair).</li>
            <li> im a college student, and ive been natural for 1yr and a couple of months now</li>
            <li> i follow her on instagram and check out her website daily before i made a choice to get her products, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the manetabolism vitamins!</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I started using this product when I went natural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking progress photos to keep up with the growth and that&#x27;s really the only way you&#x27;ll notice.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE REAL DEAL, look no further.  </li>
            <li> , both of us are natural.</li>
            <li> if i had gotten a year supply, my hair could&#x27;ve been to my ankles by now!&amp;#34; Haha, I definitely recommend these pills!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped getting acrylic nails also and growing out my natural nails</li>
            <li> I went natural about a year ago</li>
            <li> I am on a natural hair journey and have been looking for ways to speed up growth AND improve health.</li>
            <li> I now have to wax my lip at least every two weeks, shave my legs and underarms more often too.  </li>
            <li> I am very grateful for this product and the product line that I have convinced several people to give it a try!!</li>
            <li> and I rock my natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> and I am 31 years old).</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend these vitamins to anyone suffering from hair loss or anyone who wants to grow their hair.</li>
            <li> I been growing my hair naturally for about 3 months</li>
            <li> , I had to get my entire head done over because my hair had grown just that much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve definitely received noticeable growth and everyone tells me how much.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the extra thickness to my hair!</li>
            <li> I have heard that you get breakouts while taking them, but i haven&#x27;t gotten anything so far.</li>
            <li> After a year of being natural</li>
            <li> The shipping speed is also fast when ordered from the actual website.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to any and everyone; regardless of race, hair texture, natural or relaxed.</li>
            <li> 6 months ago I decided to go natural and felt I needed something to aid me in growing my hair.</li>
            <li> The hair that grows is really soft, too.</li>
            <li> but so far I can see some growth within my edges</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just in complete shock</li>
            <li> So I only really review on books</li>
            <li> my nails have grown rapidly, my skin is clearer than ever and my hair has grown nearly two inches</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for about a 1/12 after transitioning for a year while in college, which was a struggle.</li>
            <li> I am in the process of going natural</li>
            <li> My hair was near waist length but not quite by the time I graduated.</li>
            <li> Definately helped with the heat damage on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> So naturally I was devastated, and completely heartbroken over the loss of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought oh she&#x27;s just trying to fool us with the old okie doke.</li>
            <li> These vitamins have strengthen and thickened my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended these vitamins to about 3 people thus far and would keep recommending them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m recently natural...</li>
            <li> I got the 5 month supply and 4 for my sister and my hair has grown 2 inches so far in 2 month, it&#x27;s also thicker and healthier.</li>
            <li> I tried these vitamins early July because I&#x27;ve been seeing people post progress pictures on Instagram.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning from a relaxer to natural.</li>
            <li> I just went natural 6 months ago</li>
            <li> My mom put me on to these when I started my natural hair journey.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve only had the product for a few weeks :)</li>
            <li> My hair is so thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> Even my thin edges are coming in nicely.</li>
            <li> my hair haa become wven more thick.</li>
            <li> also she said my hair was growing in so thick and healthy.</li>
            <li> I also have major new growth under my protective style.</li>
            <li> and now I find myself clipping them down often (not a bad thing)</li>
            <li> My hair feels full and when I blow dry it my boyfriend can definitely see and feel it.</li>
            <li> I plan on ordering more later in the future as well as other products.</li>
            <li> My hair was almost shoulder length and after a month supply I have reached past shoulder length! :)</li>
            <li> After taking a Biotin supplement for years and barely seeing any results I decided to try a new product.</li>
            <li> I had hopes but not high hopes after pretty much maintaining the same length hair for 3 years.</li>
            <li> and I never really saw significant growth except for my bodily hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but most of these reviews or at least the top ones on the first page are planted, clearly.</li>
            <li> Recommend this for women (like myself) that wears a lot of weave and  lost a lot of it due to having too many center parts.</li>
            <li> I have been taking manetabolisms for the past 6months and they have truly been a blessing not only to the growth and strength of my natural hair, but It has also supported the health of my skin and nails, unlike most vitamins the manetabolisms has never given me any negative side affects I have found that it has boosted the health of my immune system along side my healthy eating diet change..</li>
            <li> The shipping was so fast and the pills were at my house in 2 days flat.</li>
            <li> I love these pills, I&#x27;ve done research on Youtube firstly about Hairfinity vitamins and heard some bad reviews on how while taking them the new growth is thinner than it would be if you weren&#x27;t taking them so my first thought was</li>
            <li> but I never looked into it until I became serious with having healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I had been taking hairfinity  for the last 6-8 months and remembered having the same  breakout problem within the first couple of weeks of taking it as well.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the healthy hair vitamins for the past couple of months and they definitely work!!!</li>
            <li> I have struggled with my hair and have tried many different options in the past.</li>
            <li> Definitely cheaper on the main website, but if you have Prime, you can get it quicker through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical when I first bought them because I&#x27;ve heard so many people tell me their stories about hairfinity &amp; I</li>
            <li> Even so, I noticed a real difference in my edges within the first few weeks of taking these.</li>
            <li> I ordered the pills off of the main website in June, and my edges started growing back.</li>
            <li> To say I was pleasantly surprised, was a major understatement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There have been many occasions when I&#x27;ve banged my hand and broken a nail, only to see it growing back long and strong in about a week to two week&#x27;s time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I would wash my hair every week I would have TONS of shedding, but these vitamins have tremendously cut down on that shedding I barely see any on some washes!</li>
            <li> Additionally: the deep conditioner that she sells is HIGHLY overpriced</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these vitamins and not only to women but men also.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these for anyone transitioning, big chopped, or if you just want to add fullness and thickness to your hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend and I&#x27;ll be purchasing my next two month supply!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking to improve the overall health of their hair.</li>
            <li> I did my big chop my after my senior year of high school in 2011</li>
            <li> and I have seen major results!</li>
            <li> results may not be as fast and long than others</li>
            <li> Normally my hair grows on about 1/2 an inch every couple of months and it grew like 1 1/2 inch in only 3 weeks of taking manetabolism.</li>
            <li> You will experience growth before that first bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> Also no break outs and no dark urine</li>
            <li> which is faster than my regular normal rate of growth.</li>
            <li> I started these vitamins back in March and since then my hair has become more thick and also they have helped with my transition from relaxed hair to natural.</li>
            <li> The vitamins have caused my edges that have been missing for a long time to come back in so full!!</li>
            <li> I cant wait til my first trimester is over (thats when my Dr say I can get back on them once the sickness is over) because my hair is about to be a true MANEchoice if you know what I mean....</li>
            <li> First for me personally my two month supply in less than a month tops gave me much thicker hair along with length.</li>
            <li> (always a plus)...no increase in hair growth in other less appealing places though.</li>
            <li> They are within a normal size so no worries about having a hard time swallowing them and no bad taste.</li>
            <li> but I check my new growth daily</li>
            <li> Let me just tell you, this style usually last a month and after 2 weeks is time to get it redone because all of my new growth.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a new bottle.</li>
            <li> will add that I am in the southern New Mexico area</li>
            <li> hair texture is very corse  and tends to get dry and brittle and break easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am African American and nothing has ever made my hair grow so FAST not just that</li>
            <li> Ive always had long hair, however, these vitamins gave me a definite legnth boost within finishing my first bottle.</li>
            <li> Not only are my edges fuller only after 1.5 months, but my nails are so much stronger and longer</li>
            <li> So much growth in such a short time..</li>
            <li> I found the Mane Choice Vitamins on social media, with some research I decided to give them a try, and boy was I surprised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my second year of being completely all natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle &amp; not only has these pills made my hair longer but also thicker (which I really needed).</li>
            <li> I hate swallowing pills and stopped taking the vitamins and surely enough I have not seen hair growth results like I did with these wonderful vitamins.</li>
            <li> He took them for a month and slowly but surely his hair grew back.</li>
            <li> You will be glad you did because your days of thinning, breaking, slow growing, shedding hair will FINALLY come to an end with this product!!</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time swallowing pills but you can open these and use them that way which is really good.</li>
            <li> I was soooo upset and was looking for something to help me grow my healthy thick hair back.</li>
            <li> (Sidebar: I highly recommend following the website and their social media to keep up to date with all the products and promos.)</li>
            <li> Before I knew it I couldn&#x27;t keep my hair in any protected styles because the growth was so major.</li>
            <li> No other vitamin for me.</li>
            <li> and I actually had to have the outter retouched 3 weeks earlier than I normally do!</li>
            <li> I seen growth starting as early as two weeks!</li>
            <li> I had major hair growth before th 30 days were up.  </li>
            <li> About 6 months ago I had a major setback after having twists installed and today you would have no idea, partly because of additional help from these vitamins.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I see a major difference.  </li>
            <li> Before my hair was trying to recover from MAJOR damage.</li>
            <li> I am known as a product junkie, I have spent countless time and money on trying to find the right hair vitamins.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown so much and has gotten so full and thick since using these products!</li>
            <li> After a terrible flat ironing incident, I had to cut most of my beautiful hair off, reverting me back to big chop length.</li>
            <li> I started using this product with high hopes for my hair to be restored back to its former luster.  </li>
            <li> and these vitamins are pushing my new growth in nice and thick!!!</li>
            <li> I experienced bad breakage..</li>
            <li> 4  years ago I decided to no longer relax my hair and focus on healthier hair practices and a healthier lifestyle in general.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just an illusion because I as so desperate for healthy hair</li>
            <li> I am waiting until I complete this bottle to give my final review and decide whether I will continue to take this for three months as I did with harifinity.  </li>
            <li> Not going to complete this last bottle.</li>
            <li> and I barely saw any improvement, but with the Manetabolism pills my hair has grown a lot</li>
            <li> I have been natural for the last 10 years but did a big chop about 2 years ago and have been wearing my hair naturally curly.</li>
            <li> BARELY ANY shedding or anything.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the breakage that I used to have directly in the middle of my hair is gone.</li>
            <li> I have been incorporating these vitamins in my daily natural hair care for almost a year.</li>
            <li> Well guys, I have nearly finished my 3rd bottle!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cannot wait to take out my protective style next week and wear my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for about 3yrs and just recently</li>
            <li> These were the second type of hair vitamins I took, anf by far the best!At</li>
            <li> that if the middle of her crown was still growing (like wild fire mind you) why can&#x27;t the rest of it?</li>
            <li> I have been natural since 7thgrade and last my 10th grade year I decided to uses these pills</li>
            <li> I have been natural for 2 years prior to using it</li>
            <li> but I could barely make it to 1.5 with taking these vitamins.</li>
            <li> I have recently began transitioning to my natural hair and this product has truly helped speed the process.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m near finishing my second bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m newly natural so my hair is still very short</li>
            <li> Not only is my natural hair growing</li>
            <li> I have been taking these vitamins for nearly a month now and have only missed one day</li>
            <li> I am currently on a natural hair journey and I am using protective hairstyles to grow my hair and the manetabolism vitamins are definitely showing results by growing out my protective hairstyles.</li>
            <li> This hadn&#x27;t been readily apparent to me until I started comparing pictures over this period of time.  </li>
            <li> As of last year I decided I wanted to make the transition to natural hair.</li>
            <li> Started taking the pills last month and I&#x27;ve been wowed with the length its grown; I had my braids redone four weeks ago and within a week the braids were slipping off because my hair was growing THAT fast!</li>
            <li> when normally after the twists are taken out it would eventually work its way back into the different textures.  </li>
            <li> it made mostly my edges thin out</li>
            <li> she was talking about this hair vitamins that you created that helped her hair grow long thick and healthy....</li>
            <li> I honestly have always felt it was a myth, and that results were always exaggerated and  I &#x27;m not one to subscribe to the &amp;#34;hype&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> My strands were no longer thin and stringy but healthy</li>
            <li> I now have thick have thick healthy hair with full edges after finishing my third bottle.</li>
            <li> When I first began taking them I had just gotten my braids (protective style) and within 2.5 weeks I had new growth, I ended up removing my braids because within 3.5 weeks it was ridiculous new growth.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend to anyone with dry brittle hair trying to get a healthier head of hair.</li>
            <li> my nails are long and hard and my face is smooth in clear!</li>
            <li> My nails have became extremely strong and the length of my hair is unbelievable in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Of course I wash my face a lot, but no more than normal.im convinced that the vitamins are the reason my skin is clear right now.</li>
            <li> Im excited to see where I&#x27;ll be in the next few months with it!</li>
            <li> After hair infinity I didn&#x27;t want to try another hair growth pill, but after looking at all the pictures with significant hair growth it was hard Not to buy in.</li>
            <li> But if you are serious  about getting long healthy hair</li>
            <li> My edges werw finally growing back since I was pregnant, but then started falling out because a stylist braided my hair TOO TIGHT for this sew in</li>
            <li> the reviews here are very misleading be careful!</li>
            <li> As much as I didn&#x27;t want these pills to work (I just assumed they wouldn&#x27;t like other supplements)</li>
            <li> It is the real deal and not like the other hair vitaams that take 3 months to show that your hair has grown an inch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products to get real results</li>
            <li> I first started off taking regular Biotin pills from your local grocery store just to regain the length I once had, but I noticed a lot of side effects such as dry irritated skin on my face and bumps.</li>
            <li> I social media stalked before going forth and committing...</li>
            <li> type of thing and by monitoring the creators social media page with tons of reviews and pictures.</li>
            <li> I finished bottle number 2 and currently transitioning back to natural.</li>
            <li> the creator is a former Medical professional</li>
            <li> These are very easy to take and they don&#x27;t have a weird smell to them.</li>
            <li> I decided to take the plunge and 5 months later I have no regrets!</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptic about trying this product.  </li>
            <li> The first month, I gained a little over an inch of growth.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about buying a hair product offline but being that I follow them on social media and saw that they had such great reviews I had to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Within just 3 months NO MORE IV, my hair has grown RIDICULOUSLY, I actually have nails that are worthy of a manicure</li>
            <li> barely grew , I even tried the &amp;#34;Inverse method&amp;#34; which is a claim that you can get your hair to grow an extra inch within a week.</li>
            <li> I was kind of skeptical because prior to purchasing these I was on a different hair vitamin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie, at first I was had a few doubts.</li>
            <li> The results are real and can&#x27;t wait to explore to the other products they offer !</li>
            <li> there BEAUTIFULLY healthy little CURLS sprouting through!!!!</li>
            <li> I also use some of their other products and HIGHLY recommend that you use their products.</li>
            <li> but after taking them for just a couple weeks my hair had grown a little more than half an inch!!</li>
            <li> My hair is so much thicker than it previously was before I started taking these vitamins.  </li>
            <li> A WHOLE INCH AND A HALF OF GROWTH.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t take them for an extended period of time because I decided to cut my hair but in the time that I did take them I noticed a lot less shedding, and my nails were and still are growing very</li>
            <li> I am natural and my bangs stretched was to the mid section of the bridge of my nose.</li>
            <li> It was full in the front, back, and sides but because i was a braid fanatic, my edges and nape were always broken.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed how thick and full my hair is too, I had lost some hair around the front of my hairline and thought it would never grow back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s growing my hair out extremely quickly and thick.</li>
            <li> For shiny thick and quick hair growth.  </li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptical about taking these pills, but boy am I GLAD I ORDERED THEM.</li>
            <li> But with this last sew-in I received when I started taking these vitamins came a loose from the new growth and not be pulling my hair out in the back.</li>
            <li> The pills are a little large</li>
            <li> the past 7 months.&lt;br /&gt;Normally my hair growth is really slow to actually have it touch my shoulders is amazing.</li>
            <li> , my hair grows like crazy and I love it!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I wanted to notice results right away.  </li>
            <li> These pills paired with protective styling and various tips/tricks shared on social media by founder Courtney have taken my hair to the next level!</li>
            <li> I first started these vitamins after being so deficient in numerous vitamins and minerals that I had take several supplements intravenously (IV) for 6 months straight.</li>
            <li> and I do mean everything, such as JBCO, megatek mixes, oils, various deep conditioners and even other hair vitamins such as Hairfinity; but over the years nothing has helped my edges grow back as healthy as my hair is...</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that after taking them for two months my hair has thickened up and grew at least 2 inches(Yes!!!)</li>
            <li> Ive tried what feels like every vitamin for hair growth and was about to give up on the whole thing until I stumbled across these little gems of awesomeness.</li>
            <li> I had just recently did a large cut and was missing my length.</li>
            <li> A little over a year ago I started following the Mane Choice on IG but was very nervous to order.  </li>
            <li> My hair is half way down my back now and im back on track with quick hair growth finally.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of really bad breakage and had to get a good bit of my hair cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very bold and dramatic when it comes to my hair, so for that I&#x27;m picky.</li>
            <li> I recently had to a big chop due to heat damage and these vitamins completely revitalized the thickness of hair, along with maximizing my hair hair growth in such a short time frame!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its the product or the weather, but I definitely didn&#x27;t see any positive changes to my hair.</li>
            <li> One spot had completely grown back in and the other one was making it&#x27;s way.  </li>
            <li> spend a lot of time on instagram looking at protective hair styles and following other girls that have been going natural for a while or just</li>
            <li> This really is the secret to long, thick and healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (curly, thick and strong with less split ends).</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that the side effects that I had on the other product were not happening here.</li>
            <li> Ive seen her!&amp;#34; I remember her face from other researches I&#x27;ve done when wanting to start my natural hair journey.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these for the past 5 months and after a third big chop, these vitamins have given me so much thickness and health to my hair.</li>
            <li> I kinda used my tatt as my gauge...and shedding has decreased SIGNIFICANTLY.</li>
            <li> After 3 months of taking them, my edges are full and thick!</li>
            <li> so with high hopes i tried for another month, don&#x27;t waste your time trying this product.</li>
            <li> My edges are super thick!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also gotten super thick!</li>
            <li> I did notice growth from the pills early on but stopped taking them after a week and a half because I was getting migraines every day from taking them even though I drink a lot of water daily.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everyone I know and here is why, my whole life I bit my fingernails, they have never grown past the edge of my fingers.  </li>
            <li> Especially for anyone suffering from that awkward post twa/pre-hangtime stage. :)&lt;br /&gt;You definitely won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been long enough to tell if it works</li>
            <li> My hair is not only long but healthier then is has ever been.</li>
            <li> I discovered the themanechoice, so i decided to do my research on these pills, long story short</li>
            <li> It was breaking, my curls were flat..</li>
            <li> had been following Courtney&#x27;s hair journey long before she announced what she was doing (which was taking HER vitamins).</li>
            <li> For a long time I didn&#x27;t have edges nor would the back of my hair grow</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to do so.</li>
            <li> Within 2 1/2 weeks I started to see thin spots become full spots and</li>
            <li> The Mane Choice is showing the real (everyday) woman achieve real results!</li>
            <li> I mean, really!    </li>
            <li> Overall the vitamins are the bomb and you should try them and support the brand, the owner Courtney gives back in charity and other giveaways and engages with those following or wanting to try her brand.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t even near a half an inch</li>
            <li> My nails that would usually split and break had started to grow hard and strong.</li>
            <li> Shipping is fast, friendly customer service and the pills don&#x27;t break you out or make you feel bad.</li>
            <li> I am on multiple medications due to health issues and I had a spot in the back of my hair that NEVER grew (the nape)</li>
            <li> It has brought life back to my hair whicg had lost is shine due to personal stress.</li>
            <li> It grow a certain length then over time it would slowly  break off.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning and have been growing my natural hair for a little over two years.</li>
            <li> Within a half of month I saw about a half of inch and a whole month</li>
            <li> I usually wear my hair in high curlly puff ponytails.</li>
            <li> I used Manetabolism  for a month after a battle with  damage thinning hair that was cause from being on prescription drugs for six months ,I  found The Mane Choice on social media and after comparing with the other hair vitamin I made the mane choice I cut had to cut my hair</li>
            <li> I only used two bottles of the pills and a year later my hair is a little pasted my shoulders and my shaved part in the back fully grown.</li>
            <li> I have had such a hard time trying to get my hair to grow at even a normal rate.</li>
            <li> so at least think reasonably when reviewing a product.</li>
            <li> Needless to say hat edges are now completely filled in and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried another well known hair vitamin in the past and I will say I haven&#x27;t seen anywhere near the same results.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve tried  all types of vitamins in the past such as,Nexus,GNC hair vitamins,Groganics,and hairfinity and this by far</li>
            <li> Hair growth is a long process so it requires patience</li>
            <li> For a long time I researched ways to have my hair grow and came across Hairinfinty and The Mane Choice.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are enviously long.</li>
            <li> I did get minor breakouts around my chin area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with thinning edges for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> my bottom lip stretched.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not shedding and I don&#x27;t have breakage and grey hair</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t like taking vitamins because they&#x27;re usually horse pills</li>
            <li> I getting so long</li>
            <li> my nails never been long until I started taken the pills</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been taking long.</li>
            <li> My hair growth has been gradual and it&#x27;s been a long road.</li>
            <li> I am not a natural person</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are growing long to</li>
            <li> I must confess, my hair is already mid way down my back</li>
            <li> I stopped taking it for one day and the following day the raised areas had gone down, so this product is obviously not for me.  </li>
            <li> I had a baby about a year and a half ago and was experiencing major shedding ...</li>
            <li> The Mane Choice has definitely been a MANE component in my hair growth over the past few months and have completely bought into the other products which I also HIGHLY recommend!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice new growth until a month after I finished taking these pills and it was very little.</li>
            <li> My hair usually grows about a half inch per month and at the end of just my first bottle I saw about 1.5 inches of growth.</li>
            <li> Not only did I grow a healthy set of nails which at one point was impossible but</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these pills religiously and have noticed less shedding before, during, and after deep conditioning and washing.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m only 2 and a half months deep.</li>
            <li> My goal is to have hair as long as hers!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve taken other supplements that said it does the same thing as Manetabolism, but truly nothing compares.  </li>
            <li> LIFE LONG HABIT CONQUERED IN A MONTH!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these vitamins for about 4months , during this period I had a protective style (weave) , when I took my hair out in the third month I noticed extreme growth.</li>
            <li> If you are looking into trying hair vitamins or have tried that other brand with unsatisfactory results I definitely recommend The Mane Choice.</li>
            <li> I have tried biotin from the store but that only gave me chest problems... like sharp pains in my chest</li>
            <li> I was told that my hair wouldn&#x27;t grow back in due to my alopecia.</li>
            <li> Other companies have pills that promote growth but these prote growth As well as overall healthiness!</li>
            <li> I just finished my first bottle and my hair has filled in like crazy, its so thick</li>
            <li> I cut off my hair due to breakage and alopecia, the pics below is a 3 week progress pic from the back of my hair that wasn&#x27;t growing and has grown in.</li>
            <li> I had been struggling to grow my edges back in and regain the fullness in my hair due to hair loss for 6 years.</li>
            <li> sooo I have tried two other products I won&#x27;t name that were said to do the same....</li>
            <li> And unlike other vitamins I&#x27;ve experience, these are the only vitamins that don&#x27;t cause breakouts on my face, which is a plus for me.</li>
            <li> The back of my hair grows extremely fast while the front is normally very slow.</li>
            <li> I never thought my hair would get back to being healthy after a really bad experience.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and damaged from bleach and dye.  </li>
            <li> and if you didn&#x27;t know, consuming too much vitamin A can cause serious health issues.</li>
            <li> I tried hairfinity a few years back and didn&#x27;t see much overall improvement or growth.</li>
            <li> I had absolutely no new growth at that time.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a few breakouts but nothing major</li>
            <li> Within the first two weeks I had at least a half of an inch of growth.</li>
            <li> As far as hair growth, I&#x27;m not sure just yet.</li>
            <li> I have recently cut off all the hair on the back of my head and it has grown back at least 3 inch</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m  a true addict.</li>
            <li> I have type 3c hair, so I can not really see how long it is until I straighten it.</li>
            <li> And for someone with thick coarse, natural hair (2 years no relaxer) having short, so thick I can barely run my fingers through it,</li>
            <li> As i live in the UK i was shocked at how quickly they arrived.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair up in a loose bun majority of the time.</li>
            <li> was growing protective style loose.</li>
            <li> Having this medical condition, my hair was normally dry and brittle, leaving it subject to breakage.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll probably stop taking them soon, because at this rate my hair will be down my back in no time.  </li>
            <li> When I big chopped I was kinda down on myself</li>
            <li> I have not notice anything different with my skin other than the break outs I no longer have, and as for my nails,  they last a little longer than with Hairfinity but started to chip and break as well.  </li>
            <li> and you definitely get other vitamins that are beneficial as well!</li>
            <li> One try and you won&#x27;t go back to any other hair multivitamin pill!</li>
            <li> I currently take my length check pictures every 16days because that&#x27;s how often I have extremely noticeable growth!</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t be going back to any other pills!</li>
            <li> I have tried other hair vitamins that made me kind of nauseous and sick to my stomache</li>
            <li> my new growth is so thick</li>
            <li> Normally, I don&#x27;t wear weave, but I was getting bored with the natural look.</li>
            <li> I only took half of the dosage which was one pill a day to ensure I didnt overwhelm my system and these were my results.</li>
            <li> well I&#x27;m half way done with it, and I&#x27;m finally seeing some growth (although my results are nothing like the ones u see on IG)</li>
            <li> And one other thing, I have tried other hair vitamins (hairfinity) and they did not work for me since they counteract with medication I must take daily.</li>
            <li> I did not see any growth or thickness outside of what I normally get each month nor did I see any decreased shedding.</li>
            <li> I previously took a different brand and although I saw plenty of length, I didn&#x27;t get the thickness and fullness</li>
            <li> I started using Manetabolism hair pills February of this year, previously I had tried hair skin and nails and hairfinity and both vitamins really only grew out my nails.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first but after using these vitamins for only a couple of months.</li>
            <li> and my stylist indicated that she&#x27;s noticely less breakage and some of my edges growing back in already</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also seen results in less than two weeks of starting!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m half way through my third bottle</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first because I always end up being apart of the 10% group that a specific product does not work for</li>
            <li> My mother has alopecia and had been told by several dermatologist over the past 20 years that there was no hope of any hair re growth in her temple follicles and around the front and back of her head.</li>
            <li> I was astonished because my hair seemingly only grows about half an inch a month.</li>
            <li> I tried Manetabolism pills and not only did my hair grow slightly over an inch in a month, I did not have headaches and my face did not break out.</li>
            <li> my hair sewin felt like I had it in for a month and a half when it had only been two weeks.</li>
            <li> In one month I saw double the growth than with the previous brand.</li>
            <li> By the end of the 2nd week my hair had grown about half of an inch.</li>
            <li> , my hair type is a mix of 3C/4A/4B (3C-top/4A-back/4B-crown) and I am a black female.</li>
            <li> my hair has grown back to the length that it was before I cut my ends off ... in less than a month&#x27;s time.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about trying it at first but after reading numerous of reviews and doing tons of research, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> ( super random)</li>
            <li> Results are not super fast since I have slow growth</li>
            <li> My hair grows at a very slow rate but once I started using the vitamins my hair began to grow at a much faster rate, shed less and was stronger and healthier overall!!</li>
            <li> Since then, every time I have a little money left over I would order two jars of The Mane Choice Vitamins for me and my husband.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but let me tell you, I went from no edges to three inches in two months!</li>
            <li> Before these vitamins, I suffered numerous dark spots on my face..the vitamins help fade them!</li>
            <li> I have been taking these vitamins for a little over two weeks and even though I don&#x27;t know my actual hair growth because of my sew-</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve recently noticed that I haven&#x27;t had any bumps in a little over a week.</li>
            <li> Currently I have a hard boil like pimple on my face that is utterly embarrassing.</li>
            <li> My nails are stronger, some acne has cleared up, and my hair has grown from in between my eyes to further down the bridge of my nose!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see how long my hair grow using this product!!!</li>
            <li> Even after having my ends trimmed twice to get rid of really bad ends, I&#x27;ve seen more then an inch of growth.</li>
            <li> but I read too many bad reviews and being a college student</li>
            <li> how great these are, just try them and see for yourself you will NOT be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I plan on using the vitamins for at least another year or so ONLY because I&#x27;ve actually seen results.</li>
            <li> Ive been natural ever since i was 16 years old, but instead of doing a big chop, i did a semi chop by cutting the ends.</li>
            <li> However although my nails did grow there was no real change in my skin.</li>
            <li> I can say that a few years back after taking botin alone</li>
            <li> , I was wide awake.</li>
            <li> I have not really seen any growth.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd round of taking the supplement and already my stylist has noticed a change in hairgrowth.</li>
            <li> I find itvery weired that there&#x27;s been an increase of 300-400 reviews on this product, yet for months there were only but a few reviews</li>
            <li> Such a blessed and humble  woman.</li>
            <li> and I had absolutely NO shedding.  </li>
            <li> I have had trouble with getting my hair to grow thicker, without a lot of shedding, my thought was to stop getting perms in my hair and the second was to cut off all my relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> three times longer they were stronger, when I would go to bite them it was alot harder for them to break</li>
            <li> I drink NAKED GREEN MACHINE</li>
            <li> I had a few streaks left in my hair and their now at my ends.</li>
            <li> but that is expected with multivitamins.</li>
            <li> I saw Teyana Taylor post on her Instagram about the vitamins, and I became curious then.</li>
            <li> My hair has minimal shedding, it&#x27;s getting thicker and my curls have never looked so</li>
            <li> I noticed absolutely no breakouts at all</li>
            <li> Absolutely no breakouts.  </li>
            <li> when I&#x27;m detangling (wet).</li>
            <li> A few months back my fiancee started losing his hair.</li>
            <li> Noticed (minimal) growth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lifelong consumer.</li>
            <li> My self and my family has absolutely no complains.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> washing my hair, I have minimal to no shedding, growth at over 2 inches and thickness</li>
            <li> I also use the green tea deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I also did not received the results I expected.</li>
            <li> I have seen growth but not nearly as much as what the testimonials claim.  </li>
            <li> My family recently moved in February to the Caribbean to do missionary work and the humidity gave me even more reasons to hate.  </li>
            <li> My hair is also fuller in the middle where it all came out and never grew back as thick.  </li>
            <li> My regular hair growth cycle is half an inch per month!  </li>
            <li> My hair actually became unbelievable thick and soft and started to grow!</li>
            <li> Sadly my stress points are right on my edges...</li>
            <li> After High school I was in a pre college program before Freshman year and wore my hair straight practically straight EVERYDAY because I hated wearing my hair curly and wasn&#x27;t at the desirable length it used to be at.</li>
            <li> Once I started taking them I noticed the shedding grew less &amp; less &amp; my hair started growing back with thickness!!!</li>
            <li> I originally started taking them after cutting about 4 inches of heat damaged hair off .</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, I have very brittle nails, and I did not see amelioration in them which is not that disappointing, I was not expecting anything major because my goal did not have to do with my nails.</li>
            <li> My edges (which I had given up on as they started to thin from constant braiding that was too tight) were starting to fill back out.</li>
            <li> The sides of my hair have never been even and now they are going past my collarbone The sides of my hair have never been even and now they are both reaching past my collarbone, I&#x27;m also seeing new growth around my edges.</li>
            <li> sometimes hours between each other.</li>
            <li> One other girl told  me about  Mane Choice.</li>
            <li> I usually use Hairfinity , but wanted to give this a try because I saw that the vitamins were double to what were used in Hairfinity.</li>
            <li> I would say the other products worked in moisturizing my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other things to assist with my skin, hair, and nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that include biotin but the Mane Choice has worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products and nothing was helping, my friend recommended I try these</li>
            <li> Some results can be seen quicker on other purchasers but it just depends on your body</li>
            <li> I stopped taking them for about 6 weeks due to surgery.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try other mane choice products.</li>
            <li> I would recommend these over and other vitamins</li>
            <li> Other than helping my hair it has also improved the health of my nails.</li>
            <li> I figured out there are other methods of taking them ie opening the capsule.</li>
            <li> There are other hair supplements out there</li>
            <li> I was wary when I first ordered these, and my instincts seem to have been proven correct.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll begin by stating that I did not purchase these vitamins on Amazon due to their price.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had any other hair vitamin.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any sid effects other than HAIR GROWTH, RETENTION and AWESOMENESS.</li>
            <li> some of the other hair,skin and nails pills have.</li>
            <li> But I saw the results of other people, read up on the products</li>
            <li> had no breakouts like some other pills that I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have seen triple the results compared to ANY of the other hair pills out there.</li>
            <li> I recommend these pills along with her other products to all of my sisters, nieces and girl-friends.  </li>
            <li> I stopped getting my nails done due to the faster growth.</li>
            <li> I spent YEARS trying to grow my hair!</li>
            <li> What other hair supplements does that?</li>
            <li> but manetabolism gives me that extra boost of energy i had been missing!</li>
            <li> When I first heard about them I was a but skeptical until I order them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get cystic acne or any other side effect.</li>
            <li> the other hair pills have caused me too.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any side effects, NO breakouts or any other complications.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re remotely hesitant about &amp;#34;miracle pills&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t know which one to try, this one is a winner!</li>
            <li> Three weeks later my bangs were past</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t even had any break outs or any other type of symptom with these.</li>
            <li> *(other hair vitamin that I won&#x27;t call by name)</li>
            <li> NOT the other way around.</li>
            <li> Anyway, once I started noticing my hair growing at a faster rate so did hair on other parts of my body.  </li>
            <li> I had to cut my hair due to breakage.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a product to help with two bald spots that were beginning to develop due to stress.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely NO breakouts &amp; my haaaaaiiiir!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a vitamin taker!</li>
            <li> I did not experience any headaches, acne or any side effects with them like with other products.</li>
            <li> I tried other hair, skin, and nails products and they do not compare.</li>
            <li> I tried oils, creams, drops, other supplements...</li>
            <li> Also these pills caused me no breakouts like other vitamins I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> From whatever it is, biotin, hair infinity, other hair growth pills, WHATEVER it is that you are using and or doing</li>
            <li> buyers beware,  this will grow out your protective style sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> I have used other products and saw no difference</li>
            <li> They also have other hair products on the site to use on your hair.</li>
            <li> I just use he pills,but I may start using some of the other products.</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;ve heard other hair vitamins cause.</li>
            <li> but I received extreme growth from this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll also be purchasing other products.</li>
            <li> When you have a small percentage of people that it dont work for it is likely allergans or genetics to propriety blends in the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m big on protective styles but my last sew-in left me very thin around my edges.</li>
            <li> My hair and I have had a LIFELONG love hate relationship.  </li>
            <li> By the end of my first bottle, I could see some very thin &amp;#34;baby hair&amp;#34; on my bald spot.  </li>
            <li> My hair use to be very thin and stringy,now its has a pretty shine.</li>
            <li> No breakouts, my usually weak and peeling nails have done a complete 360.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first because of all the other brands I tried.</li>
            <li> my hair is the longest that it&#x27;s been in a long time and my nails are growing constantly and they are thick!  </li>
            <li> My hair does feel a little stronger, but not much else.  </li>
            <li> I definitely see a dramatic growth difference and thickness, plus just overall health in my hair.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first until I tried it and became a believer.</li>
            <li> Even when I hardly noticed, my friends or co-workers would say &amp;#34;your hair got longer.&amp;#34; So it&#x27;s definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I was having such a hard time finding a product that would help my hair grow.</li>
            <li> Now I am a person who has such a hard time taking pills</li>
            <li> and I broke out all over my back and on my wrist with these huge, horrible, red raised bumps/welts.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many things to get this stupid acne under control</li>
            <li> I had dark marks from bumps here</li>
            <li> , I had some dark spots I tried to get rid of for years and these vitamins helped me in just one month now</li>
            <li> This really seems fake and the biggest problem over all is hair loss.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any negative side effects, I would definitely recommend giving these pills a try.</li>
            <li> Completely off because I was tired of the chemicals and processing done to my hair.</li>
            <li> It is also back thick and shiny.</li>
            <li> T2D forced my decision to go natural no more chemically processed hair.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> Ladies start your Long hair don&#x27;t care journey asap!!!!!</li>
            <li> Hair has down but did not retain length with all the shedding.</li>
            <li> Will do a hair review after I take my hair down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve increased my water intake and even backed down to 1 pill/day and still broke out.  </li>
            <li> and I had to take it down my hair</li>
            <li> I received a three month supply and decided to track my growth by putting my hair in crochet braids for the 3 months and when I took my hair down</li>
            <li> The hair butter gives it moisture and life without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to take my hair down and see my growth.</li>
            <li> and I should have dropped down to 1.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful for these vitamins because my hair started to fall out due to stress and these vitamins saved my life!</li>
            <li> Now I want to try the conditioners,and all the other products!</li>
            <li> After so many trials and fails with other hair growth products I was skeptical</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also going to try the other products!</li>
            <li> And hopefully trying other products!</li>
            <li> and I had a little edge loss due to wearing a lace closure sew-in .</li>
            <li> And no breakouts either like with other vitamins!</li>
            <li> My hair usually feels dry but while taken them, it did not.</li>
            <li> I have tryed other products and was not very pleased I will continue to use Manetabolism.</li>
            <li> These vitamins have not only brought me insane hair growth, but my hair is much thicker, shinier, curlier, and the change in my hair&#x27;s overall health is just so obvious.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from thin edges and overall thin coarse hair for my entire life.</li>
            <li> Genetically I have very thin hair, and after using these for a month my hair is so much thicker.  </li>
            <li> I have tried biotin pills and a few other hair/nail pills</li>
            <li> I purchased these vitamins a month ago because I was really tired of having little no growth with my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I fell &amp;#34;victim&amp;#34; to losing my edges from protective styling with braids that were entirely too tight &amp; HEAVY!!</li>
            <li> They only bad thing is my hair is growing too fast for protective styles like braids</li>
            <li> unfortunately it refused to completely revert after I wet it</li>
            <li> My hair even stop shedding less.</li>
            <li> After finishing a month and half of the mane choice vitamins my hair has started to fill-in the front of my hair, and my eyelashes have stopped falling out and have gotten thicker and longer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to increase my intake of water to prent breakout like previous supplement I have tried.</li>
            <li> They do have an odd smell</li>
            <li> With my hair I noticed less shedding and thickness</li>
            <li> and I started to notice that I was shedding less and less.</li>
            <li> I have seen results after about a bottle and a half.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed less shedding in my comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was slightly hesitant to buy hair vitamins because of biotin</li>
            <li> Since I have been taking them I have had nail growth, hair length growth of about 4 inches, and less hair shedding .</li>
            <li> My hair grew half an in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> My hair measures at 6 and a half,</li>
            <li> My hair is fuller and less breakage.</li>
            <li> I measured my hair after 3 in a half weeks of.</li>
            <li> and my hair was 5 and a half inches according to the shirt on nov.20th</li>
            <li> hair was like at 4 in a half before I started taking mane choice</li>
            <li> I would have a lot of shedding and breakage and now since I have been taken the pills I have way less shedding and breakage.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what made the manechoice stand out to me, already I&#x27;ve noticed less shedding</li>
            <li> One day I hope to have half of her hair length..</li>
            <li> now my hair has grown tremendously no shedding at all.</li>
            <li> Not even half way done with the bottle.</li>
            <li> and it cleared me up in less than a week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shed anymore or any less than I already did</li>
            <li> I wasnt used to the half inch of hair on my head</li>
            <li> My hair grew less then a month.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s softer and has less tangles.  </li>
            <li> and it took me half the time to get here.</li>
            <li> I also taken hairfinity previously</li>
            <li> BUT what I got in a 2 month supply of Hairfinity I was getting in less than a month with Manetabolism.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try the vitamins at first because of my past experiences .</li>
            <li> I also have less shedding.</li>
            <li> (i have about one inch and a half growth in 2 months )</li>
            <li> I had tried hairfinity for a month and half and noticed breakouts...which I never have.</li>
            <li> It is now almost the end of September and my hair is 2 1/2 inches past my starting length before I took these vitamins (I gave myself a small trim).</li>
            <li> I spent a year just getting it about half an inch past there.</li>
            <li> My hair is down by my collar bone and the texture is tight, little curls.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t upset my stomach,  doesn&#x27;t mess with my sleep and doesn&#x27;t mess with my appetite.</li>
            <li> Even though i missed one day, my end results were not affected, and drinking juice with the pills instead of water didnt mess up my end results.</li>
            <li> Not bright yellow urine here lol!&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my hair is thick and long.</li>
            <li> I too would like to have long flowing thick hair like the owner.  </li>
            <li> I had a sew-in during the summer and the woman braided so tight that she pulled out my edges where the closure was installed.</li>
            <li> No heat no chemicals or tight styles in my head</li>
            <li> even when the followers ask really stupid questions or questions that could easily be answered if they just scroll up or go to the website).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much growth results after taking the first month supply not to mention I broke out terribly on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been very insecure about my hair and recently started apreciating my natural beauty.</li>
            <li> Giving it two starts though cause little growth is still something.</li>
            <li> Over the two months i got a little over two inches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen results in as little as 3 days.</li>
            <li> Excited to start a another hair journey as a relaxed girl, I was disappointed because I saw no results.</li>
            <li> My mother on the other hand is too lazy</li>
            <li> I tried other  hair growth vitamins in the past, but have not  had results close to this.</li>
            <li> I started taking these pills on Monday, I need to wait a little longer to see hair growth but...</li>
            <li> I bought to 2 bottles a little over a month ago.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown a little over 1/2 inch each month.</li>
            <li> It took the vitamins a little longer than what was stated to arrive.</li>
            <li> My shedding are little to none when I detangle and I truly think it because of these vitamins.</li>
            <li> I usually took other vitamins</li>
            <li> a little thicker..</li>
            <li> a little longer..</li>
            <li> When using hairfinity i got these weird dry pates on my skin, when they d&#x3D;finally went away i was left with scars.</li>
            <li> No more thin and short, but thick and luscious edges are back.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product, hands down!</li>
            <li> which is what I was looking for in a product and my face has cleared up from the breakouts I was experiencing and lastly my poor little brittle nails actually grow now and are stronger than ever.</li>
            <li> Once I went natural I finally realized how bad my edges had gotten.</li>
            <li> I have been on a journey to regrow my hair after dyeing my hair blonde and cutting it all off and starting over.  </li>
            <li> but it made my hair thin, especially around my edges and the ends of my hair. .</li>
            <li> but it was a waste of money and time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say it was the worst decision!  </li>
            <li> It was just a waste of money</li>
            <li> In addition to the reduced shedding I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair has grown a few inches.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first but after seeing all the pictures and reviews on instagram</li>
            <li> I paused the pills until I wanted to take out the style and resumed taking them a few days before.</li>
            <li> On June 29th, I dyed my hair green.</li>
            <li> i gained about an inch of growth in a month plus it regrew my broken edges back.</li>
            <li> It seemed as though I was always tired and now I notice a definite boost in the energy I have throughout the day!</li>
            <li> I must say I have never been into hair vitamins and their claims because I felt like it was all gimmicky foolishness.</li>
            <li> I started using the hair vitamins a few months ago and started to see results in 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any break outs, which I was quiet worried about.</li>
            <li> My hair was thin, and fragile after one week of them I could notice a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Now my hair has grown a few inches</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few.</li>
            <li> and I even gave my sisters a few bottles.</li>
            <li> I had a few bald spot in my head from Lupus making my hair fall out.</li>
            <li> also use the butter and the green tea conditionner.</li>
            <li> The thin ares around my temples are thickening back up</li>
            <li> I even dropped a few lbs.</li>
            <li> They are part of my everyday life.   </li>
            <li> I was truly missing my hair.</li>
            <li> I know people are against hair grown vitamins because they think they don&#x27;t work or are a sham</li>
            <li> I can walk out on the street with my natural hair and not feel insecure.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been taking them everyday like I&#x27;m suppose to.</li>
            <li> Within a few days she immediately noticed that her hair was looking fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li> Very skeptical at first</li>
            <li> I bought some this summer and have dreaded everyday I had to go without them thinking to myself, &amp;#34;dang,</li>
            <li> I have trouble with my edges thinning and these pills</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see what results I get in a few month..</li>
            <li> I definitely stand behind this product.  </li>
            <li> I had all my dead ends cut off.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first when I saw a lot of reviews about how these pills caused breakouts on your face.  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair all my life that only grows to shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I now have thick hair that gets curly when wet.</li>
            <li> I initially decided to purchased this product after I took out my box braids and noticed how thin my edges got.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m going to try it and give my review in a few months.</li>
            <li> ..will gain a few pounds..</li>
            <li> Also my mom hair grew and she had trouble with her hair.</li>
            <li> I was curious about some of the negative reviews I have read and just like any product.</li>
            <li> I just waste my money buying this product.</li>
            <li> I must say that after one month, my hair sheds less and thicker than usual.</li>
            <li> They were always long, but weak and would break off.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s long &amp; thick!</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t see a major difference...</li>
            <li> when I was like 12, before my mom started cutting out my perm in High school.</li>
            <li> The only thing I have to show for taking this product for 3 months is terrible skin due to constant breakouts despite drinking at least 3 liters of water daily eating a balanced diet and being active.</li>
            <li> Broke me out pretty badly on my cheeks and jawline.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn false nails for as long as I can remember, never again.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small, but you notice a change from bald to a little less bald.</li>
            <li> The pills didn&#x27;t slow that down</li>
            <li> A little skeptical about hair growth pills especially with hairinfinity</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve always been afraid of trying new things...</li>
            <li> I have to have at least a half an inch of growth</li>
            <li> Before, my hair was so thin, dry and damaged</li>
            <li> By the end of my second bottle, my hair is no longer thin, it is so thick that I have to moisturize it twice day.  </li>
            <li> my hair was longer, STRONGER, and thicker with little to no shedding!</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product for a little bit over a week, and I am ALREADY noticing changes!</li>
            <li> Some people see results in as little as 3 weeks!</li>
            <li> I just wanted to tell my little story!</li>
            <li> Within a week and a half I noticed my nails growing longer than usual (and my nails never grow!).</li>
            <li> and my hair has gotta thicker less shedding and even grew about an inch if not more already!</li>
            <li> and I drink very little fluids</li>
            <li> Problem is, I drink very little of anything.</li>
            <li> I had very little growth</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to try out the other products!!!</li>
            <li> not sure if I will continue to take it or reduce the dosage to one a day instead of two....</li>
            <li> Giving a three because I&#x27;m not really sure on what&#x27;s going on yet just giving an update on what I&#x27;ve noticed.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet....</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length and won&#x27;t seem to grow past that point.</li>
            <li> No more break out</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these vitamins for the past month</li>
            <li> Needless to say I am not a big fan of getting my hair cut</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with my results</li>
            <li> I had been having trouble with shading and once I started to take these pills it stop!</li>
            <li> I started using these vitamins after having my head shaved for 2 brain surgeries in the past year.</li>
            <li> These vitamins have grown my hair from neck length to arm pit length over the past 3 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Manetabolism-vitamins for the past 3 weeks and have seen growth in my hair already.</li>
            <li> I started using these vitamins in April and the amount of growth I have seen is UNBELIEVABLE.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s usually when I hit the wall at work</li>
            <li> My husband hair started falling out because he has Alopecia areata (AA) which  is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body, usually from the scalp.[1][2]</li>
            <li> Needless to say when we completed our two month &#x27;experiment&#x27; my hair had grown close to 2inches while hers had only grown close to one inch.</li>
            <li> Let me tel you that I have been struggling with this bald spot for the past 3 years, I have tried just about everything that I could find for balding.  </li>
            <li> These are freaking unbelievable</li>
            <li> My hair never grew past the nape of my neck now</li>
            <li> BUT they&#x27;re in a slick capsul</li>
            <li> I usually get close to an inch</li>
            <li> her hair is past her shoulders &amp; it has gotten thicker.</li>
            <li> My hair had never been past my shoulders and within 8 weeks my hair length surpassed my shoulders.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m usually a drab morning person</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for the past 6 months and my hair has never been healthier.</li>
            <li> Bought the pills but was skeptical well my hair dresser immediately noticed I was doing something different</li>
            <li> Scared To Try These At First , Because I Had Such An Awful Outcome With hairfinity.</li>
            <li> OH, also, they don&#x27;t taste or smell  HORRIBLE like most vitamins do.</li>
            <li> Nothing out the ordinary.</li>
            <li> My hair has been at about shoulder length for the past three years until I started taking the Manechoice supplement.</li>
            <li> so my next purchase ill be getting 4 bottles ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> Being a lifeguard and work in the heat all summer and swimming usually</li>
            <li> but I was never satisfied.</li>
            <li> My edges haven&#x27;t grown in the past 2 years and they grew in.</li>
            <li> I shed less and my hair is stronger than ever before!!</li>
            <li> I purchased manetabolism after scouring through all of the other hair vitamin options and every one of them had unwanted side effects like acne and some worse like stomach cramps.</li>
            <li> I had cut the front and edges of my hair very short as well because the damage was worse there( I know bad idea), and noticed my hair was coming back sooner than I thought.</li>
            <li> I bought these to help grow back my hair in the front since I cut it off due to heat damage( bad decision).</li>
            <li> Nails are so long everyone ask if they are fake ( they don&#x27;t break either ].</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had thick past shoulder length hair, but after the damage I had to cut it.</li>
            <li> (Sorry for making this a long review) 😛👍🏽</li>
            <li> My hairline thinned out from braids and excessive tension and now it is thick and growing.</li>
            <li> I had my hair in a protective style and once I took the protective style out my hair had grown at least an inch and a half!!</li>
            <li> My hair was thin, my nails brittle and weak and my skin dry - all signs of vitamin deficiencies...</li>
            <li> Hairfinity made my face breakout terribly, m nails were weak, and I did not see positive results until the second bottle.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I fell very ill for a few months and decided not to take my vitamins because I knew my body wouldn&#x27;t be absorbing any of the nutrients and benefits</li>
            <li> use to hardly even get one pimple before) and headaches.</li>
            <li> have always had a hard time digesting supplements or had adverse reactions.</li>
            <li> You have to take progression pics or it will be hard to tell, they are&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Was very skeptical about using this product but when I use it I see major changes in my hair...</li>
            <li> But so far I have not had any bad things to say about Mane hair vitamins I don&#x27;t get any of the breakouts or chest pains</li>
            <li> I will be filing a complaint with the BBB</li>
            <li> Some hand given me side effects that were negative and</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had one complaint yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never liked the growth and thinness of the hair.</li>
            <li> Ordered a 4-month supply back in August and my hair has been growing like crazy.</li>
            <li> I did not have any negative side effects.</li>
            <li> I remember when I took biotin last year my face broke out horribly, but while taking manetabolism I continued to drink plenty of water and my face stayed clear.</li>
            <li> So at least an inch was cut off ...</li>
            <li> But the second I get out of bootcamp I will splurge like I crazy.</li>
            <li> secondary to that is my hair</li>
            <li> I did the big chop and was so afraid to wear my hair out.</li>
            <li> I started using these vitamins in July because I was tired of being in the awkward stage of my natural hair journey.</li>
            <li> I saw the reviews and decided to at least order one bottle</li>
            <li> My hair has retained at least two inches of growth and still growing.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, it grows well but wanted a boost.</li>
            <li> My hair is already thick, so I can&#x27;t speak for that aspect.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars for the slow growth</li>
            <li> My hair was growing slowly</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who is experiencing slow growth, and breakage.</li>
            <li> I like my thick hair..</li>
            <li> My hair have always been thick.</li>
            <li> I started using them 4 months ago when I noticed my hair was just not as thick as it used to be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always been thick</li>
            <li> and I have thick hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s never been so thick and health</li>
            <li> My hair has never been thick</li>
            <li> I literally had minimal shedding while taking these pills!!!!!</li>
            <li> I suggest this over all of the other vitamins !!!!</li>
            <li> Buying into this product of course lead me to buy the other products as well !!!!</li>
            <li> and although I was skeptical about hair vitamins (i&#x27;ve tried two other brands to no avail)</li>
            <li> I mean thank you.</li>
            <li> I would DEFINITELY recommend Mantabolism to my friends, mom, church members, coworkers, and even random ppl on the street!</li>
            <li> My hair usually grows .25 inch per month!</li>
            <li> and my hair is (unbelievably) longer than it was BEFORE the cut!</li>
            <li> My hair was thin on the sides due to tight braids and weaves and every time I took my weave out I ended up cutting the sides of my hair because my hair was tangled in the sewing thread.</li>
            <li> After having my daughter in June my hair began to shed, thin, and I was overall really unhappy.</li>
            <li> Seriously.    </li>
            <li> If you are a little skeptical, it will not hurt to do your research or go look at this company&#x27;s Instagram or Facebook.</li>
            <li> poofy, hard to manage hair that was not a welcome change after child birth.</li>
            <li> I could not figure out why I had such a bad headache.</li>
            <li> It has been bad enough to cause me to stop using the product.</li>
            <li> Just all around NOT A GOOD LOOK.</li>
            <li> I tried everything you can think of oils, pills, herbal remedies, I was desperate one day I stumbled upon the main-choice vitamins, I took other vitamins with no luck and didn&#x27;t want to get my hopes but after reading reviews and seeing results I was sold.</li>
            <li> ( i mean seriously my nails grew like weeds!)</li>
            <li> With the last product I used my skin had broken out so bad that I had to go to the dermotologist for help.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully I can give it a 5, but that headache was pretty bad!!</li>
            <li> and I think for at least 1 year!</li>
            <li> Growing facial hair! :(</li>
            <li> I recently switched to the mane choice after being disappointed by hairfinity.</li>
            <li> At least 7 of my friends have now ordered Manetabolism because they see the impact it is having on my hair!</li>
            <li> I have tried acrylic polish and gel polish and they are still weak.</li>
            <li> THERE IS ONE NEGATIVE!</li>
            <li> So at first I started off with Hairinfinity &amp; it was horrible.</li>
            <li> Now my hair was already THICK before, but now it&#x27;s just something else!  </li>
            <li> Before I started using them my hair was breaking off sooo bad because it was so dry.</li>
            <li> Hairfinty grew my hair but broke my face and body out and left black marks horribly,</li>
            <li> The growth was VERY slow (almost as if it wasn&#x27;t working at ALL.)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve alway had very thick hair, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking VERY VERY slowly.</li>
            <li> but it is VERY thick.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to see my progress in a few months!!!</li>
            <li> Hairfinity made my hair thin and my skin clammy, so I stopped taking vitamins in acceptance that my edges were never coming in.</li>
            <li> The hair that hasn&#x27;t fallen out has broken off.  </li>
            <li> but then it got thin because of heredity.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy another bottle, just because it didn&#x27;t have much growth and the pills made my skin horrible!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t retain length, and it was also extremely thin.</li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair that stopped growing like 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> I take two pills at night, and I must say, I have not increased my water intake from what I was already drinking, and I have not experienced any abnormal breakouts.</li>
            <li> The relaxer made my hair so thin</li>
            <li> Let me just say, though, that I have poor eating habits</li>
            <li> I have NOT experienced any breakouts.</li>
            <li> Not to mention I have not experienced any breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I was on them and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel so thin anymore</li>
            <li> but neither did it make the shedding worse.</li>
            <li> my acne has gotten worse and makes me feel like I am a teenager again with all the breakouts ...</li>
            <li> I was so tired of feeling like my hair wasn&#x27;t growing</li>
            <li> I tired hairfinity for two months and it made my hair thinner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve Always Had Thin Edges</li>
            <li> she was gonna share her secret basically.</li>
            <li> My hair was thin and see through, it is now fuller longer and healthier than it has ever been.</li>
            <li> I have really thin hair.</li>
            <li> I also had brittle thin nails.</li>
            <li> and I was really tired of my TWA phase.</li>
            <li> With other products I get bad headaches and with theses, nothing.</li>
            <li> These vitamins are seriously heaven sent!</li>
            <li> I saw results in 2 weeks seriously!</li>
            <li> I was very ill a few months ago.</li>
            <li> I am a very impatient person and my 3c/4a curls are at an awkward length</li>
            <li> She was so shocked, we ended up going half on a 12 mth supply.</li>
            <li> I seen the testimonies and was shocked, still a little skeptical.so me and my mother tried the one month challenge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Almost forgot, my nails grew like crazy and was hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> My hair will then become thin and damaged from excessive heat that even though I know is bad for y hair, I still insist on using.</li>
            <li> I felt weird and nauseated, sleepy, and my stomach started cramping.</li>
            <li> I had ance and ance scars real bad but its clear</li>
            <li> I am always a little suspicious of Amazon reviews because I do not know who is real or fake, but when it came to this product I watched the benefits from these vitamins for myself on Instagram.</li>
            <li> I suffered from heat damage and thin edges from wearing weaves and tight protective styles, well I&#x27;ll tell you after taking the vitamins for 6 months my edges are growing slow but at least they are growning!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My nails are very very weak.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, no more Dominican blow outs for this girl!!!</li>
            <li> and ive lost all that weight plus usually another 1 or 2 pounds!!!</li>
            <li> Th shedding started with the second bottle and keeps getting worst by the minute.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately after three months using this product, my hair was thinning.</li>
            <li> , it unfortunately did not do that for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these didnt work for me.</li>
            <li> The sad part is they don&#x27;t care and won&#x27;t give a refund.</li>
            <li> Needless to say after six months of taking this vitamin I did not see any hair, skin or nails improvements.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> but I seems that I was wrong</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this hair vitamin, but figured that there was no harm in ordering a one month supply and trying it out for myself.  </li>
            <li> BOY WAS I WRONG.</li>
            <li> My nails grow at the same rate and are still terribly brittle.</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong with any of the mane choice products.</li>
            <li> I purchased these vitamins after making the horrible decision to get a really short hair cut!</li>
            <li> I dont even wanna risk taking them with the fake reviews</li>
            <li> You can check reviews date on 22 September , all in one day and looks fake.</li>
            <li> Seems FAKE</li>
            <li> ; wrong.  </li>
            <li> Creams oils  pills shampoos that all failed..</li>
            <li> I am ABSOLUTELY obsessed with the Mane Choice products.</li>
            <li> If you have been skeptical about purchasing any Mane Choice product please do not hesitate anymore.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I took a million pictures of my grown out color and even waited a couple months to get my hair colored again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely horrible with drinking enough water sometimes.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with their products.</li>
            <li> Even with all my excitement,  I was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re suffering from any form of hair loss whether it be hereditary, or from the wrong hairstyles</li>
            <li> I was really sad about my bald/weak spot that&#x27;s was caused by stress.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I see results around my edges of my hair ,i like the product.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it consistently but can definitely see fullness and growth</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really rate it, just started taking it and it&#x27;s my second day, but my face feel very irritated and itchy.....my scalp too....not sure if I will continue to take it or reduce the dosage to one a day instead of two....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product.  I have only been taking it for two weeks.  I have notice the difference in my finger nails.  They are stronger and does not chip and break easily as before.  That is a plus. Have not seen any difference in my hair as of yet.  But I have notice a break out in my face.  I am starting to drink more water to see if that will flush the product out of my system and alleviate the problem.  I had been taking hairfinity  for the last 6-8 months and remembered having the same  breakout problem within the first couple of weeks of taking it as well.  It only lasted a few days and wasn&#x27;t and is not now very noticeable.  Most of the breakout is gone and they lasted for three days at the most.  I am waiting until I complete this bottle to give my final review and decide whether I will continue to take this for three months as I did with harifinity.  Again as with hairfinity, I did not see a difference in my hair the first month of taking the product.  So if the breakout continues to clear and nothing else happens I will probably use it for three months and write another review of my results. .  All in all, right now it&#x27;s just  an ok product.  5/5/15 One Month- I see a difference in the texture of my hair.  I do not have as much shedding as before taking Manetabolism.  With Manetabolism I do not notice any increase in hair growth as I do with Hairfinity, but my hair seems to be stronger.  I have not notice anything different with my skin other than the break outs I no longer have, and as for my nails,  they last a little longer than with Hairfinity but started to chip and break as well.  I have started my second bottle (5/2/15) and will update my review at the beginning of the next bottle..  I will give it the three month test to see whether it is something I will continue to use.  7/8/15 Bottle #3- I am having the worst shedding in the world. I touch my hair and hair comes out. I brush my teeth and hair falls out. Not going to complete this last bottle. Th shedding started with the second bottle and keeps getting worst by the minute. Hair has down but did not retain length with all the shedding. Going back to my hairfinity.</li>
            <li> My hair has definitely grown</li>
            <li> Works fast !!!! Hair is growing fast I can tell because I just got my hair colored and it&#x27;s already growing out</li>
            <li> My friend had great results with manetabolism but unfortunately after three months using this product, my hair was thinning. Yes it made my hair grow,  but it made my hair thin, especially around my edges and the ends of my hair. . I have thick hair, it grows well but wanted a boost. I really wanted to like manetabolism but they did not work for me.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is different, another friend experienced the same results as me and others I know  are having excellent results.  If you are reading this, just because I gave it 3 stars, does not mean it will not work for you...Give them try and see how  they work for your hair, who knows you  may be one of the lucky ones.&lt;br /&gt;Almost forgot, my nails grew like crazy and was hard as a rock. My friend who is having great results with her hair,  manetabolism had no affect on her nails,  her nails are still weak, go figure? Also I live in Canada and when I ordered from the main site,  product comes within a week and they have excellent customer service.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle and my hair have gotten thicker and longer my edges have grown in alot after 1 bottle ..... no side effects happened to me..... so far I&#x27;m loving this product and it only been a month yessssss</li>
            <li> This product did NOT work, i bought this two months ago hoping it would do justice for my hair but it was a waste of money and time.&lt;br /&gt;The product claims to provide the body with natural nourishments to promote thickness and faster growth, it unfortunately did not do that for me. If i could i would give this product zero stars. The first month of trying out this product, there was not results, and so with high hopes i tried for another month, don&#x27;t waste your time trying this product.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle it work ...</li>
            <li> This made my hair flourish it made it stronger I was able to retain the length and my natural hair journey was absolutely enjoyable my edges grew back after years of thinking that they would never grow back my hair was shoulder length about 4 months ago now its armpit length I love these vitamins. I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about 2 weeks now and I&#x27;ve seen growth already.</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing these from the actual website since shipping was free and you pay more on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pic on the left was Thanksgiving and the pic on the right was October.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered these after looking through people&#x27;s testimonials of how these helped with their hair loss. I had a sew-in during the summer and the woman braided so tight that she pulled out my edges where the closure was installed. Normally, I don&#x27;t wear weave, but I was getting bored with the natural look. I&#x27;d advise women to be super careful with who they let braid their hair or they&#x27;ll end up like I did. Anyway, I went a whole month on hairfinity and didn&#x27;t noticd much of a difference in my hair, though my skin looked pretty good. I&#x27;ve been taking these for about 10 days and already see my edges starting to fill back in, where they hadn&#x27;t while I was using hairfinity. I&#x27;m not one of those people who breaks out or gets headaches from vitamins so I didn&#x27;t experience any of those symptoms (this is probably because I only drink water).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these didnt work for me. I experienced so much unimaginable shedding of hair from my head since taking them: hair on the floor, hair in the drain, hair on my clothes, hair practically falling out on wash day, hair falling on others! This really upset me so I stopped taking these after just a month. I only took half of the dosage which was one pill a day to ensure I didnt overwhelm my system and these were my results. However although my nails did grow there was no real change in my skin. I can say that a few years back after taking botin alone I experienced abnormal hair growth like new eyelashes growing sideways lol, my hair breaking midway from the root to the ends and where I could grab it and pull it out (extreme breakage) and some other wierd things so I am probably one of thoses persons who just cannot handle large amounts of biotin in my system, also I took these with zinc so I didnt get that much breakouts. I wish that this product worked for me, given all the good reviews but my hair is thinner and lifeless since using it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not working out for me , it&#x27;s been a month</li>
            <li> Still waiting on results still. Maybe I need another 30 days.</li>
            <li> I literally can&#x27;t express how much these vitamins have helped my life. I&#x27;d worn weave consistently for almost 9 years. I was one of the girls who got sewins days sometimes hours between each other. Once I went natural I finally realized how bad my edges had gotten. My hair was literally growing in the pattern of a sew in! So i started taking hair vitamins. First it was generic brands, then hairfinity. Hairfinity made my hair thin and my skin clammy, so I stopped taking vitamins in acceptance that my edges were never coming in. I cried a many of nights because  of it. Then, my step team wanted to wear pony tails and I was like my edges on a jumbotron no bueno. One other girl told  me about  Mane Choice. I read reviews, looked at YouTube videos, stalked her Instagram, but what sold me was it being  based in Alabama. I&#x27;m  an Alabama  native, so  I had to support  the home team. The rest  is history, I&#x27;m  about  2 months in and I have  edges. I can comb through my edges! I use it with a combo of JBCO and Emu oil and the rests are outstanding! During  Christmas  my sister even pointed out what was once baldness was now hair! Needless to say, I&#x27;m  a true addict. My only cons would  be talking before  bed is a bad idea, I was wide awake. And it threw my cycle off, but I&#x27;m  sure  it was just my body getting  used to it.</li>
            <li> LOve this product in a month I can see growth.  Fast shipping will buy again</li>
            <li> So far I noticed a difference with my hair. It has definitely grown longer and thicker. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. The 3rd week I notice 1 and 1/2 inch of growth. I wish I had ordered 2 bottles instead of 1. Now I got to order on Friday.</li>
            <li> Giving a three because I&#x27;m not really sure on what&#x27;s going on yet just giving an update on what I&#x27;ve noticed. My hair is currently in a protective style almost finished with the bottle but my nails break more than they grow I have headaches with these but my skin did not breakout and my head be itching like a crack addict lol hopefully its growing tho. Will do a hair review after I take my hair down</li>
            <li> I have just starting using yesterday so can leave a review as to if it works or not but when I read a review about them shortening quantity I decided to count mine and low and behold my 1st bottle is short 11 pills and that is a lot!!! I&#x27;m see that as a rip off because if you add that up after buying 6 month supply you are actually only getting 5 month supply and they are costly</li>
            <li> I usually use Hairfinity , but wanted to give this a try because I saw that the vitamins were double to what were used in Hairfinity. Overall, I did not see a big change in my hair. Actually my hair has been shedding a great deal. I&#x27;m not sure if its the product or the weather, but I definitely didn&#x27;t see any positive changes to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have not really seen any growth.</li>
            <li> Saw some hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> I have to what and see</li>
            <li> to soon to tell if it works</li>
            <li> love it starting to see some results</li>
            <li> Horrible results my hair has been falling out in clumps. The hair that hasn&#x27;t fallen out has broken off.  I bought this product thinking it would improve my hair but has done the opposite. The sad part is they don&#x27;t care and won&#x27;t give a refund. They onky care about selling bottles. Very unhappy customer. I will be filing a complaint with the BBB</li>
            <li> I brought this for my daughter  she says it work for her and continue to use it</li>
            <li> I purchased these pills with hopes of quick regrowth after shaving bald for the army back in 2012. The growth was VERY slow (almost as if it wasn&#x27;t working at ALL.) I feel as though those who claim to have success with it are under a sort of placebo effect because I am seeing no difference at all in time it takes to regrow or the health of it compared to natural growth. 0/10 would never recommend spending money on this (I received as a gift from my best friend from the corp, what a waste of a birthday)</li>
            <li> Started taking the pills last month and I&#x27;ve been wowed with the length its grown; I had my braids redone four weeks ago and within a week the braids were slipping off because my hair was growing THAT fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 4 instead because it made me break out no matter how much water I drank. It has helped my hair grow a bit faster but most of all I see more baby hairs than anything. If you start to break out &amp; you know you need a clear face by a certain date all I gotta say is don&#x27;t take the pills.</li>
            <li> My experience with this product is as i was taking it as directed i started to notice bumps on my face, so I altered my intake to just one pill a day and things are just fine.  I have notice that my hair look and feels thicker and i have noticed some growth.</li>
            <li> extremely good I haven&#x27;t finished my 30 days but I already see improvement my nails and hair are growing so nicely and ive never been able to grow my nails! Thank You so much</li>
            <li> I am a Hairdresser, and I can honestly say this vitamin supplement is revolutionary. It&#x27;s for all hair types and backgrounds, some people assume its only for female afro-centric hair types from their reviews and photos, but I am a caucasian male with ultra-fine hair, it wasn&#x27;t budging in length for months, I started taking this in february, and by may I have grown 4.5 inches of thick, strong tresses, which is remarkable because hair growth is averaged out at 1/2 and inch a month. It&#x27;s brilliant what the body can do with the right nutrients! plus it is very affordable and extremely safe, I even recommend it to my clients!</li>
            <li> Its really good I would suggest any women of any race to try this for hair growth...</li>
            <li> My friend from school got me on this product and I love it ... the pills, shampoos and conditioners all of it is great!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for close to 3 weeks now. I could not figure out why I had such a bad headache. I finally linked it to this. Instead of 2 daily I take one and it helps. As far as hair growth, I&#x27;m not sure just yet. I do think it&#x27;s making my nails grow, so my hair is probably growing , too. I have type 3c hair, so I can not really see how long it is until I straighten it. There are lots of vitamins in it, so I don&#x27;t think that you need to spend more money on a multi-vitamin! I will update once I straighten my hair. Hopefully I can give it a 5, but that headache was pretty bad!!</li>
            <li> it  works and Im ordering more</li>
            <li> Great Product!!!! Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great hair vitamin. Better than the others I tried, like Hairfinity.</li>
            <li> This definitely works but It gave me these gangsta painful pimples. My skin is sensitive but I&#x27;ve never had acne before. I found that when I opened the capsules and mixed it with my protein drinks the acne went away. I think for me it just needed to be mixed with something else in order to digest it. Once my hair started to grow it was on a roll! Took about 3 weeks before I realized....hey my hair is growing. Kinda snuck up on me. I keep my hair up in a loose bun majority of the time. I have 10 more days worth of pills left and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  My hair and skin are loving these vitamins after just 2 weeks.  I&#x27;ll keep you posted.</li>
            <li> I took the pills last year and had great results so I decided to take them this summer. So I took the ManeChoice Plus and I can honestly say it was the worst decision!  The &amp;#34;Plus&amp;#34; pill caused me to breakout and have tones of headaches. Also my hair didn&#x27;t grow like it did the first I took the pills.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say because I only been use it for 5 days</li>
            <li> Love this product. I noticed that my hair didn&#x27;t shed as much and that its thicker than ever! My nails are growing too</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a difference in my hair with these. Definitely did not work. My hair is down by my collar bone and the texture is tight, little curls. I would say the other products worked in moisturizing my hair but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> The delivery was too fast ..I was surprise n please with it..I will update pic when I finish n see results..Finger Cross</li>
            <li> I read awesome reviews on this so I decided to get a bottle. I&#x27;m almost done with it and I haven&#x27;t noticed any spectacular growth as opposed to what most of the reviews on here say. Giving it two starts though cause little growth is still something.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd round of taking the supplement and already my stylist has noticed a change in hairgrowth. I will try another bottle which will be a 90 day period to compare the overall results.</li>
            <li> I just started taking the Manetabolism Vitamins and have not seen a difference, because I was already taking Hair, Skin &amp; Nails Vitamins.  I will continue these for a couple of months and follow-up with another review or whether there&#x27;s an improvement.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about the product since I just started taking it for a week. I hope to see results. I am happy that it has not caused any headaches or stomach problems like other products. If I am happy with the results after 30 days, I may buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work. just buy biotin and save the extra money</li>
            <li> Product arrived as promised</li>
            <li> I am pn my 3rd bottle and I have not noticed ANY new growth. I have emailed them with my concerns and I have yet to get a response. Deeply disappointed.</li>
            <li> This made my hair texture softer , and I achover an inch or so in a month . Yay healthier hair</li>
            <li> So many vendors are starting to post reviews on their own products.  Wish Amazon would find a way to stop this.  Hopefully, all are looking at the reviews and dates they were written as a precaution.  Remember, 5 stars is perfect, and there is no such thing as a perfect product.  No company can make &amp;#34;everyone&amp;#34; happy so at least think reasonably when reviewing a product.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!!Great product</li>
            <li> Not sure yet....give me a month</li>
            <li> if anyone says this product doesn&#x27;t work or makes you smell fishy you&#x27;re probably not drinking enough water with it. I started seeing results within 3 weeks and i don&#x27;t take both tabs at once but i drink one bottle of water per tab.</li>
            <li> Hair seems healthier!</li>
            <li> Love it my hair is growing rapidly in a week i already had new growth</li>
            <li> Fantastic product! It really does make your hair grow super fast! If you&#x27;re looking for thicker, longer and healthier hair, then this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> I started Manetabolism May forth and I can say I see result already. I can say this is a frist for me.I have tryed other products and was not very pleased I will continue to use Manetabolism. Thank you for helping me on my hair joinery</li>
            <li> I believe this product really does work. My hair is already thick, so I can&#x27;t speak for that aspect. I do however see a lot of growth and my hair definitely feels a lot healthier (stronger, less breakage, and more elasticity).</li>
            <li> Notice how most of the 5 star reviews are all from the same day? I&#x27;ll never respect a company that has to resort to deceit to sell a product THAT DOESN&#x27;T WORK. These pills have done LITERALLY NOTHING for me. It was just a waste of money and I regret that I bought them. If anything these pills have slowed my hair growth somehow. I am relaxed with brastrap -length hair and I always know when I have new growth because of the difference of textures but I had literally none. I didn&#x27;t notice new growth until a month after I finished taking these pills and it was very little. I will never buy these again and wouldn&#x27;t recommend them to anyone. Save your money and just buy Biotin.</li>
            <li> Just like the picture. It hasn&#x27;t been long enough to tell if it works but I can see some improvement in hair growth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see anything yet, still waiting to see the difference, it&#x27;s my third one so, let&#x27;s wait and see</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well. As regular hair and skin vitamins</li>
            <li> It made my head hurt so bad that I stopped taking it.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for those with acne prone skin. Broke me out pretty badly on my cheeks and jawline. Took about a month to clear up. I think I will just stick to getting my biotin from food and accepting the length of my hair and the rate it grows.</li>
            <li> A great hair journey.</li>
            <li> I purchased the six month supply of this vitamin since that&#x27;s seems adaquete time to see a difference in your hair growth. I read all the wonderful reviews and did my research on the product.  My hair is shoulder length and won&#x27;t seem to grow past that point. I was hoping after taking this vitamin I would see growth. Needless to say after six months of taking this vitamin I did not see any hair, skin or nails improvements. However, I noticed after six months of taking this vitamin I did experience hair breakage in the middle of my head. Unfortunately, this product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> This works my hair and nails are beautiful!!</li>
            <li> I bought a two month supply of these pills from the original website ( I came to Amazon to see if I can get my next supply cheaper, and I can&#x27;t) Anyway, these worked nicely on my hair and nails. I&#x27;ve never had problems with acne so I noticed no change there. But, my nails grew stronger (not necessarily longer, but i was able to retain length) with these and my hair did gain some texture. I didn&#x27;t get ravaging growth, but it did jump start my growth because before I started I was getting absolutely none. Over the two months i got a little over two inches. Also, it is important to drink water and maintain a reasonable diet in order to see results. My first month on the pills I had just started college and I was eating and drinking whatever, whenever. My second month I cleaned up my diet and drank more water and non - sugary drinks and I saw better results.</li>
            <li> The Manetabolism Healthy Hair Vitamin is a great product, I&#x27;m already witnessing results after 2 weeks of usage.</li>
            <li> No complaints here. I didn&#x27;t do measurements because I really bought it for shedding. But these are my two month results. I kinda used my tatt as my gauge...and shedding has decreased SIGNIFICANTLY.</li>
            <li> I took Hairfinity for a month and didn&#x27;t notice any growth until the last week and it wasn&#x27;t even near a half an inch so I decided to switch to Manetabolism . I&#x27;m not even finished with my first bottle and I have new growth jumping out my roots. I have to have at least a half an inch of growth and I have to get my braids re done! I love manetabolism, I&#x27;ve been natural for about 3 years and my hair grows slowwww but I&#x27;m hoping The Mane Choice will help me reach my hair goals . I&#x27;m also not the type to experience symptoms so I have none. I also haven&#x27;t seen significant growth in my nails but I jus want beautiful long hair to be honest lol anywho Manetabolism has a lifetime customer !</li>
            <li> These pills are great. I would recommend going to the actual website tho. They cost $24.99 there.</li>
            <li> I started taken them may 29th,and the first month, I didn&#x27;t see ANY results, so I thought maybe I should try a second bottle, well I&#x27;m half way done with it, and I&#x27;m finally seeing some growth (although my results are nothing like the ones u see on IG) but I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars for the slow growth,bad acne break outs(I use to hardly even get one pimple before) and headaches.</li>
            <li> So far so good.. ..in about 2 weeks I saw an inch in growth but one area..</li>
            <li> I rated it a 3 because I haven&#x27;t noticed any harm it did to my hair neither have I noticed any good it did.  I have taken it for 60 days.  It was recommended to me by my neice who gave me a bottle.  After thirty days, I thought I needed a little more time so I ordered 2 more bottles from amazon and to date, I really don&#x27;t seed any advantange.</li>
            <li> Ok I don&#x27;t really write comments or do surveys but I really need to do this one. So about 2 months ago I purchase this product off the manetabolism instagram page and I can honestly say it really works. Don&#x27;t get me wrong it took some time before i saw any results but it worked. In my opinion its better to see results then nothing at all. After 2months my edges was growing back and now I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> I too have experienced breakouts beyond belief. I&#x27;ve increased my water intake and even backed down to 1 pill/day and still broke out.  Currently I have a hard boil like pimple on my face that is utterly embarrassing. I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s a hair bump because not to take anything away from the pills because I did notice I was shaving more often than usual but the breakouts are too much.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my girlfriend! it didn&#x27;t help at all with the condition of her hair, after reading all these reviews I figured this would work great but I seems that I was wrong the reviews here are very misleading be careful!</li>
            <li> I tried the first 30 day supply just to see how much growth would be added to my hair and it truly works</li>
            <li> The owner of Manetabolism likes to comepare her products to hairfinity. I find itvery weired that there&#x27;s been an increase of 300-400 reviews on this product, yet for months there were only but a few reviews and most were not so great. Anyways, I have user this product! The pills are not that great if you are looking for length but I DID experience more thickness in my hair consistentlyconsistently over 40 days out a 60 Day supply... I personally think Hair skin and nails (easy pickup at the store) + 1 biotin a day is better for length. Additionally: the deep conditioner that she sells is HIGHLY overpriced</li>
            <li> Drink lots of water while using this product , it made me break out :(</li>
            <li> I have used over the counter pills , nature made, that have produced better outcomes.</li>
            <li> These really work, my hair is much thicker and longer. I just love these vitamins.</li>
            <li> I love these vitamins I notice a change already  in my hair already and this is my first bottle</li>
            <li> I love this product you can actually see and feel the results I like this product better than hairfinity I&#x27;ve seen more progress with the main choice in 2 months than I seen with 6 months of hairfinity</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot I was expecting it on August 6 but hey i will take it today no problem ...this was the fastest shipment I ever had ..I will start using it soon and update yall ..</li>
            <li> FINALLY! A product that works. I&#x27;ve tried several different supplements. Some hand given me side effects that were negative and others just did nothing. I&#x27;ve been using for a couple weeks and I already feel a difference in my hair&#x27;s overall health! THANK YOU MANECHOICE TEAM</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of the vitamins and just received my 2-month supply in the mail.  I&#x27;ve been taking these pills religiously and have noticed less shedding before, during, and after deep conditioning and washing.  In addition to the reduced shedding I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair has grown a few inches.  The last time I measured my length my hair was about 16&amp;#34; all around.  I don&#x27;t have my measuring tape on hand (I&#x27;m definitely buying the length check t-shirt next) but when I stretch my hair it now reaches under my breasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am super excited!  I have been on a journey to regrow my hair after dyeing my hair blonde and cutting it all off and starting over.  My hair was growing slowly but I feel that the Manetabolism Healthy Hair Vitamins has helped to speed up the process.  Hair growth is a long process so it requires patience but with these vitamins your hair will grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus!!  I am a recovering nail biter and have stopped biting my nails for about a year or so now and since I&#x27;ve been taking the vitamins I&#x27;ve noticed that my nails do not chip or break as often.  My nails use to be super soft and it took everything to keep them from breaking but now they don&#x27;t break as easily and they&#x27;re growing stronger.</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product! Have been using this for for 4 months now and I have seen tremendous growth! Definitely a MUST BUY!</li>
            <li> This is a product that gave me confidence within myself and my hair. My hair felt as thought it would NEVER grow until taking these Hair Growth Pills. I will recommend this product to the end of the world. This is truly a WINNER!!! Thank you so much for creating a product that grants faith and confidence in your customers.</li>
            <li> These pills are amazing. I can&#x27;t wait until my next purchase . I recommend them for faster thicker hair growth . Guaranteed purchase .</li>
            <li> One word: Awesomeness!!!</li>
            <li> These pills are amazing. I brought them back in September and I have already seen growth! I am excited to try all other products!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these vitamins! I initially tried Hairfinity which literally broke me out from head to toe but these work beautifully! I am a regular customer and am constantly referring and advising them to use these products.</li>
            <li> This product is the BOMB, it really really works. My nails have gotten stronger and longer.  I was very skeptical at first but after seeing all the pictures and reviews on instagram I purchased two bottles during their 20% off promotion and that was the best investment I ever made. Guys please buy this product. Do not knock it till u try it. It works fast and grows hair fast n healthy. No acne or bad breakouts. I even read where someone stated that it changed their cycle (REALLY) this product has made my skin much healthier and I truly believe it has helped with my immune system also. This is a great product and can not wait to try the rest of the line.</li>
            <li> These vitamins are seriously heaven sent! I thank God for them. I took these vitamins and my hair started growing within two weeks! my hair was longer, STRONGER, and thicker with little to no shedding! I am so grateful for these vitamins because my hair started to fall out due to stress and these vitamins saved my life! i am so happy i found them due to following the owner&#x27;s IG page, Courtney! she is so awesome! and so is her hair!!!! Dont believe me? go follow @themanechoice on Instagram now, youll see alot more testimonies and proof of its work and so many other great products. I promise you wont regret it!!&lt;br /&gt;  Blessings!!</li>
            <li> I had a fresh protective style in and decided to try these.... It went great for my hair and nails... not so much for the style.&lt;br /&gt;By two weeks in [this is skipping days as well because I have a horrible memory about taking pills] my nails were strong and growing,  and i had an inch of new growth. I paused the pills until I wanted to take out the style and resumed taking them a few days before. My curl pattern was completely back and it stayed that way, when normally after the twists are taken out it would eventually work its way back into the different textures.  I couldn&#x27;t be more excited to have my pre heat damage curls and length back.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this hair vitamin, but figured that there was no harm in ordering a one month supply and trying it out for myself.  Wrong! I should&#x27;ve ordered a two month supply...better yet, a four month supply. lol! This hair vitamin is simply AMAZING! Not only have i noticed significant hair growth, i have also noticed less shedding when I wash my hair, and my hair is much fuller and thicker.  I&#x27;m a &amp;#34;naturalista&amp;#34;, but earlier this year i decided to color my hair and did one too many Dominican blow outs. My hair wasn&#x27;t incredibly coarse to begin with so it straightened out nicely and looked delicious...unfortunately it refused to completely revert after I wet it and it became obvious that I sustained some damage.  Some of my ends were straighter than others and those nice spiral curls and bounce I once had were gone.  I started using this product with high hopes for my hair to be restored back to its former luster.  Today, I can honestly say that the results have been nothing short of amazing.  Looking forward to receiving my next order so that I can continue on my healthy hair journey.  Meanwhile, no more Dominican blow outs for this girl!!!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with the Manetabolism vitamins! These vitamins have not only brought me insane hair growth, but my hair is much thicker, shinier, curlier, and the change in my hair&#x27;s overall health is just so obvious. My starting point was just above &amp;#34;bra-strap length&amp;#34; and after i finished bottle 3, i was at &amp;#34;mid-back length&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m currently on bottle 4 and I can&#x27;t wait to see where my hair reaches now. Goal: waist length healthy hair: and with these products, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be there in no time!!! Follow me on Instagram @naturallybre to see my review in pictures!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking the mane choice vitamins for 6 weeks now and I&#x27;ve seen AMAZING results. I take both pills in the morning and I drink 8 bottles of water through the day to reduce the risk of break outs that are caused by biotin. I&#x27;ve recommended this to all of my friends. I plan on trying the shampoo and conditioner soon. I highly recommend the mane choice hair vitamins to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for vitamins to help with my hair growth for years because of hair dryness, shedding, breakage from sew-ins, and basically not wanting to grow. Then I found The Mane Choice. I was a little skeptical at first because of all the other brands I tried. They didn&#x27;t help at all but I decided to give it a one month trial anyway. I must say that after one month, my hair sheds less and thicker than usual. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes. Even my husband noticed the growth and wanted to try it for himself. Since then, every time I have a little money left over I would order two jars of The Mane Choice Vitamins for me and my husband. We have never been more happier with the results and more satisfied with our appearance. We are ready for our third month supply and excited to continue on with our journey. I have also purchased the &amp;#34;Doesn&#x27;t Get Much BUTTER Than This&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;Green Tea &amp; Carrot Deep Conditioning Mask&amp;#34; using these products while taking these vitamins works wonders for my hair. I am sold and don&#x27;t need to look any further. Thanks for such a wonderful product!!</li>
            <li> I purchased my first bottle in July of 2014 and experienced a tremendous amount of growth in my hair and especially my nails. My hairline grew in thicker and fuller. Thanks Mane Choice!</li>
            <li> I purchased #Manetabolism over a month ago and the results are ASTONISHING ! I love this product and will definitely purchase more!</li>
            <li> The Mane Choice vitamin pills are amazing! I did the big chop May 28, 2014, then started my mane choice journey on June 4th. Not only did I start seeing results fast within my hair, but my nails were growing stronger and healthier too. On June 29th, I dyed my hair green. Now, looking back from June 4th to June 29th my hair looked great!! It felt beautiful and looked it. Before I even cut my hair, I used to have sort of a bald spot on the side of my head. After making a collage on July 3rd, I can&#x27;t tell you how much it made my day seeing that there was hair in that bald spot. Hair can have so much meaning and for me it was getting my confidence back. I&#x27;m very bold and dramatic when it comes to my hair, so for that I&#x27;m picky. I picked Mane Choice because I&#x27;ve seen the results and consistency with it. If you&#x27;re having any doubts please just try it, and promise you won&#x27;t regret it! What&#x27;s your choice? (;</li>
            <li> These pills are amazing. I&#x27;ve only been using them for 1 month and i already see amazing results around my edges. Thanks The Mane Choice</li>
            <li> These pills are awesome as simple as that!!!!</li>
            <li> The Manetabolism Hair Vitamins are amazing! I&#x27;ve tried other things to assist with my skin, hair, and nails and I always found myself breaking out. With using these vitamins, I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts to date. Also, my nails are much stronger, my edges are fuller and my hair has grown so much in places where it was really short. I use to have a really short piece of hair in the middle of my head and I was told that it wouldn&#x27;t grow because of my nerves. It&#x27;s safe to say, it has grown! Woo Hoo, this is quality at it&#x27;s best. I encourage anyone to try these vitamins and see what they can personally do for you. I&#x27;m almost certain that you will have a positive and productive experience. Also, might I add that their customer service experience is really great. They will respond to any of your questions, comments and concerns that you may have! Not only are their products great, their brand is great! They&#x27;re products enhance your life! Everyone knows that when you look better, you feel better! So, go on and try some Manetabolism and amp your confidence, hair length, skin and nails!</li>
            <li> I purchased two bottles of the manetabolism hair vitamins over the summer. I immediately noticed how my nails were growing much longer than they had before, and I&#x27;m a nail biter. I am transitioning and have been growing my natural hair for a little over two years. I was very pleased with the growth that I saw after using my first bottle and really look forward to using my second bottle. I hadn&#x27;t had a chance to continue with my second bottle, but I did notice my hair continued to grow stronger/thicker and so do my nails which I definitely attribute to manetabolism. And one other thing, I have tried other hair vitamins (hairfinity) and they did not work for me since they counteract with medication I must take daily. Manetabolism did not do this! I was very happy about that because it meant I could continue taking manetabolism and not worry it was counteracting with my other medication.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair vitamin I&#x27;ve tried. It makes my hair stronger. I literally had minimal shedding while taking these pills!!!!! Awesome product!!!!! Thanks Mane Choice.</li>
            <li> These pills are truly a blessing. The best man made item you could ever get. I rememeber I kept seeing the reviews for these pills all over my instagram and the hair growth was phenomenal like I couldn&#x27;t believe you in just one month you could gain all that hair growth. So I had to go buy me a bottle. Manechoice manetabolism pills are the best thing that could happen to my hair. It made it so much thicker and IT GREW. I finally reach my goal of collar bone length with those amazing pills. My hair even stop shedding less. Then the wonders it did for my nails. I promise you it felt like my nails grew over night. And the nail bed was so much stronger that I couldn&#x27;t trim my nails. I don&#x27;t know about anybody else but I truly thank Courtney for sharing her hair magic with us. And I&#x27;m definitely going to be purchasing a six month supply real soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that include biotin but the Mane Choice has worked wonders for me. I love this product. It helps my hair grow fuller and faster. I also love that it includes vitamins that help to boost my energy. Ladies and Gentleman, this is the vitamin you won&#x27;t regret buying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different kinds of regular hair, skin, and nail vitamins as well as Hairfinity pills. The Mane Choice vitamins are the first to actually show results. I&#x27;ve had a bald spot in the middle of my head for 7 years and I&#x27;ve had treatments from a specialist. The treatments never worked but shortly after I started taking these vitamins I noticed growth! These pills have been a lifesaver for me and I&#x27;ve only used 2 bottles. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after the next 2 bottles!</li>
            <li> I first purchased these vitamins in the spring hoping to thicken my hair.  All I can say is WOW!!!  My hair is so much thicker than it previously was before I started taking these vitamins.  I didn&#x27;t think they would work for me because I am anemic,but I started taking these,and of course I realized if I can take 2 hair vitamins,I could certainly take my iron pills also. I highly recommend these vitamins.  Now I want to try the conditioners,and all the other products!</li>
            <li> As most people are with these hair growth products, I was skeptical. But after trying these growth pills and doing length checks, I was made a believer! I had a lot of really bad breakage and had to get a good bit of my hair cut. I started taking my two month supply shortly after to help get my length back. Not only did I get it back, but I&#x27;m retaining it well. 2 inches in 2 months. Two pills in the morning with your breakfast will change your hair life for the better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Common questions: no, I didn&#x27;t break out, and no, hair does not grow more in other places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The maker of these vitamins is such a beautiful person inside and out from what I can tell from reading about her. She&#x27;s touching so many lives with her products and I thank her for this. I don&#x27;t know her personally but it&#x27;s amazing for good people to have great success in helping others.</li>
            <li> For starters, I have ALWAYS been a fan of Courtney&#x27;s!!! Such a blessed and humble  woman. I&#x27;ve never met her personally, but if you follow her on social networks it&#x27;s very obvious of how beautiful her spirit is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Hair Vitamins are definitely worth buying!!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! Within the first 2 weeks I noticed NOT ONLY 1 inch of hair growth, but I had stronger nail growth, and longer lashes. You think HairFinity/Biotin is good..... Wait until you try these... I&#x27;m a fan!!!! :-)</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle and I love this pills..infinity broke me out...I never had skin problem until I took infinity. Since I switch to manetabolism No more break out and my hair is thicker and longer.. love this pill.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered my first bottle (on the official site) and my order came SUPER FAST!! I already drink a gallon of water per day, so I have no issues with side effects at all! I&#x27;ve already started my supplements and I must say that I felt more energetic and I look forward to my results! The packaging is secure and the vitamins have a unique smell, but not funky at all. The capsules are easy to swallow too. I&#x27;ve always had anxiety swallowing pills, but these aren&#x27;t bad at all. I take both at once! My next order will be a six month supply, deep conditioner and hair butter! The founder&#x27;s hair is beautiful and long. Why not use a product that has given awesome results like hers?! My goal is to have hair as long as hers!</li>
            <li> i purchased these vitamins awhile ago and they worked wonders on me. i gained about an inch of growth in a month plus it regrew my broken edges back. i recommend them to anyone who wants healthier hair.</li>
            <li> These pills are amazing.  I&#x27;ve achieved so much growth since taking them.  I started June 28th, right after receiving a fresh relaxer earlier than month.  I had absolutely no new growth at that time.  On September 5th I did the &#x27;big chop&#x27; and I love it!  My stylist was amazed at how much my hair had grown in that short amount of time.  I now have a TWA that I can wash and go with every day.  My husband noticed how much and how fast my hair has grown and he&#x27;s decided to start taking them also.  I&#x27;ve experienced no noticeable side effects.  I highly recommend this for anyone transitioning to natural hair, or if you just want length.  I prefer short hair so I&#x27;ll probably stop taking them soon, because at this rate my hair will be down my back in no time.  I look forward to trying their hair butter and deep conditioner.  If they&#x27;re as good as these pills, they will have a customer for life!</li>
            <li> For some reason I never thought to take vitamins during my hair journey. I started following Courtney on YouTube and her spirit was so sweet that I started following her on Instagram. When she launched her business I simply wanted to support her because I love seeing people go after their dreams. I bought a one month supply of vitamins and the results were so amazing that I am now on my last bottle of a six month supply. My hair went from shoulder length to arm pit length by the third month. I have recommended a total of 5 friends to these vitamins and they all swear by them. I wish The Mane Choice continued success and that Ms. Courtney keeps that mustard seed faith!!</li>
            <li> I purchased a 2 month supply initially. I began noticing better growth in my nails and hair almost immediately. I reached a 1/2 inch of growth in two weeks. The only drawback to the vitamin is that I am not a big pill taker, I actually just started swallowing pills in the last 2 years. They were too large for me to swallow so I opened the capsule into applesauce to consume daily. They did not taste very well, but probably because they&#x27;re intended to be taken that way.</li>
            <li> So I have been using the mane choice for 3.5 months now and the results have been amazing. I suffer from Alopecia and have had a great deal of hair loss in the middle region for the last 5.5 years. I have tried other products and nothing was helping, my friend recommended I try these so thought what have I got to lose (a little more hair lol). I so wish I had found these when I first started losing my hair the result has blown me away (my hair would have not even got this bad). The folicules in my head have started reproducing hair so my patches are nearly all covered. After 1 month I knew I was on to a winner so I stocked up with a 12 month supply (you know that ain&#x27;t cheap so I must definitely be a believer). I am going to keep on with my vitamins until my patches are covered and then I am going to cut away all the relaxer and start a fresh with natural hair and keep taking the vitamins. I have recommended this product to so many of my friends now just for healthy hair growth in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You definitely have yourselves one happy customer :-)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve seen results in as little as 3 days. No breakouts or thinning of the hair just my hair growing healthier and stronger and fuller than ever. I will always be a customer.</li>
            <li> I started these vitamins back in March and since then my hair has become more thick and also they have helped with my transition from relaxed hair to natural. I have friends that take hairfinity but these vitamins have proved to be way better when you compare my growth to theirs. I highly recommend these vitamins and not only to women but men also.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I would do without this product! My hair reached a plateau. I lost hope for reaching my length goals. Until I saw The Mane Choice on instagram and all the great reviews on it. So I tried it for a month and O M G! My hair didn&#x27;t just gain length! It got thicker and stronger! My hair grew a whole two inches in just one month! I&#x27;m more than happy with the Manetabolism! I&#x27;m gonna pinch my pennies and order a full 6 month supply! I can&#x27;t wait to see my results!</li>
            <li> I wish there was a way to post a picture of what this product has done for me.  I have very bad hair loss around my edges not from damage from braids, weaves or product it is hereditary.  I thought this was something I just had to live with.  I tried this product to help my hair grow and possibly become thicker.  OH LAWD!!!! the first month my hair was thicker, stronger and I had absolutely NO shedding.  My fiance noticed that my edges were growing in, it wasn&#x27;t something that I was monitoring because I felt they would never grow back.  I am able to buy edge control now!!! LOL  These vitamins are amazing! Some results can be seen quicker on other purchasers but it just depends on your body but I promise you these work!!!!  In all honesty I cannot put into words how great these are, just try them and see for yourself you will NOT be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> This is my fourth month using these vitamins.  I was skeptical at first, but let me tell you, I went from no edges to three inches in two months! My nape hair snapped off last winter and I went from under an inch to maybe four inches.  And my hair is visibly thicker as well. I am a believer and repeat purchaser!  It works!</li>
            <li> Best hair vitamins everrrrrrrrrrr instantly as i started taking  them isee result my hair is longer and thicker iwould recommend this to any one who need a longer stronger thicker hair it works wonders an ilovee it💕</li>
            <li> For a long time I researched ways to have my hair grow and came across Hairinfinty and The Mane Choice. I tried both and I have to say The Mane Choice truly gave me the results I was looking for. I highly recommend you try this product. I&#x27;m not even a big fan of taking pills. But it&#x27;s worth it if you want to have beautiful healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these vitamins for the past month and I&#x27;m about to start my second bottle! I am very happy with my results so far! Right before I started taking them I cut off some heat damaged ends and the curls are now growing in beautifully! I have also seen a difference in my energy! It seemed as though I was always tired and now I notice a definite boost in the energy I have throughout the day! I plan on doing a length check after my 3rd bottle. Oh yeah NO BREAKOUTS OR ACNE!</li>
            <li> I must say I have never been into hair vitamins and their claims because I felt like it was all gimmicky foolishness. So when I came across Manetabolism I was like, hmmm same ole same ole. BOY WAS I WRONG. I began taking the vitamins right around March or April (despite ordering them earlier in the year). Within 2 weeks, no lie, I noticed my hair growth. I went from a short, Halle Berry cut earlier this year , to a chin length bob now and that&#x27;s with me taking the vitamins inconsistently (I&#x27;m bad with vitamins, pills etc). Just imagine the growth I would get if I would do it right. Not only has my hair grown, I began transitioning to natural hair because my hair was growing so fast my relaxer appointments couldn&#x27;t keep up. So I ditched the relaxer and I&#x27;m transitioning under a protective style. My stylist is always amazed with my hair growth. My hair is so thick and healthy. Thanks Manechoice!</li>
            <li> I have been using Mane Choice for 3 weeks now. I began taking them the week I got my hair braided and what a mistake!  My braids still look good but my new growth makes it look like I&#x27;ve had my braids in for 7 or 8 weeks. I tried the pills because I experienced hair loss with my pregnancy.  I was malnourished from the morning (all day, every day) sickness causing my hair to just fall out. I got better so my hair started growing in but then it got thin because of heredity. After taking the pills and drinking plenty of water (as I always do and as recommended) I&#x27;m seeing growth and hair growing in areas that had thinned out out my scalp. I only purchased 1 bottle as a trial, but I&#x27;ll be ordering 6 more on Friday.  Can&#x27;t wait to see my progress in a few months!!!</li>
            <li> I used Manetabolism  for a month after a battle with  damage thinning hair that was cause from being on prescription drugs for six months ,I  found The Mane Choice on social media and after comparing with the other hair vitamin I made the mane choice I cut had to cut my hair but it was ok because of the growth I had gotten from the vitamins my hair stopped shedding clumps and was back to normal this gave me my confidence back thank you this was truly a blessing</li>
            <li> So I used the manetabolism vitamins for 1 month and I saw a big difference! I have a lot of new growth! My edges broke because of gettin my weave so tight and almost everything grew back so Im satisfied and I&#x27;m still using it and I think for at least 1 year! so make sure to get it !</li>
            <li> These vitamin are the best hair growing tablets on the market. Hands downs. Their All natural  &amp; no side affects.Quick results with days literally. Your hair, nails and skin will be transformed right before your eyes. Trust me you&amp;#34;ll be on here too bragging .You will love your Mane.</li>
            <li> Based on pictures and customers views i think is a great product for healthy growing hair. Some day would like to be able to try the product for myself. So i can actually be apart of people that says it works. Keep up the good work and making your customers happy.</li>
            <li> Im getting all emotional while thinking about all the benefits of taking these hair vitamins. Im on my 3rd month and i can only say positive things. The health and length of my hair is beyond anything i can imagine. This is definitely a vitamin that nourishes from within, with no breakouts!!!!</li>
            <li> These are by far the best pills that I have ever taken for hair growth. I tried hairfinity before I tried these and I barely saw any improvement, but with the Manetabolism pills my hair has grown a lot and I only took them for a month. Your supposed to drink water but I hardly ever drink water and the results are wonderful. Just imagine if I do drink water while taking them.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble with getting my hair to grow thicker, without a lot of shedding, my thought was to stop getting perms in my hair and the second was to cut off all my relaxed hair. Needless to say I am not a big fan of getting my hair cut so i just opted out of getting perms. Maronths turned to years and all I did as get protective styles and Dominican Blowouts, my hair would grow and shed grow and shed. Not satisfied with my results I started hearing about Hair Infinity, I thought hmm maybe I should try them out, but my mom beat me to it and she tried them first, not satisfied with her results I did some researching and came across Manetabolism Hair Vitamins, when I say I received hair growth within 1 1/2 weeks I was truly impressed, these vitamins grew out a lot of my protective styles that I had to start purchasing them for family and friends they were so satisfied with their results that they now customers. I am so grateful for Ms. Courtney and her passion for wanting to help people grow their hair. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I began taking these pills in May after reading all of the rave reviews about this product. My experience unlike most of the reviews here was not as positive. I did not see any growth or thickness outside of what I normally get each month nor did I see any decreased shedding. My nails grow at the same rate and are still terribly brittle. The only thing I have to show for taking this product for 3 months is terrible skin due to constant breakouts despite drinking at least 3 liters of water daily eating a balanced diet and being active.</li>
            <li> These pills worked wonders for me! I lost a 4 cm spot of hair from a horrible sew in. My dermatologist told me. I would need monthly injections into my scalp after it healed. These pillis startedmy hair regrowth immediately! Im excited to see where I&#x27;ll be in the next few months with it!</li>
            <li> I started using the hair vitamins a few months ago and started to see results in 2 weeks. I stopped taking them for about 6 weeks due to surgery. I have started taking them again 3 weeks ago and my nails have started growing as well as seeing and feeling a difference in the thickness of my hair. It needs great healp due to stress breakage and too much heat. I will be ordering more in a month or so, hopefully before I run out of these. Looking forward to a great recovery.....</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these vitamins... the HYPE is true! And the hype isn&#x27;t even enough - - this is a real and honest as it gets... I first started these vitamins after being so deficient in numerous vitamins and minerals that I had take several supplements intravenously (IV) for 6 months straight. My hair was thin, my nails brittle and weak and my skin dry - all signs of vitamin deficiencies... Well once I found Manetabolism, i showed the Nutrition Facts to my doctor and she agreed to wean me off the IV if I agreed to take the vitamins faithfully as she directed... Easy trade.... Within just 3 months NO MORE IV, my hair has grown RIDICULOUSLY, I actually have nails that are worthy of a manicure and my skin glows!! I&#x27;m a Mane Choice chick FOR LIFE.... Thank you for this product. I&#x27;m very grateful.</li>
            <li> Hm where do I start! Well the first hair growth pills I heard of were hairfinity so I tried them. I wasn&#x27;t really impressed after hearing about mantabolism. I&#x27;ve been taking these pills for about 3 months now and not only has my hair grown but it&#x27;s gotten thicker which is what I was looking for in a product and my face has cleared up from the breakouts I was experiencing and lastly my poor little brittle nails actually grow now and are stronger than ever. I love this product and I&#x27;ve gotten my friends hooked also. I love that they frequently have promos such as free shipping and sales and makes it even more worth it. I can&#x27;t wait to try other mane choice products.</li>
            <li> Awesome awesome awesome!!!! iWas told about these a while back and just ordered them about a month ago, the results have been amazing. My hair is fuller and longer and healthier! Great product for anyone</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I big chopped my hair and became natural but I wanted to give my hair an extra boost and this was the right product to do so. Not only did my hair grow but it got thicker! I seen more growth in one month taking these vitamins than I ever had. These vitamins also gave me more energy during the day and boosted my immune system also. You can not go wrong with any of the mane choice products. Make the right choice with the mane choice!</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying that I loooovvvveeeee these vitamins. They gave me so much hope for my hair. I&#x27;ve always had problems growing my hair out and hair breakage. And these vitamins helped so much. They are everything I could have imagined and more. My hair has grown out 3 inches after my 2nd bottle. And it feels and looks so much healthier now. I just ordered another batch of vitamins and I can&#x27;t wait to see the progress in my hair. Thank you The Mane Choice!</li>
            <li> This product I AMAZING!! I could not believe my hair had grown that much that quickly. I had so much new growth packed on top of each other. I&#x27;m sooooo excited about this product and this is my number one beauty product!! Please buy this product if you want REAL RESULTS!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product three months now and I have seen major results! First thickness throughout my entire head now lenght retention! Great product that I now have my friends and mother using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah it even helps your nails which is a big PLUS!!</li>
            <li> You should definitely try this product I didn&#x27;t their was another out there and when doing some research I was able to run into this and I can honestly say I am happy with results try it u will be very satisfied</li>
            <li> I purchased these vitamins after making the horrible decision to get a really short hair cut! I started taking them as soon as theu arrived and within two weeks, I could visibly tell a difference in my hair! They worked so well, my stylist has started using them! My nails have also grown tremendously as well! This product is definitely the truth!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these vitamins. I started out using hairfinity and thought they were good until I was getting major migranes, acne and my hair was falling out in the handfuls. So I was looking for an alternative and found these! It&#x27;s growing my hair out extremely quickly and thick. And even though you&#x27;re supposed to drink a lot of water, sometimes in my busy schedule I forget but I haven&#x27;t had any bad side effects from forgetting. They only bad thing is my hair is growing too fast for protective styles like braids but thats ok cause im hair is getting long ebough to where i may not need them :) The company is amazing and is always giving back. I will forever use this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE! I saw so much thickness added to my hair after the first week, new growth was abundant! After a month is when I started to see the length. I highly recommend these for anyone transitioning, big chopped, or if you just want to add fullness and thickness to your hair. I recommend purchasing on their website because it&#x27;s cheaper there. They have a line of hair care products so it doesn&#x27;t just stop at the pill. Great investment. i ordered my 2 month supply last month, and shared a bottle with my mom. Must buy!</li>
            <li> Great product with fast results took one bottle of pills and noticed results in hair and nail growth I will order a longer supply to track the results better you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product the beginning of June. I was kind of skeptical because prior to purchasing these I was on a different hair vitamin. I didn&#x27;t see much growth results after taking the first month supply not to mention I broke out terribly on my face. So I stopped those and found out Manetabolism and did my research.  I compared ingredients and found out which ingredients were different among the two. This vitamin has tons of ingredients that are beneficial and great for hair growth.  After I finished my research I gave it a try. And let me tell you, I saw improvements in my hair after the first month! I am on multiple medications due to health issues and I had a spot in the back of my hair that NEVER grew (the nape) and I could not even put finger coils back there. After taking these vitamins the first month, I was able to plait the nape area of my hair! I was in total shock! I even convinced my sister to purchase these vitamins. I never received any breakouts on my face or anything. And not only does it allow hair growth, but it improves the overall state of your hair and also nail growth. I am not saying everyone will receive tons of growth within a week but everyone&#x27;s body is different and everyone&#x27;s hair grow at a different rate. I did purchase after that month and I will definitely continue to purchase. If you are a little skeptical, it will not hurt to do your research or go look at this company&#x27;s Instagram or Facebook. You will get all the additional information and see the results for your self. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a naturally curly girl. I have been natural for the last 10 years but did a big chop about 2 years ago and have been wearing my hair naturally curly. I had suffered from what I thought was permanent damage to my edges from years of weave and braids abuse. I have tried numerous remedies to try and regain my edges and I do mean everything, such as JBCO, megatek mixes, oils, various deep conditioners and even other hair vitamins such as Hairfinity; but over the years nothing has helped my edges grow back as healthy as my hair is...until I tried Manetabolism!!!! Unlike the other hair vitamins that I have tried, I experienced no breakouts or no negative side effects but I noticed over 1 inch of growth on my first bottle and hair fuzz on my temples!!! Before I was done my first bottle I ordered 6 more! I have also introduced this to some family members and friends who have had the same experience. I highly recommend Manetabolism to anyone interested in growing out bald spots or hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried another well known hair vitamin in the past and I will say I haven&#x27;t seen anywhere near the same results. These are very easy to take and they don&#x27;t have a weird smell to them. I saw results after just one bottle. My hair as been stronger and my nails have even been growing like crazy. The creator is very personable and professional and the customer service is wonderful. I haven&#x27;t had one complaint yet.</li>
            <li> I bought a 6month supply, which needed to be posted to the UK, (I did not incur customs fees) I find the pills are quiet easy to swallow, I take the recommended two pills together in the morning and drink plenty of water through out the day. I have not experienced any break outs, which I was quiet worried about. Most importantly along with a structured routine and taking the pills, in my first month I retained 1inch of growth and my shedding has decreased tremendously.</li>
            <li> So far I have been using these vitamins for a month and love the results...I like that it doesn&#x27;t break me out. I just received 2 more bottles in the mail ladies you have to give them a try</li>
            <li> After using these pills over a 4 month period. My hair has grown tremendously. I already have thick hair, but my hair has become much thicker and since being natural for over a year, I am finally able to see my natural curl pattern!!! I didn&#x27;t have any side effects and my nails grew...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely try these pills if you want to start growing healthy hair!!! Must have</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of Manetabolism and I must say I am loving the results. I haven&#x27;t done my length check yet because I have box braids in. I do notice that my roots are looking a lot healthier than before. While taking the vitamins, I drink tons of water each day, i exercise and eat healthy. I also massage and oil my scalp daily to help growth. I will certainly be ordering again once I am finished with this bottle!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is awsome!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months and it has for sure helped my hair grow about 4 inches. It also helped with the thickeness of my hair. Besides my hair it hasn&#x27;t caused any acne like hairinity! This product it a must have!!</li>
            <li> I bought a two month supply for me but end up giving my mother a bottle. We end up ordering another 2 month supply within 3 weeks, because these vitamins are AMAZING!!!!!! My mother hair is filling in great and my hair is getting thicker and growing. I tried itworks hair vitamins and Hairfinity...The Mane Choice is the BEST!!!</li>
            <li> I would love to try. . Do u think these pills help with young girls age 8 or people with alopicha</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for 3 years now and I&#x27;ve taken other supplements that said it does the same thing as Manetabolism, but truly nothing compares.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle of Manetabolism and I absolutely love it.  When I first began taking them I had just gotten my braids (protective style) and within 2.5 weeks I had new growth, I ended up removing my braids because within 3.5 weeks it was ridiculous new growth.  I don&#x27;t ever remember my hair growing this fast and lets not talk about nails.  I&#x27;ve worn false nails for as long as I can remember, never again.  My nails are growing so fast and they&#x27;re so strong and healthy, only manicures from here on out.  My hair is growing, it&#x27;s healthy and I have a tremendous amount of energy, YES THEY BOOST MY METABOLISM....I WILL USE THIS PRODUCT FOREVER.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product for myself and my mother!! I am so excited to try Manetabolism. Shipping was super fast and customer service swiftly responded to a question I had. I&#x27;m so excited that this is not JUST a vitamin for your hair, but chock full of stuff that great for your body as well. Very happy to add Manetabolism to my healthy hair journey.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say : \\&quot;I love these vitamins\\&quot;,  not only can my friends notice how long my hair is getting. I&#x27;ve also noticed how thick and full my hair is too, I had lost some hair around the front of my hairline and thought it would never grow back. After finishing a month and half of the mane choice vitamins my hair has started to fill-in the front of my hair, and my eyelashes have stopped falling out and have gotten thicker and longer. Thank you Courtney and the Manechoice for blessing us w your amazing products. Forever a customer. I so want to try that hair butter next. Long, strong, healthy hair is achievable w the ManeChoice Manetabolism vitamins!</li>
            <li> I bought the vitamins from themanechoice.com and not even 3 weeks later I saw growth! My hair was healthier softer and all around just lovely! I would recommend these over and other vitamins</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everyone I know and here is why, my whole life I bit my fingernails, they have never grown past the edge of my fingers.  When I started taking Manetabolism I noticed that not only were my nails three times longer they were stronger, when I would go to bite them it was alot harder for them to break so I eventually just left them alone. LIFE LONG HABIT CONQUERED IN A MONTH!  As for my HAIR it was so much thicker,  so strong,  and for someone who has grown up with eczema in the scalp ,I&#x27;ve never seen my hair so healthy and strong before.  I THANK the creaters of this product for giving me a chance to feel beautiful head to toe!!</li>
            <li> Started my first bottle almost a month ago and I&#x27;ve seen exceptional hair growth !!!! Defitnitley recommending this to any and everyone :)</li>
            <li> I ordered these because my friend referred them to me and also because my hair was badly damaged and my edges were thin. I just ran out today but let me tell you that these pills are heaven sent. I&#x27;ve always been real sensitive about my edges but after taking these and usingJBCO my edges started growing back. My hair also became more thicker, so thank you Manetabolism for helping me with my hair journey.</li>
            <li> I purchased these vitamins after seeing the results on Instagram. Once I saw hundreds of testimonials, I waited for a sale and jumped in.  I bought 4 bottles to share with my daughter.  These are nothing short of amazing.  No need to give a disclaimer about how different people achieve different results, You WILL achieve results, no matter who you are.&lt;br /&gt;My hair had all but stopped growing ever since I had my daughter 14 years ago.  And for someone with thick coarse, natural hair (2 years no relaxer) having short, so thick I can barely run my fingers through it, poofy, hard to manage hair that was not a welcome change after child birth. My hair and I have had a LIFELONG love hate relationship.  My family recently moved in February to the Caribbean to do missionary work and the humidity gave me even more reasons to hate.  In June I bought these vitamins.  These helped me fall back in love with my hair.  For the first time in 14 years, my hair is growing past its threshold length.  For the first time in a looooooooooooooooooooooooong time I can wrap my hair at night with a smile and not wonder what it&#x27;s going to look like in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you thank you thank you!!</li>
            <li> Great investment. First for me personally my two month supply in less than a month tops gave me much thicker hair along with length. I didn&#x27;t have to increase my intake of water to prent breakout like previous supplement I have tried. Overall everyone get s different results but this product is definitely a great deal.</li>
            <li> I always suffered with short hair. It never grew, like ever. Since I started taking these vitamins my hair has grown, so has my nails! Not to mention the fact that the founder is a super sweet honest woman! Try it! There&#x27;s no side effects!</li>
            <li> My name is Dy and I&#x27;ve taking these vitamins for 3 months now. I mini chopped in June and started these in July. I love what these vitamins have done to the overall health of my hair. I&#x27;ve experienced faster growth, less shedding and my hair has become thicker. Other than helping my hair it has also improved the health of my nails. Before taking these my nails were brittle and short. Now they&#x27;re stronger and longer. As for my skin, I experienced a few blemishes here and there but no breakouts. Thank you to Courtney and her team for creating these amazing hair vitamins.</li>
            <li> I love healthy thick hair I have thick hair but it wasn&#x27;t so healthy &amp; I stumbled across manechoice hair vitamins .OMGs it is thee best doesn&#x27;t have any side effects &amp; very easy to swallow. Its a must try some people may take longer to see results &amp; others won&#x27;t. Regardless its still worth the try &amp; wait. 😍👍</li>
            <li> these vitamins has brought my hair back to life and reduce my shedding</li>
            <li> i have been taking these pills for 6 months and my hair has never looked so healthy and i have so much new growth. I will definitely recommend these pills to my friends and i just ordered another 4 month supply its worth the money I loveee them !!!!</li>
            <li> I used the 30 day supply and I noticed a difference after 2 weeks. It has made my hair to grow longer and thicker!!! I was a little skeptical at first until I tried it and became a believer. I plan on ordering more later in the future as well as other products.</li>
            <li> These pills are the best as I was looking on instagram I was like people hair can be growing this fast especially Ms. Courtney&#x27;s hair. Definitely 5 stars!</li>
            <li> These are the Best pills ever!! I had been having trouble with shading and once I started to take these pills it stop! My nails are growing so fast and my hair is too!!</li>
            <li> I decided to try The Mane Choice hair vitamins post my b/c of 6 months. I wanted to compare how my hair growth &amp; overall healthiness of hair from the 6 months prior till now starting the vitamins. I started in May and my results were amazing! I noticed my hair was more thicker and stronger after two weeks. I also noticed I was retaining more length it seems moreso then the first 6 months without it. I def think you should give it a try. You will see results the first month!</li>
            <li> I love these vitamins. Normally my hair grows on about 1/2 an inch every couple of months and it grew like 1 1/2 inch in only 3 weeks of taking manetabolism. I didn&#x27;t experience any hair breakage, shedding or any side effects. I hate swallowing pills and stopped taking the vitamins and surely enough I have not seen hair growth results like I did with these wonderful vitamins. After consulting the manetabolism team (who are very customer friendly and interactive might I add) I figured out there are other methods of taking them ie opening the capsule. I will be ordering a 3 month supply very soon. My boyfriend never stopped taking them and the bald spot on the crown of his head has resolved tremendously. Biotin didn&#x27;t give him the results that manetabolism has given. I am just beyond thankful for such a product. I cannot wait to try the line as  whole as their prices are very reliable as well. Keep doing whatever you&#x27;re doing. XOXO</li>
            <li> I have started my manetabolism vitamins and have already begun to see results. Not only with my hair but all over. Plan to order more and refer it to my family. Especially my cousin who has thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two months now and the product is amazing!!!! My first two weeks my hair was growing my nails was growing but my hair was growing faster. During the time of taking the pills my hair was in a protective style for 3 weeks and I had to take it down my hair was growing protective style loose. I&#x27;ve also took hairfinity but I think the mane choice works faster with growth.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I even purchased some fir my mom. She loves them! She hasn&#x27;t skipped a beat taking her vitamins since.</li>
            <li> I was very cautious about trying a hair vitamin.  After a lot of research and back and forth I purchased these pills.  I love them! No breakouts, easy to take and most importantly they Work! Since I had just dyed my hair it was easy to see how much growth I had.  I was so impressed I recommended this product to friends and coworkers.  I  had everyone making the mane choice!</li>
            <li> A little over a year ago I started following the Mane Choice on IG but was very nervous to order.  About a year ago my sister had to have emergency brain surgery and as a result her hair had to be saved off.  At that point I knew this was a product that would be included in our regimen.  I ordered as soon as she was home and able to take supplements safely.  We are so happy with the results we are seeing from this product and are always recommending it to others with hair issues!  There are other hair supplements out there but I have to say, &amp;#34;Although I&#x27;ve tried the rest, I now only stick with the best!&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> Started taking these this month for my 6 month no heat hair challenge. I cut 3inches from my hair before I began and it has already grown back an inch from the pills. I love them!</li>
            <li> I use the vitamins, and I swearrrrr by them! My hair was thin, and fragile after one week of them I could notice a difference in my hair. Nails are so long everyone ask if they are fake ( they don&#x27;t break either ]. Everyone can tell that my hair is thicker, and getting longer. I liked the fact that it made it thicker before longer first because healthy hair comes before long hair. Definitely worth the investment. I will be ordering my 6 month order of vitamins very soon.</li>
            <li> After 2 years of back to back bleaching and color treating and heat damage to my hair I have lost my about 5 inches of curls on my ends and my texture has totally changed. After taking these vitamins it gave me courage to go through with the big chop to finally get my hair back in healthy shape. I recommend The Mane Choice to anyone looking for healthier hair!!!!</li>
            <li> After I had my daughter my hair started shedding at uncontrollable rates,  if I put my fingers through my hair I had a handful of hair by the time I got to the end of my hair I was devastated I didn&#x27;t know what to do I tried everything you can think of oils, pills, herbal remedies, I was desperate one day I stumbled upon the main-choice vitamins, I took other vitamins with no luck and didn&#x27;t want to get my hopes but after reading reviews and seeing results I was sold. I even convinced my coworkers to try it with me. We got together and ordered a bundle box of vitamins and 2 weeks later started our journey. My hair is naturally curly I&#x27;m biracial so people assume I have great hair no problems but the way my hair was shedding and thinning out I couldn&#x27;t take it I started the pills after 2 weeks my hair grew 1/2 inch the shedding stopped almost immediately!!!! My hair is thicker, shiner, and looks better than I ever seen it! I&#x27;ve gotten so many positive reviews and everyone keeps asking me how? What? When? And I tell them the mane choice 😁 I am soooo in love the way my hair it&#x27;s shine, texture, curls, length EVERYTHING if I could change one thing it would be knowing about this product years ago so I could have had this type of healthy hair my whole life. My coworkers also experienced changed and growth in their hair as well and we have completely different hair types. I recommend this to everyone even strangers.</li>
            <li> Growing facial hair! :(</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t work for me. I was wary when I first ordered these, and my instincts seem to have been proven correct. There are no ingredients listed on the main Amazon page. These seem to just be placebo pills meant to boost your confidence and make the seller money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see no improvement no growth I am on my second bottle but look like my hair is falling out.instead of growing.</li>
            <li> I swear by this product. At first i was skeptical about what these pills could really do especially after going through 2 bottles, however the first week into the third bottle i was baffled. Hair growth like crazy! Even my thin edges are coming in nicely. Now im on my fourth bottle and my hair growth has doubled, i guess its true that sometimes you need to give pills 3 months to kick in</li>
            <li> I have been using the tablets for more than 3 weeks now.  My hair does feel a little stronger, but not much else.  I don&#x27;t like the &#x27;fishy&#x27; smell associated with it though. It seems to leak out of my pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with my results ....My hair is growing out very long full and healthy.... I drink NAKED GREEN MACHINE BOOST(green veggies&amp; fruit juice)... AND plenty water...my skin is flawless I had dark marks from bumps here and there my nails are growing long toooo better get u some</li>
            <li> I was really sure what would happen with these pills but I could go with or without. After two months my hair was visibly thicker and healthier but not a lot of length. It makes all the hair over our body grow faster and thicker, not a bad thing, but its definently there. I wouldn&#x27;t buy another bottle, just because it didn&#x27;t have much growth and the pills made my skin horrible! I already have steady acne, but there was significantly more acne when I was taking these pills. I haven&#x27;t taken any for a month now and the dance has gone away, I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my hair yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll begin by stating that I did not purchase these vitamins on Amazon due to their price. I&#x27;ve been taking these vitamins since August and have noticed a significant amount of growth and  thickness in my hair. Since taking the vitamins my shedding has completely stopped. For those who claimed that the vitamins didn&#x27;t work, have you incorporated a healthy diet? It&#x27;ll take more than these vitamins to promote hair growth.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve used thus far...definitely seen a difference in a month&#x27;s time especially my nails!</li>
            <li> Bought n took these from oct 1 to the 30th. Only got my regular 1/2 inch. Wont be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I dont even wanna risk taking them with the fake reviews ):</li>
            <li> First this make you gain weight??</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair is growing so fast</li>
            <li> My hair look healthy. Thank u</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my hair in a protective style since I began using the vitamins in august but I can insure you that I see the new growth I can&#x27;t wait to see my progression sn: I have had any breakouts so far</li>
            <li> I purchased in may my hair length was staggering. I started taking my pills in may and I first noticed less shedding and more length retention. Now my hair has grown a few inches and the thickness is amazing as well!!</li>
            <li> These pills are wonderful! I have a friend who has taken these pills for 2 months now and her hair grew one inch within a week! I just ordered the pills 2 weeks ago and I can honestly say I see the difference around my edges! I love these pills and everyone should try them out! They are very efficient!</li>
            <li> My friend used this product and she said it works and I am willing to try this product to see the same result!! Can&#x27;t wait to get mine :)</li>
            <li> hello I&#x27;m Victoria I&#x27;m currently on my second bottle of these amazing vitamins and there the best thing ever made , when i was younger i had so much hair that my mother could not control so she started giving me perms which was horrible it made mostly my edges thin out and Ive tried  everything to grown them and make them thicker again and then it happened one while scrolling through instagram and i said i must have these , with my first bottle my edges thicken now there growing and I&#x27;m just so happy , i would recommended this to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I did the big chop 7months ago and with the help of these pills I have 7inches of hair on my head.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best hair vitamins I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;ve tried quite a few. I received a three month supply and decided to track my growth by putting my hair in crochet braids for the 3 months and when I took my hair down it had grown literally 3 inches. That&#x27;s an inch a month and I&#x27;ve never had any other hair vitamin. I love these and recommend them to anyone and I even gave my sisters a few bottles.</li>
            <li> These hair vitamins are the bomb.com. I started my hair journey last month and im now on my second bottle. Not only have my hair grown longer it has also gotten alot thicker. My hair so seem to be alot more shiny. I first started off taking just biotin and I realize that my hair needed much more than that. I have also notice NO BREAK OUTS...These vitamins also work miracles for yor nails. I cant wait for more growth. Thanks</li>
            <li> I started using these vitamins after having my head shaved for 2 brain surgeries in the past year. My hair has grown 2 inches since June, I love this product and will be a customer for life.</li>
            <li> These are the best hair pills out I&#x27;ve tried other hair pill products to grow my hair longer but wouldn&#x27;t see any results. But these pills really work i see so much new growth coming in after 2-3 weeks with these pills. I&#x27;m so happy I found these pills :)</li>
            <li> I ordered these amazing vitamins about 2 months ago and guys they really work. I heard a lot about hairfinity but I chose to go this route and I&#x27;m glad I did. Great purchase ladies you won&#x27;t regret it:) oh and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these vitamins for 4 months now andi can say they really do make your hair nice and healthy. My hair has grown atleast 2 inches since I&#x27;ve started!!! I will forever be a customer.</li>
            <li> This product never ceases to amaze me I&#x27;ve used it at two times on separate occasions but each time that I&#x27;ve used it and it has done a wonderful job at renewing my hair. I have a lengthy tee shirt and Ive seen the growth. Great thing about the product is that not only does it grow your hair but it strengthens it as well!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only3 months and have seen amazing results! I will cont. to use this for my journey to long &amp; healthy hair</li>
            <li> I have been using these pills for about a week and 1/2..and I have noticed changes already, my hair is practically shedd-less with insane noticeable growth, also my nails are stronger than ever!! I am so pleased with your product.</li>
            <li> As much as I didn&#x27;t want these pills to work (I just assumed they wouldn&#x27;t like other supplements), THEY DID. I have natural 4 type hair. I usually wear my hair in high curlly puff ponytails. My puff ponytails have been a staple in my routine for about a year. Well, after taking these supplements (I bought the 60 day supply), I noticed that my puff was poofier after my 30 day bottle was empty. :-) So, I decided to get my hair straightened. O.M.G., my hair had to grow about 2 inches from the last time I checked length. It&#x27;s also much thicker. I suggest anyone interested give it a try.</li>
            <li> I tried this twice and although I was skeptical about hair vitamins (i&#x27;ve tried two other brands to no avail) I was highly impressed with these. So much so that I bought another pair for back up. I like the fact that there is no gross aftertaste and you don&#x27;t start to grow hair all over. I felt more energetic after taking these and knowing that its not just for my &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; I would highly recommend them. I take them as a multivitamin supplement and I couldn&#x27;t be more happier with my purchase. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these pills for various reasons. I have natural hair and I have been trying to grow out the back of my hair and it has don&#x27;t that and made my hair so healthy. To me healthy hair is worth so much you can have length but when you have length with healthy hair its great. My Nails are strong also. I buy my pills from a local retailer but they are definitely worth the money. I tried the hairfinity but found these so much better. Also I use her other products with these pills and AMAZING! BARELY ANY shedding or anything. I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
            <li> I used my sister as a Guinea pig for these pills and it really works . She recently got box braids and she had so much new growth . These pills grow out protective styles .</li>
            <li> I cut my hair back in January. Completely off because I was tired of the chemicals and processing done to my hair. My hair grows quicker than most but I wasted more results. I was studying Mane Choice and Hairfinity for a while. I&#x27;ve heard of Hairfinity but I never heard of Mane Choice until I seen a post on Instagram by Teyana Taylor. After researching and looking at both I decided to go with mane choice and I am so happy I did. There are no side effects and you see results within the first week. Before I knew it I couldn&#x27;t keep my hair in any protected styles because the growth was so major. Definitely recommend this product especially to new natural hair virgins. Worth the money</li>
            <li> OhhhEmmmGee , this product is 5 star worthy ! My hair is growing faster, it&#x27;s thicker and so so much healthier feeling. My nails are stronger, and longer ! And my skin is on 10 ! My face seems to be clearing out, I thought it was an illusion at first but friends begin to tell me and now I&#x27;m sold. I can only order one bottle at a time because I&#x27;m broke and in college lol BUT trust me ladies and men it is well worth it. This is a genuine review and I would not even bother reviewing if the results were not real. One day I&#x27;ll try the conditioner , butter , and hear protection and I&#x27;ll let you all know about that. Plus they have great sales and discounts on the website when you catch them ! Buy some !!!! :) thank you mane choice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these vitamins for about 4months , during this period I had a protective style (weave) , when I took my hair out in the third month I noticed extreme growth. I had a few streaks left in my hair and their now at my ends. This product works wonders. Just make sure you drink plenty water . thank you manetabolism !!!</li>
            <li> I recently lost the left side of my front edges and decided to give this product a try. At the time I had a sew in installed and noticed growth within 2 weeks. At the end of my first month of the product I removed the sew in and noticed my edges COMPLETELY grew back in. I fell in love with the product and am now beginning my 4th month. I have recommended the product to my friends and family. I noticed a few breakouts but nothing major so I increased my water intake. I try to drink about 9 (8oz) or more glasses of water daily. I now don&#x27;t have breakouts with this product. Also, remember to continue proper hair care and moisturizing. I would definitely recommend you give it a try. I chose this product over Hair Infinity because it had better reviews for faster hair growth and fewer facial and scalp breakouts (according to my research).</li>
            <li> I originally tried this product b/c I had a coupon. I had no expectations from this product b/c I had NEVER heard of it. I purchased ONE bottle and within TWO weeks I could see not only a difference in my nails but also in my hair growth. I then purchased THREE more bottles. I had a few bald spot in my head from Lupus making my hair fall out. I took these pills for 4 months totally and I FINALLY saw growth in the spots I thought would NEVER grow back. This product is absolutely AMAZING.  It actually works. The ingredients are close to the equivalence of a multivitamin. I had no problems with break out BUT I suggest taking these pills with plenty of water.</li>
            <li> These vitamins are literally a miracle in a bottle! I had cut off all my hair because of heat and color damage, and wanted to start my natural hair journey all over again. I took these pills and got senaglese twists installed in my hair and after  two weeks my twists began to look like they had been there for a month. When taking these pills you immediately see improvement in length and texture. I had cut the front and edges of my hair very short as well because the damage was worse there( I know bad idea), and noticed my hair was coming back sooner than I thought. Mane Choice is the better than Hairfinity because you need at least 3 bottles of Hairfinity to see what ManeChoice does in one month with one bottle. I highly recommend this product, ladies you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I ordered my vitamins last Sunday and they were delivered on Friday which was exciting. The capsules themselves are a pretty decent size, not horse pills. They do have an odd smell but that is expected with multivitamins. I started today so I can&#x27;t really review how well it works obviously, however I do have extremely high hopes!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and absolutely love it!! I also tried hair infinity which only showed normal growth compared to The Mane Choice!! Can&#x27;t wait to start my new month.. Worth Every Penny Spent(Thank You Mane Choice)</li>
            <li> I bought these pills for the first time back in June. While I was taking them, I also had my hair in a protective style (crochet braids), I was drinking a gallon of water a day, going to the gym 5 times a week and doing nightly scalp massages. All of these combined made my hair grow an inch in four weeks! No breakouts either. I was so happy with the results, so I just bought 2 more bottles while their website was having free shipping last week. Here&#x27;s to two more inches :)</li>
            <li> I originally bought my two pack of pills on the Mane Choice website but wanted to do a review here because the world needs to know about these pills! I have had them four about a week, I have had them before, but the first time I got just the one bottle from a friend so it was a month supply. I not only saw my hair getting thicker but growing out even more than I would without them. I decided to purchase the two pack from the site because I loved them the first time and wanted to see how they would grow out my hair this time for two months. I also have a protective style as well so I am really excited when I take them out to see how much new growth I have. One thing I also love about these pills is that unlike Hairfininty pills, I have not had ANY breakouts or side effects using them. I love that! You get growth, longer hair and a no side effect pill all in one for a great price! :) Not only does this pill make your hair grow, but it&#x27;s a multivitamin and you definitely get other vitamins that are beneficial as well! The website isn&#x27;t just a place to get money from customers either. You see that they have events and are actually caring about their fans and customers. On Instagram they post tons of customers reviewing and showing their hair growth. I love the Mane Choice and I hope that you all learn to love them as well. One try and you won&#x27;t go back to any other hair multivitamin pill!</li>
            <li> Thank God for this product! After a terrible flat ironing incident, I had to cut most of my beautiful hair off, reverting me back to big chop length. I heard about this product from a friend and classmate, and immediately I was enthralled! I have been taking this product for a little bit over a week, and I am ALREADY noticing changes! My nails are stronger, some acne has cleared up, and my hair has grown from in between my eyes to further down the bridge of my nose!</li>
            <li> This pill has to be a miracle worker. The first time I ordered the pill I used it for 2weeks and notice that my sides started to grow back I was schoked ny the reaction. So i ordered more this time I give my mom a bottle from a little girl my mom only had hair in the middle of her hair and after one month of the mane choice my mom sides and nape area grew hair for the first time in her life. These pills are the best on the market and i will always be a buyer of this product..this pill give my mom confidence to wear her own her so thank you mane choice :-D:-D</li>
            <li> I started using The Mane Choice products after seeing the amazing reviews on Instagram. My hair has never been stronger or healthier than it is now. Thanks to The Mane Choice hair vitamins, I have now reached Bra strap length in a 2 years span. I can&#x27;t wait to see what my hair will look like by my 3 year big chop anniversary. I gave my mother, who is suffering from alopecia a bottle, and I cannot wait to see her results. Thank you Courtney for making a product that truly works!</li>
            <li> So far so good!! I have been using this product foe 4 days now with no side affects. I am hoping for success with my bald spots in the middle of my head.</li>
            <li> I am on my second month of Mane Choice vitamins and I love them. I previously took a different brand and although I saw plenty of length, I didn&#x27;t get the thickness and fullness I was hoping for. That is not the case with The Mane Choice. I see a significant difference in the volume of my hair, not just the length. I also have a ton of energy to spare with these vitamins. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These pills are the Holy Grail of hair pills. At first I was worried about taking these pills because I was worried about possible side effects or that the pills just won&#x27;t work. I read so many amazing reviews and The Mane Choice assistance in answering all of my questions put me at ease. I decided to take the plunge and 5 months later I have no regrets! My hair is healthy, strong and the length is unbelievable! My skin and nails also benefited from my use. The Mane Choice is the right choice</li>
            <li> I started using Manetabolism hair pills February of this year, previously I had tried hair skin and nails and hairfinity and both vitamins really only grew out my nails. However Manchoice vitamens have grew out my nails as well has my hair. I noticed that the breakage that I used to have directly in the middle of my hair is gone. I have also been taking the pills and using the avocado oil and my hair has grown about 4 inches longer in the past 7 months.&lt;br /&gt;Normally my hair growth is really slow to actually have it touch my shoulders is amazing. I did notice some breaking out, however once I started drinking enough waters, the facial break out stopped. I would recommend to anyone who is experiencing slow growth, and breakage.</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re reading this review then you&#x27;re probably like the 1000&#x27;s of others who&#x27;s either thinking about buying or wondering if it works. Let me be one of many that confirms IT WORKS!!! While taking this vitamin I did not experience any sid effects other than HAIR GROWTH, RETENTION and AWESOMENESS. What I liked most about this product is that its a Black Owned business, formulated by an educated couple (Dr and RN) and that their customer service is outstanding. In addition, it has the essentials of whats needed instead of a bunch of fillers. The pricing is affordable and the quality is good. Don&#x27;t sit there thinking about it, but instead be like Spike Lee and &amp;#34;Do The Right Thing.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> ok, SOOO I&#x27;m usually not the person to try new products for the body BUT I love these vitamins! As I got older, I loved to cut my hair in bobs and then keep wanting my hair to grow back lol usually, my hair grows back at a &amp;#34;regular pace&amp;#34; BUT with the help of these vitamins, I&#x27;ve noticed growth within my first month of using them. Even when I hardly noticed, my friends or co-workers would say &amp;#34;your hair got longer.&amp;#34; So it&#x27;s definitely noticeable. I would recommend this product, hands down! I&#x27;ll probably never stop taking them LOL</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these pills for about 5 months now, and I can&#x27;t say enough how much they&#x27;ve been a &amp;#34; God send&amp;#34;. Within the first month I got about an inch of growth, and steady growth has continued. Not only is my hair healthier than it has ever been, but I also see other amazing benefits. I have so much energy when I take these vitamins. Before taking these vitamins my energy level was extremely low, and I was very sluggish throughout the day. Now, I have enough energy to tackle whatever the day brings. In addition, I truly believe that my body is absorbing all of the nutrients in these pills. I&#x27;ve taken other hair skin &amp; nail pills, and when I did my urine would often be a bright yellow (TMI i know). That bright yellow secretion meant that something I was taking wasn&#x27;t absorbing properly, and my body had to get rid of it. With the Manetabolism vitamins that is  NOT  the case. Not bright yellow urine here lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my nails grow sooo quickly. Never have I had nails these healthy, long, or strong! I could rant on an on about these vitamins, and how much I love them! They are definitely a staple for not only my hair, but my overall health.</li>
            <li> Very good product!! I started these pills April 2014 and they have helped with my shedding and ofcourse helped my hair to grow even faster. I highly recommend to anyone with dry brittle hair trying to get a healthier head of hair.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love these pills. After trying another brand and having no results, I decided to give  manetabolism a try. Before finishing my first bottle, I noticed growth not only in my hair but my nails as well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I had braids and took these vitamins for a week and I noticed new growth. The mane choice is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I have been using the healthy hair vitamins for the past couple of months and they definitely work!!! My hair is thicker, growing nicely and my thinning edges are returning back healthier! I definitely recommend anyone with hair loss, thinning edges, bald spots, etc. to give these pills a try. Also great customer service and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic at first because I couldn&#x27;t understand how so many people were seeing such great results. I social media stalked before going forth and committing... I must say I&#x27;m glad I did. Customer service is great, the owner is sweet and the product is great. Not only did I gain healthy hair and nails, but also great energy. No negative side effects for me either.</li>
            <li> These pill are amazing.  I&#x27;ve been struggling with heat damage for 3 months.  These pills have made my hair healthy, thicker and longer! It&#x27;s helping me transition also! I believe these pills are my best friend.  3 months and counting!  People BUY THESE PILLS!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased my first mane choice vitamins in June and ever since its been a part of my hair regimen! I&#x27;m usually able to keep extensions for at least a month but after using these I have to keep re doing my hair because that&#x27;s how much growth I have!</li>
            <li> These vitamins are absolutely amazing. I was a skeptic at first. But after one bottle my growth rate more than doubled. My hair usually grows about a half inch per month and at the end of just my first bottle I saw about 1.5 inches of growth. My hair was longer, fuller, and thicker. Also, my skin is now impeccable and my nails are stronger and longer. If you are looking into trying hair vitamins or have tried that other brand with unsatisfactory results I definitely recommend The Mane Choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to regrow my hair for years after I was diagnosed with psoriasis in my scalp. Nothing worked whatsoever, but I had faith and tried ManeChoice after a friend recommended it. I am so happy to say the spots where the psoriasis took over are finally growing hair, I&#x27;m on my second bottle and the patches are pretty much gone and my hair feels stronger than ever! I love this product, buy multiple, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> These vitamins have changed my life! I never felt comfortable in my own skin because my hair has always been a problem area. I couldn&#x27;t retain length, and it was also extremely thin. These vitamins have grown my hair from neck length to arm pit length over the past 3 months. It has thickened up, and I no longer have severely split ends. I am transitioning to natural and The Mane Choice is making the process a breeze! I would just like to thank the maker for this smile that I have on my face and an air of confidence that I have never had before!</li>
            <li> Not only does the manechoice grow your hair faster and longer; it helps your confidence grow as well. When I big chopped I was kinda down on myself I was worried my hair would never grow. But because of courtneynaturalhair I am now growing my hair and my confidence as I grow into the woman I am destined to be. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> My friend take these pills and they work marvelous! I Love the Results!</li>
            <li> I won a bottle of these amazing vitamins this past April on instagram, I was overjoyed because of so many great reviews that I had already seen on social media, so now it was my time to see what they would do for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair normally grew half inch per month but for the 30 days that I took the vitamins; my hair grew an inch which was the first for me, my nails also grew very rapidly and were very strong! I love these vitamins because of all the great ingredients that they have in them, I knew my body was getting everything it needed. They are within a normal size so no worries about having a hard time swallowing them and no bad taste. During my time taking them I didn&#x27;t experienced any breakouts or any other side effects at all and was very happy about that. I did noticed and exciting and amazing difference in my skin, I had some dark spots I tried to get rid of for years and these vitamins helped me in just one month now that is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this over and over to my family and friends, for it is a great product. Now I can&#x27;t wait to try the entire line.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many vitamins and these are by far my favorite,if you are looking for a good hair and skin vitamin then look no further make the choice today that is the manechoice of course they are the best out there.</li>
            <li> I love love love these vitamins. I have been incorporating these vitamins in my daily natural hair care for almost a year. I am very pleased the results. I have less breakage which leads to more growth and overall health hair. Thank you Courtney for Manetabolism!!!!</li>
            <li> I really do enjoy this product because it actually works. I have struggled with my hair and have tried many different options in the past. However, with Manetabolism my hair is full and doesn&#x27;t have extreme breakage anymore. These vitamins help encourage me to take care of my hair and take time to learn about hair maintenance. I have been taking the Manetabolism vitamins for 3 months. I have been happy ever since.</li>
            <li> I love these pills, I&#x27;ve done research on Youtube firstly about Hairfinity vitamins and heard some bad reviews on how while taking them the new growth is thinner than it would be if you weren&#x27;t taking them so my first thought was no thank you! I like my thick hair.. I have tried biotin from the store but that only gave me chest problems... like sharp pains in my chest it wasn&#x27;t pretty so i stopped taking them and gave em to my mom. She started complaining of having bad gas in her side so we just threw that out all together. (DON&#x27;T USE BIOTIN FROM THE STORE IN THE YELLOW BOTTLE LOL) But so far I have not had any bad things to say about Mane hair vitamins I don&#x27;t get any of the breakouts or chest pains so that&#x27;s a plus! and my hair is growing!!!! so THANK YOU MANE CHOICE!! :D</li>
            <li> So far so good! Been taking them and realized no break outs! No nausea or any other horrible side effect some of the other hair,skin and nails pills have. I&#x27;ve been taking these pills for about a week and I am already seeing growth. These pills are fabulous I just had a baby and my obgyn said they are ok to take while breastfeeding too!</li>
            <li> These hair vitamins are truly a blessing. First and foremost I would like to thank God because I truly believe that there was a reason I came across Courtney. The original reason I started taking these hair vitamins was because the nape of my hair seems to never grow. No matter what I tried, nothing seemed to work. There was even a bald spot. I literally gave up until I came across these. If you see the back of my hair today people, you would not think that it was the same nape lool. I&#x27;m not even exaggerating either. Not only has the nape hair picked up but my hair has also got thicker and I&#x27;ve seen growth. Now my hair was already THICK before, but now it&#x27;s just something else!  My nails are also longer and stronger. I&#x27;m not going to lie, at first I was had a few doubts. But I saw the results of other people, read up on the products and I said to myself I have to try this. Well guys, I have nearly finished my 3rd bottle!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People, people...I&#x27;m telling you these work!! I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative side effects and I highly recommend this product to anyone. You will NOT, i repeat... you will NOT regret it :)</li>
            <li> These pills are amazing, I&#x27;m three days away from starting my third bottle. My hair have always been thick. These vitamins make my new growth feel thicker. I&#x27;m in love with my growth. I have a protective style in now but I check my new growth daily and I&#x27;m in all that my hair need to be taking out just after three weeks because it&#x27;s growing so fast. I have two full bottles waiting to be taking but I&#x27;m already thinking about ordering again just so them will be with me . The shipping was incredibly fast I received both of my orders in four to five days. You will Not regret this purchase!! When I take just biotin I breakout so bad and I only drink water. So I was afraid to try these but I&#x27;m so glad I did . No negative reaction at all!!!</li>
            <li> Those pills are just amazing, I had a huge issues with my hair loss and breakage. I&#x27;ve tried like a billion of products but none of them worked. I&#x27;m in my bottle n°4. And I&#x27;m going to buy another 4 month supply. Thank you the Mane Choice you have changed my life : my hair is thicker and fuller and it&#x27;s growing, my nails and my lashes too.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the butter and the green tea conditionner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using the mane choice and I love it.. Although I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in length (yet) my hair is so much thicker and healthier and that ls what matters most right? I should have gotten more than a month supply because I know I will be using for a long time. You&#x27;ll get your money worth for sure great buy!</li>
            <li> I tried Manetabteolism last year, but will admit that I did not use it consistently. After my wedding this year (and the stress of planning) I noticed that the hair in the middle of my head broke off. I decided this was a great time to commit myself to taking manetabolism. My hair has grown 3 inches! I am so happy because this area seems to be problematic for many woman in my family. I didn&#x27;t expect to see it grow at such a rapid pace. Manetabolism is my new best friend and I cant wait to see how long my hair will be with the help of Mane Choice next year.  ALSO There are always deals going on throughout the year from free shipping to 20% and sometimes 25% off. If you follow on Instagram @themanechoice or sign up for notifications on the website. You will get more than you bargained for with these random deals.     This company should be the Mane choice for your hair!!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I received the reference for it through a friend and noticed results quickly (I&#x27;d say within a week). My hair has grown significantly as well as strengthened. I will definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> These pills are amazing !!! My hair grew so much within the first 30 days that I had to buy another supply!!! With my hair I noticed less shedding and thickness had no breakouts like some other pills that I have tried. Also my nails grew longer :-)</li>
            <li> I started taking Metabolism vitamins 2 months ago. I was praying that something would help my hair grow back in the middle where it went bald.  These vitamins are AMAZING! Not only did they help with hair growth but my nails also grew like wild flowers! I did suffer from any breakouts either!!  I love The Mane Choice products!!!</li>
            <li> All I can say is wow!. These vitamins are perfect and does what it says and some. These vitamins have not only grown my and my mom&#x27;s hair but it has made it so much healthier. I can say this is the best out there for reviving and growing your hair!. Do your hair a favor!</li>
            <li> I recently switched to the mane choice after being disappointed by hairfinity. Hairfinity made my face breakout terribly, m nails were weak, and I did not see positive results until the second bottle. However, once I started taking manetabolism my nails are stronger than ever and my hair is actually hrowing already. I&#x27;ve only taken the pills for 15 days and I&#x27;m already seeing great results. I don&#x27;t breakout and my hair retains moisture better with these pills. I do have my hair in a protective style which definitely helps the growth of my hair, but I give all thanks to manetabolism for growing my hair faster and healthier. Cannot wait to take out my protective style next week and wear my natural hair. Thanks manetabolism!</li>
            <li> These pills are great! You get great results within a month! I love them, and it will continue to buy them until my hair reaches a certain length. I recommend these to everyone that&#x27;s stuck in a hair growth stage!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal! I&#x27;ve noticed a major change in the texture of my hair and although I keep my hair in a high puff, I&#x27;m still able to see that it&#x27;s growing. I only purchased one bottle to try it out, but I plan on purchasing more!!!</li>
            <li> Was very skeptical about using this product but when I use it I see major changes in my hair...it grew thicker and longer. I have recently cut off all the hair on the back of my head and it has grown back at least 3 inch and I have only used one bottle going to buy more again.</li>
            <li> These Pills have worked wonders for me, I Live in Canada and I have to take extra measures to ensure I get them each month. I&#x27;ve been in these for a year and my growth has doubled. I had cut my hair above my shoulders last august and now a year and a month later I&#x27;m at bra strap length. I am so thankful to have come across these , they have made my hair healthy inside and out !</li>
            <li> I Purchased these vitamins a few months ago and they are the next best thing LITERALLY!! I have seen triple the results compared to ANY of the other hair pills out there. I have tried Mane choices competitors and they could NEVER compare to these vitamins. My nails have became extremely strong and the length of my hair is unbelievable in such a short amount of time. The owner is a sweetheart and has a great heart shes always helping other and shes such a giving person. Customer service is outstanding the owner Courtney has picked a fantastic team! Delivery time was very fast and she often does free shipping promos! Overall I would recommend this product to any and everyone who is natural, relaxed, or transitioning that wants the solution to healthy hair! Thanks for a wonderful product Mane choice! God Bless Courtney for everything you do and have done! - Angela</li>
            <li> I took them for a week. I drank about 60 ounces of water a day, and took them with a full meal. The vitamins gave me headaches. I felt weird and nauseated, sleepy, and my stomach started cramping. I don&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li> You can check reviews date on 22 September , all in one day and looks fake.</li>
            <li> I loved it.. I seen results within two weeks.. I&#x27;m purchasing more right now..</li>
            <li> I started taking  manetabolism 2 months ago and it definitely works. I was taking prenatal vitamin along with 10,000 mcg of biotin but didn&#x27;t see any progress with my hair. After taking these for 2 months my hair has finally reached has grown an 1 1/2 inches and  finally reached bra strap length and I will continue taking it until I reach my goal. Before I brought the vitamins I read the reviews on here and compared it to hairfinity and didnt really like what I heard about hairfinity causing break outs. And I am glad I went with manetabolism. By the way I didn&#x27;t break out at all with manetabolism. I am  happy with it and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I guess September 22 was a good day for these people. This really seems fake and the biggest problem over all is hair loss. Instead of growing your hair, its taking it out. Seems FAKE</li>
            <li> Excellent I noticed growth immediately</li>
            <li> After so many trials and fails with other hair growth products I was skeptical but then I thought &amp;#34;What do I have to lose?&amp;#34; I started seeing results within the first two weeks and my hair is STILL growing :) I&#x27;m on my second bottle and about to put in my third order.... I have NO BREAKOUTS and my hair is growing in areas where I thought it was damaged without repair. Got questions? Comment below!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Manetabolism-vitamins for the past 3 weeks and have seen growth in my hair already. Of course it works for everyone differently and alternate paces, but for me it has been great so far. I&#x27;d recommend them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 3 weeks in and not finished with this product yet.  Maybe I&#x27;ll do a review once I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> These hair vitamins are amazing! My mom had been trying to grow her hair for a while and, following @courtneynaturalhair on Instagram and seeing raves &amp; raves about them, I decided to try them for myself first. I&#x27;d only taken them for two weeks and saw my hair growing &amp; get thing thicker. I was sold and bought another one for my mom who had very similar results. These vitamins work wonders and I recommend them to everyone I have a hair conversation with.</li>
            <li> The Mane Choice is the Main Choice ! The pills have the reaults that you are looking  for. Best hair growth pills with the beat results :))</li>
            <li> These vitamins are AMAZING!  Within a month my hair was growing, ..my hair haa become wven more thick. I love when I see new growth.&lt;br /&gt;#themanechoice has the best products. My nails has even grown , I love it, I would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s trying to grow healthy hair.</li>
            <li> When I say thank you I mean thank you. I&#x27;ve been taking these pills for the last 5 months. My edges are fuller. My hair is fuller and growing rapidly especially since I did my big chop in July. As a stylist I recommend to my clients all the time because it works. Not for advertisement but for the fact IT WORKS!!!!</li>
            <li> Before I was skeptical, a month trial quickly turned into 4 months and I&#x27;m so happy I made the mane choice. My hair grew thicker and longer faster. If you want to see results, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent!!! Does exactly what it says it will do and will not disappoint you!</li>
            <li> I have fallen in LOVE with Manetabolism Vitamins! I started searching for hair vitamin supplements about a year ago and was going back and forth with whether or not I should get Hair Infinity but after the first time I saw all the reviews on Amazon, Instagram, FaceBook, and even Twitter I new the ManeChoice was the right option for me. I started wearing box braids and started taking my first vitamin on the same day. By the 3rd week of having box braids I had to get all of my braids around my edges and then some re-done! My hair has been growing so rapidly and I love it I have told all of my friends at college about Manetabolism and can&#x27;t wait to order another bottle!</li>
            <li> I love the pills, I started using them when I was transitioning my hair to natural. The pills helped to thicken my hair and I started to notice that I was shedding less and less.</li>
            <li> These vitamins are absolutely amazing. I started taking them a month ago and within two weeks I started to see growth,  not only in my hair,  but with my nails as well. After having my son I had postpartum shedding on my temples and I&#x27;m taking this product to grow it back. The thin ares around my temples are thickening back up and I&#x27;m so excited.  I just started my 2nd bottle and I can&#x27;t wait until I finish this bottle to see what happens.  Love these vitamins. 😆</li>
            <li> I was a Hairfinity user. Excited to start a another hair journey as a relaxed girl, I was disappointed because I saw no results. Plus, the vitamins made me super nauseous, daily. I remember about a year ago I saw Teyana Taylor post on her Instagram about the vitamins, and I became curious then. It wasn&#x27;t until about two months ago that I tried these vitamins for myself and I saw the results I was looking for. My hair dresser ordered these on my behalf and I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased!! After cutting my hair into a bob, I saw so much new growth in such a short time, it honestly seemed too good to be true, clearly it wasn&#x27;t :) &amp; the BONUS is, that there are NO side effects. I even dropped a few lbs. So glad I made the switch!!</li>
            <li> I am currently on my third bottle and I love these vitamins. My hair is getting longer and thicker. I am constantly getting compliments on my hair now. I have been natural for 4 years now. The Manechoice has a customer for life!!!</li>
            <li> Pills have never been a friend of mine. But this product have honestly been good for my nails as well as my hair. I see my nails strength more as days progressing.</li>
            <li> Great product with amazing results. It&#x27;s really hard to find products that really help your hair grow and stay healthy. I&#x27;m happy that I was introduced to this product.</li>
            <li> The best thing on the market. Not only does it help your hair. It also helps nails and skin too. My skin is so clear. Will be ordering more today. ☺</li>
            <li> I am a true advocate of themanechoice I am in love with this products. I promote it to my clients as well as anyone who wants to know about an amazing hair vitamins. They make your hair healthy, stronger, THICKER, fuller, smoother,  longer, beautiful &amp; luscious(my personal feeling, wink wink)!! I&#x27;ve been taking them since January 2014 and I will continue too! I recommend this product over hairinfinity and biotin anyday! You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product . I had tried many others and experienced head aches.  So far I have not experience anything except my nails have grown and my hair has gotten thicker. Will be order more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Manetabolism for 6 months, I begin my textaxed hair journey 06/22/2013. I started with Hairfinity however I did not see many results, my hair was a little thicker, but not what I imagined to achieve. I saw a post on Teyana Taylor&#x27;s Instagram (love her hair)!!  about Mane Choice and decided to try it. Needless to say, I&#x27;ve seen such great results.. not only is my hair thicker and longer, it&#x27;s healthier! Healthier then it&#x27;s ever been. On a hair journey it&#x27;s always important to remember &amp;#34;Health First, Length Second&amp;#34;. Of course I do not rely just on the pills to grow my hair, even with taking them you still should give your hair the proper care... build yourself a regimen, deep conditioning, moisturizing and sealing, cowashing.. etc. I also use the &amp;#34;Doesn&#x27;t get much Butter Than This&amp;#34;, with that product I use once a day at night before I moisturize and seal my hair as well Deep Conditioning Mask...I use this mask biweekly and my hair just loves it! I&#x27;m planning on buying the Thermal Defense Silkening Step 1-Step 5 Collection soon... Now my entire family uses Mane Choice as their go to for hair care! I strongly recommend this hair care line.. I live by this! Thanks Courtney you inspire me.&lt;br /&gt;Follow my HHJ on Instagram @nikkihairjourney</li>
            <li> The Manetabolism Vitamins have given my hair so much shine and thickness. I saw instant results in just 1 week! Its definitely a must buy. I can&#x27;t believe it, I thought my hair would never grow back. Thanks!</li>
            <li> These pills are by far the best hair pills I&#x27;ve ever taken. Last year, I was taking Hairfinity because of all the reviews I was hearing and noticed it was thinning my hair out as it was growing. I switched to manetabolism and noticed my hair was growing longer, THICKER, and there was no breakage! I was truly a happy camper lol Of course you have to drink tons of water when taking pills with a lot of Biotin in them but overall, I can say I truly did enjoy my hair growth experience with manetabolism and I will continue to buy hair vitamins from this company! Their shipping is even fast!! What a bonus!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Manetabolism Vitamins for six months now and have been ecstatic with my results!  The vitamins are easy to swallow and have no bad side effects for me.  My hair, skin and nails have vastly improved in heath and appearance!  I am a very happy customer and will undoubtedly continue to use this product faithfully!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with these vitamins!!  I would recommend for anyone who is trying to get their hair back on track. I tried these for a month and notice my hair didn&#x27;t shed as much and my hair that was damaged and broke off started to grow back. I have tried another vitamin but didn&#x27;t get the results I needed.  I had to try these again and I can&#x27;t wait to try out the other products!!!</li>
            <li> Omg!! These hair vitamins are theBOMB.com!!! I noticed after my first bottle that my hair was definitely thicker, longer &amp; stronger! My nails even benefited from the pills! I haven&#x27;t experienced any negative side effects! I strongly encourage anyone wanting healthier hair &amp; nails to try Man metabolism/ The Mane Choice!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these vitamins for almost three months and have seen a significant difference in my hair. Even after having my ends trimmed twice to get rid of really bad ends, I&#x27;ve seen more then an inch of growth. I highly recommend it for people tryiing to re-grow their edges!</li>
            <li> Best hair vitamins on the market I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle and my hair had grown tremendously and is so much healthier the best state is ever been even with gold hair care for two years and no heat it only took 1 bottle and I&#x27;m in love....</li>
            <li> Finally a product that shows results! After having my daughter in June my hair began to shed, thin, and I was overall really unhappy. I purchased The mane choice at the end of August and started taking them about two weeks ago. It has only been two weeks and I can already see a difference and so can others. My hair has minimal shedding, it&#x27;s getting thicker and my curls have never looked so good.(I am a natural curly girl)  My hair is so much stronger and fuller.  I have tried so many other supplements with no results. I was really getting discouraged. But these have by far met and passed my expectations. I can&#x27;t wait to see the change over the next two weeks.</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS!! No gimmicks or tricks! I was skeptical at first but after using these vitamins for only a couple of months. My hair growth is amazing and I will definitely continue to use these!</li>
            <li> I have Bern taking these pulls for three weeks now and I&#x27;m IN LOVE!! I hope with my boyfriend about possibly loving these pills more than him lol I had previously taken Hairfinity and it not only broke my son out but I also was getting terrible headaches... with the Mane choice my skin remains clear and I have not had a headache once!  I also have noticed my hair feels stronger by far... I plan on getting more products (avacado,jojoba, and all the oils)GO GET LADIES this product is sent from heaven made from an angel here on earth!!</li>
            <li> I tried the two month supply. No breakouts or any bad reactions. My nails grew longer and stronger and I definitely saw improvements in my hair. I&#x27;m ordering another supply!!</li>
            <li> After seeing many amazing testimonies of people using the Mane Choice, I decided to give them a try and bought a 4-month supply. While I was transitioning, it was a bit tricky to see progress but as soon as I big chopped, i realised how effective these vitamins were. My hair grew tremendously, I was sooo impressed! So did my nails actually. I&#x27;m still trying to grow my hair as quickly as possible so I can&#x27;t wait to repurchase. I definitely recommend this product. I noticed absolutely no breakouts at all so it&#x27;s all harmless.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THESE VITAMINS! By far the best I&#x27;ve tried yet! Made me hair a ton thicker and longer in such a short period of time! I can definitely vouch for this product and would suggest it to everyone one. Guys and girls! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been very insecure about my hair and recently started apreciating my natural beauty. I have been transitioning to  natural (still new to me) and disovered the mane choice and im currently on my second bottle. My hair has so much more definition. Im beyond proud of my results. And my hair feels and looks so much better. Thank you courtney so much.&lt;br /&gt;Giveaways@themanechoice.com</li>
            <li> started taking these pills back in June after taking another brand for almost 6 months.  This has more of the ingredients i need for hair/skin/nail nourishment and seems to be working quicker than the other pills.  No side effects so far and my stylist indicated that she&#x27;s noticely less breakage and some of my edges growing back in already so im VERY excited.  Well worth the purchase as I intend to purchase more during another sale at the themainchoice website or here on amazon if i see some price drops.  i no longer take my multi vitamins as this has all that i need.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about buying a hair product offline but being that I follow them on social media and saw that they had such great reviews I had to give it a try. ONE WORD:  AMAZING ! I purchased the vitamins and conditioner and started seeing results in about a month. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with length but shedding was a big problem or should I say breakage. Either way these vitamins and that conditioner turned my life around and I&#x27;m never looking back lol. I&#x27;m just a regular person like you. I&#x27;m not being paid to say this or anything.. I just want to help someone like someone helped me.</li>
            <li> I had heard great things and seen success pictures about the Mane Choice products, but I didn&#x27;t personally &amp;#34;know&amp;#34; anyone that was actually taking the pills.  Then one day my daugther had a friend come to the house to do a protective style in her hair.  We were discussing various hair regimens and different hair products, and starting talking about The Mane Choice pills.  This young lady said that she was in fact taking the pills, and has/had done wonders for her hair.  She said it made it thicker, longer and stronger.  So I ordered mine the next day, May 1, 2014.  Since I started taking the Manetabolism, these pills are a wonder.  The Manetabolism has become my &amp;#34;Mane&#x27;s Choice.&amp;#34; My hair has seen a significant change in growth as well as strength.  This has become my new addition.  I absolutely love these pills.  I was pleased that Ms. Courtney was able to breakdown all of the vitamins contained therein and how they work together, and I have found that with a balanced healthy diet along with the taking Manetabolism, you cannot &amp;#34;grow&amp;#34; wrong.  My hair is relaxed, so I see the growth in my own hair, as well as my finger nails.  I find that I am really taking better care of my hair now more so than before.  I recommend these pills along with her other products to all of my sisters, nieces and girl-friends.  Thanks to Ms. Courtney and her husband to allow God to use them in creating a wonderful hair product.  I am a true testament to the success taking the Manetabolism.</li>
            <li> These vitamins are the truth!!! I am on bottle number five and have seen growth and fullness. I started with a bang that was at my eyebrows and by the end of bottle two my bang was to my chin. I love these vitamins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these vitamins for 4&lt;br /&gt;months now and I&#x27;ve seen my hair getting fuller n fuller. I have thin curly hair that stopped growing like 10 years ago. I&#x27;ve tried every pill you can think of and never had results. With the mane choice I got results on the first bottle it was unbelievable and a miracle. I will be taking these vitamins for months and years to come.</li>
            <li> I purchased the two month supply pretty much on a &amp;#34;he say she say&amp;#34; type of thing and by monitoring the creators social media page with tons of reviews and pictures. So I said hey, let&#x27;s try this out. I finished my first months supply and noticed the growth after trying to go &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, let&#x27;s saaaay I missed my creamy crack! Anyways, I didnt pay much attention to how fast my hair was growing until I started my second month. When I say this makes your hair grow honey! I means it! The hubby even noticed hair growth and not on my head! &amp;#34;Ummm honey, you just shaved your legs yesterday, is this stubble I&#x27;m feeling? &amp;#34; and in my head I&#x27;m saying &amp;#34;boy stop touching me! &amp;#34; lol overall, great product! My nails have grown much much faster. I stopped getting my nails done due to the faster growth. Now I just keep them cut short. I already see growth after having my creamy crack treatment two weeks ago. Man! Ladies, great product if you&#x27;re trying to have that healthy, thick and fast growing hair(everywhere! Keep those razors sharp and that wax fresh!). I highly recommend and I&#x27;ll be purchasing my next two month supply!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been using these for 4 months. My hair so much better than it was before. I will be ordering more of these pills soon. If you want healthy hair get these pills !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using these vitamins off/on for a year in October. I love all there products. Make sure you do your length checks these vitamins really work. Not only will your hair grow but your nails will be strong and healthy also. So start growing today!</li>
            <li> I spent YEARS trying to grow my hair! I would get it right above neck length and then it would just stop! I spent a year just getting it about half an inch past there. I made the best choice I could&#x27;ve EVER made back in June. I started taking The Mane Choice Vitamins and I swear to you, I&#x27;ve seen more growth in 3 months than in 2 years! I AM ADDICTED!! I get tears in my eyes when I look at my hair now, because I never thought this was possible for me. If you want results, make The Mane Choice!</li>
            <li> A little skeptical about hair growth pills especially with hairinfinity then I came across manetabolism! I seen the testimonies and was shocked, still a little skeptical.so me and my mother tried the one month challenge. Astonishing my hair grew a inch in a half! My mother on the other hand is too lazy so I took her supply! This stuff really works! I&#x27;m currently doing the year challenge so I&#x27;m going to take these pills for a full year &amp; I&#x27;m not straightening my hair until July 2015! Also did I see hair growth my nails are long and hard and my face is smooth in clear! (Unlike hairfinity which would cause you to break out)  &amp; I also don&#x27;t drink water as much as you&#x27;re suppose to and I was still taking the pills with 0 break outs :) my hair is almost past my breast and I&#x27;m only 2 and a half months deep. Thank you Manetabolism!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Manetabolism is the best! It worked amazingly for my heat damaged hair by giving it the vitamins needed to grow healthily. I was dreading the idea of having to cut off my ends, but the pills allowed them to regain strength</li>
            <li> I tried hair infinity for 30days and didn&#x27;t see any difference to my hair! Tried Mane Choice also for 30 days and my thining hair at the top is getting thicker. My stylist even notice the difference without me saying anything. Can&#x27;t wait to get bottle number 2!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product, after originally using hairfinity for 4 month. When using hairfinity i got these weird dry pates on my skin, when they d&#x3D;finally went away i was left with scars. It also broke me out, it was horrible, and the growth rate slowed down after a while. I have been taking Manetabolism for 4 months, and I love it. My hair had grown 4 inches, no break outs, and my nails have grown as well. I have recommended this product to many friends and family, and those who have tried it are loving it.</li>
            <li> I started using these vitamins in April and the amount of growth I have seen is UNBELIEVABLE. I recently had to a big chop due to heat damage and these vitamins completely revitalized the thickness of hair, along with maximizing my hair hair growth in such a short time frame! I would recommend several times over the stars allotted. I tried other  hair growth vitamins in the past, but have not  had results close to this. If you want healthy hair, mane choice is the way to go!!!</li>
            <li> These pills are AMAZING! I&#x27;m 20 years old and lost a patch of hair when I was pregnant back in may I bought my first bottle in June and am very happy I did because since June my patch has grown back a whole five inches! My hair is stronger then ever and growing like crazy! I just bought two more bottles last night! Definitely recommend this product !</li>
            <li> The best hair vitamins with real results.  My hair has had remarkable growth, no more shedding!!  I always recommend Mane Choice after people ask about my beautiful hair &amp; growth!!!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing,the reason why I love it is because it makes my hair grow and looks healthy.am telling everyone to try it for 30dsys and you will never stop because you will love it.</li>
            <li> This product is extraordinary!! Mane choice is the BEST choice! My hair has grown so much and has gotten so full and thick since using these products! I shed less and my hair is stronger than ever before!! Love it Love it Love it!! These pills grew not only my hair but improved my skin and nails also!!</li>
            <li> These are hands down the best hair vitamins I&#x27;ve ever taken. The best thing about the vitamins, they have no side affect like other hair vitamins. I don&#x27;t have any acne from them, I&#x27;m not noticing hair growth anywhere else except on my head. My nails are 1000x times stronger and healthier. I 100% believe in The Mane Choice, I tell every and anybody about them!</li>
            <li> So, let me tell you about these AMAZING hair growth pills. Ive been using them for a couple of months now and ive seen some definite growth. I used to have to do imaginary hair flips, but now with the help of Manetabolism, I can hair flip on fees with my REAL HAIR! Ive also had my edges to start coming back in, and we all know the edge struggle is REAL! Its like these pills are made out of unicorn tears or something. But the thing I love most is that theyre AFFORDABLE! As a broke college student, most of my budget goes to ramen noodles and textbooks, but at only about $30 a month (less if you catch a discount sale on their instagram @themanechoice) I can afford to keep my hair happy and healthy! I would DEFINITELY recommend Mantabolism to my friends, mom, church members, coworkers, and even random ppl on the street! theyre that good!</li>
            <li> These pills are amazing , saw results and was overwhelmed. Can&#x27;t wait to order more.</li>
            <li> My 4th month and I&#x27;m still happy.   Ran out of pills 2 days ago and ordered a new bottle to my surprise I got the NEW ONE!  manetabolism PLUS ! So excited to start this one since My hair and body has responsed so well to the regular pills.   My hair never stops growing now, my nails are so strong and long and I&#x27;m just happy with these pills. They are part of my everyday life.   I don&#x27;t break out (I am prone to cystic acne, along with these pills I use acnepril) ... Life is good right now.</li>
            <li> i cant believe the thickness and growth that i had receive after using just one bottle after one month of using this...i love it i cannot wait till i order another bottle of this..perfect for me</li>
            <li> I have seen results after about a bottle and a half.  I absolutely have to keep drinking lots of water (6-8 bottles) each day I take the vitamins though.</li>
            <li> I have used 2 bottles of Manetabolism thus far and I have not had any hair shedding.  I have fine hair and I relax my hair every six months (my last relaxer was in June) so a length check won&#x27;t be accurate at this time. I can say though, I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts on my skin and it helps to drink plenty water throughout the day. Additionally, my nails are the longest they have ever been in the history of my life :) I do incorporate a nail hardener nowadays but they are not as brittle as they used to be.</li>
            <li> I started taking these pills on Monday, I need to wait a little longer to see hair growth but...the first day I took these pills I got major pimples! Hopefully this will go away as I keep taking them but that scares me, I want my face to stay clear and my hair to be longer and stronger.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Shipped right away.</li>
            <li> I only tried them out of curiosity. I had no concerns about my hair prior. Honestly, the pills didn&#x27;t do anything for me but reset my menstrual cycle which really sucked! I thought I had some fingernail growth but they were too brittle and didn&#x27;t last. I won&#x27;t restock</li>
            <li> Never in a million years would I have thought , hair pills would actually make my hair  grow , I thought it was all a lie just to get you to buy the product . But using mane choice I  saw rapid growth on the first bottle , so I ordered 3 more ,  my nails were amazing , my hair is now on my back  in just a few months , I will forever take  my mane choice pills ..</li>
            <li> I started using this product at about a year on another hair vitamin product. I was surprised to see that the side effects that I had on the other product were not happening here. In about a month or my first bottle I seen results. I would recommend this product to anyone. The most change I&#x27;ve seen is in my edges. They are grown back in and I couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
            <li> These pills are great on my scone bottle now, and am seeing great results, thank I man choice ur pills are awesome.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend EVERYBODY to order these vitamins. I guarantee you will see results with in a couple of weeks. I love love love manetabolism.</li>
            <li> Just started my first bottle today, ready to see my progress...</li>
            <li> I was having such a hard time finding a product that would help my hair grow. That I was ready to give up. An then a friend referred me to Mane Choice. I was hesitant at first but took a chance. &amp; it am so glad I did. This product has been wonderful to me and to my friends as well. I suggest everyone try it out. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I ordered  these to rejuvenate my edges, I didn&#x27;t have any growth there for the  years but after taking these pills for a month. I had a definite breakthrough and growth with them. My whole hair is growing like never before</li>
            <li> Of course, like so many others I purchased these vitamins to grow my hair. Almost immediately I noticed growth within the first month; length wise and thickness. I will admit I am not as diligent at doing length checks as most naturals but my hair is thicker and along with using the deep conditioner by Mane Choice I have noticed less shedding in my comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I think the biggest UNEXPECTED benefit is the boost of energy I get. I take my pills with my lunch and that&#x27;s usually when I hit the wall at work and I get a burst of energy to carry me through the rest of my work day. Its like 2 for 1.</li>
            <li> I purchased a months supply of these vitamins and was pleasantly suprised the way it not only helped my hair to grow at a quicker rate than nomal but also strengthened my nails. Will definately purchase these again.</li>
            <li> I started out looking in to hair vitamins by Hairfinity. But I was concerned about some of the after effects of the vitamin. Throughout my research I had ran into Manetabolism. Advertised with the pill was a beautiful woman with long, pretty hair. I said &amp;#34;hey! Ive seen her!&amp;#34; I remember her face from other researches I&#x27;ve done when wanting to start my natural hair journey. So I then begin to research Manetabolism. I&#x27;ve heard nothing but good things &amp; their customer testimonials are unbelievable. I remember being so excited &amp; ordering the vitamins right away. At the time of purchase they were having a free shipping promo or what have you going on &amp; I just couldn&#x27;t resist. The vitamins help with the growth of hair &amp; nails. The testimonials are really beautiful. Some people see results in as little as 3 weeks! I was so amazed. Themanechoice.com for all their products @themanechoice on instagram. I love Manetabolism!!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> These pills are amazing ! I saw results in 2 weeks seriously! I stopped taking them because my braids started to look bad because my hair was growing so much, which is a good thing! I love it</li>
            <li> I love The Mane Choice. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 months and have had great results. No breakouts or bad side affects at all!!! I&#x27;ve also seen results in less than two weeks of starting!!! What other hair supplements does that? It&#x27;s so great that I introduced it to 5 of my friends and they are loving it too!! The mane choice is the right choice.</li>
            <li> These hair vitmins are AMAZING! Ive had sooooo much growth since i started talking them in April! I never thought hair vitamins would work this well but these are on point! They have all the ingredients of a multivitamin plus more. I take medications daily and would sometimes have 0 energy but manetabolism gives me that extra boost of energy i had been missing! Im sooo excited to see my hair in a year! Ps the deep conditioner is next on my must have list...i heard its the bomb.com :-)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Manetabolism products, specifically the healthy hair vitamin. I big chopped in October of last year and while I was extremely happy with my haircut and the decision I had made, by December I was truly missing my hair. I&#x27;d heard many reviews about different hair vitamins, but the one that stuck out most of Manetabolism, so I did my research and boy oh boy, was I excited to visit the website. I put my order in for a 60 day supply and the delivery was speedy. I received them 3 days after ordering on a Saturday. The reason I enjoyed the hair vitamins is because it truly worked from the inside out. Not only did a see amazing results with my hair growth and hair thickness, I saw changes in my skin, and my nails. My skin began to look brighter, almost as if I had glow. While my nails have always grown, they were never as strong as they were after indulging in the healthy hair vitamins. I would recommend the healthy hair vitamins to any and everyone. Most people learn by trial and error; trying one thing after another, but that isn&#x27;t necessary with Manetabolism. The company, the customer service, the product, everything is amazing and I rate them off the charts (I wish there were more than five stars to give).</li>
            <li> Intially I started by using Hairfinity until I notice my face breaking out and I grew frustrated. I found the mane choice on the popular page of my IG and decided to give it a try ! I am African American and nothing has ever made my hair grow so FAST not just that but THICK AND HEALTHY !!!! I am now on my fourth bottle and my hair is passing my shoulders when I cut it up to my ears in March ! These pills are a GODSEND !!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. i have been using it for 2 months and my hair has grown and it also has become thicker. it is amazing, I have used hairfinity before, but I was not getting results as I am now with the manetabolism pills. Its amazing and i have my friends buying the product now becauase they love my results that i am gettong.</li>
            <li> best hair, skin, nail vitamin if you are seeking results. My nails are much more stronger. My eyelashes are enviously long. With a sufficient amount of water and making healthier food choices my skin looks great. My hair which was once stunted in growth and thinning at the crown has shown a significant amount of improvement overall. i Have been using the hair vitamins for about six months and I am impressed with my results with this product and i am going to be along time customer.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Definitely noticed results the first month.  Arrived on time.  This brand is 1000% better than Hairfinity. Absolutely no breakouts.  A must try.  What are you waiting for!!  3 easy steps. Add it to your cart, enter your info, and confirm.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had edges in years from wearing braids in my early 20s. I heard about this product on social media and decided to see if the hype was real. Well let me tell you, IT&#x27;S REAL. I&#x27;ve been taking this product for 3 months. The first 3 weeks I got 1&amp;#34; of growth. The second month I had another 1.5inch of growth. I&#x27;m half way through my third bottle and I&#x27;m wearing a protective style. Let me just tell you, this style usually last a month and after 2 weeks is time to get it redone because all of my new growth. Also, I HAVE EDGES AGAIN.  But, not only is my hair growing, it&#x27;s healthy. I have fullness, shine and manageability. I&#x27;ve been natural for 2 years now and wish I would&#x27;ve known about this product years ago. I promise, you won&#x27;t be disappointed by this product. I just recommend you drink PLENTY (about 2-3 liters) of water a day to avoid breakouts. I did get minor breakouts around my chin area. I then read the reviews and realized I needed to increase my water consumption. This is an amazing product and does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> These Pills are a Godsend. When I first heard about them I was a but skeptical until I order them. I just recently started to really take care of my hair and taking these for the first two months my hair is thicker and my lenght is now bra strap length. I just order another two months and I can&#x27;t wait to watch my hair grow this product is amazing I&#x27;ve recommended it to many of my friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product out did my nails wonders, better than hair finity. Took 2 months worth of pills but biotin gives me headaches so I had to stop &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> These pills are owned by a godly woman, therefore God is blessing these pills and blessing those using it .</li>
            <li> I love this product it shoes tremendous results.</li>
            <li> Everyone experiences growth differently. I&#x27;m on my second bottle. I have definitely noticed a difference in my hair and nails. My hair is thicker and my nails are stronger. The only way to appreciate and experience the change is by taking a side by side comparison of the before and after. Its cheaper if you buy directly from their website.</li>
            <li> These Vitamins are pass the bomb.com lol seriously I am blown away by such awesome results ! I big chopped for the 3rd time on april 23rd of this year and my hair has grown so much ! Not only is it growing like a weed but its soooo thick and beautiful ! I&#x27;ve been getting so many compliments on my hair than I&#x27;ve ever gotten before and I owe it all to these vitamins ! Courtney and her husband are geniuses ! God has truly blessed them and I&#x27;m so thankful that she shared her vitamins and products with all of us to experience ! I will be a loyal customer from here on out ! If you want longer or thicker hair or both please give these vitamins a try ! as well your nails and skin will be flawless ! :)</li>
            <li> I love these vitamins, they give me life lol. I like that fact that they help promote healthy hair, hair growth and nails and it actually works. When i first started I got results from only 1 week of use!</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  I was on another hair vitamin for 2 1/2 months.  I didn&#x27;t see growth like the Instagram pics showed and I started to breakout.  I know everyone is different but they just weren&#x27;t working for me.  With a bottle and a 1/2 left I decided to stop.  I then found these.  I wish I had started with The Mane Choice first!  I would not have lost money but only gained hair!  I am on my second bottle and have two more waiting for me.  I will definitely continue to use these pills.  No side effects at all.  Try these and you will never want to try the rest.</li>
            <li> I have seen so much growth with these vitamins.  I got the two month to just try them, and I can&#x27;t wait to save up and buy more( I am a college student) ! I had a sew in and its def time to take it out with this new growth.  The only thing I wish I did was take before and after pics.  Def would recommend!</li>
            <li> I just started my fourth month of manetabolism and I love this vitamin. I don&#x27;t get cystic acne or any other side effect. They are easy to take. Shipping is also really fast. My hair was already thick but with this vitamin it has become thicker !!!! I am also retaining all of my length!! Thanks ManeChoice!!</li>
            <li> Purchased these pills for the first last month and my hair has gotta thicker and looks much healthier! I&#x27;m hooked and will be forever a customer of The Mane Choice!</li>
            <li> These pills are amazing ! You see results so quickly. I&#x27;ve tried many other hair supplements ( Hairfinty, biotin, hair skin and nails) and I&#x27;ve never seen my hair grow as fast as when I&#x27;m taking these. You must drink a lot of water. I also noticed I don&#x27;t break out like the other hair pills have caused me too.</li>
            <li> I started taking these pills back in June and within a week I immediately seen results of course I was very pleased but then my next question was would it continue to work this well. Now I&#x27;m here 4months late still taking them and my hair is longer , thicker, and most importantly healthier and the icing on the cake is my skin , nails and eyelashes have also improved! So this is why I consider the mane choice as the ONLY option when your searching for pills to take to promote hair growth. I also forgot that I now have 4 of my friends using and even my mother ! Lol order yours now !!!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome along with every other product this line offers. Once you try it you won&#x27;t want any others! I recommend this company&#x27;s products to anyone looking for natural and healthy hair care.</li>
            <li> These pills works miracles My husband hair started falling out because he has Alopecia areata (AA) which  is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body, usually from the scalp.[1][2] Because it causes bald spots on the scalp, especially in the first stages, it is sometimes called spot baldness. In 1–2% of cases, the condition can spread to the entire scalp (alopecia totalis) or to the entire epidermis (alopecia universalis). He started taking these pills two months ago and from tge time he started taking them till now we see amazing growth.

            <li> I absolutely love this product. I ordered a 2 month supply of this product and received on 8/14. I have been taking his product for one month and have received amazing results. I have already gained an inch of hair and that is awesome for me because my hair usually grows 1/4- 1/2 inch a month. The other thing I really love about this product is that it is very easy to digest. Now I am a person who has such a hard time taking pills but I can easily open these and put them in my yogurt or morning shakes.. Its just makes it so easy. I will definitely continue ordering these. I can wait to see what six month/ a year brings.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the results I have been getting sin I have started using this product. I was so excited that I also but for my mother and grandmother. They also love it. Not only is it growing my hair stronger and healthier but it is also doing the same for my nails.</li>
            <li> Best hair pills on the market. My hair is very stubborn and I have tried everything under the sun to get my hair to grow. I was very pleased after the first bottle. My hair is growing great and i will continue taking these pills. I would advise anyone looking to grow longer healthier hair to give these a try. You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I love these vitamins, I have noticed a change in length of my hair after the first bottle, my nails are stronger and longer. I am starting my second bottle and look forward to my hair journey</li>
            <li> I first ordered these vitamins after suffering chemical damage. They are easy to take, does not break you out or give you a headache. They actually do work! No hype, just truth. I&#x27;ve always had thick past shoulder length hair, but after the damage I had to cut it. These pills have grown my hair over six inches in three months. It is also back thick and shiny. I just ordered another 4 month supply during the free shipping sale and received them in 3 business days. No other vitamin for me.</li>
            <li> These vitamins are my everything right now! Before I started using them my hair was breaking off sooo bad because it was so dry. I&#x27;m on my second bottle right now &amp; I kid you not but I maybe get like 5 strands of hair in my comb when I&#x27;m detangling (wet). &amp; my hair is bleached! &amp; don&#x27;t get me started on the new growth ! I&#x27;m at my neck bone now, but give me about 4 more months &amp; my hair will be at the middle of my back! Go buy you some today ! You won&#x27;t regret it! Go now! What are you waiting for! Haha :)</li>
            <li> I purchased my first two month supply of the manetabolism back when Courtney first started selling them. My mother (whose hair has always grown faster then mine) started taking hairfinity at the same time so we could decide which product was better. Needless to say when we completed our two month &#x27;experiment&#x27; my hair had grown close to 2inches while hers had only grown close to one inch. She also experienced acne around her nose. After that I was hooked! I currently take my length check pictures every 16days because that&#x27;s how often I have extremely noticeable growth! I have tried biotin pills and a few other hair/nail pills but nothing had the same results. I have recommended these pills to every naturalista I know. A majority of my friends now take the pills and none of us have anything bad to say. No side effects whatsoever. I also love the hair butter. These pills paired with protective styling and various tips/tricks shared on social media by founder Courtney have taken my hair to the next level! I also love how often there have promotions and deals, I even got 15% off for my birthday!  #ForeverCustomer</li>
            <li> Best hair growth vitamins ! You will definitely see results in the first month. I never want to go a month without them.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic. It has brought life back to my hair whicg had lost is shine due to personal stress. Ive always had long hair, however, these vitamins gave me a definite legnth boost within finishing my first bottle. Im on my second at the moment. The customer service was also fantastic with great communication.  As i live in the UK i was shocked at how quickly they arrived. I woukd definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> hello, I&#x27;ve been using the manetabolism 4 months I love it, can&#x27;t wait until I get a year in, I think everyone should try it, I have all my friends using it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The vitamins have caused my edges that have been missing for a long time to come back in so full!!</li>
            <li> These pills are a MIRACLE! I have been suffering from thin edges and overall thin coarse hair for my entire life. Since I have started taking these pills my hair has grown in thicker, and healthier. I haven&#x27;t had any side effects, NO breakouts or any other complications. These pills have made my hair grow faster than they ever have in my life. I am soooo glad this product came along! The creator Courtney &amp; her husband REALLY know what they are doing! I have recommended this to all of my friends and coworkers because it WORKS! I know people are against hair grown vitamins because they think they don&#x27;t work or are a sham but these are the real deal! We all need vitamins in our daily lives and Courtney has come up with a unique formula that works wonders. I am completely confident in her and her husband based off of their credentials. Also Courtney&#x27;s hair is AMAZING and very long through her use of the pills! Whats not to LOVE.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these pills for about 2 months and the growth is AWESOME, my hair already grows pretty fast but now I have up to 2 inches of new growth. I have been recommending these pills to EVERYONE, next stop I will be trying out the deep conditioner and butter. I&#x27;m like a kid in a candy store..</li>
            <li> These pills give my hair life. At first I was a little skeptical about taking these pills, but boy am I GLAD I ORDERED THEM. MY HAIR IS GROWING MUCH FASTER than it normally would; thicker as well. I always had problems with my edges due to perming and tight hair styles, but I can see great results already. To be honest with you, I haven&#x27;t been consistent , but I still see Marvelous results. I recently purchased a new bottle. THESE PILLS ARE MY BEST FRIEND FOR LIFE. THANK YOU MANE CHOICE!!</li>
            <li> These pills are absolutely amazing! I&#x27;ve only been taking the pills for about 3 weeks and have already noticed growth in both the length and thickness of my hair. If you&#x27;re afraid of breaking out or wasting your money, DON&#x27;T BE! Make the choice, they&#x27;re afforadable and are completely worth every penny.&lt;br /&gt;-E.Warner</li>
            <li> OMG! I am in looooooveeeee with this brand. At first I debated against either this brand or hair infinity but I was told that The Mane Choice is a more natural brand which uses more natural and organic products then the other leading brands. I started using the hair pills and it got my hair POPPIN, 💁. I really recommend The Mane Choice brand, especially if your natural and want your hair to grow back healthy and full. I love The Mane Choice 😍❤</li>
            <li> I am now on my third month with these vitamins and they are amazing. My hair is not only longer but it&#x27;s growing in thicker and is visibly healthier. I even have my mom taking them now. I would definitely recommend these vitamins over anything else.</li>
            <li> I purchased these pills after getting a Dominican blow out (which completely thinned my hair). These pills are a life saver!!!! I repeat a life saver!!!! My hair is thicker, fuller, and retains length. I no longer have to be embarrassed of having see through hair. I would purchase these pills, they are completely worth it!!! Plus, the customer service is more like family then a third party company selling merchandise!!!!</li>
            <li> I am recently finished my first bottle of Manetabolism Hair Vitamins and I have to say I am in love with this product! I experienced breakage due to chemicals  and heat damage. after just one bottle I see a difference in my hair. I cant wait to continue on my hair journey with your products! I will soon order more. Thank you for this!</li>
            <li> Greatest hair pills i&#x27;ve tried. I have tried several different pills and product to try and get my hair to grow. To date the Manetabolism pill are working wonders. I  am so thankful that my sister told me about this. I now have my other sister and my boyfriend taking this pills and excited about the growth. My hair is not only long but healthier then is has ever been. Great product.</li>
            <li> This product gave me confidence. I can walk out on the street with my natural hair and not feel insecure. Im the the of person who wears weaves alot cause I&#x27;ve never liked the growth and thinness of the hair. Now after using this for just one month I saw results. I almost wanted to cry cause now I don&#x27;t have to hide under weaves anymore. I can rock the hair good wanted me to have. Thank you mane choice!</li>
            <li> Heard a lot about this vitamin !!!! Def can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these pills I&#x27;m on my third bottle and within the first two weeks of taking them I seen a nice amount of growth I would recommend these my edges are also really thin from year of pulling when I was younger and they are finally filling in it&#x27;s been years I thought my sides and edges were forever gone lol but with the mane choice I had hope!!</li>
            <li> Honestly they do work. I bought to 2 bottles a little over a month ago. My nails started to grow pretty fast and my hair grew about an inch. Im looking to continue  taking these pills so I can continue to grow long beautiful natural hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product so much! I am one of the many people who despises taking pills but these are so worth the hassle. I was a bit skeptical at first because I always end up being apart of the 10% group that a specific product does not work for but Manetabolism has proved to be different. I have hereditary thinning of my edges and since taking Manetabolism while simultaneously using their 100% pure Castor Oil, I have seen a significant improvement in the growth of edges. I just recently added the &amp;#34;Doesn&#x27;t Get Much Butter Than This&amp;#34; to my twist-out regimen and it provides so much stretch and retention that I could just cry! It is so amazing to have products that actually work for your hair type and smell absolutely fabulous! At least 7 of my friends have now ordered Manetabolism because they see the impact it is having on my hair! Thank God for Courtney!</li>
            <li> I have nothing but excellent results from my vitamins. I have been natural for about 3yrs and just recently a best friend of mine told me about these vitamins and I absolutely fell in love. Not only did I grow a healthy set of nails which at one point was impossible but my hair whoa... Only after a couple of weeks using my pills I noticed my hair was softer, thicker and growing rapidly...I am extremely happy with my vitamins not only are they good for the body but my hair nails and skin even.....yes to the Mane!!!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased these pills for a specific reason and have received so many additional benefits, including healthy thick(er) hair, strong nails, and reduced shedding. They have also encouraged me to increase my water intake. EXCELLENT product!!!!</li>
            <li> im a college student, and ive been natural for 1yr and a couple of months now, i could never seem to find products that will hold moisture to my hair, or anything that will make it grow how i wanted it to. The Mane Choice products are amazing! BEYOND AMAZING! i follow her on instagram and check out her website daily before i made a choice to get her products, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND the manetabolism vitamins! not only will it make your hair grow, but it makes your skin, and nails look AMAZING! this is the best and nothing but the best! I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> The bomb grows your hair! I would recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but I must express my happiness with this product. I have used countless companies such as Hairfinity, phyto, natures best, Nixon, and only one that has worked for me is Mane Choice! I&#x27;ve been using the vitamins for about 2 months and so far my hair has grown 2 inches and is much healthier overall! My hair is shedding less and I haven&#x27;t experienced any acne breakout like I did when I used Hairfinity vitamins. I recommend this product to all my friends and they fell in love once they started to use them also. I only wished I tried this earlier instead of giving Hairfinity a second chance. Thanks Mance Choice!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only took one hair pills in my life and all it did was break me out! I have really sensitive skin so I&#x27;ve always been afraid of trying new things...but my edges were particularly none existent and I needed a breakthrough.. Mane Choice hair vitamins has given me that!!! it hasn&#x27;t even been two months and already my edges are thicker and my hair is shiny and getting longer. best ever i swear. oh and noooo breakouts, not anywhere :)</li>
            <li> This pills are awesome! I&#x27;ve struggled with thinning edges for as long as I can remember. I tried HairFinity and it broke my face out horribly and I never really saw significant growth except for my bodily hair. I saw an advertisement for Mane Choice so I decided to try it out! BEST decision. Not only are my edges fuller only after 1.5 months, but my nails are so much stronger and longer AND my face has cleared up. No breakouts! I&#x27;m so thankful for these pills.</li>
            <li> This vitamin is amazing I seen results in one month. My hair grew fast as well as my nails. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this product works WONDERS !!! this is the best hair growth vitamin ! it makes hair longer &amp; so much thicker !! it&#x27;s like magic vitamins for your hair !! I suggest this over all of the other vitamins !!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE VITAMINS!!! My hair was dry and damaged from bleach and dye.  I had to cut  my hair really short to get rid of the damaged parts and I actually considered shaving my hair off and starting over.  After doing some research and checking testimonials I decided to try these vitamins. Let me tell you, I started noticing a difference in a week! My hair was softer and not frizzy. I bought a two month supply directly from the manechoice website (much more cost effective that way)  and at the end of those 2 months I had over an inch of growth and healthy soft hair. There was a lot of research put into this product by the owner and it is a product worth getting. Two pills daily and I never once experienced a breakout.  Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> I have been using these vitamins for two months and I am absolutely in love with the results. I purchased a year supply and I share them with my Daugther. Thank you for this product.</li>
            <li> Love these vitamins they have helped me so much can&#x27;t wait to start back up on them as soon as possible</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. That&#x27;s it, point blank. It does as advertised without the extra. I&#x27;ve taken about three months supply, one month between each bottle and my hair has significantly grown 3 extra inches. This product doesn&#x27;t upset my stomach,  doesn&#x27;t mess with my sleep and doesn&#x27;t mess with my appetite. It has made my transistion to natural so easy. I was truly amazed. Especially when you take before and after pictures. I want to buy more asap but that college life has me strapped for cash. Will definitely continue buying though. I&#x27;m also going to try the other products!</li>
            <li> I love these hair pills so much omg words cannot explain they make my hair so much more fuller andlonger than the hairfinity pills I am so happy I found this pill thank you so much do not hesitate to buy!!! You won&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> I have been taking these vitamins for 3 months now. Since I have been taking them I have had nail growth, hair length growth of about 4 inches, and less hair shedding . The pills are about the size of a normal multivitamin. I have not had any side effects , no facial breakouts ect...,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these pills for about 2 months now. I haven&#x27;t been taking them everyday like I&#x27;m suppose to. I just finished my monthly supply and I have about 2 inches of hair growth and my edges filled in and also a bald area at the crown of my hair now has hair there. This product is great I&#x27;m gonna start my second bottle today. Out of every product that i tried using To grow my hair, this is the only one that&#x27;s ever worked. I&#x27;m so glad that I found this product :)</li>
            <li> These pills are the bomb.com! Ive tried what feels like every vitamin for hair growth and was about to give up on the whole thing until I stumbled across these little gems of awesomeness. I noticed a significant amount of growth within weeks of starting my regimen. You do have to comsume a resonable amount of water and maintain healthy hair care with these so keep that in mind. I cant say how much I love these vitamins and will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> These pills are great. I have been using them for about four months now and have notice my hair first getting thicker then it started to get more length. I have not gotten any side effects like hair loss, which i experience with hair infinity.</li>
            <li> I started using this product when I went natural 3 years go because my hair was so damaged from a bad relaxer I received. I experienced bad breakage.. Thinned sections of hair. It was just coming out.. I was depressed about my hair I didn&#x27;t know what to do until I ran across a YouTube channel .. The young lady had a beautiful head of hair (Courtney) she was talking about this hair vitamins that you created that helped her hair grow long thick and healthy.... But I had heard this all before .. Tried all type of products.. Creams oils  pills shampoos that all failed.. So I did so more research on the manechoice .. Finally gave in and I&#x27;m so happy that I did...  My hair is growing and after just one bottle I was amazed it worked so fast ... I didn&#x27;t have and breakouts like with biotin pills I didn&#x27;t feel sick to my stomach nothing no side affects.. Just healthy hair..  Please ladies and men if you are having hair growing issues please try this product you will not be disappointed..!!!!!</li>
            <li> Having healthy long hair begins from within and these vitamins are awesome. Formulated by people within a medical field these vitamins have the right proportion of everything you need to have healthy, long, luscious hair with no adverse side effects. I am on my six bottle and my hair is 6 inches longer. I consume lots of water while tasking these vitamins, eat healthy and exercise. I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I wanted my hair to grow in thicker and longer and since buying this product and using it I&#x27;ve noticed a difference. my hair is filing in and I see new growth more often than the previous hair pills I was taking. Thank you mane choice :)</li>
            <li> These vitamins really work, my eldest daughter was having some breakage issues during the summer and started taking this product. Within a few days she immediately noticed that her hair was looking fuller and thicker. She even saw some change in length within the first couple of weeks. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to have healthier, fuller hair!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these hair vitamins! I&#x27;ve been using them for over six months now and I am growing double the amount of hair per month than before! Yes I have measured! I&#x27;ve also noticed thicker hair around my hairline which was thinner than the rest of my hair. And best of all, no side effects other than increased energy due to the B12 in these! Winning! :-)</li>
            <li> Ive been ordering and using mane choice products for over a year now and they are AMAZING!! I tell everyone about the product line whenever I get a chance. My hair grows at a very slow rate but once I started using the vitamins my hair began to grow at a much faster rate, shed less and was stronger and healthier overall!! A few months back my fiancee started losing his hair. He was only 28 at the time and couldnt understand why his hair was balding.  We went to the dermatologist and he suggested cortisone shots. Nothing worked.  He was devasted and beginning to lose hope. I swore by the vitamins and talked him into trying them since I saw great results with my hair.  He took them for a month and slowly but surely his hair grew back. We havent been able to purchase more yet because I recently lost my job and we are trying to save for our wedding but as soon as I get back on my feet I will be ordering more. His confidence has grown tremedously thanks to mane choice vitamins.   Thank you for this amazing product it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I am ABSOLUTELY obsessed with the Mane Choice products. This product has changed my life forever. I struggled with thinning edges for years and no matter what products i tried it NEVER helped. When i stumbled across The Mane Choice i had to try... Very skeptical at first im not gonna lie, But i gave it a shot. HONEY ......let me tell you something MANE CHOICE HAS BECOME MY LOVER AND BESTFRIEND LOL. I neverrrr forget to take it , its apart of my life and will stay with me forever. Not to mention my nail growth had skyrocketed. I</li>
            <li> Manetabolism gives life. Period. I tried the vitamins earlier this year (for 3 months), and I could not have been happier with my results! This vitamin does wonders for your hair, skin, and nails. My new growth was sooo lush. I try to purchase these vitamins on sale. Which, thankfully happens quite often on the manechoice website. If you&#x27;re remotely hesitant about &amp;#34;miracle pills&amp;#34; and don&#x27;t know which one to try, this one is a winner!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these vitamins. I never thought my hair would get back to being healthy after a really bad experience. But thanks to mane choice I am on the right track now.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I bought one bottle back in April just to try them out and see how they work for me. I was wearing braids, so I could see when I had growth. When I say these vitamins are no joke.... I noticed growth (about .5 inch) in 2 weeks! My hair usually grows .25 inch per month! I had to get more. Ordered a 4-month supply back in August and my hair has been growing like crazy. I&#x27;ve been taking progress photos to keep up with the growth and that&#x27;s really the only way you&#x27;ll notice. Not only did my hair grow, but my nails became very strong. They were always long, but weak and would break off. But not while I&#x27;m taking Manetabolism. These also give me energy where I don&#x27;t feel sluggish after waking in the mornings! Just get a bottle already!! Even if you don&#x27;t like taking pills, it&#x27;s a capsule. So you can open it and sprinkle in smoothies, water, on food. Whatever! Get one month supply and see your amazing results. I promise you&#x27;ll be hooked!</li>
            <li> I loved these pills . I took them everyday for a month and my hair grew an Inch which is a lot considering my hair doesn&#x27;t grow that much in month regularly . They also thicken my hair and made it stronger . When ever someone is speaking of wanting to grow and strengthen their hair I tell them to buy the mane choice hair pills . It&#x27;s a decision you won&#x27;t regret :)</li>
            <li> These were the second type of hair vitamins I took, anf by far the best!At first I just took Biotin but it broke my face out bad so I stopped using it. Then I came across the mane choice at first I was iffy at the price but seen all the great reviews at said what the heck! I received them in a timely manner and started taking them as soon as I got them. I only took a month supply but  that on the supply green my hair out and made it.thicker which is great for someone with then hair like mine!! If you need help with your growing or anything these vitamins are great! I ordered a 2 month supply this time!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with these vitamins. Not only did they grow my hair, but the shedding stopped, it&#x27;s healthier than ever and my face is glowing. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I love these vitamins! I bought these to help grow back my hair in the front since I cut it off due to heat damage( bad decision). After taking the vitamins for a month I was more than happy with wearing my hair in a full wash n go! It has grown about an inch. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and I am getting ready to order again soon since I&#x27;m out!</li>
            <li> My mom and I tried these to help with out hair growth. She had thinned out sides because of her locs and my hair started breaking and thinning after my son was born. Needless to say hat edges are now completely filled in and my hair is the longest that it&#x27;s been in a long time and my nails are growing constantly and they are thick!  No break outs or side effects. Love love love this product!  I now have my clients, family and friends buying the vitamins.</li>
            <li> Great pills!!! Really helped with the hair loss around my edges from braids , etc.</li>
            <li> I have been using the mane choice for a month now and I&#x27;m absolutely in love. My hair has grown and gotten so much thicker. I was told that my hair wouldn&#x27;t grow back in due to my alopecia. But thanks to the mane choice it&#x27;s growing.</li>
            <li> I completely love the ManeChoice products...the viatmins are awesome and have given me such awesome hair growth...my curls are way more healthier than before along with Don&#x27;t Get Much Butter Than This...I must have for naturals.. 😃😃😃👏👏👏</li>
            <li> I have been using Manetabolism Healthy Hair Vitamins since March of this year and I can absolutely say that this product works!  Not only did I have extrodinary growth, my edges grew back also.  I would advise this product to anyone seeking to restore hair growth, that want thickness, or just all around length!  Since using Manetabolism, I have introduced the product to my sister in law who has had some issues with thinness, and hair growth.  Now everytime there is either a 20% off sale or free shipping sale she is calling me to tell me so that we can order our next bottles!  I also introduced my friend to the product who in turn now has her mom using the product! So if your looking for that product to give you thickness, return of your edges, and overall length, MANETABOLISM  is the place to go!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dying to get these hair growth pills, hopefully I get it soon.</li>
            <li> I recently just started taking the mane choice and I love it already my hair is getting fuller and stronger! I recommend this to anyone all hair types ! 😍😊</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in need of edge rejuvenation. Long hair is nice, but nothing when you can see your scalp through your hair st the sides of your temples. I&#x27;ve been taking them for a month and have seen tremendous progress l, more so than the two years since I stopped relaxing it. This is a great buy for any hair issues that you may have.</li>
            <li> I am honored to use the mane choice as part of my daily regiment. I&#x27;m almost done with the first bottle and ready I&#x27;ve noticed my hair has gotten thicker,especially around the edges and has plenty of new growth. I referred mane choice product to friends, family and co-workers.&lt;br /&gt;The products are awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this  product so much. It actually work!! They are a product that have no gimmicks or lies. If you buy this product you will fall in love with it. I recommend this products to all my friends and family. I was able to see my friend&#x27;s edges grow back and my hair gaining inches within a matter of a month. It is a great product!!</li>
            <li> At first I was a little skeptic about trying this product.  I purchased 2 bottles of this Hair Skin and Nails vitamins.  I have had such positive results that I am about to order me 2 more bottles.  By the end of my first bottle, I could see some very thin &amp;#34;baby hair&amp;#34; on my bald spot.  Let me tel you that I have been struggling with this bald spot for the past 3 years, I have tried just about everything that I could find for balding.  THIS IS THE REAL DEAL, look no further.  Mane Choice is the ONLY choice for mer.  By the end of my second bottle, my hair is no longer thin, it is so thick that I have to moisturize it twice day.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT, what a blessings in disguise.</li>
            <li> I brought this product in February, just to try it out. I got the Mane Choice and I brought a cousin of mine Hairfinity, both of us are natural. Before taking, I cut about two inches off of my hair because it was damaged badly. In a month, my hair grew back and then some. By April, my hair had grown about 4 inches. I sent them pictures to show. I didn&#x27;t take them daily as I should, but I did take two a day, and now my hair is so healthy and it&#x27;s growing so long. People always compliment on how healthy my hair looks. I used to take biotin and prenatal vitamins, but after taking these, I will still to them. I did not have any negative side effects. No breaking out, or nausea or stomach pains or any of that. But I guess that depends on the person. Me personally, I would recommend it to everyone. I do recommend it to everyone who ask, or even those who just say they are going to take vitamins for their hair, I tell them what I used, and I show them the three pictures I have.</li>
            <li> I Have been using Manetabolism hair vitamins now for two months and I am about to order my third bottle. I am not big on leaving reviews on product&#x27;s unless I am sure they will work. THESE VITAMINS ABSOLUTELY WORK!! one step closer to my healthy hair goal thank you mane choice love these.</li>
            <li> I just recently started my transition from relaxed to natural and it hasn&#x27;t been easy but when I heard about manetabolism I got excited it has grown my natural hair out and made my transition much easier I bought a six month supply and I can&#x27;t wait to see the incredible results. thanks a lot manechoice :)</li>
            <li> I started taking these pills September 2nd. And in the first 2 weeks I began to see results. My hair grew half an in 2 weeks. Really amazing. My shedding hasn&#x27;t stopped yet I&#x27;m having postpartum shedding. I&#x27;m hope they do make the shedding stop. So far I am pleased with the pills and do recommend them.</li>
            <li> I have been using The Manetabolism vitamin for three months now. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking to improve the overall health of their hair. Not only has my hair grown from the opening of my mouth to now passing my chin, I also noticed that my hair is fuller. I take two pills at night, and I must say, I have not increased my water intake from what I was already drinking, and I have not experienced any abnormal breakouts. A downside to me would be the fact that I like to keep my nails naturally short, and I have to cut them more frequently due to the growth I&#x27;m experiencing with the vitamins.</li>
            <li> These vitamins are beyond amazing! Not only has my hair began to grow more but it has gotten thicker as well. Even my nails grow like wildfire! I&#x27;m so in love with this product and I recommend it to anyone who wants to jump start a new healthy hair regimen.</li>
            <li> This hair supplement is the best. There are no side effects just great results. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a month and the results are astonishing.  My hair is longer and thicker, it looks and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> My nails are very very weak. I have tried acrylic polish and gel polish and they are still weak. I recently cut my hair but didn&#x27;t like my look so in deceived to grow it back. I have only been taking the Manetabolism pills for a month and have seen amazing results. My nails are extremely strong and for the first time last week I was able to get a manicure with normal polish and it looked fantastic! I also have major new growth under my protective style. I recommend these for those who have the same struggles as I do or should I say did!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Mane Choice for 3 months now and have seen outstanding results not only for myself but also in my mother. I needed help with length retention and my edges. Within 2 1/2 weeks I started to see thin spots become full spots and short thinning areas became just a bit longer. Now I have much more growth and my protective style is grown out after a month!! My mother has alopecia and had been told by several dermatologist over the past 20 years that there was no hope of any hair re growth in her temple follicles and around the front and back of her head. I though to myself that if the middle of her crown was still growing (like wild fire mind you) why can&#x27;t the rest of it? So I ordered her pills and she has seen re growth in her temples already in 3 weeks! It&#x27;s very small, but you notice a change from bald to a little less bald. Next is to order some for my grandmother and cousin in Germany! Thank you mane choice you have made me forever a believer in your products. Thank you for fixing our crowns and making them shine again.</li>
            <li> I love these vitamins. They make your hair grow and reduce shedding a lot. They are worth the investment and they are capsules and easy to swallow</li>
            <li> I LOVED MANETABOLISM. And that&#x27;s saying something because I&#x27;m usually quite the skeptic about so-called &amp;#34;mystical magical hair growth pills&amp;#34; but this stuff really is the truth! Your hair will TAKE OFF. I bought some this summer and have dreaded everyday I had to go without them thinking to myself, &amp;#34;dang, if i had gotten a year supply, my hair could&#x27;ve been to my ankles by now!&amp;#34; Haha, I definitely recommend these pills!! Especially for anyone suffering from that awkward post twa/pre-hangtime stage. :)&lt;br /&gt;You definitely won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I finished bottle number 2 and currently transitioning back to natural. The relaxer made my hair so thin and these vitamins are pushing my new growth in nice and thick!!! I&#x27;ve stopped getting acrylic nails also and growing out my natural nails please order a bottle you will not regret it!</li>
            <li> I am known as a product junkie, I have spent countless time and money on trying to find the right hair vitamins. Thank the heavens above for MANETABOLISM. The results are excellent: Stops shedding. thickens the hair, grows the hair (within 30 days), nail growth and a boost in energy.  This is a GREAT product. 5 STARS!</li>
            <li> These vitamins are AWESOME! When I first tried these vitamins I noticed a difference in my hair within 3 weeks. I had just got a trim before I started them so my hair was real healthy no split ends. I am natural and my bangs stretched was to the mid section of the bridge of my nose. Three weeks later my bangs were past my bottom lip stretched. I love these vitamins and I advise anyone wanting to try a hair vitamin to get these. My hair is fuller and I can see the healthiness of my hair all over. Also I haven&#x27;t had full edges since a fungus took them out years ago. Some spots were completely smooth. Now I have edges! They are continuing to fill in and I am starting to see the length. I&#x27;m so happy I made the right choice with the MANE CHOICE. Hopefully anyone looking for a hair vitamin will make the MANE CHOICE TOO!</li>
            <li> This Product Is great , I found out about their products via Instagram. I have The length T-Shirt , and I am eager for my future length check. I would totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I went natural about a year ago and I did the ultimate big chop, I shaved all of my hair off. Over the year, i&#x27;ve accumulated about 5 inches of hair. I am a very impatient person and my 3c/4a curls are at an awkward length so I wanted anything that would speed up the process. I purchased a one month supply and completed it the 16th of September. My hair measures at 6 and a half, A WHOLE INCH AND A HALF OF GROWTH. I was astonished because my hair seemingly only grows about half an inch a month. I immediately started my new bottle and I can&#x27;t wait to continue my hair growth journey with The Mane Choice. My hair feels healthier and thicker at the root and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. This is a must have for any woman looking for longer, healthier hair.</li>
            <li> This product was excellent I am new to growing my hair naturally I usually wear a protective styles I just took out my first weave install and I noticed about 2 inches of growth! Excellent product</li>
            <li> These vitamins are the bomb.com. You will not be disappointed. You will experience growth before that first bottle is empty. I recommend these vitamins over any vitamin that I have taken. They are the BEST! I LOVE THEM. I haven&#x27;t even had any break outs or any other type of symptom with these. THANKS for coming out with these vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;-Nyeashe&#x27;</li>
            <li> These are freaking unbelievable they are like magic in a bottle they helped my hair grow longer and gotten thicker ...after I had a baby and my hair was falling and I had to cut my relaxed hair I was devastated and had no hope butb these pills right here gave me my hoo e back thank you courtney !!!!!</li>
            <li> I am on a natural hair journey and have been looking for ways to speed up growth AND improve health. I&#x27;ve tried everything. Took hair skin &amp; nails. Noticed a difference in nail growth but not hair. Then I tried hairfinity. Noticed (minimal) growth but I began getting breakouts which I NEVER get. Finally bought 60 days worth of the mane choice vitamins. My hair has been thicker &amp; retaining wayyyy more length than before. Will be buying a 4 month supply next time!</li>
            <li> Love this soo much. This has done me wonders</li>
            <li> These pills are wonderful!! I have been taking them for about 6 mths!! When I started taking them, I had did my big chop for the second time. I wanted something to help from my hair to grow out.  It will be a yr in October and my hair has exceeded the length I had w/ a relaxer (just below shoulders). Im so thankful for these pills and I just ordered another bottle!!</li>
            <li> I have been taking the Manetabolism vitamins since June and have seen more growth than normal...even my friends and co-workers are noticing. My hair has grown a little over 1/2 inch each month. I was hoping for an inch each month :-(. Let me just say, though, that I have poor eating habits and I drink very little fluids so that&#x27;s more than likely my fault. When I drink, I drink water (mostly). Problem is, I drink very little of anything. Sometimes I&#x27;ll eat and forget to drink something. (I know, I know...no good, all bad.) My point is that if I&#x27;m seeing this kind of growth with my current diet, I can only imagine my results if I actually ate (and drank) right. Sooo....to those of you with the same issue....I have started doing smoothies to incorporate more fruits and veggies into my diet and I bought a 74oz water bottle that I have to finish each day (or I can&#x27;t have any juice with my dinner haha). It&#x27;s a struggle but I&#x27;m making progress so this may work for you as well. Anyway, back to the vitamins...you should definitely go for it! They really are amazing!!! I plan to keep buying them...for, like, ever. Seriously.    As far as side effects, I have bought them for both me and my sister and neither of us have experienced any breakouts. In the past, she experienced breakouts with *****(other hair vitamin that I won&#x27;t call by name) and when taking biotin alone. Also, I may be imagining things but i think my lashes have gotten longer too (always a plus)...no increase in hair growth in other less appealing places though. Amaaazing, right? How do you do that, Courtney?!  Also, my skin looks brighter (all over) and my nails have grown faster than normal. Plus, Plus, PLUS! Like, when&#x27;s the last time the side effects were all good things. I mean, really!    One last thing...two words...delivery...fast. Twice, I&#x27;ve ordered on Friday (lol payday) and have gotten my order on the following Tuesday.</li>
            <li> After my first bottle I saw great results. Along with length my hair was thicker and my edges started filling in!!! I ordered 3 bottles so I will do an update after I finish all three.</li>
            <li> These pills are amazing!!!! I&#x27;ve been using them for 4 months now, and am very happy with my results!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these vitamins!!! I had a lot of shedding from several medications I was on after having multiple surgeries. After finding Courtney on Instagram, I started following her &amp; was so impressed with what she had to offer. I voted for her daily to get her products into Walmart but they didn&#x27;t pick her but that did not stop me from using the vitamins. Once I started taking them I noticed the shedding grew less &amp; less &amp; my hair started growing back with thickness!!! It is almost time to reorder &amp; I will be taking these for life because they WORK!!!!!</li>
            <li> Manetabolism healthy hair vitamins are literally a UNICORN in a Bottle! I honestly don&#x27;t know HOW they do it, but I can assure you that these power packs capsules WORK. They really do!!!.  After I had my beautiful daughter, I began experiencing tons of shedding and hair loss around the perimeter of my hairline. That&#x27;s right... my EDGES were in STRUGGLE MODE! I honestly began to see an improvement after the first week.  I could tell exactly where the new hair was growing in and there BEAUTIFULLY healthy little CURLS sprouting through!!!! I&#x27;ve just finished my second bottle of Manetabolism Vitamins, and I will NEVER be caught without them. The overall health of the hair that I wasn&#x27;t even concerned with is growing THICKER and my nails are more beautiful than they have ever been. My husband even took notice..... and for me that makes it even more worth it :-)&lt;br /&gt;Go. Buy. NOW!!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely cheaper on the main website, but if you have Prime, you can get it quicker through Amazon. These work amazing for me, I use them for retention which is a huge problem for me.....well used to be! These dont give me breakouts like Hairfinity did and I don&#x27;t get that nauseous feeling either. I will definitely continue to use these pills bc I&#x27;ve seen a major improvement in my hair&#x27;s overall health:)</li>
            <li> The hair pills are awesome.... I have been natural since 7thgrade and last my 10th grade year I decided to uses these pills and I got a whole lot of growth</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE The Mane Choice Manetabolism vitamins! I did my big chop my after my senior year of high school in 2011 and I thought it was going to take my hair forever to grow my hair back, but with the help of Manetabolism I am getting to my goal much faster. When I would wash my hair every week I would have TONS of shedding, but these vitamins have tremendously cut down on that shedding I barely see any on some washes! If you have been skeptical about purchasing any Mane Choice product please do not hesitate anymore. You will see great results!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t take them for an extended period of time because I decided to cut my hair but in the time that I did take them I noticed a lot less shedding, and my nails were and still are growing very strong.&lt;br /&gt;👍👍 to the mane choice!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have any bad side effects. Probably need to use it again to see results.</li>
            <li> Works GREAT! I have fuller longer hair I totally recommend this product ! 💕</li>
            <li> i buy these Vitamins from actual website (Mane Choice on IG) the creator is a former Medical professional so that helped I think in the ingredients. My hair is fuller and less breakage. Drinking more water is best when taking anything including these Vitamins. Hair Finity broke me out like most people. I truly believe they are NOT for women of color. Just my opinion. Mane Choice is made by a African American woman and just looking at the reviews they are 100% better.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a month in September and I grew an inch. I also was exercising and moving a lot so that probably helped as well. The thing about enhancing your body is that your lifestyle needs to be a crutch to your health. NOT the other way around. So, if your serious about growing your hair and making good life choices, this will most likely help.</li>
            <li> I love it! I have been taking it for about 3 weeks and I can definitely see a difference in my hair, thickness, growth, healthier etc. I love it so much that I already ordered next month&#x27;s supply!</li>
            <li> I initially heard about this product from my niece.  Her hair looked so healthy and had grown since the last time I saw her so I figured I would give it a try.  I was skeptical at first because I wanted to notice results right away.  I started to notice my hair growing at a faster rate probably about three weeks into taking this vitamin.  I must confess, my hair is already mid way down my back but I still wanted my hair to grow longer.  Yes I&#x27;m greedy.  Anyway, once I started noticing my hair growing at a faster rate so did hair on other parts of my body.  I now have to wax my lip at least every two weeks, shave my legs and underarms more often too.  So ladies and gentlemen, this product does work better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  I highly recommend it, just beware if it makes your hair grow on your head, hair EVERYWHERE else will start growing in too.</li>
            <li> I started taken these pills about  6weeks ago I think they are working for me cause my edges were practically gone and now they are pretty full I measured my hair after 3 in a half weeks of. Taking them I had on my measuring tshirt and my hair was 5 and a half inches according to the shirt on nov.20th I will do it again Dec 22 to see if anything changed .my hair was like at 4 in a half before I started taking mane choice so yes it is growing I don&#x27;t know how to post pics to show my progress</li>
            <li> I have been taking these pills since June and my hair has grown 2 1/2 inches and it has become thicker! I&#x27;ve also been feeling more energized from the vitamin components. I&#x27;m confident that if I continue using these vitamins that I will reach my journey to waist length in no time!!! Love the pills and the results :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these pills going on 6 months now and my hair is thick and long. My hair never grew past the nape of my neck now it&#x27;s between my shoulders I&#x27;m very pleased. thank you mane choice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but most of these reviews or at least the top ones on the first page are planted, clearly. Anytime there is not a verified purchaser, I get suspicious.</li>
            <li> I just finished my first bottle and my hair has grown and looks and feels healthier!</li>
            <li> These pills are everything to me.  They give my hair life.. my hair is now Fuller and healthier.  I only been using the pills for 2 months now, and I swear within the first 2 weeks I saw changes in my hair. I love these pills and I will continue to use them.</li>
            <li> The mane choice is amazing!! The growth that I&#x27;ve seen is awesome. Highly recommended hair care products.</li>
            <li> I have been using Manetabolism Hair Vitamins for 3 months now and I have to say I love them I have not had any problems with breakouts or any side effects from them. I love how the hair vitamins have changed my hair when I would wash my hair I would have a lot of shedding and breakage and now since I have been taken the pills I have way less shedding and breakage. I am so grateful to these pill I have seen growth and thickness to my hair my new growth is so thick and i love it I will be continuing taking these pills as long as they are available. These are the only hair vitamins I have taken and will be the only ones I will be taken. Thank You So Much Courtney for creating this amazing product.</li>
            <li> I completely love this product. I have been natural for 2 years prior to using it and I felt like my hair had grown all it was going to grow. I tried it for two months and I have noticed do much growth. And thickness. The thickness it&#x27;s my fave part. My hair feels full and when I blow dry it my boyfriend can definitely see and feel it. It&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I did not break out as much as I did with another hair vitamin.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with these vitamins. Overall I&#x27;ve seen in increase in energy, as well as increased density in hair. I&#x27;m on my second bottle and plan to remain on them through atleast spring 2015 if not longer. I have NOT experienced any breakouts.</li>
            <li> I received my hair vitamins last week and I&#x27;m so excited. I have just ordered the conditioner. Im on my way to healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I was initially hesitant about buying this product because I was sure it wasn&#x27;t going to work but after reading other reviews and people&#x27;s successes, I decided to give it a try. Within a week and a half I noticed my nails growing longer than usual (and my nails never grow!). They were stronger than ever!! During the first month of taking the vitamins I had my hair in a protective style and once I took the protective style out my hair had grown at least an inch and a half!! In one month!!! I am very grateful for this product and the product line that I have convinced several people to give it a try!! I&#x27;ve even bought bottles for my mother. One of the positives is that I experienced absolutely no side effects. I remember when I took biotin last year my face broke out horribly, but while taking manetabolism I continued to drink plenty of water and my face stayed clear. I would recommend this to anyone!!</li>
            <li> I have been using The ManeChoice now for about 4 months! I love the way my hair feels and looks. Not to mention the GROWTH. I&#x27;m not shedding and I don&#x27;t have breakage and grey hair like I was getting from another well known hair supplement. I have everyone I know on these pills! They don&#x27;t break me out and I rock my natural curly hair. I swear by these pills. I&#x27;ve tried everything and I won&#x27;t be going back to any other pills!</li>
            <li> These vitamins are absolutely amazing!! Nothing but beautiful results, within 10 days both my nails and hair had grown! My edges are super thick! And my hair is thickening all together. Its shinier and healthier with these vitamins. I absolutely adore them and will continue to use them!</li>
            <li> Have been using manetabolism for the last to months and my hair has gotten longer than I thou it would. The product is way better than hairfinity. Give it a try. Money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I had a fall in the middle of the hair and after there was nothing left for two months, as soon as I started the vitamins my hair and pushed my edges also thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these vitamins since April. I originally started taking them after cutting about 4 inches of heat damaged hair off . It is now September and my hair is (unbelievably) longer than it was BEFORE the cut! Not only is it longer but also thicker! The cherry on top is that it hasn&#x27;t made my skin breakout and my nails are longer and stronger than they&#x27;ve ever been. They have a loyal customer here!</li>
            <li> I am so pleasantly surprised by the results after just 3 bottle of this product! My hair has never grown so fast and I can see me reaching my waist length goal sooner than I ever though. Miracle product!</li>
            <li> I tried these Vitamins twice and my hair was thicker Fuller  and made my natural hair journey so pleasant..  You won&#x27;t regret it  it&#x27;s the bomb.com!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shama L.</li>
            <li> These pills are the absolute best. They give real results I recommend them to everyone that&#x27;s looking for that extra push towards strong healthy hair etc.</li>
            <li> These pills are really good. Other companies have pills that promote growth but these prote growth As well as overall healthiness! I had really good results in hair growth as well! Will be buying another bottle soon! And hopefully trying other products!</li>
            <li> I tried the other hair growth pills (I won&#x27;t use the name, to protect the innocent, but the initials are H.F.) and although they DID help my hair grow faster, I suffered from daily headaches and my face broke out (I have never had an issue with acne in my life and I am 31 years old). I tried Manetabolism pills and not only did my hair grow slightly over an inch in a month, I did not have headaches and my face did not break out. I will recommend that you drink lots of water while taking the pills though (this helps decrease your odds of breaking out). Aside from trying the HF pills and Manetabolism, I also tried Biotin (from CVS) and Hair, Skin and Nails pills (from CVS)...I found I had the best results with the Manetabolism pills. I also really like their customer service. I follow both The Mane Choice and CourtneyNaturalHair on Instagram and I&#x27;m always so impressed by the responses to followers (even when the followers ask really stupid questions or questions that could easily be answered if they just scroll up or go to the website). I sent a picture in showing my hair growth after I finished my bottle and was congratulated by the company for my hair growth. I take customer service very seriously and hands down, The Mane Choice has some of the BEST customer service around! (No exaggeration) Basically, you can&#x27;t lose if you give these pills a try.</li>
            <li> These are the best hair vitamins I have ever used. I really love how the product is all natural so I do not have to worry about any harmful chemicals in my body. Within a month my hair has already grown so much. I definitely recommend these vitamins to anyone suffering from hair loss or anyone who wants to grow their hair.</li>
            <li> These pills are AMAZING! I have been taking it for 3 months and my hair is much fuller. The back of my hair grows extremely fast while the front is normally very slow. But since taking these pills I have more even and accelerated growth. My skin also looks amazing and my nails are very strong and long, people always think they are fake! I definitely recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> Omg!!!! These hair vitamins are life! My hair was thin on the sides due to tight braids and weaves and every time I took my weave out I ended up cutting the sides of my hair because my hair was tangled in the sewing thread. I came across The Mane Choice on Instagram and I heard so many great reviews about it so I decided to give it a try. After I finished my first bottle i could not believe my results! My sides grew back in and I was able to grab my sides and brush it into a pony tail! I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> I swear by these vitamins. If you are faithful to them, surely they will be faithful to you. I started using them 4 months ago when I noticed my hair was just not as thick as it used to be. Both me and my stylist (who also takes them) started to see a significant difference in the thickness of my hair. My hair began to look fuller and feel even better. I plan on using the vitamins for at least another year or so ONLY because I&#x27;ve actually seen results. Try it! You won&#x27;t regret it. They are well worth the $25 bucks!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these vitamins!!!! I normally don&#x27;t like taking vitamins because they&#x27;re usually horse pills and I abhor taking big pills. These are moderately sized with the shell so it&#x27;s easy swallowing. The benefits are outstanding!!! There&#x27;s a definite improvement in hair AND nails almost immediately (wherever you need the vitamins most). I highly recommend this product. You will never be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had to cut my hair due to breakage. I then ordered two bottles of the pills to see if I got any results and YES I DID. My hair has grown a lot from where I cut it. When I get the money, I will definitely order more. My friends always ask about Hairfinity till I tell them about Mane Choice and their products have better results.</li>
            <li> I love these pills! I have trouble with my edges thinning and these pills have helped out so much! They have also started to clear my face up and made my nails grow. I would recommend buying these pills if you are looking for fast hair and nails growth, also clearer skin.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a product to help with two bald spots that were beginning to develop due to stress.  Well, after a month of using the the supply I was happy to see growth in the bald spots.  One spot had completely grown back in and the other one was making it&#x27;s way.  Not only did the Hair Vitamins help strengthen and grow my hair, my nails were growing and getting stronger!</li>
            <li> I LOOOOOOOOVE this product !!! I have used 3 bottles of these hair  vitamins and have received nothing but GROWTH! There&#x27;s no break outs of the skin, your hair grows thicker , your edges grow thick and strong not to mention the shine it gives my hair ! I&#x27;m 8 months pregnant and these pills has stopped my hair from shedding ... Ladies if you wear weaves and your tired of having NO edges you better order this product ASAP!!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased these pills after trying the hyped up hairinifinity pills and seeing no results.  I had my hair colored right before opening my first bottle and after 2 weeks my color started growing out. Needless to say I took a million pictures of my grown out color and even waited a couple months to get my hair colored again. I liked that I had evidence and bragging right about my new vitamins.  Haven&#x27;t looked back since started my mane choice journey!</li>
            <li> having damaged breaking hair I needed something to help it over all and I wanted growth, so after reading about this product and seeing before and after photos I thought I would give it a try. The first time I ordered a 2 mth supply and the results were amazing! I noticed results within the first 10 days!  My hair dresser notice right away also she said my hair was growing in so thick and healthy. She was so shocked, we ended up going half on a 12 mth supply. I definitely recommend these pills for a healthy hair transformation!!</li>
            <li> These pills are AMAZING!!! I&#x27;ve used hair vitamins in the past but these are by far the best, I&#x27;ve actually seen results.  Genetically I have very thin hair, and after using these for a month my hair is so much thicker.  I am now on my 4th month and my hair is so much longer and fuller.  Not to mention I have not experienced any breakouts.  With the last product I used my skin had broken out so bad that I had to go to the dermotologist for help.  I am in love with this product and I recommend this product to all of my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the mane choice for one month after seeing so many amazing results on Instagram. I started taking them the day after I got a fresh sewin and let just say my hair sewin felt like I had it in for a month and a half when it had only been two weeks. I am in love with this product and definitely adding it to my hair regimen. (: DON&#x27;T THINK TWICE JUST ORDER THEM.</li>
            <li> These pills are amazing. I was so skeptical when I first bought them because I&#x27;ve heard so many people tell me their stories about hairfinity &amp; I didn&#x27;t want to break out because my skin is super sensitive but omg! Absolutely NO breakouts &amp; my haaaaaiiiir! It&#x27;s always been thick but now it&#x27;s long &amp; thick! Yessss! I love this stuff &amp; I only bought a one month supply so I&#x27;m definitely going back. But fyi, go on their website. It&#x27;s cheaper &amp; sometimes they have free shipping. I&#x27;m definitely buying a 6 month supply. Trust me, this. Stuff. Works!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this vitamins helped my hair to grow thicker and longer and It also grew my edges back. I am definitely ordering these again.</li>
            <li> So, I decided to give the Manetabolism a try, after my Sister grew an inch using it in a month time span. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, &amp; I too have noticed a huge difference in thickness&amp; length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordering the product was fast&amp; easy, so was shipping! Follow them on IG there&#x27;s always a great promotional discount taking place.</li>
            <li> This Product Is Amazing. My sister is now currently using this &amp; it&#x27;s working wonders for her ! I have to purchase some &amp; use your product asap !</li>
            <li> I purchased these pills out of curiosity to compare to Hairfinity and see what it was all about. It was one of the smartest decision I could have ever done for my hair!!! My hair grew so fast and it was easier for me take the Mane pill than the Hairfinity one. My nails were stronger too, and I was loving it. So I went ahead and purchase two more bottles, along with the butter and the green tea conditioner, I was in love with my hair.. I tell ya. Thank you Mane for making me fall in love with my natural hair. To top it off, you guys are an amazing caring company.</li>
            <li> I have been using these pills for a 13 days and the results are AMAZING!!! I am sold on this product and there is not turning back! Been natural for 28 years and this is the BEST MOST EFFECTIVE SAFE vitamin I have ever taken!!! My hair is currently in a protective style (havana twists) and I actually had to have the outter retouched 3 weeks earlier than I normally do! My edges are fuller and from the looks of my new growth my hair is definitely growing in thicker and faster than my normal hair growth rate! I am extremely please with my purchase and will definitely be purchasing more before this bottle is complete. This all natural hair formula has a unique blend of ingredients necessary for the healthy head of hair we all desire! This product speaks for itself so purchase your own so you can get the results I&#x27;m talking about! You will be glad you did because your days of thinning, breaking, slow growing, shedding hair will FINALLY come to an end with this product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so grateful for these vitamins! I was looking at Hairfinity for hair growth which i&#x27;ve heard about for years but I never looked into it until I became serious with having healthy hair. I searched the website and looked up a ton of youtube videos, just as i was going to purchase something told me to keep looking, as I was scrolling through IG I discovered the themanechoice, so i decided to do my research on these pills, long story short i ordered a 4 month supply and have been taking the vitamins for 2 1/2 weeks. I noticed w/ alot of people that the hairfinity pills granted .5 inches of hair growth per bottle where as manetabolism granted 1 inch of hairgrowth per bottle, so its the same price for double the growth to me that&#x27;s what made the manechoice stand out to me, already I&#x27;ve noticed less shedding and i can&#x27;t wait to do my 30 day length check to see my results!</li>
            <li> I have these vitamins and have been taking them for 3 months and they work wonders, my hair grows like crazy and I love it!</li>
            <li> These vitamins are awesome. Since taking them I&#x27;ve definitely seen more/faster hair growth. No breakouts, my usually weak and peeling nails have done a complete 360. Overall great vitamins and definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> The most wonderful hair vitamins ever!!! I tried another brand for about 3 months and saw results slowly, but I decided to switch over to this brand because of Courtney&#x27;s own success with her products. It&#x27;s been the greatest decision ever. In one month I saw double the growth than with the previous brand. I normally would go threw months with my protective style( a sew in) but I could barely make it to 1.5 with taking these vitamins. Needless to say I absolutely love this product and the results it yields.</li>
            <li> I love this product and the other products from this line. My hair has become longer, thicker and healthier it doesn&#x27;t shed anymore when I comb or brush it since I have been taking these vitamins.</li>
            <li> These pills definitely are worth the price. I seen growth starting as early as two weeks! No breakout but drink plenty of water...</li>
            <li> I bought a six month supply and have used 2 bottles and have noticed a visible change in the firmness of my nails and nail growth. I cannot yet comment on the growth of my hair because I have not  done an official length check but my box braids are telling me it&#x27;s definitely growing. No side effects for me and what I liked most about them is the smell as compared to one of the major competitors!!!</li>
            <li> After following The Mane Choice on Instagram I saw other natural hair people getting great results. I went to the website and order a 30 day supply. I did my big chop in February 2014. I repeatedly got it cut for about three months. I finally started to let it grow about May 2014. I been growing my hair naturally for about 3 months and I see results. I order my Manetabolism about end of August and I got them fairly quick. Within a half of month I saw about a half of inch and a whole month I saw about a whole inch. I want and plan on purchasing more for my hair journey! I really recommend these pills to anyone looking to grow thick, healthy, longer hair.</li>
            <li> I live in the uk and pay shipping fees to receive all the mane choice products, because it&#x27;s 100% worth it. For shiny thick and quick hair growth.  I&#x27;ve tried for many products and none have given me the results mane choice has.</li>
            <li> These vitamins are the absolute best!!!! I was hesitant to try them initially but after seeing ssooooo many great reviews, I decided to give them a try. I wear weave in my head &amp; after about a month &amp; 1/2, I had to get my entire head done over because my hair had grown just that much. I&#x27;m a lifelong consumer.</li>
            <li> By The testimony Of These Vitamins, it takes care of your hair just as described . It amazing how tremendously well, and quick it works. It&#x27;s EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> This vitamin has work wonders for me and my family. I Purchase this product now only for me , but for my mother, daughter and my sister. my sister went through kimo and has Alopecia and my God, when I say wonders. My self and my family has absolutely no complains. Thank you</li>

If you&#x27;re thinking about getting these vitamins..Stop debating and just get them.. I guarantee you will not be disappointed...</li>
            <li> These vitamins are the truth. Within the first two weeks I had at least a half of an inch of growth. I have been taking these for the past 5 months and after a third big chop, these vitamins have given me so much thickness and health to my hair. I am a faithful customer!</li>
            <li> I am currently a newbie to the Mane Choice line of vitamins. I am very excited to use it. I was referred by a family member and saw a lot of the testimonies from their Instagram page. I am very excited to see how much my hair will grow. :)</li>
            <li> I purchased these pill in hopes that they would speed up my growth. I have recently began transitioning to my natural hair and this product has truly helped speed the process. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> These vitamins work so well on my hair,I have chronic myeloid leukemia and it makes my hair very thin and doesn&#x27;t allow my hair to grow but these vitamins have made my hair grow within the first two weeks I was on them and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel so thin anymore</li>
            <li> This is honestly an amazing investment! I love these vitamins! After doing a big chop I started my hair journey with main choice and it has done my hair justice ! In two weeks I&#x27;ve seen an amazing amount of growth and thickness ! I love it and would definitely recommend it to others ! The results are real and can&#x27;t wait to explore to the other products they offer !</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I was impressed with the delivery time. I started taking the product to help with my edges and the thickness of my hair, it has only been a week and already I can see a difference. 2 of my friends are taking the product and before their first bottle was finished they saw growth which got me excited about the product. I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens by the end of my first month, I will definitely order more bottles.</li>

            <li> I started using HAIRFINITY last year it worked perfectly fine for the first 3 months then it&#x27;s my hair stop growing then i was on instagram i saw the beautiful courtney with her beautiful hair and i was like is her hair real so I started looking and I found &amp;#34;The Miracle Pills&amp;#34; I have been taking them for 2 months now my hair has grown tremendously no shedding at all. These pills work wonders i told all my friends about them yes we all taking them. 5***** for Courtney for making them.</li>
            <li> I suffer from hypothyroidism and I have been using this product faithfully since June.  Let me tell you this product has worked wonders for my hair!  Having this medical condition, my hair was normally dry and brittle, leaving it subject to breakage.  My hair grows, but Manetabolism has increased my growth rate x2!  I stand behind this product completly and with this available, there is no reason we can&#x27;t all have beautiful, healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m On My Second Bottle Of Manetabolism And I&#x27;m Loving It!! It&#x27;s Giving Me Back My Hair Confidence!!</li>
            <li> I have been using manetabolism for less than a month I have already received amazing results.  I am currently transitioning from relaxed to natural and the thickness and growth I have received is amazing.  I have already purchased my six month supply and can&#x27;t wait to see what wonderful results I will achieve.  My dreams of mid back length are now possible!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> These pills are amazing! I did my big chop in August. Loved my twa but wanted to see growth already so I ordered a 2 month supply. Within a week I noticed hair growth. I was so excited. My nails have also grown and gotten much stronger. By the end of the 2nd week my hair had grown about half of an inch. When I finished the bottle I had a curly afro. I had about a full inch of growth. I love this product and will definitely be getting more.</li>
            <li> Ive been natural ever since i was 16 years old, but instead of doing a big chop, i did a semi chop by cutting the ends. My hair was always full in the middle. It was full in the front, back, and sides but because i was a braid fanatic, my edges and nape were always broken.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried hairfinity,  and didnt eveb get through one week.&lt;br /&gt;I started breaking out in huge pimples in one area . It was so bad and even though i didnt take it consecutively the breakouts lasted for about 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to do more research and came across the mane choice. It took me 2 good weeks to determine if it will be worth it. I read reviews that results were shown after one mnth, and there was no proven side effects.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it a try, and BEST CHOICE I EVER MADE. I have seen results in my edges after 7 days. They were getting fuller. I literally had big bald spots, but i had seen a difference within mane choice. Even though i missed one day, my end results were not affected, and drinking juice with the pills instead of water didnt mess up my end results. After one month my hair was thicker and a inch longer.  I can not wait to recieve my second bottle. These VITAMNS are the TRUTH!</li>
            <li> Great hair vitamins! Healthy hair, skin and nails.</li>
            <li> These vitamins are great, does exactly what it says on the bottle. I&#x27;m hardly ever consistent when taking vitamins of any kind, and when taking these I may have missed a dose or two, sometimes even missed a whole day! Even so, I noticed a real difference in my edges within the first few weeks of taking these. I definitely saw growth and I&#x27;ve been having issues with my edges for months. I&#x27;m near finishing my second bottle and I&#x27;m definitely going to continue. Can&#x27;t wait to see what results I get in a few month.. I&#x27;m an international customer and I can definitely tell you these are really worth trying wherever you are in the world :)</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best products ever! And yes, I have tried Hairfinity before I came across these. Shipping is fast, friendly customer service and the pills don&#x27;t break you out or make you feel bad. I&#x27;ve ordered more than once &amp; I can say they are heaven sent. I&#x27;ve definitely received noticeable growth and everyone tells me how much.  my hair has grown&lt;br /&gt;since they last saw. me. Please don&#x27;t look&lt;br /&gt;over these, you will not regret it. They are very helpful as well and want to ensure&lt;br /&gt;you have the best experiences. Don&#x27;t be&lt;br /&gt;afraid to reach out to them for tips either.&lt;br /&gt; They don&#x27;t see you as just another dollar. I am forever a loyal customer! :)</li>
            <li> The product is good.  It arrived on time.</li>
            <li> OMG...I hate taking pills/vitamins. I honestly have always felt it was a myth, and that results were always exaggerated and  I &#x27;m not one to subscribe to the &amp;#34;hype&amp;#34;  But This Manetabolism is the real deal right here...even my hair dresser was like your hair is really trying to grow out!  I saw thickness first, it really got nice and full....then came the length!  I L O V E  this product, just ordered MORE!</li>
            <li> Giving five stars for now. Just purchased my first bottle off of eBay. I decided to add some before pictures and give a detailed review about my first month of using the Mane Choice. The pills are a little large BUT they&#x27;re in a slick capsul so they&#x27;ll slide down easily. I could probably even ingest it without water. Anyways excited to start my journey with the mane choice. I&#x27;ve heard many good things about this dietary supplement. I&#x27;ll update my review along with pictures at 15 days. Then once more at 30. 💕💖💋  10 DAY REVIEW- Okay so the second picture I posted is 10 days later. It&#x27;s already grown! The first picture it was just at my bra strap now it&#x27;s most definitely past it. That&#x27;s in just 10 days! Not even half way done with the bottle. THERE IS ONE NEGATIVE! This pill (just as everyone said) will most likely give you break outs. I never break out I was just lucky but this pill did make me break out. I&#x27;m going to continue to take it because I started washing my face with a new acne treatment called Clean and Clear Advantage. It&#x27;s an acne kit I bought from Walmart about $17 and it cleared me up in less than a week. That&#x27;s the only problem I found with this pill. No headaches or anything. I don&#x27;t shed anymore or any less than I already did lol. But yea so far I&#x27;m super impressed and excited about these results. (Sorry for making this a long review) 😛👍🏽</li>
            <li> I been take these pill for a month and my hair I getting so long my skin I so clear and I so love my nails my nails never been long until I started taken the pills</li>
            <li> I love this product I saw  my hair growing within a month. This product it just great! I would love to recommend this product to anybody I love it!</li>
            <li> I have my daughter to thank.. She,suggested that I try this product.. Thankful to her, I seen a difference in two weeks..&lt;br /&gt;Loving it!!</li>
            <li> Love the product have it for a few days can see the grow on my edges will recommend to friends and family</li>
            <li> I just received these I&#x27;ve always been a hair finity girl but when I stopped taking hairfinity my hair started thinning out for some reason and I&#x27;ve alway had very thick hair, so I&#x27;m trying mane choice to see if it&#x27;s better I&#x27;ll do a before and after picture ..</li>
            <li> 1 star for the 1 inch I grew in 3 months. I guess everyone is different but these were a NO for me. I didn&#x27;t have breakouts some headache and itchy scalp I didn&#x27;t really notice thickness, I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been very impressed with this product.  I used Hair-finity and after a few months of use I didn&#x27;t notice much growth.  I was hesitant at first but after reading the reviews and researching the ingredients, I decided to give the product a try.  This product works within the body to improve hair, skin and nails.  Additionally, I noticed it helped improve my energy  levels and daily functions.  Some of the reviews I saw spoke of women experiencing acne breakouts; I would say to these reviews that you have to keep in mind that this product works with your hormones so you just have to know your body or talk to a doctor.  You also have to make sure you hydrate your body and eat balanced meals.  Overall, it has done what it says and I am not disappointed.  I just received my second order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add that I am in the southern New Mexico area, my hair type is a mix of 3C/4A/4B (3C-top/4A-back/4B-crown) and I am a black female.</li>
            <li> I have seen over 4 inches of hair growth in the 6 months that I have been using the Manetabolism Hair Vitamins.  My sister introduced this product to me in a challenge to see how much our hair could grow after using this Mane Choice product for one year.  My stylist is impressed with how healthy my hair is growing.  I will most definitely continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> The pills are big, but work amazingly! Thanks for the extra thickness to my hair!</li>
            <li> I did notice growth from the pills early on but stopped taking them after a week and a half because I was getting migraines every day from taking them even though I drink a lot of water daily.</li>
            <li> I have taken this hair vitamin for about 2 weeks and already I see results. These vitamins are absolutely amazing. I can&#x27;t wait to purchase more to see how far my hair can grow. I have heard that you get breakouts while taking them, but i haven&#x27;t gotten anything so far. As long as you drink a lot of water you are perfectly good.</li>
            <li> These vitamins are definitely on point!!!!!  I had major hair growth before th 30 days were up.  I definitely stand behind this product.  I, personally had no side effects.  I will be ordering more in the near future.</li>
            <li> I was using Hairfinity for 2months. I did the &amp;#34;Big Chop&amp;#34;which I wish I shouldn&#x27;t have done because my hair was so healty I just wanted to start over I guess. Anyway I took HairFinity for 2months I had very little growth but I has some...my nails didn&#x27;t grow at all. So I switched it up and started Manetabolism. Boy am I glad I did I just finished my first bottle and my hair has filled in like crazy, its so thick and I have thick hair but it has never been this thicj. It has grew also...its still short because I literally shaved my hair off but now I have a &amp;#34;mini fro&amp;#34;. My nails are so long and strong and my family have been going on and on about how clear my skin is. I had ance and ance scars real bad but its clear and I don&#x27;t drink alot of water maybe 4cups a day because I drink tea...But It really does boost your immune system to promote a healthy you all around inside and out. I can&#x27;t wait to see how long my hair grow using this product!!! Let&#x27;s get growing Ladies</li>
            <li> After doing extensive research on this vitamin and the Hairfinity vitamin, I decided to go with this one.&lt;br /&gt;I was not even a week into taking it and I broke out all over my back and on my wrist with these huge, horrible, red raised bumps/welts.  I am obviously allergic to something in it but I read the label before hand to avoid something like this and I had no known allergies to any of the ingredients that were listed.  I stopped taking it for one day and the following day the raised areas had gone down, so this product is obviously not for me.  I bought this as part of a set with the hair butter and conditioner for $74 so I am sure I am out of some money.  Lessons learned for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this to make others aware that some of ingredients may cause you to have a reaction not to bash the maker of this vitamin.  I&#x27;m sure they do work for some but they definitely aren&#x27;t for me. I hope the hair butter and conditioner agree with me.  Be careful.</li>
            <li> I took 2 pills a day for 2 weeks and then 1 pill for 2 weeks. I reduced to 1 trying to eliminate the breakouts i started having but it didnt help. Ultimately, I did see some growth but i couldn&#x27;t take the breakouts so I gave up on them after a month.</li>
            <li> I am on my 4th month with these vitamins and I love them. Less shedding, more growth, thickness, and shine. I am in braids right now. And just 3 weeks in, I have about 1/2 to an inch of new growth already. The only con with this is, I get breakouts on my face every once in a while. And I drink PLENTY of water. Yes, I would recommend these vitamins. Buy from the website though. They are $24 there.</li>
            <li> It took the vitamins a little longer than what was stated to arrive. I started taking them the following day after I received them. My last day was AUG 22, 2014. In that time I managed 1 1/4 in of growth. I usually get close to an inch a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these vitamins I noticed that I didn&#x27;t have to moisturize my hair as often. My hair sheds a lot, I&#x27;m at the higher end of the numbers. The pills didn&#x27;t slow that down but neither did it make the shedding worse. I will say that I did have/get a break out. It only happened around my monthly time slightly more than usual, but nothing huge.</li>
            <li> Hope this is what everyone says it is</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these pills! I&#x27;m not much of a vitamin taker! My hair grows pretty fast but I wanted to take special care of it since I bleached a spot in my head ( super random) and I had a little edge loss due to wearing a lace closure sew-in . I didn&#x27;t experience any side effects and it was worth the cost ! I recommend them to anyone wanting longer ,stronger, and healthier hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I retouched my roots three weeks ago.  attached below shows three weeks to date of how much growth I&#x27;ve experienced since then!  HUNTY!!! These pills are the truth!</li>
            <li> Would buy again I did not take them regularly but hope that when I purchase again I will see more results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these pills. My hair has grown very well and my hair has stopped shedding so much. I recommend these to everyone!</li>
            <li> These pills are AMAZING. They work wonders. My sister in law has been taking these vitamins for almost 5 months her hair was to the end of her ear &amp; it was very thin &amp; after taking the vitamins her hair is past her shoulders &amp; it has gotten thicker. Her results amazed me &amp; I can&#x27;t wait to try the vitamins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 5th bottle and these vitamins ate great for overall health. Yes they target hair but it&#x27;s benefited my skin and nails and improved my energy. My hair has visibly  gotten healthier and longer. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I have tried other hair vitamins that made me kind of nauseous and sick to my stomache but these ones were perfect. I had no nausea and they really work. After my first bottle I had major growth and I am happy with my results. I am now on my third bottle and will be ordering again. I really recommend trying these.</li>
            <li> I started off with 2 bottles. I haven&#x27;t even finished my first bottle and my hair has grown almost 2 inches!!! Not only do these make your hair grow but it makes it thicker and healthier. I&#x27;ve tried another type of pill like this (hair infinity) and did not see any results. These vitamins are truly a blessing for everyone who wants and needs their hair to grow! I will be purchasing the 6 month supply when I get on my second bottle. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Make the right choice. The Mane Choiice that is.     These vitamins do not cause any breakouts or side effects. I recommend to drink a lot of water it helps the process go faster. My nails have grown strong and healthy also. As well as my skin clearing up. There isn&#x27;t just one thing these vitamins do. It&#x27;s multiple. There are many vitamins out there that claim to do these things but the mane choice actually owns up to every thing they claim to be and claim to do! I&#x27;m a lifetime customer!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased my second bottle of these pills 2 weeks ago. I big chopped 2 months ago. I wasnt used to the half inch of hair on my head so i wore wigs and turbans. I am now comfortable wearing my natural hair out. My hair and nails have grown soo much since adding these pills to my regimen! I would definitely recommend these pills to anyone.</li>
            <li> The vitamins are amazing. I cut all my hair off to start over natural and these vitamins have really helped grow my hair out. They also grew my nails and eyelashes out and my nails are soooo strong. I did not experience any headaches, acne or any side effects with them like with other products. I am currently on my third bottle and even though I haven&#x27;t been consistent as usual my hair is still growing. I have a difficult time swallowing pills but you can open these and use them that way which is really good. Overall my experience has been great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these vitamins!! No cons! All pros! Before these vitamins, I suffered numerous dark spots on my face..the vitamins help fade them! Awkward? I know! Most hair vitamins break your skin out! Not only the good skin outcome but my hair growth was ridiculously fast!! I definitely recommend this product to everyone!!!!</li>
            <li> These pills are litterally the bomb.com! They made my hair geow so much. It feels much thicker and fuller than before I have more confidence wearing my hair out. I definitely give this product a thumbs up you should try it !</li>
            <li> I ordered my first 2-month supply of manetabolism during their 4th of July sale. (Sidebar: I highly recommend following the website and their social media to keep up to date with all the products and promos.) I finished my first bottle as directed and saw a noticeable increase in hair growth AND manageability. A month after my texlax, my new growth looked much closer to 3 months post. I&#x27;ve noticed my hair stays softer longer in between deep conditioning and shedding is at an all time low... Even when washing and detangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My 2nd bottle, I was not as regimented with so it took me 2 months to finish that bottle. However, my results are all still the same. Manetabolism is definitely a holy grail item in my hair care regimen now. About 6 months ago I had a major setback after having twists installed and today you would have no idea, partly because of additional help from these vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing I want to add. I&#x27;m absolutely horrible with drinking enough water sometimes. I have had no skin issues or nausea issues with not drinking enough water while taking these vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I have recommended these to friends and family alike, and even purchased some for people. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> One day I stumbled upon this product on instagram and took a quick interest. After looking at the posts, I did my own research on the contents of this pill and they were legit!&lt;br /&gt;My hair texture is very corse  and tends to get dry and brittle and break easily.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been taking these pills for over a month now and I can honestly say that this is not a gimmick!&lt;br /&gt;When washing my hair, I have minimal to no shedding, growth at over 2 inches and thickness all over!&lt;br /&gt;Not only do you experience growth with this product but a energy boost as well.&lt;br /&gt;This product is great and I will continue to refer my friends to it!</li>
            <li> I first started off taking regular Biotin pills from your local grocery store just to regain the length I once had, but I noticed a lot of side effects such as dry irritated skin on my face and bumps. Since I&#x27;ve been taking the Mane Choice supplements, not only have I experience no side effects, but I&#x27;m more concerned in the overall HEALTH of my hair, not just inches. My their customer service is amazing and you can see how they really care about customer results.. I can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products!!!!</li>
            <li> I have always had healthy full hair but recently my hair began to fall out do to health issues. I have been taking this vitamins for over two months and my bald spot is filling back in great! I didn&#x27;t think it was possible! I love these vitamins and plan on continuing to buy them in the future!</li>
            <li> these pills are amazing. my cousin showed me these and how much her hair was growing and just had to order me some as well and they worked wonders on my hair . it&#x27;s never been so thick and health and it&#x27;s growing! love these pills</li>
            <li> I love these vitamins. My hair grew within the first 2 weeks! There were no annoying side effects like some other vitamins. The hair butter is wonderful also. It smells so good and does wonders for my hair which always seems to be extra dry. The hair butter gives it moisture and life without weighing it down. I also use the green tea deep conditioner. I have yet to be disappointed with any product from Mane Choice. You cannot go wrong with their products. I can&#x27;t wait until my new shipment arrives. Thank you Mane Choice!!!</li>
            <li> These pills are awesome!!! My hair and nails grew ridiculously!! The Mane Choice even posted a picture of my results  on their instagram page. I had no negative side effects at all!! I do recommend that you drink lots of water while taking the pills. But if you are serious  about getting long healthy hair I highly recommend these pills!! BTW my hair is relaxed and it worked just as effectively on my hair as it would natural hair. I will be ordering my next bottles this week. Thank you mane choice!!!</li>
            <li> I tried my first bottle of pills not to long ago and Love the results! My hair was almost shoulder length and after a month supply I have reached past shoulder length! :) with good health practices already. I didn&#x27;t experience any negative side effects, I would definitely recommend giving these pills a try.</li>
            <li> My edges werw finally growing back since I was pregnant, but then started falling out because a stylist braided my hair TOO TIGHT for this sew in I got back in February. I ordered the pills off of the main website in June, and my edges started growing back. Within 2 weeks I could really see a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these hair vitamins for 1 month now, I&#x27;ve had a good amount of growth, I&#x27;ve used many hair vitamins but these here are the real deal. I cut off my hair due to breakage and alopecia, the pics below is a 3 week progress pic from the back of my hair that wasn&#x27;t growing and has grown in.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these vitamins for a little over two weeks and even though I don&#x27;t know my actual hair growth because of my sew-in I can already tell that I like them better than Hairfinity. I don&#x27;t get headaches, I&#x27;m not breaking out and I don&#x27;t have to drink a ton of water. I can&#x27;t wait to take my hair down and see my growth. I also order the castor oil and I am loving that.</li>
            <li> These pills are AMAZING! I tried other hair, skin, and nails products and they do not compare. Unlike the other vitamins The Mane Choice not only increases growth rate in length but it also thickens and promotes retention which is just as important as growth! There no side effects when taken correctly. Adding these to your hair care regimen will be one of the best decisions you&#x27;ll ever make! I thank God for finding these! They may not have hundreds of celebrity ambassadors saying \\&quot;get long healthy hair like mine\\&quot; (as they wear 24 inch Brazilian straight) misleading the consumer. The Mane Choice is showing the real (everyday) woman achieve real results!</li>
            <li> I give TheManeChoice vitamins 5 ***** they are easy to take, I had awesome growth,  less shedding and noticed a change in thickness after one bottle without experiencing any breakouts or sickness.  If you are on a journey to healthy hair I definitely recommend these vitamins</li>
            <li> Loveddd these pills. They worked much better for me than Hairfinty.  Hairfinty grew my hair but broke my face and body out and left black marks horribly, something I never had to deal with before. Using hairfinty it grew my hair 2 inches in a month, but Main Choice grew my hair 3 1/2 inches in a month with no break outs.!!! I also drink water while taking them</li>
            <li> These pills have helped me in more ways than one.  My hair is definitely healthier now ... after almost 1 month of taking them ... I see a major difference.  It&#x27;s thicker and has definitely grown a lot more than it normally grows in this time frame.  Before I started these pills I had all my dead ends cut off.  So at least an inch was cut off ... my hair has grown back to the length that it was before I cut my ends off ... in less than a month&#x27;s time.  I had a baby about a year and a half ago and was experiencing major shedding ... with these pills that has helped tremendously to stop all that shedding.  I was very skeptical at first when I saw a lot of reviews about how these pills caused breakouts on your face.  So I was stressing because during and after pregnancy ... my acne has gotten worse and makes me feel like I am a teenager again with all the breakouts ... I MUST SAY these pills have actually cleared my face!!!  Even if these pills didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair I would probably still take them just to keep my face clear.  To sum this all up as you can see I absolute LOVE THESE PILLS!!!  Will definitely be ordering more.  I recommend all my friends to these pills and they have ordered and are loving the results too.  So definitely give them a try!!!</li>
            <li> When I decided to go natural it was all because I saw everyone else&#x27;s pictures with long healthy hair and I wanted to be apart of the trend. After a year of being natural my hair didn&#x27;t grow at all and I immediately began to feel embarrassed because everyone had long beautiful hair and I didnt. These pills brought the confidence out of me. When I started taking them not only did my hair immediately began to grow but it was also healthier and stronger. I felt confident to wear my natural hair out and I felt amazing. Now my hair may not be the length but it&#x27;s almost there all thanks to the mane choice manetabolism pills.</li>
            <li> These pills are AMAZING!!! Not only have they made my hair longer and stronger, but also my nails. I HIGHLY recommend these pills to anyone who is on a journey to healthy hair!! The shipping speed is also fast when ordered from the actual website.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair all my life that only grows to shoulder length. My hair will then become thin and damaged from excessive heat that even though I know is bad for y hair, I still insist on using. I started using this product not because I wanted to see a difference in the length of my hair but because I wanted to improve its health. I ordered a month supply and did a protective hair style to test the product. After taking out my hair I could see an immediate difference in my hair texture. My strands were no longer thin and stringy but healthy (curly, thick and strong with less split ends). My edges (which I had given up on as they started to thin from constant braiding that was too tight) were starting to fill back out. My nails that would usually split and break had started to grow hard and strong. At first I thought it was just an illusion because I as so desperate for healthy hair so I continued to order a two month supply. After continuing with these vitamins I saw the real difference.My hair actually became unbelievable thick and soft and started to grow! I now have thick have thick healthy hair with full edges after finishing my third bottle. This product is great for anyone in search of healthy hair. One must remember that this is a process. You will not see results overnight and these products don&#x27;t just work on their own, you have to take the right precautions to promote healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these pills for a few months now and I am amazed at how much thicker I feel my hair is getting even with my hair being relaxed. I have also seen significant growth in between my protective styles. I recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> First, I did notice some growth in the length of my hair but it has only been 30 days. grew about 2 inches!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;BUT my edges!! Oh my!Grew out so much!&lt;br /&gt;I find that there is a night to day difference in only one month; my edges are way fuller than what they used to be! I am soooo exited for next month to see if it continues like that.&lt;br /&gt;Second, I didn&#x27;t  get break out issues&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I have very brittle nails, and I did not see amelioration in them which is not that disappointing, I was not expecting anything major because my goal did not have to do with my nails.But Yes My short brittle names have grown sweety! get yours today!</li>
            <li> These pills are amazing. I&#x27;m newly natural so my hair is still very short and it&#x27;s always been short. I was so tired of feeling like my hair wasn&#x27;t growing so I decided to give these a try. I bought a 2 month supply and I experienced an inch an half of hair growth within the first month. Now, I am on my 5th bottle and my hair has gone from shoulder length to bra strap length. These are definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I have been taking Manetabolism for just about a month and I have had tremendous results. I had been struggling to grow my edges back in and regain the fullness in my hair due to hair loss for 6 years. 4  years ago I decided to no longer relax my hair and focus on healthier hair practices and a healthier lifestyle in general. With this change my hair was growing but my edges were not. I tried oils, creams, drops, other supplements... Nothing worked. After seeing some of the before and after results on Instagram, I decided to order a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the 1st wk I noticed my nails were growing. They are now strong, long, and just beautiful.  My edges are completely filled in and I have so much more energy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had a hard time digesting supplements or had adverse reactions. I was soooo happy to finally find a product that was not harsh on my system and delivered the benefits it promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something new and these are by far my favorite hair supplements. With other products I get bad headaches and with theses, nothing. I see growth automatically which is a plus.  It&#x27;s a product you MUST try !&lt;br /&gt;-Lechelle</li>
            <li> Just ordered these on their website and I must say these are amazing ! After a week I already see new growth . I took a picture before I started and one after(my hair is currently in braids) so it&#x27;s easy to view new growth. I was scared to buy it since I&#x27;m in college I did not want to lose my money but it was worth it Im trying to get out the TWA stage since I just cut my hair . I&#x27;m so ready for this hair journey</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of manetabolism and I am in LOVE! My hair is growing wonderfully, my skin isn&#x27;t breaking out like other biotin products I&#x27;ve tried. This is a must have product. Recommend this for women (like myself) that wears a lot of weave and  lost a lot of it due to having too many center parts.</li>
            <li> These pills are awesome gave me an inch new growth in one month!!!! The best hair supplements you will see results. Thank you manetabolism!!!!</li>
            <li> These vitamins are amazing. They have helped my nails, hair and eyelashes grow. Thank you for a wonderful product</li>
            <li> I love it. I brought at the actual website for $24.99 and I received it in three days. My hair grew less then a month. I can&#x27;t wait to order more and the other products.</li>
            <li> These Vitamins Are Amazing. They Do What They Claim!  My Hair Noticeably Grew Longer Within A Month, Ni Side Affects Which Is Great. I Will Definitely Recommend This Product To Everyone!  I Love It! I Want More!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!! I was skeptical about trying it at first but after reading numerous of reviews and doing tons of research, I decided to give it a try. I&#x27;ve never had problem with thickness but for some reason I could never retain my length. It grow a certain length then over time it would slowly  break off. These hair vitamins has given me thicker hair, healthier hair, and longer hair. Because it helps grow healthy hair I can actually retain my length. I would recommend this to any and everyone; regardless of race, hair texture, natural or relaxed. Everyone should give it a try!</li>
            <li> Let me repeat, this product is the TRUTH! I recently decided that I wanted to grow my hair out because my hair had been stuck at one length for quite a while. I came across the Mane Choice hair growth pills and my hasn&#x27;t been the same since. My hair has not only grown, but it&#x27;s gotten healthier inside and out. Not only has my hair benefited, my nails are longer and my skin is clearer. And if that&#x27;s not enough, go to the Mane Choice&#x27;s website or Instagram for a number of amazing personal testimonies. TRY THEM, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> Wow!!!! These pills are amazing! 6 months ago I decided to go natural and felt I needed something to aid me in growing my hair. While researching different pills I came across these and decided to give them a try. My hair growth was remarkable and I was able to big chop 3 months into taking these pills. Very thankful to have found these pills.</li>
            <li> I started Manetabolism in May and am glad I tried it when I did. I had just recently did a large cut and was missing my length. Manetabolism gave me a steady inch per month. Before the vitamins I only could get 1/2&amp;#34; a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you first start the pills you&#x27;ll be amazed that your hair can grow 1/2&amp;#34; in two weeks. At the time I was doing braids and I had to get my braids redone very often to keep up with the growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These vitamins are formulated perfectly by a group of qualified Doctors. This fact alone really made me eager to try them since their effiency is backed by science. Also these pills caused me no breakouts like other vitamins I&#x27;ve used. And my nails grew like crazy and my skin thanked me as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manetabolism is always having a special so If you get a chance to try these perfectly formulated vitamins I would highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> I took a two month supply of the Mane Choice supplements from April through June. The difference in my hair was amazing. The strength and of course the length retention. I gained two inches in growth. Can&#x27;t afford it right now. But the second I get out of bootcamp I will splurge like I crazy. Dying to try the deep condition and daily moisturizing butter.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these vitamins. I have been using now for 2 months and have experienced amazing growth. I began using the vitamins with Senegalese twist, and they grew out so fast. I have lupus and the vitamins are helping with my shedding. I would advise everyone to try them out.</li>
            <li> This is my first customer review on Amazon. I am always a little suspicious of Amazon reviews because I do not know who is real or fake, but when it came to this product I watched the benefits from these vitamins for myself on Instagram. I had been following Courtney on IG for several months and loved how she transformed her hair and also watch her business with her husband grow from the ground up! These vitamins are amazing for my hair I even got my sister to buy them and she loves them as much as I do. I took Hairfinity for about 6 months and saw results, but the difference with manetabolism is that it grew my hair and also helped me retain the length as well. I am very pleased with these vitamins and I recommend them to any and everyone. Find her on Instagram and see results from real people for yourself to ease your mind:) Have a blessed time hair growing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking The Mane Choice for almost a month. Before I started taking them I had what I call light acne (a bump or two here a bump or two there), but I&#x27;ve recently noticed that I haven&#x27;t had any bumps in a little over a week. When you factor in that I don&#x27;t drink as much water as I should, that&#x27;s great. Plus the fact that my nails are growing (FINALLY) is also a plus. As I&#x27;ve said before I&#x27;m almost to my one month mark and I can feel a good amount of new growth. Before I started The Mane Choice I treated myself to an Awapuhi Keratriplex Deep Conditioning Treatment and a trim. My hair was at mid-neck length and its now at shoulder length. I&#x27;ve also noticed a decrease in the amount of hair that collects in the sink after I comb or brush through it a couple of times. I would and have recommended there pills to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product my protective style has to be change because of hair growth and I&#x27;ve only had the product for a few weeks :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving these pills! My hair is beginning to feel a lot healthier! Haven&#x27;t been taking long. Once I&#x27;m done I&#x27;ll be back to further review!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I get excited for &amp;#34;tomorrow&#x27;s&amp;#34; cause I know I get to take 2 more of these vitamins. I&#x27;m on my 5th bottle as of right now. My hair had never been past my shoulders and within 8 weeks my hair length surpassed my shoulders. I haven&#x27;t missed a day and my hair is longer, thicker and feels stronger even on wash days. My shedding are little to none when I detangle and I truly think it because of these vitamins. Thanks Courtney! Can&#x27;t go a day without them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen soo much growth!!! My hair is also fuller in the middle where it all came out and never grew back as thick.  Love these pills!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. These vitamins really do work! I haven&#x27;t even used up my first month&#x27;s supply and my hair has already grown so much. The hair that grows is really soft, too. I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone who wants to grown long, healthy hair. And you don&#x27;t have to be natural to use this product, Buy it :)</li>
            <li> I decided to transition from relaxed to natural an decided to give manetabolism a try! I have only been taking them for 3 weeks and my hair has gotta thicker less shedding and even grew about an inch if not more already! No headaches or nausea. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin! i am just on my first bottle and i have seen growth and thickness, i recommend this and looking forward to my final results.:)</li>
            <li> After removing some extensions from my hair in January I noticed some thinning around my edges. On Instagram one day I saw some great reviews of these hair vitamins and decided to try them for myself. After 3 months of taking them, my edges are full and thick! The overall health of my hair improved and quite a bit of nail growth! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these for two months and they are absolutely AMAZING. I questioned buying them but my friend swore by it and I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast my hair was and is still growing. If you&#x27;re hesitant I recommend buying a bottle and taking pictures before and after a one month supply.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Noticeably thicker hair right away!! Almost two inches of growth in 5 weeks...I&#x27;m on my way to Pocahontas length!!! Thanks MANETABOLISM!!!</li>
            <li> So recently I ordered the one month Manetabolism pills and I have not received them yet, but I ordered them because of all the wonderful reviews I saw on youtube and instagram,  and after doing extensive research I am so excited to receive these pills and begin my hair journey!</li>
            <li> I started using mane choice hair manetabolism on September 24th I muse say I really love how my growth is going, I went and order 2 mths supply I&#x27;m so in love with this by the way love the speedy delivery xoxoxoxoxox</li>
            <li> I waited about  months before buying these vitamins because i wanted to see the public&#x27;s response over time. After glowing reviews, I bought some. I am  FAN. I&#x27;ve been taking Manetabolism for about 3 months and my growth has been crazy. I did another BC in September 2013 and have been dying for my hair to be long and healthy. (Mid back length is my goal) These vitamins are definitely helping me reach there faster. I also love that Courtney is a Christian and gives all credit and Glory to God. She has a forever customer in me. 👍😘😙😘👍</li>
            <li> I ordered these pills to help my edges grow because they are very thin I have tried EVERYTHING in the book and nothing seems to work but so far I can see some growth within my edges and I&#x27;m just in complete shock also I was nervous at first to take the pills just because of possible side effects but I&#x27;m not experiencing anything there perfect  I will be ordering a second third fourth bottle lol</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE these hair vitamins.  I started out ordering one month&#x27;s supply and before completing that bottle I quickly ordered 3 more bottles!  Not only is my natural hair growing, it&#x27;s softer and has less tangles.  I&#x27;ve had short, brittle fingernails my ENTIRE life and they are growing beautifully.  I&#x27;m even noticing longer lashes.  This is a must-have!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! I started taking it in May and my hair has grown just under 4 inches since then. It&#x27;s also gotten super thick! My hair has been so healthy I love it! I&#x27;ve just purchased my 7th bottle today!</li>
            <li> I love these vitamins they gave me life the did just want it reads healthy hair more hair can&#x27;t stop want stop it&#x27;s a must have</li>
            <li> I have been taking manetabolisms for the past 6months and they have truly been a blessing not only to the growth and strength of my natural hair, but It has also supported the health of my skin and nails, unlike most vitamins the manetabolisms has never given me any negative side affects I have found that it has boosted the health of my immune system along side my healthy eating diet change..&lt;br /&gt;I brag about the mane tabolisms to any one struggling to retain healthy growth and length.. Because of how quick and effective it is, I noticed tangible growth and change in my hair after 1 week of my mantabolism journey&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mane choice is the best thing that has happened to my Natural hair journey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It never disappoints...</li>
            <li> I love love love these vitamins!!  I wasn&#x27;t too sure if they were going to work but after taking them for just a couple weeks my hair had grown a little more than half an inch!! My regular hair growth cycle is half an inch per month!  If you are at all unsure go to the manechoice instagram page and witness all of the AMAZING before and after pictures.  I love this stuff and will be repurchasing it again and again and again!!</li>
            <li> So I only really review on books but here it goes... First off I must start by saying I am an overseas customer(meaning that getting the right product is paramount because of shipping prices etc) and had been reading reviews, watching videos and looking at transformation photo&#x27;s since March and one of my closest friends decided to try your product in June and saw a decent amount of change...so I decided to try it as I&#x27;ve been stuck at the same length for quite someone now. I have been taking these vitamins for nearly a month now and have only missed one day my nails have grown rapidly, my skin is clearer than ever and my hair has grown nearly two inches it does look and feel a lot healthier than before I now officially have a bun. As well as growth on my head my eyebrows have grown which I&#x27;m so excited about as I&#x27;ve never had any and never had them done this will be a new experience...roll on month two. Will definitely be recommending it</li>
            <li> My hair was falling out in the back due to lack of moisture and too many relaxers. I stop relaxing my hair and started watching YouTube for help to get my hair healthy again. The women on YouTube helped me start a hair routine.. but my hair was still lacking in luster/thickness. I found these supplements on Instagram and decided to try it out. I absolutely love these pills, my hair has grown back and its thicker then it has ever been! My eye brows are thicker too!!! 2 thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> So about these vitamins... They have done absolutely great things for my hair and my overall body. Here&#x27;s some background... I&#x27;ve been natural for about a 1/12 after transitioning for a year while in college, which was a struggle. My hair growth has been gradual and it&#x27;s been a long road. I&#x27;m big on protective styles but my last sew-in left me very thin around my edges. I stumbled upon these vitamins on Instagram and wanted to give them a try. I tried hairfinity a few years back and didn&#x27;t see much overall improvement or growth. So Courtney was having a Labor Day sale and was offering a great discount so I said why not. The shipping was so fast and the pills were at my house in 2 days flat. I didn&#x27;t start taking them right away brcause I wanted to try a crochet braid as my next protective style and had to figure out how to go about that. But I&#x27;ve had my crochet braid in for about 2 weeks now and let me tell you not only do I have about an 1/2 of inch of growth already but my edges are filling back in!!!! Praise Jesus!!! and after graduating from school I&#x27;ve started Working and I&#x27;m usually a drab morning person but the pills give me energy too. Overall the vitamins are the bomb and you should try them and support the brand, the owner Courtney gives back in charity and other giveaways and engages with those following or wanting to try her brand. What more can you ask for!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these hair vitamins for almost 2 months and i have to say this is hair growth in a pill!!! My cousin started taking these pills first and once I saw how her edge grew in within 2 weeks I was sold.I first started taking these the end of July and the first change I noticed was my hair  texture has changed. I now have thick hair that gets curly when wet. My hair use to be very thin and stringy,now its has a pretty shine. I also had a lot of breakage and shedding before taking theses pills. These vitamins truly work and i&#x27;ve tried  all types of vitamins in the past such as,Nexus,GNC hair vitamins,Groganics,and hairfinity and this by far is the one that i finally see results with. My hair has grown 2 1/2 inches and i&#x27;m not even finished my second bottle yet.These vitamins make you want to take better care of your hair once you see how much progress you can get from them. I will continue to take these pills so i can continue to get awsome results. Ladies start your Long hair don&#x27;t care journey asap!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I recently cut my hair in Nov. and I started using the Manetabolism vitamins in Feb. I used the product for three months and my hair grew longer, healthier and thicker. My hair grew a total of three inches during that period that I was using the product. I first thought to use the product because I was getting a sew-in and I wanted to find a way to preserve my edges during that time. As a result of testing this product, when I took my sew-in out I found that my edges were much better than before I used the product. My hair has never been thick and so I throughly enjoyed the new found thickness that I gained from the Manetabolism vitamins. Thanks to this product I am very close to reaching my hair goal and it took me half the time to get here.</li>
            <li> This Is like god created it his self and sent it to me because my hair had broke and my edges were thinning . I have been taking mane choice hair vitamins for 3 weeks and my hair have grown 4 inches. I will continue to use the mane chioce products. I have brought 4 bottles after i have seen the results. If you haven&#x27;t gotten your vitamins then you really need to. It is the real deal and not like the other hair vitaams that take 3 months to show that your hair has grown an inch. I recommended yall go try it.</li>
            <li> The best pills ever. I was trying biotin for years and it&#x27;s didn&#x27;t seem to work. I was searching Instagram and I came across Mane Choice. And I reviewed it and I seen testimonies. Courtney and her team are amazingly magnificent. I cut my hair last year November, in a symmetrical cut shaved the back off. I was upset. When I saw these pills, I said let me try it. I only used two bottles of the pills and a year later my hair is a little pasted my shoulders and my shaved part in the back fully grown. THESE PILLS ARE A MIRACLE. I also love the butter and conditioner they work wonders as well!</li>
            <li> I am a college student and I never had the time to really take care of my hair or even afford to do so. I caught the hair vitamins on a sale and just couldn&#x27;t resist. Before, my hair was so thin, dry and damaged it got so bad I was embarrassed to wear my real hair. After taking these pills my hair is so much thicker, fuller, and never dry or brittle and this happened within the first week. So happy I got these pills and can&#x27;t wait for the next sale to order more! Lol</li>
            <li> Amazing results. This vitamin is more than just for hair growth it really is a multivitamin as well!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone and everyone. These pills are better than hairfinity and biotin. It is worth every penny and it SHOWS results, best thing is it works on all hair types. I am currently on a natural hair journey and I am using protective hairstyles to grow my hair and the manetabolism vitamins are definitely showing results by growing out my protective hairstyles. Dont hesistate to buy these vitamins, they are a great way to grow your hair fast.</li>
            <li> I received my hair pills about 3weeks ago. Not only I can already see hair growth I see a change in my lifestyle. I normally take energy pills to get me started my day but since taking the mane choice I don&#x27;t have to anymore. It promotes a surge of energy. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love love love these vitamins ! I tired hairfinity for two months and it made my hair thinner so I made that mane choice and switched over and have been taking these for 3 months and for the first time in my 22 years of living my nails are growing &amp; breaking . Thanks Courtney !</li>
            <li> AMAZING....sooo I have tried two other products I won&#x27;t name that were said to do the same....however they had horrible side effects!...manetabolism is amazing!..no side affects other than beautiful hair!...I suffered from heat damage and thin edges from wearing weaves and tight protective styles, well I&#x27;ll tell you after taking the vitamins for 6 months my edges are growing slow but at least they are growning!!!!!! Where before they didn&#x27;t bt not only has this product helped me but the owner of the wonderful brand her humbleness has definitely impacted my life!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my fourth bottle and these vitamins are excellent.  I have seen a lot of growth but more importantly for me I have noticed that my hair has grown in much thicker and fuller.  I used hair infinity vitamins and they don&#x27;t even compare.  The mane choice vitamins are the best</li>
            <li> The Mane Choice Manetabolism vitamins are the truth. I&#x27;ve been using them for the past 6 months and my hair has never been healthier. I definitely see a dramatic growth difference and thickness, plus just overall health in my hair. I love them. And unlike other vitamins I&#x27;ve experience, these are the only vitamins that don&#x27;t cause breakouts on my face, which is a plus for me. The Mane Choice, you have a lifetime customer here :) :) :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these vitamins for four months now and they are the real deal. I Love them and wont be stopping anytime soon. I guarantee you&#x27;ll be satisfied!!!!</li>
            <li> Tried 2 bottles of these and just absolutely loveeed it. I saw such a difference in my hair after the 1st bottle. I would recommand this to anyone. Hairinifty is &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; but these pills just changed my whole entire perapective on hairinifty, 10x better !!</li>
            <li> This product is everythig it says it will do. I initially decided to purchased this product after I took out my box braids and noticed how thin my edges got. After two weeks of using it I could see a difference. I also love the fact that I don&#x27;t breakout. This was the fine lining between hairfinity &amp; themanechoice. I&#x27;m glad I made the RIGHT choice :)</li>
            <li> Look, I would choose these hair Vitamins over any &amp;#34;ritual&amp;#34; any day!  Not only can I be a spokesperson for this GREAT vitamin on this amazing line of products but REAL people show REAL results EVERY DAY.  Just take a look at TheManeChoice Instagram account!  The cost of this product is worth more than buying packages after packages of other creams or hair &amp;#34;vitamins&amp;#34; when this right here is the key!</li>
            <li> Bought the pills but was skeptical well my hair dresser immediately noticed I was doing something different she said your hair is growing like crazy! Easy to take, no breakouts like hair infinity did. I grew hair EVERYWHERE (you&#x27;ve been warned. Lol) and when you become a VIP member you get great deals!!! Trust me these are no gimmick.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It does not break me out like hairfinity did and i am satisfied with the result.</li>
            <li> In the beginning of this year I was suffering from horrible color damage, causing me to unfortunately have to cut my longer than shoulder length hair all the way up to my ear! :( I was soooo upset and was looking for something to help me grow my healthy thick hair back. I found the Mane Choice Vitamins on social media, with some research I decided to give them a try, and boy was I surprised. Not only did my hair grow almost back to my shoulder, my skin looks GREAT! Courtney and the Manechoice team are gifts from God. They are so helpful and giving, a great company to do your business with. Once my finances get in order I plan to buy a 6 month supply!!! Thank you so much Courtney and the Manechoice!</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem growing hair length. but once I discovered the mane choice, everything changed. I feel so way better wearing my natural hair out and not having to cover it up with braids and weaves. These are the best hair vitamins out there. I would definitely recommend this to all women/men with hair troubles.</li>
            <li> I have taken these pills for two months and absolutely love it. Not only did my hair grew but it felt healthier. My hair usually feels dry but while taken them, it did not. I also taken hairfinity previously but I prefer these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Manetabolism for three months now, and wow!!! Before my hair was trying to recover from MAJOR damage. It was breaking, my curls were flat.. Just all around NOT A GOOD LOOK. Since using this product, I&#x27;ve been able to rock my hair natural, and my curls are bouncy, shiny and beautiful!! Now let&#x27;s talk about length... You want it?? This is the product to use. I was able to get my damaged ends all the way off by the end of minth one!!! Since then, minimal trims and my hair looks awesome!! I highly recommend this product to anyone who is trying to get their hair in better shape.</li>
            <li> I tried HAIRFINITY you better make the MANE CHOICE! Its the best decision I ever made. I feel sexy, my confidence is out of this world, and my hair is ALL MINE!!!! Turn heads with the mane choice ladies!!! Your hair will be flowing in no time! It works good with men too!!!! These vitamins are crack! I recommend them to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try currently waiting for my shipment</li>
            <li> I have been taking these vitamins for a month now and I must say these vitamins are the deal!!!!!!!!!!!! I have definitely seen results. My hairline thinned out from braids and excessive tension and now it is thick and growing. I love it. I am in the process of going natural so my hair is the thickest it has ever been. I have been recommending these to everyone I encounter when they ask me about hair. I will definitely continue my healthy hair journey with manetabolism vitamins and mane choice hair care products</li>
            <li> This really is the secret to long, thick and healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s my back story. I used to have hair waist length up until when I was like 12, before my mom started cutting out my perm in High school. My hair was near waist length but not quite by the time I graduated. After High school I was in a pre college program before Freshman year and wore my hair straight practically straight EVERYDAY because I hated wearing my hair curly and wasn&#x27;t at the desirable length it used to be at. Well you know what happened next? another BIG CHOP at the beginning of Freshman year. I cried for a week straight because my hair was then shoulder length. My hair was my pride and joy and have been growing it back since then. From time to time when I straighten my hair and it&#x27;s not at waist length I&#x27;ll shed a tear or 2. I started off trying Hair infinity and my hair barely grew , I even tried the &amp;#34;Inverse method&amp;#34; which is a claim that you can get your hair to grow an extra inch within a week. Nothing was WORKING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend a lot of time on instagram looking at protective hair styles and following other girls that have been going natural for a while or just started.&lt;br /&gt;This is when I first came across The Mane Choice. After hair infinity I didn&#x27;t want to try another hair growth pill, but after looking at all the pictures with significant hair growth it was hard Not to buy in. I also heard great reviews from even girls on my campus about the Mane Choice. One person said their hair grew so fast they stopped taking them because they were wearing braids and you could notice all the new growth !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s when I OFFICIALLY bought in. I started off with 2 bottles. Completely confident the pills would work. and you know what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEY DID. I noticed a huge difference in growth before I even finished the first Bottle!!!!!!!! I was ASTONISHED!  all of those nights crying over the want for my original length was over!!! I have finally reached ultimate happiness. Buying into this product of course lead me to buy the other products as well !!!! The Mane Choice has definitely been a MANE component in my hair growth over the past few months and have completely bought into the other products which I also HIGHLY recommend!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re ready for long beautiful it&#x27;s time to make the switch!! From whatever it is, biotin, hair infinity, other hair growth pills, WHATEVER it is that you are using and or doing I can Guarantee that the Mane Choice will be the BEST CHOICE you will ever make regarding your hair health/journey :)</li>
            <li> I purchased manetabolism after scouring through all of the other hair vitamin options and every one of them had unwanted side effects like acne and some worse like stomach cramps. I purchased manetabolism and I had NO side effects at all. None. And my hair grew and my nails were uncontrollable lol. I now purchased some for my mom with relaxer damage and my mother in law with thyroid issues and they are telling others about it! Not to mention, the brand is a really genuine brand. Courtney is very giving and always supportive to her customers! Great brand and great product!</li>
            <li> These vitamins are the bomb.com! I have been taking them for 6 months now and I have seen amazing results. And no breakouts either like with other vitamins!</li>
            <li> Ok.. let me just say that theses pill are EVERYTHING! !! I been taking them since March becase I wanted my hair to be a certain length for my wedding in July. My hair growth within the first month was almost 2ins. So I had to buy more, all together from March til July 15th the day of my wedding my hair  length is a total of 6ins. I cant wait til my first trimester is over (thats when my Dr say I can get back on them once the sickness is over) because my hair is about to be a true MANEchoice if you know what I mean.... And when my frieands say &amp;#34;my jair not growing&amp;#34; I just pass the a bottle and they always call and say &amp;#34;how can I get somemore!! Its the best on allllll types of hair trust and believe from a woman that has tired everything! !</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for anyone trying to transition without doing the big chop such as myself!  In one I grew almost two inches! I took these supplements in the morning and drank two 20 oz bottles of water with it. I didn&#x27;t break out once! This product made my hair soo much stronger and shinier. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying the 6 month supply next payday.... buyers beware,  this will grow out your protective style sooner than expected!</li>
            <li> These pills are great, my hair feels muvh thicker and my edges are coming back in great. Definately helped with the heat damage on my natural hair. Im on month two and ready to see what this product can do for me in a year.!</li>
            <li> Scared To Try These At First , Because I Had Such An Awful Outcome With hairfinity. I&#x27;ve Always Had Thin Edges BUt This Product Has Made them Completely Grow In Full.And On The Plus Side I Haven&#x27;t Had Any Breakouts Since Taking These.</li>
            <li> Bought these from them I have a 4 month supply I love them I recently just cut my hair &amp;am excited to see how long my hair grows.</li>
            <li> I have to say these pills are God sent, simply amazing, incredible!!!!! I fell &amp;#34;victim&amp;#34; to losing my edges from protective styling with braids that were entirely too tight &amp; HEAVY!! Those braids literally wore my hair out. So naturally I was devastated, and completely heartbroken over the loss of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been following Courtney&#x27;s hair journey long before she announced what she was doing (which was taking HER vitamins). Then I remember the day she said she she was gonna share her secret basically. I was ecstatic!!!! Even with all my excitement,  I was a bit skeptical. I thought oh she&#x27;s just trying to fool us with the old okie doke. So then I started seeing people&#x27;s pics &amp; testimonies about the manetabolism pills and I was like ok, I gotta try these babies!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered my first bottle and I kid you not, my edges had filled completely back in, in just SIXTEEN (16) days!!!!!! I had tried everything from growth oils, shampoos, rogaine, even MONISTAT with no such luck &amp; with no sight of my edges coming back. But the manetabolism pills did EXACTLY what they said they would do &amp; that&#x27;s grow my hair. Granted, everybody&#x27;s hair is different and results vary from person to person but these babies will definitely grow your hair &amp; soon have you looking like Rapunzel!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m the biggest skeptic of all so when I say these WORK, I mean they WORK &amp; I have the picture to show!!! Also, I did NOT have any breakouts with taking these &amp; my nails grew ridiculously long as well &amp; super strong. My nails are really soft &amp; break extremely easy but not anymore!  Not since I&#x27;ve been taking MANETABOLISM!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re suffering from any form of hair loss whether it be hereditary, or from the wrong hairstyles don&#x27;t fret!!! Go and order you a month&#x27;s supply of manetabolism and watch your hair fill in!!!! Don&#x27;t get discouraged if your hair is not coming in as quickly as you&#x27;d like; just order another bottle and watch them work....remember the time in which it takes your hair to grow back is not important, what&#x27;s important is your hair growing!! As the adage says, &amp;#34;Rome wasn&#x27;t built in a day! &amp;#34; So make the choice... The Mane Choice if you want GUARANTEED results!!</li>
            <li> i love this product..it doesnt make me break out i have less shedding and the best part IT ACTUALLY GROWS YOUR HAIR courtney is the best and i love her discounts she gives alot &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I tried Hairfinity first and broke out. I also did not received the results I expected. (My hair grew at normal rate). A friend told me about Manetabolism and so I decided to try it because... well, why not? I didn&#x27;t break out and I saw more growth in one month than I did in two months of taking Hairfinity. Def ordering more.</li>
            <li> I see that most of the debate of vitamins these days are without a doubt Hairfinity vs Manetabolism and the winner issssss! MANETABOLISM! Without a doubt. I did get sufficient growth with my Hairfinity BUT what I got in a 2 month supply of Hairfinity I was getting in less than a month with Manetabolism.  Unfortunately, I fell very ill for a few months and decided not to take my vitamins because I knew my body wouldn&#x27;t be absorbing any of the nutrients and benefits so I have some left from the 2 month supply I bought and my results haven&#x27;t been constant but I plan on getting another bottle as soon as my funds permit and I&#x27;m well past excited to get them again! After doing as drastic haircut, I&#x27;m ready for my hair to grow like weeds again! Please, buy this product and recommend to a friend cause you will not regret it. It really is the MANE choice!</li>
            <li> These vitamins are Great!!!! My hair In the front fell out so bad I ordered these vitamins and I just finished my first bottle...I can honestly say hair is starting to fill back in...Great product I Definitely Recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try the vitamins at first because of my past experiences . However within a week of using the mane choice vitamins, I have noticed growth not only on my hair but also my nails ,skin and eyelashes have shown great improvement. I&#x27;ve been using the vitamins for 3 months now and have over 6 inches of new growth! I did not think it was possible but these vitamins have changed my life. Mane Choice you have gained a lifetime customer ! If you suffer from hair loss or feel as though your hair is not growing I would highly recommend trying these vitamins!&lt;br /&gt;-Mimi C.</li>
            <li> I hear so much about this product! I am so excited to have not only myself BUT my husband to start on this product with me. HE will be the best candidate &amp; can&#x27;t wait to share our story with the mane choice once we receive &amp; start 😄</li>
            <li> this pills are amazing! Not only are they great for hair growth but an awesome vitamin! I was very ill a few months ago. I needed to build my immmune system and health back. I usually took other vitamins but my friend referred me to these. She gave me her bottle and not only did my hair grow thicker but my health has dramatically changed. I love these vitamins!</li>
            <li> These are AMAAAAZING. I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle of these pills...I&#x27;m seeing overall improvement in length and thickness. But, the the most significant change is the weak/bald spot issues that I&#x27;ve been having. Since starting these pills, the spot has filled in and my weaker spots are also growing too. I was really sad about my bald/weak spot that&#x27;s was caused by stress. But, it&#x27;s turning around! All this and no weird side effects (i.e. No breakouts!). I take both pills in the morning, so I don&#x27;t forget. I will definitely be repurchasing. OH, also, they don&#x27;t taste or smell  HORRIBLE like most vitamins do. No gagging, lol :D</li>
            <li> 2 pills shy of completing my 6th 30-day supply bottle of Healthy Hair Vitamins, I have to say that The Mane Choice has made a believer out of me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only have I noticed substantial growth/length retention in my hair since taking them (about 4 total inches), but the manageability of my unprocessed natural hair has improved greatly!  Although considered &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; by most standards (mid-back length), the hair around my temples has always been much shorter and thinner than the other hair on my head.  About 3 months after beginning my Manetabolism regimen, I noticed that the hair at my temples had begun fulling in.  This hadn&#x27;t been readily apparent to me until I started comparing pictures over this period of time.  To say I was pleasantly surprised, was a major understatement!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind however that these pills don&#x27;t only support the promotion of healthy hair growth, but also the growth of strong, sturdy fingernails!  There have been many occasions when I&#x27;ve banged my hand and broken a nail, only to see it growing back long and strong in about a week to two week&#x27;s time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;d be lying if I told you that Manetabolism worked overnight.  You are going to need patience and to adopt a regimen that will reinforce the pills. Most importantly, you will need to drink PLENTY of water.  As a runner, I hydrate constantly but I noticed that I had to drink almost twice as much water to flush the biotin in the pills through my system (which for me caused a few unsightly breakouts on my cheeks and chin).  Still, this reaction wasn&#x27;t enough to stop taking them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would highly recommend this product to anyone tired of stagnant hair growth and ready to experience the type of healthy hair and length retention you never thought you could achieve before!</li>
            <li> I have used other products and saw no difference then I heard about manetabolism but wasn&#x27;t sure if I wanted to lose more money, because the other products said the same thing. I decided to give it a shot, and these vitamins really work. I been using them now for 6 months &amp; my hair has grown so much. I also have less shedding. I will continue to use manetabolism for healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I love love love these vitamins. They are sooo awesome. For a long time I didn&#x27;t have edges nor would the back of my hair grow so I had to continue to cut my hair to keep it even. When I started taking these vitamins my edges grew back in a month and the back of my hair is growing to match the front of my hair. I am soo happy thee vitamins help your hair grow strong and thick they are just awesome</li>
            <li> This product gives results as promised. I see pics and stories about this product on instagram and I&#x27;m definitely purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I personally have been using this product for 3 months, now if that doesn&#x27;t say enough then allow me to continue. I have recieved amazing results. Each month I obtain about 1inch. Normal hair growth for me is .5 of an inch. 3.5 inches vs. 1.5? I&#x27;ll take that any day. Im just so glad they let God use them in creating this amazing product. Don&#x27;t just take my world though buy it and see for yourself. Want to see others story check out themanechoice.com or instagram.com/themanechoice. You&#x27;ll be nothing short of impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with these vitamins. I was using the competition brand for three months and I only saw growth the very first month. I made the the choice after much review and seeing real results from people who had only used the manetabolism for two weeks. Now I have been using these vitamins four months and my hair is very healthy and I see a lotttttttt of growth even with my nails they are longer and healthy.... Thanks Courtney for your amazing products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these pills since Last year October (not consecutive). I&#x27;ve noticed tremendous growth. I also use some of their other products and HIGHLY recommend that you use their products.</li>
            <li> Manetabolism  tablets are great. I&#x27;ve been taking the vitamis for 2months &amp; have had great success with my hair growth. These vitamins have strengthen and thickened my natural hair.  I recommend this product to all woman. I&#x27;ve order other popular hair vitiamis however I seen results right away with these. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell if it did anything or not.</li>
            <li> I love this product this is my 3rd month my hair is growing rapidly and is healthy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m skeptical reading all those great reviews dated September 22 seems suspect to me that all those &amp;#34;different people&amp;#34; wrote reviews on the same day. Anyways an associate of mine told me about this products because she heard about it so I&#x27;m going to try it and give my review in a few months. Will be doing my protective styling while taking the pills. I really hope it works.</li>
            <li> By far the BEST on the market!!!!!! 💜💜💜💜💜</li>
            <li> Giving it 3 stars bc not sure about the hair growth too much but my skin looks amazing!! My skin suddenly looks healthy and glows. As far as hair I&#x27;ve been taking it for about 1 1/2 weeks so not too too sure yet. So side effects like Hairfinity.</li>
            <li> I have seen growth but not nearly as much as what the testimonials claim.  I have been taking it for 3 months straight and I&#x27;ve seen about a quarter of the results that it claims to produce.  I also read claims that it causes skin breakouts.  I didn&#x27;t experience this until the third month of using it. It has been bad enough to cause me to stop using the product.</li>
            <li> Results are not super fast since I have slow growth however a bald spot I had that&#x27;s had no hair growth is starting full in. You have to be patient, it&#x27;s not going to happen overnight</li>
            <li> Too soon for results, 3rd week... I have a very thin spot in the crown of my head, that I am watching for results..</li>
            <li> 03/19/2015&lt;br /&gt;Can purchase a 60 day supply count on Ebay for  $11.99&lt;br /&gt;The  best hair vitamin suppliment I have ever found so far and used.  Excellent results 5*****stars, these vitamins really grew out my hair people I kid you not.  I went bald in the crown of my head after being diagnosed with T2D type 2 diabetes in January of last year and taking Metformin 50mg @ 2×a day.  T2D forced my decision to go natural no more chemically processed hair.&lt;br /&gt;After many very very short hair cuts my husband gave me to even things out while having growth spurts.  Taking 2 bottles of  60 day supply using essential oils I now have a ahead full of hair Praise be to God I give the glory.  it&#x27;s lengthy enough to braid I can ware protective style cornrows.  Just ordered my 3rd bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I now embrace my natural ethnic coils and absolutely just love what manetabolism is doing for my hair,  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> So i bought these vitamins a couple months back. I didnt buy them from Amazon but on the website as they were being advertised on instagram. I have tried hairfinity and didnt notice much result wise. Now if tried Manetabolism and I must say....the biggest thing ive noticed is weight loss...and im starving ALL THE TIME...I wat and eat and eat..will gain a few pounds..go to sleep and ive lost all that weight plus usually another 1 or 2 pounds!!! Im pretty sure ita from these vitamins but no one else has mentioned...secondary to that is my hair is just overall healthier...a little thicker..a little longer.. im retaining moisture and more strands...overall i think its worth it and im not being paid or anything....I just wanted to tell my little story!</li>
            <li> It is working !!! I have it with braids on and I had to redo them !!&lt;br /&gt;My results may not be as fast and long than others (i have about one inch and a half growth in 2 months ) but I am buying it again!</li>
            <li> Love the product  it came right on time</li>
            <li> I just wanted to express my opinion about the mane choice vitamins. I never ever ever EVER write reviews on products but this one is a must!! These vitamins are amazing! I really love them. I&#x27;m in my second year of being completely all natural. No heat no chemicals or tight styles in my head what so ever. Just a curly headed chick!..lol before taking these pills, my hair grew very slowly. I&#x27;m talking VERY VERY slowly. The only thing that I was taking was a woman&#x27;s multivitamin for overall health. Nothing out the ordinary. I began taking these mane choice vitamins in January of this year. It is now March, and my hair has grown 3 inches!!! All in 3 months!! I&#x27;m not even sure how fast my hair was growing two years prior to me taking these pills, but to be able to grow 3 inches in 3 months is amazing!! I took before and after pics of my hair, and saw the comparison! I&#x27;m never giving up these pills. All I can tell you guys is that you should take them for yourself! Hey are much much cheaper on the website. Idk why it&#x27;s so expensive on here. They also have other hair products on the site to use on your hair. I just use he pills,but I may start using some of the other products.The founder is a Registered Nurse and she uses her products and pills for herself too. She even shows pictures of her progress on the website. So I would say go try the pills for yourself. They worked wonders for me. I would say my hair may be almost passed bra strap length by the end of this year. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how this product will continue to grow my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this vitamin for 4 months and it does everything it says. My hair was thin and see through, it is now fuller longer and healthier than it has ever been. These vitamins are amazing!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased these from the actual site.. Tomorrow marks 90 days. Nothing to brag about i did not get the results that i excepted.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been taking them a full month but what I can say they seem to be working.</li>
            <li> I feel these pills does a women justice! Perfect use as daily vitamin while attaining the hair growth that you want. For a person who has a oily skin type I&#x27;m hesitate to use certain hair pills because I fear the biotin in the pill will break me out but mane choice seems like it does the works for me! Its also excellent for reduce hair shedding and for women that bald spot on their hair line .</li>
            <li> I would have given the product 5 stars but I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to do so. It&#x27;s been about a week I can see my hair thickening which is defiantly a plus I have really thin hair. The pills are easy to swallow definitely a +++. Also no break outs and no dark urine like I&#x27;ve heard other hair vitamins cause. So far I&#x27;m in love can&#x27;t wait to check my progress after the first bottle!</li>
            <li> Best product ever. The pills work wonders!  The doesn&#x27;t get much butter is the best moisturizer!!!! The deep conditioner is heaven in a bottle.  Hair will feel like a babies bottom.</li>
            <li> I am in love with these vitamins. I suffered from alopecia when I was a child and I havent had a rapid hair growth in years. My hair has been at about shoulder length for the past three years until I started taking the Manechoice supplement. My hair is half way down my back now and im back on track with quick hair growth finally. I&#x27;ve tried biotin pills from CVS like every girl has experimented with, but I didnt get the results I want. This Is a product I would refer to anyone who is looking to get the ball rolling with their hair growth.</li>
            <li> The mane choice is the absolute best hair, skin, and nails vitamin. I&#x27;ve recieved many compliments on my growth and I can&#x27;t help but tell people about the mane choice.  shipping is fast !  And if need to communicate with owner she responds very quickly .</li>
            <li> I tried these vitamins to help with postpartum shedding around my edges. My hair fell out in clumps after having my baby! I started with the two month supply, was consistent with my hair care, and I&#x27;ve seen amazing results. No more thin and short, but thick and luscious edges are back. It&#x27;s only a matter of time before my hair around the perimeter catches up with the rest of my length. Amazon is great, but I also recommend going directly to the website to purchase as they are a bit cheaper. Thanks Courtney! Great product! Can&#x27;t wait to try others!</li>
            <li> I started taking the pills 4 months ago and I noticed that my hair has become thicker and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I use it while drinking a lot of water and trying to eat healthy as well because the results are more noticeable in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it strongly if you think your hair cannot grow... because it can !!!</li>
            <li> Believe me when I tell you that these vitamins are awesome and really work! I have been taking Manetabolism healthy hair vitamins from the Mane Choice since April 2014 and I&#x27;m seeing great results. After taking a Biotin supplement for years and barely seeing any results I decided to try a new product. I started seeing ads for the Mane Choice and HairFinity and I decided to go with the Mane Choice because they had real people giving real reviews and not a lot of celebrity spokesman. When I started taking the supplements my hair was just over my shoulders and I got my ends trimmed after the first month so I didn&#x27;t see much progress but now my hair is just above my bra strap. The sides of my hair have never been even and now they are going past my collarbone The sides of my hair have never been even and now they are both reaching past my collarbone, I&#x27;m also seeing new growth around my edges. I&#x27;ve recommended this product to all of my family and friends who are interested in hair growth and retention. I&#x27;ve also sent them before and after pictures. I&#x27;m constantly promoting the product because it works.</li>
            <li> absolutely LOVE this product. This is my 5th bottle and i have seen so much growth and thickness in my hair. I did my big chop December 2013, and started using these in April 2014. The results are amazing!!! My hair grows like crazy. I have never seen my hair in such a healthy condition. I have recommended these pills to two other family members and they love them as well. I have type 4c hair, and these pills are like magic. You will not be disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these vitamins for about 5 months now. They are the best vitamins I have ever taken for hair. I did the big chop and was so afraid to wear my hair out. After takin Manetabolism my hair grew soooooo much thicker, stronger and healthier. I even put many of my friends on to the vitamins and they are also very satisfied.  I am so happy to be using this product. I love them. You have a customer for life!</li>
            <li> I purchased these vitamins a month ago because I was really tired of having little no growth with my natural hair. Within the first 2 weeks I saw growth with my hair and my nails ( i mean seriously my nails grew like weeds!) I most definitely suggest that if you are looking for a good hair growth supplement that you purchase Manetabolism! I know i&#x27;ll continue to use them! My natural hair loves them &amp; I do too!</li>
            <li> This product actually works. My crown was breaking off horribly and it was the slowest growing part of my hair. Now it&#x27;s growing like weeds. I also had brittle thin nails. Now those are also stronger and longer than ever before!</li>
            <li> i am now on my second bottle and cant wait to but my third and fourth month. I saw results after only two weeks !</li>
            <li> So at first I started off with Hairinfinity &amp; it was horrible. My hair texture started to change from fine to really course, so I stopped taking them. A friend introduced me to the manechoice voice, and ever since that day I&#x27;ve been taking them. My hair is getting thicker and longer as the days progress &amp; I&#x27;m also seeing my length come back. No changing of hair texture, acne, etc. Get you some Manechoice!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using these pills August 17. I am not a natural person so I perm my hair 2 times out of a year. And I must say these pills are one of a kind. I&#x27;ve tried everything to start growing my hair back. I was referred by a friend of mines to use these pills and I&#x27;m in love with them. When I get my money up, I want to order the deep conditioner and the butter cream. Who&#x27;s ever reading these reviews, this is not a scam! Your hair actually grows from these products. Try them out and you would see the difference.</li>
            <li> I purchased these pills about a month ago. I am pleased to announce that i have fallen in love with  the results that i have seen thus far. i must admit i was hesitate to try them at first. I am currently on my second bottle. Not only have the results blown me away but I have also seen an increase in my energy level as well. I feel like a spokes person for these pills at times. I have shared my story about how healthy, stronger, and thicker my hair has gotten to everyone I come across. I must say that this is one of the best investments that i have made and i don&#x27;t mind spending the money to continue to have energy and healthy hair. You should try!! Trust me when I say you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I started using these vitamins in July because I was tired of being in the awkward stage of my natural hair journey. The most amazing thing was I had just colored my hair and by August I had 1 1/2 of new growth, which means my roots were back dark again. I love this product and I swear faithfully by the results.</li>
            <li> I Recently Just Order These Pills And I Can Already See Growth. I Love Them Already!!</li>
            <li> Where should I start about the Manetabolism Vitamins? Well, about 2 years ago, I decided to cut my relaxed hair into a really short style to begin regrowth as my hair had gotten damaged. However, I found my hair not to be growing much. As of last year I decided I wanted to make the transition to natural hair. After much research I found out about Hair finity and decided to give them a try, I took these vitamins from September until early this year. I stopped because I felt as though I was spending my money but wasn&#x27;t seeing the progress I would like. I kept searching but found nothing until I was looking through a friends Instagram and saw her wonderful comments about the Manetabolism  Vitamins. From that day until now I have been taking this vitamins and let me tell you, these are nothing short of &#x27;the truth&#x27; for hair growth. Its been about six months and my hair has just been growingggg, I wonder what my length would be if I had initially started with them. Not only is my hair growing but it is VERY thick. I&#x27;ve recommended these vitamins to about 3 people thus far and would keep recommending them. @Courtney thank you for sharing such greatness with the world, especially me as I am on a mission for long healthy natural hair :)</li>
            <li> I took the vitamins for about a week and 1/2.  I know that wasn&#x27;t enough time to notice any change and I didn&#x27;t. But I did notice some breakage with my nails. I was taking two a day and I should have dropped down to 1. I&#x27;ll restart it again at the beginning of the year.  I&#x27;ll just take one a day until they are all gone. My hair is extremely damaged from a quick weave with glue. I don&#x27;t know if it will help at all, but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> So glad I found The Mane Choice!! I can honestly say these pills are worth every penny. I&#x27;m on my 2nd bottle &amp; not only has these pills made my hair longer but also thicker (which I really needed). If you want healthy longer fuller hair you should definitely give these pills a try. It&#x27;s only $25 on the website (themanechoice.com) I will be ordering a 6 mth supply next 😁 ...you can also look at their IG @TheManeChoice for pictures.</li>
            <li> I loooooove these pills. Im on my 3rd bottle now and i just love how full my hair is. It has also grown back to what it used to be after i cut almost 6 inches off a year ago. I LOVE them.</li>
            <li> These pills do wonders for most. Even though I haven&#x27;t experienced what others experienced I do want to say that I have seen growth within 2 wks of taking the vitamins. I believe not only do you have to take the pills consistently but you have to drink lots of water along with eat healthy. I also do recommend that you wear protective styles while taking the pills to experience hair growth. All things I haven&#x27;t been doing consistently but will def start bc I too would like to have long flowing thick hair like the owner.  Those who are afraid of breakouts I recommend that you drink lots of water. More water than you are use to drinking. These vitamins have also made my nails grow quickly which I never had prior to taking the vitamins. Even when I took a break from taking the vitamins I still experienced rapid nail growth. I def do recommend this product and recommend that you purchase it from the actual site because it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> I just started taking these vitamins and I&#x27;m in love. Not only is my hair feeling healthy but I feel overall energized and happy as well. Thanks manechoice your products are fantastic:)</li>
            <li> I have been taking these vitamins for 4 months now and I just love the result. I started out taking another kind of vitamins but it was breaking me out, so that&#x27;s why I switched to the Mane.... I have yet to have one Breakout but I received extreme growth from this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m recently natural...I tried EVERYTHING FOR MY HAIR.........NO HELP UNTIL I PURCHASED The mane choice vitamins. Finally I have retention....growth...health.....I love these vitamins.</li>
            <li> I loooove these pills!!  I was really interested in making my hair thicker and longer! I saw the reviews and decided to at least order one bottle, im so glad I did! Let me tell you my hair is fine and really want my edges to be fuller I noticed thickness in the first 11 days! You have to take progression pics or it will be hard to tell, they are&lt;br /&gt;Easy to digest and I make sure I eat before hand.even my husbans noticed lol so my next purchase ill be getting 4 bottles ..two for me and two for my hubby!! Fyi my hair is relaxed too..works just fine!! Thank you manechoice i cant wait to see how my hair changes!! I will be adding shampoo and conditioner! ! Every one should try it!!</li>
            <li> Great product! On my second jar will be ordering more</li>
            <li> I bought and started them back in July. Although. Even though  I didn&#x27;t take them faithfully nor drink tons of water I measured an inch of growth! My hair was softer and thicker. People whom I hadn&#x27;t seen in a while commented that it had grown and looks fuller!  I have a second bottle that I will be starting soon. I&#x27;ll also be purchasing other products. I can&#x27;t wait to get my hands on the hair straightening products!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVED this product!!!! I had been trying to grow my hair out for 6 years now, and it seemed like nothing had been working...until I found out about this product! I saved up money to buy my first bottle, and in the month that I used it up, my hair had grown more than it has been the past 6 years! I still have some breakage, so I&#x27;m hoping that if I continue with this, it will completely go away!</li>
            <li> Been using these pills for six months. Between May and Aug my hair went from mid back to 5 inches from my tailbone. Magical.</li>
            <li> just finished my first bottle and I&#x27;ve noticed my hair has gotten a lot fuller and thicker! my hair is naturally fine and limp,so in super excited! will post another review after my second bottle!</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering these pills. And I can really say that they really work and are the best!</li>
            <li> These pills work it made my hair grow. Also my mom hair grew and she had trouble with her hair.</li>
            <li> Best hair, skin and nails pills hands down. I got the 5 month supply and 4 for my sister and my hair has grown 2 inches so far in 2 month, it&#x27;s also thicker and healthier. My nails have also grown so much and they are stronger. My eyelashes are growing long to and I think these pills are responsible for it since I don&#x27;t do or take anything else. Thank god I found these pills cause they are amazing if you haven&#x27;t already got your hands on some I advise you do ASAP if you want longer healthier hair and nails</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these vitamins. I am currently on my fourth bottle and have seen so much improvement in the thickness and texture of my hair and natural curls. I have also noticed growth in my nails. I posted a picture of my growth on my social media site and people were really impressed. Anytime someone asks me what I am doing for my hair, I tell them I take Manetabolism. I had tried hairfinity for a month and half and noticed breakouts...which I never have. That deterred me from them. Then I found out about Manetabolism and have been a fan ever since. I simply take 2 at a time and try to drink water throughout the day. Thanks Mane Choice!</li>
            <li> from everyone pictures ive seen everyone seems very happy with this product and seeing tremendous results i know it works and i cant wait to try it out and see for myself plus all i hear is good feedback</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t do reviews but for this product I had to. I have many posts on these vitamins so I decided to give these a try. I have try many other hair vitamins but they either did not work at all or  made my face break out even with the consumption of more water daily as recommended. I started taking these vitamins on July 16,2014 and I brought the 2 month supply which I am glad that I did.I can honestly say that after taking them for two months my hair has thickened up and grew at least 2 inches(Yes!!!) which is faster than my regular normal rate of growth.But a true testament that these work is because I suffer with anxiety,something that I have been dealing with since I joined the military in 2007-2011 and still suffered with. My anxiety causes me to literally pull out the back of my hair so it has been short/to bald for years and I could never even to get it so grow. I would do full sew-ins to get it to grow but I would just pull the hair from that which was already not enough to be braided.But with this last sew-in I received when I started taking these vitamins came a loose from the new growth and not be pulling my hair out in the back. As I still suffer with this, I will still take these vitamins to grow my hair healthy.Cant wait to place my next order!!!</li>
            <li> I have nothing but good things to say about this product. I followed Courtney and Manechoice IG account for over 6 months before actually purchasing. I have never had a problem with shipping when I ordered and received very promptly. My mother and I use the product it has help with overall thickness as well as growth for both of us. I was curious about some of the negative reviews I have read and just like any product. It is not an exact science and will not work for everybody. When you have a small percentage of people that it dont work for it is likely allergans or genetics to propriety blends in the product. I&#x27;m not sure. I say that to say dont let it deter you from trying it. Everyone is unique so what dont work for someone may work for you. Blessings</li>
            <li> I tried these vitamins early July because I&#x27;ve been seeing people post progress pictures on Instagram. To be honest, I was a little hesitant to spend my money on them, (I&#x27;ve tried other vitamins, but didn&#x27;t really get the results that I wanted) but I did anyway and I am so glad I did. The first month, I gained a little over an inch of growth. I immediately ordered a second bottle because I knew that I couldn&#x27;t go another month without taking them. In August, I received another inch, so I ended up ordering 18 bottles from their site. Yes, 18. It is now almost the end of September and my hair is 2 1/2 inches past my starting length before I took these vitamins (I gave myself a small trim). I am so glad that I gave in and tried these vitamins. Now I know that I will be bra strap length by December. My ultimate goal length is hip length and now I know that I will reach hip length quicker than I would have if I had never tried these vitamins. One more thing, I had no breakouts. Drink tons of water and that should solve the problem. I love these vitamins.</li>
            <li> I have had such a hard time trying to get my hair to grow at even a normal rate. I heard about the mane choice via Instagram and ordered 1 bottle to start. After 3 weeks of taking the mane choice I measured my hair. I saw about a inch different in length! After I finished my first bottle, I orders my second! I love this product and I have no complaints &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> These pills really do promotes growth and you will start to see growth within a week but the pills are cheaper from the website</li>
            <li> These vitamins are awesome I&#x27;m on my 5th bottle and have noticed a significant amount of growth. While in between I&#x27;ve cut my hair and even had braids that grew out within weeks while taking them. I highly recommend these vitamins and have not had any issues of breakouts at all.</li>
            <li> Great Product!!! I am transitioning from a relaxer to natural. Prevents hair from shedding and I have seen growth in a short period of time. This product is worth a try!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just went natural 6 months ago and I was really tired of my TWA phase. I was going to try Hairfinity but I read too many bad reviews and being a college student I really could not afford it. But I read about Manetabolism and decided to give it a try. I used it all of the summer and it kept my hair in AMAZING shape. Being a lifeguard and work in the heat all summer and swimming usually my hair does not like cooperating with me and ultimately breaks more. But I experienced reduced shedding and my hair felt a lot stronger and actually GREW! Im really ready to order some more! TRY THEM TODAY!!!!</li>
            <li> This review is from: Manetabolism Healthy Hair Vitamin (30 day supply) (Misc.)&lt;br /&gt;I heard about this product on instagram and i did a alot of research on it. And when I say every review I read was nothing but positivity!. I ordered a 2 month supply last thursday and recieved them on the following monday. And I started taking the pills the very same day. So fastword a week laster and I can alreaduy see a change in my hair. It feels and looks healthier and it is now retaing alot of moisture. It really is living up to all the hype. I cant wait until I am finish with both bottles and order more.</li>
            <li> Finally something that truly works... well worth the price. Love love love this!!! It is definitely a staple product for me.</li>
            <li> I had hopes but not high hopes after pretty much maintaining the same length hair for 3 years. Not only after a week after receiving my hair vitamins not only did I notice the growth in my edges but the rapid growth in my nails as well. I will continue on with the #manesociety because thus far this product is a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> This product is great! I just got my second bottle on Saturday. My mom put me on to these when I started my natural hair journey. I&#x27;m excited to see more results!!!</li>
            <li> These pills are amazing... No break outs and they do just what they say they will do.. My hair is growing so much thicker and healthier not to mention the amazing growth I&#x27;m having with my nails, they would always break before they would get any length and now I find myself clipping them down often (not a bad thing) I love this product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products to get real results but I was never satisfied. After trying the Manetabolism pills I was amazed and extremely happy. My edges haven&#x27;t grown in the past 2 years and they grew in. My next order is going to be 3 bottles, shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;m on a mission.</li>
            <li> I love this product I started using this may 25th 2014 after I did my &amp;#34;big chop&amp;#34; and my hair has grown tremendously. I will continue to use this product because I do see great results.</li>
            <li> These pills really work. Im taking them now and my hair is longer and healthy. I recommend buying its worth your money!</li>
            <li> Please whatever you do, do not buy these vitamins! They contain wayyyyy to much vitamin A and if you didn&#x27;t know, consuming too much vitamin A can cause serious health issues. After 4 days if taking I&#x27;ve had several vitamin A overdose symptoms.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I can&#x27;t attest to hair growth right now, as I&#x27;m protective styling while taking my vitamins. But... my skin! Ermegerd! I&#x27;ve always had a terrible terrible problem with acne and breakouts around my time of the month. Baybeeeee... this month I got 1... 1... pimple! Do you know how excited that has made me? I&#x27;ve tried so many things to get this stupid acne under control and I think I finally found my solution. Of course I wash my face a lot, but no more than normal.im convinced that the vitamins are the reason my skin is clear right now.</li>
            <li> I love this,  no break outs, thicker,  fuller, healthier hair</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say that I liked this product. I tested this out for about a month and I have not seen any noticeable results in hair growth or energy boosting. I wish it did what the description states  it provides but unfortunately not. This product did not help me out in anyway.</li>
            <li> I purchase and use this  for about  4 months.Iam hoping  that it will work for me but nothing happen Iam losing my hair now and Im losing hope.I just waste my money buying this product.Better try another product !</li>
            <li> so far so good seeing alot of thickness and growth</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any results using this product. Back to hairfinity I go.</li>
            <li> I am a vegetarian, so when I saw the list of proprietary ingredients which included shark bones, I was very disappointed. Please state non-vegetarian formula somewhere on the label. The ingredients listed where okay.</li>
            <li> I am VERY disappointed. This product has done NOTHING for my hair.</li>
            <li> Certainly saw thickness changes but not insane growth like I&#x27;ve seen in photos. Zinc and iron worked out much better for a lot less cheaper.</li>
            <li> Love it! I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months, after trying hairfinity for 3 months and I&#x27;ve seen more growth using these for 1 1/2 months than with hairfinity. I also haven&#x27;t experienced as much shedding and thinning of my hair. Plus my nails are growing like weeds!</li>
            <li> These hair supplements are perfect for me. The first month I took these, I did experience some break out on my face during the second week. I used my acne go to product and remedied this. Since then, I haven&#x27;t experienced any other breakouts and I have been using this product for over two months now. My hair has retained at least two inches of growth and still growing. I love this product. I plan to use this for the entire year of 2015 and then in December do a comparison of my hair to December 2014.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost done my first bottle and yesterday was the first time since I started them that I had my hair blown out and straightened since I started them.....wow!!!! I&#x27;m truly impressed at the growth I see in just under a month!!! I will be purchasing again!</li>
