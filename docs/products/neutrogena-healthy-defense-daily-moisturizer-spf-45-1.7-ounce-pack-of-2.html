    <ol>
            <li>It is GREAT!</li>
            <li>It is also an excellent sun screen and my face has not been sunburned since using this.</li>
            <li>One excellent product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This seems like a very good product.  </li>
            <li>or you&#x27;re just looking for a good moisturizer, BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>I am so happy I thought of checking on Amazon for this product.  </li>
            <li>Good product skin protection</li>
            <li>but I just put it on a cotton ball and smooth into my skin and works good!</li>
            <li>I need moisturizer and sunblock, and it&#x27;s nice when they are together</li>
            <li>, covers well and does not have an overpowering smell, which is nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I use Dudu-Osun African black soap for my melasma as well (awesome, awesome, AWESOME soap, by the way), and when I applied this moisturizer right after, my face looks sooooooooo good!</li>
            <li>I have tried this under my makeup, as a moisturizer alone, or on top of another moisturizer and it is just fabulous!!  </li>
            <li>This is the first moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever used that felt great on my face/neck.</li>
            <li>BUT, if I find something with more spf</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I wanted more protection than SPF30, but the SPF50 felt more like suntan lotion than moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Amongst the several moisturizers I&#x27;ve used, this is the one that I like best.</li>
            <li>It feels more like sunscreen than moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Our dermatologist gave him a sample of Neutrogena Healthy Defense to try b/c</li>
            <li>I will find alternative products and will not purchase any more Neutrogena until their animal testing is stopped.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy or waxy on my face, and I never have to use it more than once a day, unless I want to reapply from being out in the sun.</li>
            <li>I have this set up on Amazon to be automatically sent every six months, but just to make sure I have a backlog on hand in case</li>
            <li>but their moisturizers make me break out and most don&#x27;t have SPF.  </li>
            <li>I just can&#x27;t handle the sun much because of my Rosacea, so I am thrilled to have discovered this cream!</li>
            <li>This product is pretty good - I have been using it for about 3 months now.</li>
            <li>I have been using Neutrogena products for many years and they are fine, but I just found out they still conduct animal testing (I was under the impression that they did not).  </li>
            <li>It goes on so light, you&#x27;d think it&#x27;s oil free!</li>
            <li>It stays on for many hours and washes off quickly.</li>
            <li>have been using this for a little over a month, and have been very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice high SPF but doesn&#x27;t feel like a sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used up a full tube yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have very dry sensitive skin, this works great!</li>
            <li>I just received a half-used tube of this from my sister (she buys lots of makeup stuff:) and since I have rosacea I figured it wouldn&#x27;t work for me - my skin is so sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a classic case of combination skin and most good sunscreens are either far to greasy or don&#x27;t offer enough protection.    </li>
            <li>The moisturizer itself isn&#x27;t greasy and smears on your face well, absorbs pretty quickly and doesn&#x27;t make your face oily or greasy.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much of this to cover your face and neck.  </li>
            <li>So upon scouring the house, the car and my bag for it, I found this Neutrogena Healthy Defense daily moisturizer untinted SPF 45 lotion.</li>
            <li>They are not necessary and much better alternatives exist.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it, I had a burning and stinging sensation on the skin of my face.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this one now for three years, and it is consistently reliable.</li>
            <li>and I was worried at first but</li>
            <li>Its thick and not greasy, works great under makeup, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been moisturizing my face/neck and pretty much</li>
            <li>after using it for a few days I love it!</li>
            <li>It does really well under makeup too.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I use this during summer when my skin feels less dry and it works great.</li>
            <li>My face has been much smoother as well with the help on new face wash and this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>It is clean and light, but hard to find.</li>
            <li>Somehow, I lost my CVS brand SPF 100 lotion (which is what I normally use because I have melasma that makes me look like I have a mustache--I&#x27;m a woman by the way).</li>
            <li>As long as I was my face every evening, there are no breakouts or red patches and the skin I wanted to preserve looks better than it ever has.     </li>
            <li>In effort to preserve my 25 year old skin while being wrinkle/cancer free for years to come, I wanted to use a daily moisturizer with broad spectrum (UVA/UVB) protection.     </li>
            <li>Not only does it not sting, but if gives my face such a nice texture and keeps it moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li>I am 39 1/2 and live in Phoenix, AZ (\\&quot;Valley of the Sun\\&quot;.)  </li>
            <li>But for a person with melasma, who has to change their whole lifestyle to prevent the further darkening of skin, you really need spf70+, plus a sun hat&lt;</li>
            <li>It is white when it goes on, but rubs in to clear right away.</li>
            <li>I was not able to determine from the description here on Amazon which this SPF 45 item would be so I had to wait until it was delivered to be sure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap on Amazon for pack of 2, almost half price from store, if you could get at a subscription price.     </li>
            <li>It did clear my acne</li>
            <li>I went from a blemish or 2 to my face completely covered.  </li>
            <li>My skin is pretty dry and this product moisturize my skin without begin greasy.</li>
            <li>Small in size to easy to travel with as well.</li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and dry skin, and have been moisturizing since age 10 (in my 50s now!).</li>

            <li> The dry patches on his temples are gone and the brown spots have faded.  </li>
            <li> Every few years I would need to switch moisturizers, because they either stopped working, or started making me break out in various blotches, pimples or red marks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;SO, overall, I do like the product, I&#x27;ll use it everyday and probably will buy it when I run out of it.</li>
            <li> In a culture of hype and empty promises; this product does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> ACS does not endorse any specific product, Neutrogena pays a royalty to the ACS for the use of its logo.\\&quot; :/   </li>
            <li> It left my skin irritated, and I don&#x27;t usually have irritated skin.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my skin is very particular when it comes to moisturizers.</li>
            <li> comes in 1.7 fl oz.---Expensive for the small amount of moisturizer you get, especially if you plan on using it everyday, which I do</li>
            <li> It looks a little thick</li>
            <li> You can try and let the manufacturer know as I did, but not sure it will matter.</li>
            <li> Then, I saw, in small letters, at the bottom of the package:</li>
            <li> it is not absorbed by the skin and by the end of the day it becomes a dusty film over the skin.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have known hoe thick</li>
            <li> It can be dry, it can be oily, it can be sensitive, it can have terrible breakouts.</li>
            <li> A few months ago, I was having hormonal problems again and decided to buy an expensive acne kit from Murad.  </li>
            <li> I used to have terrible acne and nearly every lotion I tried was too harsh or too moist.</li>
            <li> Alas, there is Neutrogena to the rescue!</li>
            <li> I read a review that said this moisturizer is expensive.  </li>
            <li> Its a shame that it&#x27;s so expensive though!</li>
            <li> I paid almost $50 for the moisturizer that made me break out horribly and it didn&#x27;t even have SPF.  </li>

            <li> Somehow, I lost my CVS brand SPF 100 lotion (which is what I normally use because I have melasma that makes me look like I have a mustache--I&#x27;m a woman by the way). So upon scouring the house, the car and my bag for it, I found this Neutrogena Healthy Defense daily moisturizer untinted SPF 45 lotion. I think I might&#x27;ve taken it from my mom when I visited her last. Thank goodness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I use Dudu-Osun African black soap for my melasma as well (awesome, awesome, AWESOME soap, by the way), and when I applied this moisturizer right after, my face looks sooooooooo good! The moisturizer itself isn&#x27;t greasy and smears on your face well, absorbs pretty quickly and doesn&#x27;t make your face oily or greasy. It also doesn&#x27;t leave white streaks on your face. My face glows like I&#x27;ve never seen before. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) comes in 1.7 fl oz.---Expensive for the small amount of moisturizer you get, especially if you plan on using it everyday, which I do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) spf45---for a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; person, spf45 is enough, I guess. But for a person with melasma, who has to change their whole lifestyle to prevent the further darkening of skin, you really need spf70+, plus a sun hat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO, overall, I do like the product, I&#x27;ll use it everyday and probably will buy it when I run out of it. BUT, if I find something with more spf and/or a bigger size, I&#x27;ll probably buy that instead.</li>
            <li> I used to have terrible acne and nearly every lotion I tried was too harsh or too moist. After several visits to the dermatologist, and my acne gone, I stumbled on this lotion. It is GREAT! Moisturizes just enough and gives all day protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> I just received a half-used tube of this from my sister (she buys lots of makeup stuff:) and since I have rosacea I figured it wouldn&#x27;t work for me - my skin is so sensitive. Not only does it not sting, but if gives my face such a nice texture and keeps it moisturized all day long. I just can&#x27;t handle the sun much because of my Rosacea, so I am thrilled to have discovered this cream!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is clean and light, but hard to find. I think they are discontinuing it. I wanted more protection than SPF30, but the SPF50 felt more like suntan lotion than moisturizer. You can try and let the manufacturer know as I did, but not sure it will matter.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good - I have been using it for about 3 months now. My skin is pretty dry and this product moisturize my skin without begin greasy.</li>
            <li> In effort to preserve my 25 year old skin while being wrinkle/cancer free for years to come, I wanted to use a daily moisturizer with broad spectrum (UVA/UVB) protection.     Unfortunately my skin is very particular when it comes to moisturizers. It can be dry, it can be oily, it can be sensitive, it can have terrible breakouts. I&#x27;m a classic case of combination skin and most good sunscreens are either far to greasy or don&#x27;t offer enough protection.    Alas, there is Neutrogena to the rescue! I put this stuff on every morning after washing my face. It goes on so light, you&#x27;d think it&#x27;s oil free! It does really well under makeup too. As long as I was my face every evening, there are no breakouts or red patches and the skin I wanted to preserve looks better than it ever has.     If you&#x27;re a skeptic with oily/combo skin or you&#x27;re just looking for a good moisturizer, BUY THIS PRODUCT! You&#x27;ll be thanking yourself for days, months and year to come.</li>
            <li> Amongst the several moisturizers I&#x27;ve used, this is the one that I like best. It&#x27;s cheap on Amazon for pack of 2, almost half price from store, if you could get at a subscription price.     It stays on for many hours and washes off quickly.</li>
            <li> I wanted a moisturizer with sunscreen.  It feels more like sunscreen than moisturizer.  I will keep looking.</li>
            <li> This product works. What else can I say. In a culture of hype and empty promises; this product does what it claims to do. Just recently my husband was fishing in the Gulf of Mexico...all day. He should have been fried. He was not. Our dermatologist gave him a sample of Neutrogena Healthy Defense to try b/c he had some pre-cancerous legions removed. This product not only protects but it also changes the skin. The dry patches on his temples are gone and the brown spots have faded.  No hype!!!!</li>
            <li> I have normal to dry skin. I use this during summer when my skin feels less dry and it works great.</li>
            <li> I am 39 1/2 and live in Phoenix, AZ (\\&quot;Valley of the Sun\\&quot;.)  I need moisturizer and sunblock, and it&#x27;s nice when they are together so I can save a minute or so every morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for a little over a month, and have been very happy with it.  I also use the Neutrogena eye cream.  You don&#x27;t need very much of this to cover your face and neck.  I haven&#x27;t used up a full tube yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seems like a very good product.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> What a deal! I am so happy I thought of checking on Amazon for this product.  I got two tubes at a substantial savings!</li>
            <li> it is not absorbed by the skin and by the end of the day it becomes a dusty film over the skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Neutrogena products for many years and they are fine, but I just found out they still conduct animal testing (I was under the impression that they did not).  I will find alternative products and will not purchase any more Neutrogena until their animal testing is stopped.  They are not necessary and much better alternatives exist.</li>
            <li> I like Neutrogena products.   I picked this product because it had SPF 45 and because the package mentions the ACS (American Cancer Society), so I thought that the ACS endorse this product.  Then, I saw, in small letters, at the bottom of the package: \\&quot;The ACS does not endorse any specific product, Neutrogena pays a royalty to the ACS for the use of its logo.\\&quot; :/   The first time I tried it, I had a burning and stinging sensation on the skin of my face.  It left my skin irritated, and I don&#x27;t usually have irritated skin.  So, I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive and dry skin, and have been moisturizing since age 10 (in my 50s now!). Every few years I would need to switch moisturizers, because they either stopped working, or started making me break out in various blotches, pimples or red marks. I&#x27;ve been using this one now for three years, and it is consistently reliable. It is white when it goes on, but rubs in to clear right away. It isn&#x27;t greasy or waxy on my face, and I never have to use it more than once a day, unless I want to reapply from being out in the sun. It is also an excellent sun screen and my face has not been sunburned since using this. I have this set up on Amazon to be automatically sent every six months, but just to make sure I have a backlog on hand in case they quit making it. One tube last about 3-4 months.</li>
            <li> I have very dry sensitive skin, this works great! It looks a little thick and I was worried at first but after using it for a few days I love it! It has a nice high SPF but doesn&#x27;t feel like a sunscreen. Small in size to easy to travel with as well. My face has been much smoother as well with the help on new face wash and this moisturizer! I wish I would have known hoe thick it was before  I bought it, but I just put it on a cotton ball and smooth into my skin and works good!</li>
            <li> Good product skin protection</li>
            <li> I had been using this moisturizer (or the tinted SPF 30) for years since my dermatologist recommended it when I was having hormonal breakouts.  A few months ago, I was having hormonal problems again and decided to buy an expensive acne kit from Murad.  It didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I went from a blemish or 2 to my face completely covered.  I switched to the Ole Henriksen acne line.  It did clear my acne but their moisturizers make me break out and most don&#x27;t have SPF.  I decided to keep using the products but return to Neutrogena for my moisturizer.  I read a review that said this moisturizer is expensive.  I paid almost $50 for the moisturizer that made me break out horribly and it didn&#x27;t even have SPF.  I should have never stopped using Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I have tried this under my makeup, as a moisturizer alone, or on top of another moisturizer and it is just fabulous!!  One excellent product!</li>
            <li> Sunscreen and moisturizer in one!  Goes on well, covers well and does not have an overpowering smell, which is nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been moisturizing my face/neck and pretty much my entire body since I was 16. This is the first moisturizer that I&#x27;ve ever used that felt great on my face/neck. Its thick and not greasy, works great under makeup, too. Its a shame that it&#x27;s so expensive though!</li>
            <li> The SPF 30 version of this product comes in two varieties; tinted and untinted. I was not able to determine from the description here on Amazon which this SPF 45 item would be so I had to wait until it was delivered to be sure. It was untinted.</li>
