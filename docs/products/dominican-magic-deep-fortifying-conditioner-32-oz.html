            <li> problem with loss of hair, seems like it working with other products. Despite with differenent people says, hair won&#x27;t grow.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Not only does it smell good, it also leaves my hair soft and silky...why is it called dominican magic , anyway?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, it even works great on my legs as a shaving cream backup.</li>
            <li> Smells really good. Leaves my hair super soft and moisturizer and you can tell its well moisturizer because my hair has a lot of body once its dried. Not heavy at all. I really love this. I would definitely recommend this product to others</li>
            <li> If you hate coconut scent or are allergic,  stay away.  I have bleached blonde hair that goes through heat styling so I am always in need of moisture.  This deep conditioner is great. I tried it for the first time and it hydrated my tresses tremendously. Large container will last at least 6 months or more.</li>
            <li> Love it! I use it about twice a week and it makes my hair soft and it has a strong smell. Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to maintain a straight Brazilian virgin remy sew in. Although I have great quality hair, I was getting some fly aways. This conditioner got rid of all fly aways, and my hair was silky smooth without even blowdrying or straightening. I will be purchasing this product again, and I recommend it to all virgin remy lovers :)</li>
            <li> This product is just ok it doesn&#x27;t soften the hair as you would expect. I use it but I have to use another conditioner to soften my hair after using this product. The product made my hair feel a little dry after rinsing it out but if you use it with another conditioner that actually softens the hair it  will work out just fine.</li>
            <li> Heard about Dominican conditioners for years.  I saw a youtube video about this brand and had to try it.  I am sooo satisfied.  I ordered the mask as well.</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing again. This conditioner smells great and makes my hair full of life! My hair is looking like it used to.</li>
            <li> I thought I was going to like it because it left my hair soft, the first time. Then after I used it, it really didn&#x27;t work as well as the silicon mix that I normally use. It smells terrible.</li>
            <li> It smells very weird, its very heavy for my hair, i only used it twice, gave it to my mom she said it left her hair very oily. Guess it is not my kind of a conditioner.</li>
            <li> This smells sooo good! I use this once a week and have seen an improvement in my hair. I have natural hair and this makes my hair soft and manageable. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great and I have seen an improvement to the hair quality since using it, will continue to use</li>
            <li> All of the Dominican Magic products are wonder and they work so well with each other. It leaves my hair soft and bouncy.</li>
