            <li>My favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>This has a coconut smell and works better as a styling product.</li>
            <li>it will make the top of your head look greasy,</li>
            <li>You do not need much however, as the shampoo does a great job leaving conditioned.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This is so smooth!</li>
            <li>and I like Renpure so much better.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is just ok...</li>
            <li>It works great and leaves my hair vibrant all day.  </li>
            <li>The way my hair turns out is beautiful, shiny, and extremely soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and manageable and it smells great.</li>
            <li>The gelling/hardness will slowly smooth out to lovely luscious locks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it could be good for straight hair.</li>
            <li>Got here super fast and it smells great</li>
            <li>Not even islandy coconut strong.</li>
            <li>Just strong.</li>
            <li>and I got this particular kind because I wanted more shape to my curls with the use of the coconut oils&lt;</li>
            <li>allows hair to curl up without being weighted down by product, while still providing wonderful conditioning properties.</li>
            <li>I have fairly fine hair, and I can use this every day.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine, curly, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and my hair feels super soft after every use.</li>
            <li>Light weight and smells fabulous...</li>
            <li>Still looking for cheap organic</li>
            <li>that it&#x27;s sulfate free too</li>
            <li>Works great for extra curly hair</li>
            <li>Instead I got flowery cheap musk.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give it away to someone who doesn&#x27;t mind cheap perfumey</li>
            <li>Leave-in conditioner is light weight, not greasy</li>
            <li>I really liked that because it gave me a true sense of how much I used.</li>
            <li>Oh yes, the price is excellent and  I need very little after using the Renpure Cr&amp;egrave;me Cowash Cleansing ConditionerShampoo.</li>
            <li>The Redmonds&#x27; Renpure hair care line is awesome because they do not use harsh chemicals and there is NO animal testing!</li>
            <li>Ok, this is the real deal!</li>
            <li>I was expecting a rich coconut scent.  </li>
            <li>Love this product so much!</li>
            <li>Soaks right in and makes my hair super shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>it leaves my hai soft and smells amazing</li>
            <li>is something I really like being able to do.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this leave in conditioner I really did.</li>
            <li>use one full pump for y shortish-medium hair, or so.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and my curls are nice as well</li>
            <li>I was using Lush Cosmetics &amp;#34;Coolaulin&amp;#34; and that conditioner is the best I have EVER run across and made my naturally curly hair so sweet and light smelling and soft.</li>
            <li>The bottles are very sturdy and I love the pump since squeezing a bottle with my arthritic hands isn&#x27;t fun.</li>
            <li>It is not heavy, smells great and makes my curls soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First I like to say I&#x27;m from the Caribbean and have really think curly hair which gets easy dryied out.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, wonderful smell, and light enough to leave in without pulling down your hair.</li>
            <li>This product smells good, is not greasy, left my hair smooth and very soft, I may try the shampoo when mine runs out.</li>
            <li>My hair feels great, and it isn&#x27;t too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I started with the leave in conditioner, then  used 100% coconut oil (the kind you can cook with), and a curl pudding, plus the jelly as the last step.</li>
            <li>has a nice smell and does the same thing as wen</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s effective qualities ; slip, moisture,longevity, because I ended up right back in the shower washing it out.  </li>
            <li>Great leave-in to tame fly-always....</li>
            <li>Not as much coconut as I&#x27;d like, but still clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>and it is beautiful and straight (little bit of wave toward ends)</li>
            <li>I just think that it is not the right product for my hair</li>
            <li>Not only is it gentle on my newly bleached hair, it smells great.</li>
            <li>This is my first time buying any renpure products and I am switching from OGX Moroccan oil and cream to have a more all natural product.</li>
            <li>I really like this product it leaves my hair very nice not weighted down</li>
            <li>Goes very well wth the coconut pudding love the way it makes myhair smell and feels so soft</li>
            <li>I am currently starting to transition from heat damaged hair to completely natural (&amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34;), so I thought this product would be good because it doesn&#x27;t contain the things I don&#x27;t want in my hair products.</li>
            <li>I have thin curly hair and this product is absolutely wonderful, amazing looking curls without leaving it sticky and yucky like other products!</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s a big bottle</li>
            <li>and most of it was left in my roots</li>
            <li>My daughter and I tried many different shampoos and conditioners from Renpure line.  </li>
            <li>My hair actually feels better WITHOUT this product.</li>
            <li>This is the first leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li>The price is definitely a steal :)</li>
            <li>I really think it has contributed to the health of my hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stronger and more structured than it used to be, and it actually holds curls now, when it didn&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like I have to use other products with it for my hair to nice and behave.  </li>
            <li>I find that this actually feels like it is absorbing into my hair, instead of just laying on the top and feeling greasy like WEN did a lot.  </li>
            <li>Works very well with the cleansing pudding being used first.</li>
            <li>I am trying to take better care of my hair and grow it long</li>
            <li>Keeps my dry hair moisturized, love the smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like a whole new head of hair!!</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li>The Renpure products have really changed my life.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>: I&#x27;m not crazy about the masculine fragrance, although it wears off after your hair dries.</li>
            <li>Has preservatives in it, I really wish it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>and it is really silky and shiny since using this</li>
            <li>I use it every time I get out of the shower whether I am doing it straight or curly.</li>
            <li>After using the coconut cleansing conditioner (which I really like)</li>
            <li>This product is a real treat for my hair.</li>
            <li>Everything I been looking for and a leave in conditioner and the price is within an reasonable price.</li>
            <li>It depends on how much you put in.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like sticking my whole hand in a tub of conditioner</li>
            <li>Either a sulfate free or regular detergent shampoo will remove the product.</li>
            <li>It does make your hair kind of stiff, but it does soften up as your hair dries.</li>
            <li>Mmmmmmm it smells better then expected!</li>
            <li>smells good and has some conditioning aspects, but didnt really like the harse texture and limp feeling it left in my hair.</li>
            <li>so I need to only use products without Sulfates and sodium chloride in order to properly maintain it, the Renpure line keeps my keratin nice, my curly thick hair smooth, and I feel like it&#x27;s just overall better for my hair and body.</li>
            <li>Another of my new faves in hair products!</li>
            <li>I think this is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ll be using it for every day!</li>
            <li>and I have to say every single positive review stands true.</li>
            <li>It was light for a leave in conditioner and left my hair soft though.</li>
            <li>That was one of the main reasons I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>This leave-in smells a little strong at first, but once it&#x27;s in your hair after a while you won&#x27;t notice it.</li>
            <li>and I had high hopes for this brand.</li>
            <li>A little thinner than I need it to be and most of the product is removed at the ends of my hair, while drying my hair with a towel&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very generous amount in the bottle, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This was a bit too heavy for my straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li>MADE MY HAIR VERY SOFT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky about hair products and normally buy professional products.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t weight down your hair or leave any noticeable residue while adding body, softness and light structure (hold).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll most likely use this up as a finishing product which will make it last a long time.</li>
            <li>As a leave-in it is too heavy for my fine</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a lot, but no need to skimp&lt;br /&gt;Rub hands together to smooth and apply (sometimes I apply a little Argan oil</li>
            <li>Smells vaguely of old man cologne.</li>
            <li>Made my mother&#x27;s hair just as soft as she wanted.</li>
            <li>After using this its soft and the curls are well formed with residual frizz.</li>
            <li>Would definitely buy again and use forever if I don&#x27;t find an organic nicer smelling product for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft, silky and shiny and never greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li>how soft it makes my hair.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this to someone with natural curls</li>
            <li>This just displaced my old leave-in conditioner I&#x27;d used for years.</li>
            <li>Eliminates frizz and keeps my curls soft for days.</li>
            <li>Just dont put it near your scalp</li>
            <li>I use it on my natural hair after a classing condition.</li>
            <li>Even your hand feel soft after use in my curl 3b</li>
            <li>Used a palm full which is average for me with my curly hair.</li>
            <li>After reading up on this type of silicone I discovered it does wash out particularly if you wash your hair daily as I do.</li>
            <li>The only thing I disliked is the strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li>a little more perfumey than I expected.  </li>
            <li>The smell is way too strong, for me at least.  </li>
            <li>All of them left our scalps dried out and very itchy after the first couple of times we started using these products.</li>
            <li>A big plus since I work in a dry, hot factory every day.</li>
            <li>I have fine thick (as in lots of it) hair of about shoulder length.</li>
            <li>I have a thick head of fine hair</li>
            <li>You only need a quarter sized dollop rubbed between your hands and applied lightly on the spots needing a little extra control.</li>
            <li>Ive only used it once so far</li>
            <li>I chose a humid and hot night to go out with my hair down, armed with hair holders in case my hair decided to turn against me as always.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for chemically-treated and dry hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves it firm which is great due to my frizzy thick hair type, I need it that way.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t dry out my hair completely which is why I&#x27;m giving it</li>
            <li>and it costs so much less then wen some of the wen scents smell like chemicals so much that it turned me off renpure</li>
            <li>Terrific leave in conditioner for long, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty bummed about this because it&#x27;s a big bottle gone to waste</li>
            <li>This is not a problem with normal conditioners, and by the time I got from one side to the other the beginning was tangled again.</li>
            <li>So I used less the next time, but it didn&#x27;t really moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly and very dry.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Either way, the conditioner is light, smells awesome, and it&#x27;s great with the pump instead of just a cap.</li>
            <li> The smell is really nice and it have a great texture.</li>
            <li> &amp;not in a good way</li>

            <li> Works just as good as Wen for me at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I put it in just out of the shower and it makes my hair smell wonderful and tangle free.  </li>

            <li> LOVED IT EVEN MORE THAN MY WEN</li>
            <li> I am 65 yrs.young and still loving my hair.  </li>
            <li> I liked the smell of it.</li>
            <li> but my hair looks just as nice</li>
            <li> Does not smell nice coconut, but like menthol.</li>
            <li> I love this product it has a nice slip and smells so good.  </li>
            <li> Super great.</li>
            <li> but I am super happy with it.</li>
            <li> So perfect for my natural curls</li>
            <li> This one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> it makes my hair look better and it smells nice.  </li>
            <li> The bottle came filled to the very top.</li>
            <li> I guess it is ok.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner....and trust me....</li>
            <li> LOVE the cleansing pudding tho and will be reviewing that as well.eviewing that as well.</li>
            <li> so when Wen was all I ordered this on Amazon and so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> and I love the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and</li>
            <li> and I have tried more hair products</li>
            <li> I love the smell</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> People were buying from you guys because you were affordable and better than Wen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got it then</li>
            <li> My hair feels drenched with moisture, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the formula.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> My favorite hair product.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> This has a coconut smell and works better as a styling product.</li>
            <li> it will make the top of your head look greasy,</li>
            <li> You do not need much however, as the shampoo does a great job leaving conditioned.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This is so smooth!</li>
            <li> and I like Renpure so much better.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is just ok...</li>
            <li> It works great and leaves my hair vibrant all day.  </li>
            <li> The way my hair turns out is beautiful, shiny, and extremely soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and manageable and it smells great.</li>
            <li> The gelling/hardness will slowly smooth out to lovely luscious locks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it could be good for straight hair.</li>
            <li> Got here super fast and it smells great</li>
            <li> Not even islandy coconut strong.</li>
            <li> Just strong.</li>
            <li> and I got this particular kind because I wanted more shape to my curls with the use of the coconut oils&lt;</li>
            <li> allows hair to curl up without being weighted down by product, while still providing wonderful conditioning properties.</li>
            <li> I have fairly fine hair, and I can use this every day.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine, curly, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and my hair feels super soft after every use.</li>
            <li> Light weight and smells fabulous...</li>
            <li> Still looking for cheap organic</li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s sulfate free too</li>
            <li> Works great for extra curly hair</li>
            <li> Instead I got flowery cheap musk.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give it away to someone who doesn&#x27;t mind cheap perfumey</li>
            <li> Leave-in conditioner is light weight, not greasy</li>
            <li> I really liked that because it gave me a true sense of how much I used.</li>
            <li> Oh yes, the price is excellent and  I need very little after using the Renpure Cr&amp;egrave;me Cowash Cleansing ConditionerShampoo.</li>
            <li> The Redmonds&#x27; Renpure hair care line is awesome because they do not use harsh chemicals and there is NO animal testing!</li>
            <li> Ok, this is the real deal!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a rich coconut scent.  </li>
            <li> Love this product so much!</li>
            <li> Soaks right in and makes my hair super shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> it leaves my hai soft and smells amazing</li>
            <li> is something I really like being able to do.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this leave in conditioner I really did.</li>
            <li> use one full pump for y shortish-medium hair, or so.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and my curls are nice as well</li>
            <li> I was using Lush Cosmetics &amp;#34;Coolaulin&amp;#34; and that conditioner is the best I have EVER run across and made my naturally curly hair so sweet and light smelling and soft.</li>
            <li> The bottles are very sturdy and I love the pump since squeezing a bottle with my arthritic hands isn&#x27;t fun.</li>
            <li> It is not heavy, smells great and makes my curls soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I like to say I&#x27;m from the Caribbean and have really think curly hair which gets easy dryied out.</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, wonderful smell, and light enough to leave in without pulling down your hair.</li>
            <li> This product smells good, is not greasy, left my hair smooth and very soft, I may try the shampoo when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> My hair feels great, and it isn&#x27;t too heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I started with the leave in conditioner, then  used 100% coconut oil (the kind you can cook with), and a curl pudding, plus the jelly as the last step.</li>
            <li> has a nice smell and does the same thing as wen</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s effective qualities ; slip, moisture,longevity, because I ended up right back in the shower washing it out.  </li>
            <li> Great leave-in to tame fly-always....</li>
            <li> Not as much coconut as I&#x27;d like, but still clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> and it is beautiful and straight (little bit of wave toward ends)</li>
            <li> I just think that it is not the right product for my hair</li>
            <li> Not only is it gentle on my newly bleached hair, it smells great.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying any renpure products and I am switching from OGX Moroccan oil and cream to have a more all natural product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product it leaves my hair very nice not weighted down</li>
            <li> Goes very well wth the coconut pudding love the way it makes myhair smell and feels so soft</li>
            <li> I am currently starting to transition from heat damaged hair to completely natural (&amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34;), so I thought this product would be good because it doesn&#x27;t contain the things I don&#x27;t want in my hair products.</li>
            <li> I have thin curly hair and this product is absolutely wonderful, amazing looking curls without leaving it sticky and yucky like other products!</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s a big bottle</li>
            <li> and most of it was left in my roots</li>
            <li> My daughter and I tried many different shampoos and conditioners from Renpure line.  </li>
            <li> My hair actually feels better WITHOUT this product.</li>
            <li> This is the first leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve bought</li>
            <li> The price is definitely a steal :)</li>
            <li> I really think it has contributed to the health of my hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stronger and more structured than it used to be, and it actually holds curls now, when it didn&#x27;t before.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like I have to use other products with it for my hair to nice and behave.  </li>
            <li> I find that this actually feels like it is absorbing into my hair, instead of just laying on the top and feeling greasy like WEN did a lot.  </li>
            <li> Works very well with the cleansing pudding being used first.</li>
            <li> I am trying to take better care of my hair and grow it long</li>
            <li> Keeps my dry hair moisturized, love the smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a whole new head of hair!!</li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li> The Renpure products have really changed my life.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m not crazy about the masculine fragrance, although it wears off after your hair dries.</li>
            <li> Has preservatives in it, I really wish it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> and it is really silky and shiny since using this</li>
            <li> I use it every time I get out of the shower whether I am doing it straight or curly.</li>
            <li> After using the coconut cleansing conditioner (which I really like)</li>
            <li> This product is a real treat for my hair.</li>
            <li> Everything I been looking for and a leave in conditioner and the price is within an reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It depends on how much you put in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like sticking my whole hand in a tub of conditioner</li>
            <li> Either a sulfate free or regular detergent shampoo will remove the product.</li>
            <li> It does make your hair kind of stiff, but it does soften up as your hair dries.</li>
            <li> Mmmmmmm it smells better then expected!</li>
            <li> smells good and has some conditioning aspects, but didnt really like the harse texture and limp feeling it left in my hair.</li>
            <li> so I need to only use products without Sulfates and sodium chloride in order to properly maintain it, the Renpure line keeps my keratin nice, my curly thick hair smooth, and I feel like it&#x27;s just overall better for my hair and body.</li>
            <li> Another of my new faves in hair products!</li>
            <li> I think this is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ll be using it for every day!</li>
            <li> and I have to say every single positive review stands true.</li>
            <li> It was light for a leave in conditioner and left my hair soft though.</li>
            <li> That was one of the main reasons I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> This leave-in smells a little strong at first, but once it&#x27;s in your hair after a while you won&#x27;t notice it.</li>
            <li> and I had high hopes for this brand.</li>
            <li> A little thinner than I need it to be and most of the product is removed at the ends of my hair, while drying my hair with a towel&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very generous amount in the bottle, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This was a bit too heavy for my straight, fine hair.</li>
            <li> MADE MY HAIR VERY SOFT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about hair products and normally buy professional products.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t weight down your hair or leave any noticeable residue while adding body, softness and light structure (hold).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll most likely use this up as a finishing product which will make it last a long time.</li>
            <li> As a leave-in it is too heavy for my fine</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot, but no need to skimp&lt;br /&gt;Rub hands together to smooth and apply (sometimes I apply a little Argan oil</li>
            <li> Smells vaguely of old man cologne.</li>
            <li> Made my mother&#x27;s hair just as soft as she wanted.</li>
            <li> After using this its soft and the curls are well formed with residual frizz.</li>
            <li> Would definitely buy again and use forever if I don&#x27;t find an organic nicer smelling product for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft, silky and shiny and never greasy or sticky.  </li>
            <li> how soft it makes my hair.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to someone with natural curls</li>
            <li> This just displaced my old leave-in conditioner I&#x27;d used for years.</li>
            <li> Eliminates frizz and keeps my curls soft for days.</li>
            <li> Just dont put it near your scalp</li>
            <li> I use it on my natural hair after a classing condition.</li>
            <li> Even your hand feel soft after use in my curl 3b</li>
            <li> Used a palm full which is average for me with my curly hair.</li>
            <li> After reading up on this type of silicone I discovered it does wash out particularly if you wash your hair daily as I do.</li>
            <li> The only thing I disliked is the strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li> a little more perfumey than I expected.  </li>
            <li> The smell is way too strong, for me at least.  </li>
            <li> All of them left our scalps dried out and very itchy after the first couple of times we started using these products.</li>
            <li> A big plus since I work in a dry, hot factory every day.</li>
            <li> I have fine thick (as in lots of it) hair of about shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I have a thick head of fine hair</li>
            <li> You only need a quarter sized dollop rubbed between your hands and applied lightly on the spots needing a little extra control.</li>
            <li> Ive only used it once so far</li>
            <li> I chose a humid and hot night to go out with my hair down, armed with hair holders in case my hair decided to turn against me as always.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for chemically-treated and dry hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves it firm which is great due to my frizzy thick hair type, I need it that way.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my hair completely which is why I&#x27;m giving it</li>
            <li> and it costs so much less then wen some of the wen scents smell like chemicals so much that it turned me off renpure</li>
            <li> Terrific leave in conditioner for long, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty bummed about this because it&#x27;s a big bottle gone to waste</li>
            <li> This is not a problem with normal conditioners, and by the time I got from one side to the other the beginning was tangled again.</li>
            <li> So I used less the next time, but it didn&#x27;t really moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and very dry.</li>
            <li> My hair has been color treated over and over again which caused it to now be rough with major spilt ends.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not heavy &amp; doesn&#x27;t way ur hair down</li>
            <li> left my hair feeling dry which I dont get.</li>
            <li> of note, on days I don&#x27;t have the time to go through the whole process, I just use the leave in conditioner and the jelly, and with my hair in a pony tail or half down, my curls stay manageable.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the product but for $17.00, Renpure has gotta be freaking crazy!</li>
            <li> You literally need a pea size amount because it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I just expected this to smell similar.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair, so I need some leave in conditioner to help with the tangles after I shower.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say to apply generously but that made my hair stiff and took the natural curl out.</li>
            <li> makes my hair dry every time i apply it to my hair</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, dry, brittle curly hair if I don&#x27;t use and abundance of conditioning agents.</li>
            <li> I usually straighten my hair, but where I live, its almost pointless considering the humidity, so I recently became determined to find something that is not only healthy for my hair, but can allow me to wear it down without getting stares from others like they had just seen Scary Spice walking down the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and tamed yet firm!</li>
            <li> an actual leave in conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or cause greasiness.</li>
            <li> you only need a little I have shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> But be aware that the directions say to use generously, but that made my hair very stiff, dry, and hard to get a comb through.</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time finding actual &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; conditioners, I tried this.</li>
            <li> I expected this leave-in conditioner to be of comparable quality</li>
            <li> Does not smell remotely of coconut.</li>
            <li> I have 4 stars since it has preservatives and it is not organic and the fragrance is off putting when my hair is wet.</li>
            <li> Left my hair sticky and gummy when wet and feeling like crunchy build-up when dried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lightly blot dry with towel ( or used shirt because I&#x27;m curly and want less frizz)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner works well, not greasy like some other products</li>
            <li> other problem is that it doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut to me.  </li>
            <li> I always use wen and decided to try there other products and found that I actually like them a lot it is not as thick as wen</li>
            <li> I felt like it weighed my curls way down.  </li>
            <li> Although I will use it sparingly and try it down the road I don&#x27;t think this is the leave in conditioner for me.</li>
            <li> My hair has no more split ends or dry feeling.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair that needs taming even before I can flat iron it.</li>
            <li> My hair is much less frizzy with this leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> It also costs a lot less too.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any heavy residue or film on my thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I HAVE THICK DRY HAIR.</li>
            <li> WEIGHS DOWN YOUR HAIR...AND LEAVES HAIR STIFF.</li>
            <li> : moderately thick conditioner, thicker than any generic store brand, less thick than OGX brand leave in cream.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I do not enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Not overly heavy together</li>
            <li> It was heavy</li>
            <li> Throughout my life, I have tried hundreds of products to tame my frizzy hair; none have helped.</li>
            <li> The curling jelly made my hair a little crispy, but if it had anything to do with keeping my hair from going awol, I am still grateful!</li>
            <li> I apply a little on my ends at the end of every shower and man what a difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the price went up to $17.00 from $9.</li>
            <li> Not sure how I feel about that.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Also no sodium chloride, sulfates, dyes, harsh salts, parabens, or Gluten!  </li>
            <li> it still ok?&amp;#34; After 5 hours, my hair was still tame!</li>
            <li> My hair sucks up moisture .&lt;br</li>
            <li> With 4c hair, it takes a lot of conditioner/water because our hair tangles from the roots (it sucks a million).</li>
            <li> And no more frizz!</li>
            <li> Not only do I find the scent unpleasant, I am allergic to to it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so thick and curly, and so hard to brush through, after towel drying my hair and adding this in, what a difference!</li>

            <li> Tries Hair One but was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Does not smell ANYTHING like coconut it STINKs of perfume.</li>
            <li> My husband thought I was crazy; I kept going to mirrors checking on the status of my hair and repeatedly asked him and my friend, &amp;#34;Is</li>
            <li> The smell was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have $17.00 for one product, so I won&#x27;t be buying it again :-(.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells great and my hair feels super soft after every use.</li>
            <li> Really love the smell and how wonderfully and beautifully it makes my color-treated and heat-treated hair look and feel. Love that it&#x27;s a big bottle because I know it will last me a while. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> WEIGHS DOWN YOUR HAIR...AND LEAVES HAIR STIFF.</li>
            <li> I use Renpure shampoo (Wen clone) and I&#x27;m very happy with it. I expected this leave-in conditioner to be of comparable quality and it did not disappoint. The smell is really nice and it have a great texture. It won&#x27;t weight down your hair or leave any noticeable residue while adding body, softness and light structure (hold).</li>
            <li> Non-greasy, wonderful smell, and light enough to leave in without pulling down your hair. I have fairly fine hair, and I can use this every day.</li>
            <li> Goes very well wth the coconut pudding love the way it makes myhair smell and feels so soft</li>
            <li> This product smells terrible. Does not smell remotely of coconut. Smells vaguely of old man cologne. Tried to ignore the smell but it isn&#x27;t possible for me. Maybe if you wear gloves while applying it to your hair. It does actually help with frizz. But I do not enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I am in love with this product.  So perfect for my natural curls, I will definitely re-order....</li>
            <li> The smell is way too strong, for me at least.  I guess it is ok. I like the consistency of it and it coats the hair well.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel great &amp; has stopped the friz.</li>
            <li> I have fine thick (as in lots of it) hair of about shoulder length. A dime sized drop applied from the ends to the roots is plenty. My hair feels great, and it isn&#x27;t too heavy or greasy. I would absolutely buy this again.</li>
            <li> left my hair feeling dry which I dont get.</li>
            <li> Works great and does wonders for my hair. All I could ask for.</li>
            <li> It does make your hair kind of stiff, but it does soften up as your hair dries. I love it.</li>
            <li> My hair has been color treated over and over again which caused it to now be rough with major spilt ends. I actually found this stuff elsewhere and decided to read the reviews after the fact and I have to say every single positive review stands true. I love love this stuff!!...an actual leave in conditioner that doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or cause greasiness. You literally need a pea size amount because it goes a long way. Light weight and smells fabulous...I&#x27;m about to stock up!</li>
            <li> Made my mother&#x27;s hair just as soft as she wanted.</li>
            <li> The Renpure products have really changed my life. I have keratin treated hair so I need to only use products without Sulfates and sodium chloride in order to properly maintain it, the Renpure line keeps my keratin nice, my curly thick hair smooth, and I feel like it&#x27;s just overall better for my hair and body. The keratin alone contains a lot of chemicals so to not have to wash and condition with extra chemicals is something I really like being able to do.</li>
            <li> Wonderful bouncy curls and no knots!</li>
            <li> makes my hair dry every time i apply it to my hair</li>
            <li> Just too expensive!!! Works great though</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner....and trust me....I&#x27;ve bought a lot of these.  This one is by far the best.  It holds the hair...it makes my hair look better and it smells nice.  Not as much coconut as I&#x27;d like, but still clean and fresh.  I would buy this brand again...anytime.</li>
            <li> So lovely and great smelling. I recommend it highly! Leaves hair soft and tamed yet firm! Works great with Moroccan Argan Oil!</li>
            <li> smells good and has some conditioning aspects, but didnt really like the harse texture and limp feeling it left in my hair.</li>
            <li> This is my first time buying any renpure products and I am switching from OGX Moroccan oil and cream to have a more all natural product. Ideally I wanted organic but this was the best for the cheapest I could find. The packages came shipped well, and in tact. The bottles are very sturdy and I love the pump since squeezing a bottle with my arthritic hands isn&#x27;t fun. It&#x27;s a very generous amount in the bottle, I was pleasantly surprised. I have shoulder length, dry, brittle curly hair if I don&#x27;t use and abundance of conditioning agents. After using this its soft and the curls are well formed with residual frizz. But I followed up with an all organic cream for $22  for a tiny bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: moderately thick conditioner, thicker than any generic store brand, less thick than OGX brand leave in cream.&lt;br /&gt;  holds well to hair. I even rinsed it then re applied to see how it it held up and most of it was left in my roots&lt;br /&gt;  Works very well with the cleansing pudding being used first. Not overly heavy together&lt;br /&gt;  Used a palm full which is average for me with my curly hair. My hair sucks up moisture .&lt;br /&gt;  Inexpensive for the quality and amount of product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I&#x27;m not crazy about the masculine fragrance, although it wears off after your hair dries. It smells like a cologne my grandpa would wear,  .  &amp;not in a good way lol!&lt;br /&gt;  A little thinner than I need it to be and most of the product is removed at the ends of my hair, while drying my hair with a towel&lt;br /&gt;  Has preservatives in it, I really wish it didn&#x27;t. Still looking for cheap organic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall opinion for my hair type.... Very good. Like a 8&amp;1/2 out of 10. Well worth the money. I have 4 stars since it has preservatives and it is not organic and the fragrance is off putting when my hair is wet. Would definitely buy again and use forever if I don&#x27;t find an organic nicer smelling product for a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the cleansing pudding tho and will be reviewing that as well.eviewing that as well.</li>
            <li> I was using WEN since I have been letting my hair grow and then I found this item at a friends&#x27; home and she let me try it......LOVED IT EVEN MORE THAN MY WEN so when Wen was all I ordered this on Amazon and so glad I did.  I have a thick head of fine hair and it is beautiful and straight (little bit of wave toward ends) and it is really silky and shiny since using this and I love the way it smells.  Leaves hair soft, silky and shiny and never greasy or sticky.  I am 65 yrs.young and still loving my hair.  Oh yes, the price is excellent and  I need very little after using the Renpure Cr&amp;egrave;me Cowash Cleansing ConditionerShampoo.</li>
            <li> Another of my new faves in hair products! I use this along with the Renpure Coconut Creme Cowash Cleansing Conditioner. I highly recommend this for chemically-treated and dry hair. The Redmonds&#x27; Renpure hair care line is awesome because they do not use harsh chemicals and there is NO animal testing! Excellent product line at a great price - yummy scent as well ; )&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Love this!  Love the smell and how soft it makes my hair.  A must use for curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly and very dry. I am a hair product junkie and I have tried more hair products then I would like to admit. I am addicted to this product. I use it every time I get out of the shower whether I am doing it straight or curly. I have noticed a big difference in my hair since using this. It is not heavy, smells great and makes my curls soft and bouncy. Great product. Everybody asks what I have changed with my hair regime and this is it!</li>
            <li> I have nappy curls and very thick it leaves my hai soft and smells amazing</li>
            <li> Great leave-in to tame fly-always....I don&#x27;t think it smells like coconut at all though</li>
            <li> Super great. I love the smell and it&#x27;s done wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it. It makes my hair soft and manageable and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Love it. My hair is so thick and curly, and so hard to brush through, after towel drying my hair and adding this in, what a difference! It&#x27;s like a whole new head of hair!!</li>
            <li> This was a bit too heavy for my straight, fine hair. I would recommend this to someone with natural curls</li>
            <li> a little more perfumey than I expected.  I was using Lush Cosmetics &amp;#34;Coolaulin&amp;#34; and that conditioner is the best I have EVER run across and made my naturally curly hair so sweet and light smelling and soft. They discontinued it and I am so bummed. I bought this to replace it and it was not the same. It was light for a leave in conditioner and left my hair soft though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I just got a bad batch or what. After using quite liberally, I couldn&#x27;t get a paddle burst through my hair. This is not a problem with normal conditioners, and by the time I got from one side to the other the beginning was tangled again.</li>
            <li> I USED THIS AFTER THE CLEANSING CONDITIONER........EXCELLENT PRODUCT. MADE MY HAIR VERY SOFT. NOT GREASY. I HAVE THICK DRY HAIR. I RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why the price went up to $17.00 from $9. In my opinion, when a person is actually buying your product, you don&#x27;t get greedy and jack the price up. People were buying from you guys because you were affordable and better than Wen. I&#x27;ve have never tried Wen, but I did purchase this product when it was $9.99. I&#x27;m glad I got it then because I&#x27;d NEVER pay $17.00 for a conditioner (even if it put sparkles in my hair). I&#x27;m a 4c African American chic. This conditioner kept my hair moist all day. It works great. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t have $17.00 for one product, so I won&#x27;t be buying it again :-(. I liked the smell of it. Some people don&#x27;t. I didn&#x27;t get product build up and it had a lot of slip. The bottle came filled to the very top. I really liked that because it gave me a true sense of how much I used. I didn&#x27;t make a dent in the product. With 4c hair, it takes a lot of conditioner/water because our hair tangles from the roots (it sucks a million). I am very pleased with the product but for $17.00, Renpure has gotta be freaking crazy!</li>
            <li> Provides great slip! This just displaced my old leave-in conditioner I&#x27;d used for years. The bottle lasts forever and the scent is very light and pleasant once it&#x27;s in your hair. Not too coconuty.</li>
            <li> I use this as an alternative to detangler spray for my toddler daughter&#x27;s snarly hair.  It works great and I feel good that I&#x27;m not dousing her with hundreds of chemicals!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I tried many different shampoos and conditioners from Renpure line.  All of them left our scalps dried out and very itchy after the first couple of times we started using these products. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel great</li>
            <li> Whoa! The smell! After using the coconut cleansing conditioner (which I really like) I just expected this to smell similar. Well, I was wrong. It actually made me sneeze! Soooo perfumy. Not even islandy coconut strong. Just strong. I can&#x27;t even say if it works because I immediately rinsed it out and applied As I Am leave-in conditioner. And even after that the smell lingered the following morning. I&#x27;m pretty bummed about this because it&#x27;s a big bottle gone to waste and I had high hopes for this brand.</li>
            <li> Does not smell ANYTHING like coconut it STINKs of perfume.</li>
            <li> Left my hair sticky and gummy when wet and feeling like crunchy build-up when dried. Impossible to run a comb through. My hair actually feels better WITHOUT this product. Horrible.</li>
            <li> This product is a real treat for my hair. My hair feels drenched with moisture, and I love it. A big plus since I work in a dry, hot factory every day.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I have been searching for a leave in conditioner that does not leave my hair lifeless and greasy. This product is perfect for managing your hair while still allowing it to look naturally beautiful. A definite repurchase!</li>
            <li> Ok, this is the real deal! Smells fabulous and makes my hair feel and look great!</li>
            <li> Works just as good as Wen for me at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing! The way my hair turns out is beautiful, shiny, and extremely soft.</li>
            <li> Love the formula. Eliminates frizz and keeps my curls soft for days. The only thing I disliked is the strong perfume smell.</li>
            <li> Keeps my dry hair moisturized, love the smell n I like that it&#x27;s sulfate free too</li>
            <li> NO comparison to WEN.  I felt like it weighed my curls way down.  It was heavy and I did not control the fuzz. I think it could be good for straight hair.</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner works well, not greasy like some other products</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this leave in conditioner I really did. But it&#x27;s not special&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not heavy &amp; doesn&#x27;t way ur hair down&lt;br /&gt;Good ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad&lt;br /&gt;First I like to say I&#x27;m from the Caribbean and have really think curly hair which gets easy dryied out. This leave in conditioner did nothing to help with that. It didn&#x27;t dry out my hair completely which is why I&#x27;m giving it 3starts but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I am biracial with type 2c, 3a, 3b, &amp; 3c hair (ridiculous, I know). Throughout my life, I have tried hundreds of products to tame my frizzy hair; none have helped. I usually straighten my hair, but where I live, its almost pointless considering the humidity, so I recently became determined to find something that is not only healthy for my hair, but can allow me to wear it down without getting stares from others like they had just seen Scary Spice walking down the grocery store. I chose a humid and hot night to go out with my hair down, armed with hair holders in case my hair decided to turn against me as always. My husband thought I was crazy; I kept going to mirrors checking on the status of my hair and repeatedly asked him and my friend, &amp;#34;Is it still ok?&amp;#34; After 5 hours, my hair was still tame! Keep in mind, though, that I used 4 different products on my hair. I used the L.O.C. technique (leave in condition, oil, cream) plus the renpure curling jelly in the end. I started with the leave in conditioner, then  used 100% coconut oil (the kind you can cook with), and a curl pudding, plus the jelly as the last step. The curling jelly made my hair a little crispy, but if it had anything to do with keeping my hair from going awol, I am still grateful! I bought this over a month ago, and the price was 9.99, if I remember correctly. I am almost out, though, but saw the price increased to almost $17!!! Ouch! Not sure how I feel about that.&lt;br /&gt;Also of note, on days I don&#x27;t have the time to go through the whole process, I just use the leave in conditioner and the jelly, and with my hair in a pony tail or half down, my curls stay manageable. Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Helps detangle and soften my combo 3b/3c hair.</li>
            <li> I really like this product it leaves my hair very nice not weighted down you only need a little I have shoulder length hair I always use wen and decided to try there other products and found that I actually like them a lot it is not as thick as wen but my hair looks just as nice and it costs so much less then wen some of the wen scents smell like chemicals so much that it turned me off renpure has a nice smell and does the same thing as wen</li>
            <li> Everything I been looking for and a leave in conditioner and the price is within an reasonable price. I will reorder.</li>
            <li> I just got this and had to try it out. I have such a hard time finding actual &amp;#34;leave in&amp;#34; conditioners, I tried this. It&#x27;s AMAZING. Not only is it gentle on my newly bleached hair, it smells great. I think this is my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ll be using it for every day! Coconut Whipped Créme Leave-In Conditioner does not leave my hair crunchy. It leaves it firm which is great due to my frizzy thick hair type, I need it that way. It depends on how much you put in. Either way, the conditioner is light, smells awesome, and it&#x27;s great with the pump instead of just a cap. I don&#x27;t like sticking my whole hand in a tub of conditioner, it&#x27;s not as controlled. So that&#x27;s a plus!</li>
            <li> Hello! This is the first leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve bought and I got this particular kind because I wanted more shape to my curls with the use of the coconut oils&lt;br /&gt;My routine:&lt;br /&gt;Shower before bed&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo with any shampoo&lt;br /&gt;Lightly blot dry with towel ( or used shirt because I&#x27;m curly and want less frizz)&lt;br /&gt;I use one full pump for y shortish-medium hair, or so. You don&#x27;t need a lot, but no need to skimp&lt;br /&gt;Rub hands together to smooth and apply (sometimes I apply a little Argan oil after)&lt;br /&gt;Last step, twirl hair and tuck in for the night. zzzzZZ&lt;br /&gt;Warning: If you air you&#x27;ll notice a gelling effect after awhile. Don&#x27;t worry, your hair is just still drying and going through the the glorious process of coconut rejuvenation! The gelling/hardness will slowly smooth out to lovely luscious locks.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has never felt healthier and I love this product! Even got my mom hooked on it.</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and this product is amazing!  I put it in just out of the shower and it makes my hair smell wonderful and tangle free.  Also no sodium chloride, sulfates, dyes, harsh salts, parabens, or Gluten!  I wish I would have found this years ago.  I am trying to take better care of my hair and grow it long and this is the product to help me in that journey.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair product. Love it</li>
            <li> Mmmmmmm it smells better then expected! Ive only used it once so far but I am super happy with it. The price is definitely a steal :)</li>
            <li> This has a coconut smell and works better as a styling product. The instructions say to apply generously but that made my hair stiff and took the natural curl out. I went back to using the leave in conditioner I had been rubbing into my hair and using this as a finishing touchup to control the frizzy hairs. It has silicone Quarturnium-17 in it which is a water soluable silicone. Used sparingly and as a topical combed through just to finish off your hair style it does what it says it is supposed to do which is make your hair shine. After reading up on this type of silicone I discovered it does wash out particularly if you wash your hair daily as I do. Either a sulfate free or regular detergent shampoo will remove the product. Since I was planning on using it as a leave in conditioner and it doesn&#x27;t work well that way I&#x27;ll most likely use this up as a finishing product which will make it last a long time. You only need a quarter sized dollop rubbed between your hands and applied lightly on the spots needing a little extra control.</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner, leave in product and will order it again!</li>
            <li> Works great for extra curly hair</li>
            <li> Love love love!!! My ends were so bad from dying my hair. I apply a little on my ends at the end of every shower and man what a difference! My hair has no more split ends or dry feeling. Just dont put it near your scalp it will make the top of your head look greasy,</li>
            <li> Smells awful to me.  I was expecting a rich coconut scent.  Instead I got flowery cheap musk.  Not only do I find the scent unpleasant, I am allergic to to it.  Shortly after I began putting this leave in in my hair my throat and nostrils began burning and itching.  Just gross.  I didn&#x27;t get to sample it&#x27;s effective qualities ; slip, moisture,longevity, because I ended up right back in the shower washing it out.  I&#x27;m going to give it away to someone who doesn&#x27;t mind cheap perfumey smells.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have used Wen products but wanted to find a less expensive alternative.  Tries Hair One but was disappointed.  Almost went back to Wen but found this and figured I&#x27;d give it a try.  So glad I did!  I also got the leave in conditioner because I have curly hair, and those that have it know you need something to manage and moisturizer.  You do not need much however, as the shampoo does a great job leaving conditioned.</li>
            <li> This product works! I&#x27;m picky about hair products and normally buy professional products. My fav leave-in conditioner was discontinued so I searched Amazon for a replacement. I have thick wavy hair that needs taming even before I can flat iron it. This product smells good, is not greasy, left my hair smooth and very soft, I may try the shampoo when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I use it on my natural hair after a classing condition. My hair feels soft and my curls are nice as well</li>
            <li> Love it. I have thin curly hair and this product is absolutely wonderful, amazing looking curls without leaving it sticky and yucky like other products!</li>
            <li> I adore this leave-in conditioner. I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now, and it works perfectly with my fine/thin hair all year-long. I really think it has contributed to the health of my hair! It&#x27;s stronger and more structured than it used to be, and it actually holds curls now, when it didn&#x27;t before. This leave-in smells a little strong at first, but once it&#x27;s in your hair after a while you won&#x27;t notice it. I like to use it at night after showering, then twist my hair in knots, so I have wavy curls in the morning. I recommend putting it in when your hair is damp-dry.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell! Does not smell nice coconut, but like menthol.</li>
            <li> I love this product it has a nice slip and smells so good.  This is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair perfectly spiraled with zero frizz!</li>
            <li> This is so smooth! Even your hand feel soft after use in my curl 3b&lt;br /&gt;The cream hold my curl, make a awesome after day!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend!</li>
            <li> We use this leave in conditioner every time we wash our hair.  It is great</li>
            <li> Terrific leave in conditioner for long, naturally curly hair. allows hair to curl up without being weighted down by product, while still providing wonderful conditioning properties. Smells wonderful and conditions well without looking greasy. Terrific product!</li>
            <li> Started using this instead of WEN and I like Renpure so much better.  I have a lot of fine, curly, frizzy hair.  I find that this actually feels like it is absorbing into my hair, instead of just laying on the top and feeling greasy like WEN did a lot.  My hair is much less frizzy with this leave in conditioner and I don&#x27;t like I have to use other products with it for my hair to nice and behave.  It also costs a lot less too.</li>
            <li> Allergic reaction/How do I return?</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I have really long hair, so I need some leave in conditioner to help with the tangles after I shower.  It works great and leaves my hair vibrant all day.  Even my husband loves it!  He uses it on his beard.</li>
            <li> Got here super fast and it smells great</li>
            <li> This conditioner is just ok... I am only giving it 3 stars because I will use it but I have to rinse it out.  As a leave-in it is too heavy for my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;The other problem is that it doesn&#x27;t smell like coconut to me.  That was one of the main reasons I purchased it.  The smell was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much! It doesn&#x27;t leave any heavy residue or film on my thick, coarse hair. Soaks right in and makes my hair super shiny and healthy looking. And no more frizz!</li>
            <li> Leave-in conditioner is light weight, not greasy and It smells like coconut. Great product for price and is as pictured.</li>
            <li> I am currently starting to transition from heat damaged hair to completely natural (&amp;#34;curly girl&amp;#34;), so I thought this product would be good because it doesn&#x27;t contain the things I don&#x27;t want in my hair products. But be aware that the directions say to use generously, but that made my hair very stiff, dry, and hard to get a comb through. So I used less the next time, but it didn&#x27;t really moisturize my hair. I just think that it is not the right product for my hair so I probably won&#x27;t buy it again. Although I will use it sparingly and try it down the road I don&#x27;t think this is the leave in conditioner for me.</li>
