            <li>However I&#x27;m sure that once I&#x27;m able to use it I&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li>But it was more &amp;#34;awakening&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li>Absolutly love this product</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this product through Bzz Agent and I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>

            <li>My daughter is allergic to UV Rays and was experiencing some sun poisoning on most of her body when I tried it on her.</li>
            <li>I think the Soother application would have been easier if it had more aerosol like qualities or a  finer mist.</li>
            <li>I felt for sure.</li>
            <li>So although the rest of the product line may not have been my favorite this one</li>
            <li>Made my scalp feel so much better.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and smell of it as well..</li>
            <li>I love anything with peppermint in it.</li>
            <li>and I &amp;#34;NEEED&amp;#34; to thank head and shoulders for creating such an awesome product.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product!  </li>
            <li>I was able to receive this product courtesy of bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li>but im more confident about about this brand.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my scalp feels.</li>
            <li>I tried this on those spots and I can&#x27;t say that it really made a difference (as I scratch my head lol).</li>
            <li>i love the soothing tingle of this product.</li>
            <li>i really enjoy using this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got to try this product</li>

            <li>and it leaves a nice light smell to your hair.</li>
            <li>I love the tingle feeling it gives</li>
            <li>and i will be getting more to keep in the house.</li>
            <li>I am for sure buying another one.</li>
            <li>I Absolutely Love The Idea Of This.</li>
            <li>My Hair And Scalp Can Always Use More Moister</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>But after using 3 Moisture Care products for a month, I now have MORE dandruff than before.</li>
            <li>Im in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is like Paul Mitchell&#x27;s tea tree scalp treatment except 1000 times better.</li>
            <li>I was very excited because I love anything with a coconut scent</li>
            <li>I love the cool sensation I get from the Moisture Care Scalp Soother that I received free from Head &amp; Shoulders!!</li>

            <li>This soother feels nice and cool on my scalp and smells pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>The peppermint oil leaves my scalp nice and cool.</li>
            <li>It is the best hair product I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li>I really liked the cool sensation that I received all over my scalp when I applied the serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that while it works really nicely on my scalp, it works even better on freshly shaved legs to combat itchiness and irritation.</li>
            <li>and I found that although it smells strong, it&#x27;s a pleasant smell, and the product really does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li>This was a very cool experience.</li>
            <li>Its like very cool water tingling on your head.</li>
            <li>The tingle from the peppermint feels amazing on my freshly washed scalp.</li>
            <li>It is soothing and great for natural braided or twist up hairstyles.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product free.</li>
            <li>I was able to try this product for free as part of a campaign for #BzzAgent and #Head&amp;Shoulders.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got to try this out for free from Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li>The applicator bottle that the product came in is great because it allowed me to apply the product directly to my scalp.</li>
            <li>This is a great product thus far</li>
            <li>My scalp felt invigorated and most importantly  </li>
            <li>I Loved the smell of the product as much as the rest of the items in the line.</li>
            <li>I loved this product it really helps with the itching.</li>
            <li>It provides fast itch relief and it feels so good on my scalp.</li>
            <li>I loved the scalp soother.that tingle from the peppermint relived my scalp so fast</li>
            <li>This new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother is amazing!</li>
            <li>It has a cool refreshing feeling that is perfect after a long day at the gym and it makes the hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>Out of all of the products in the Moisture Care line I was most excited to try the Scalp Soother.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>So easy.</li>
            <li>I could tell easily from the package design that this product was meant for textured hair.</li>
            <li>could easily get that from any product that is water based.</li>
            <li>Feeling Amazing After A Good Shampooing and Deep Conditioning.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, immediately helped with itchiness, and didn&#x27;t give hair that &#x27;gel&#x27; feel.</li>
            <li>IN IT FROM SMELLING IT, NOT TO MENTION THAT STRONG PEPPERMINT SMELL TOO.</li>
            <li>THE SMELL IS STRONG BUT NOT SO STRONG THAT YOU COULDN&#x27;T STAND IT.</li>
            <li>As it progressed, the sensation did get stronger, but not too strong to the point of discomfort.</li>
            <li>Also I find the product is compariable to another high end, overpriced product, that I didn&#x27;t see nearly as good as results from.</li>
            <li>It provides a cool, tingling &amp; refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li>I just love the cool sensation my scalp feels.</li>
            <li>It did give a nice sensation when I first applied it</li>
            <li>It’s also super easy to use and the spray top is for targeted application, so you can use it anywhere at anytime.</li>
            <li>This is the head &amp; shoulders product that I absolutely loved all of the new products that came out.</li>
            <li>This is an easy and convenient to get itch free scalp.</li>
            <li>It worked quickly on my itchy scalp and the peppermint scent was an added bonus!  </li>
            <li>Luckily it does not have a medicinal smell at all!</li>
            <li>The positive - it smells really nice and the spray nozzle dispenses the product evenly with a fine mist.</li>
            <li>Thanks Head &amp; Shoulders for the free product!!</li>

            <li>I received head &amp; shoulders scalp soother free from head &amp; shoulders and I really like this product.</li>
            <li>The instant scalp relief is amazing.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Head and Shoulders for letting me try this Moisture Care product for free.</li>
            <li>I love this product because I&#x27;m growing my hair out natural and just put braids in for protective styling.  </li>
            <li>It helped me keep my style fresh by not having to scratch all day.</li>
            <li>I tend to have issues with irritated scalp since I have transitioned from natural back to relaxed hair and this is honestly one product that I am glad to have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural and I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite product in the line.</li>
            <li>My hair is Loc&#x27;ed and therefore my my scalp is exposed to the elements every time i get a fresh retwist.</li>
            <li>My hair felt fresh and revived.</li>
            <li>spray on quite a bit at a time, I&#x27;m really surprised it hasn&#x27;t run out yet, but more for me.</li>
            <li>as far as actual healing is concerned honestly i think its nothing more than menthol in a bottle.</li>
            <li>Though I did receive this product FREE for review from BzzAgent, I am most definitely  fan.</li>
            <li>#ScalpSoother keeps my head fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li>my favorite product so far.</li>
            <li>I used in on freshly braided hair.</li>
            <li>After putting extensions for braids in my hair, is when my  scalp  is the most irritated , itchy and sensitive.  </li>
            <li>Besides the relief what I really liked about the product was it has nozzle dispenser with cap, this helps to get out only the required amount needed and avoid wastage.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say this stuff instantly calms your itchy scalp so you don&#x27;t&#x27; be &amp;#34;digging&amp;#34; in your head all day at work or in the grocery store.</li>
            <li>In second relief from itchy dry scalp leaving scalp with a tinglely refreshing  cooling sensation This will be great hot summer days</li>
            <li>The nozzle is great for applying product right where you want it on the scalp and not on the hair and the cap locks in place, even being in my bag with heavy objects the cap stayed on.</li>
            <li>After i use this my scalp irritation is gone right away.</li>
            <li>I used this right after cowashing.</li>
            <li>The design of the nozzle help you spray the product right where you need it.</li>
            <li>right here I&#x27;m co-signing ALL DAY.</li>
            <li>PERSONALLY, WHEN I USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT FELT AMAZING.</li>
            <li>This leaves my scalp cool and calm while leaving my tresses straight and flowing between washes.</li>
            <li>It has a cool and refreshing tingle that stops your scalp from itching almost instantly.</li>
            <li>This really is helping me keep my scalp clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li>but this was the only one that worked, the peppermint oil did wonders for her scalp, this is a wonderful product to try hands down</li>
            <li>A few good squirts in those itchy areas, followed by a quick fingertip massage</li>
            <li>, I was lucky enough to get the head and shoulders moisture care scalp soother to try from bzzagent and it was an interesting experience.</li>
            <li>This product also has peppermint oil in it which creates a cool sensation with a tingle that really helps with the dryness</li>
            <li>I really love thus product and would purchase for my own personal use and would definitely recommend to others</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an African American woman with natural hair, I often wear weaves or braids and this product is perfect on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>So i put it to the test and after a long 10 hour day at work I had a nice scalp itch going.</li>
            <li>I use it every other day, and I feel like I have achieved an excellent balance between dry hair and greasy hair.  </li>
            <li>This will certainly be a stable of mine!</li>
            <li>This is truly a smart buy over and over again!</li>
            <li>course it would feel nice initially, so I decided to wait a bit and see if it really relieved her</li>
            <li>I have been keeping my hair braided the last few months and this is perfect for soothing an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>I do like the bottle that it is a pump bottle making it easy to apply in either my hand or directly into my scalp.</li>
            <li>This was a cool new product to try!</li>
            <li>, it is very intense and soothes the scalp from itch.</li>
            <li>First I co-washed my hair,then I applied the smoother to my scalp.</li>
            <li>As a bzz agent I was given this product for free to try and I must say I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>the first thing I did was use the Moisture Care Scalp Soother.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the product overall and would recommend this specifically for women/men/</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I applied it to my scalp is exactly what it claims to deliver : relief.</li>
            <li>If you ever used a peppermint soap in your hair, that is exactly what it feels like.</li>
            <li>What is great about this is that it is a non-greasy formula with a peppermint oil complex and</li>
            <li>What works for one may be different for someone else, so I would recommend trying this product for yourself :-)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, it stops the itch instantly.</li>
            <li>It scared me a bit at first, but it eventually went away.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using Head and Shoulders, and my first time using a scalp soother.</li>
            <li>When I applied the solution on my scalp, nothing happened at first.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what is says... soothes the scalp.</li>
            <li>i would say this is a must for braids, the nozzle helps you get the product exactly where it&#x27;s needed and</li>
            <li>I was skeptic at first</li>
            <li>First time trying this product</li>
            <li>First and foremost, I used it after the shampoo/conditioner and scalp treatment.</li>
            <li>I gave it three stars because although it seems like the product what the label says, and smells wonderful by the way, I was unable to use it.</li>
            <li>Then, sit back and feel it work its magic.</li>
            <li>I intend to keep using the product and supporting the brand.</li>
            <li>if it actually works, I may need to give it some more time.</li>
            <li>Use daily as often as needed because it goes on light with no greasy residue!</li>
            <li>When I first used it I didn&#x27;t feel a difference</li>
            <li>This product was sent to me to review by Head and Shoulders and this is a great product, I just would not buy it due to the fact that I don&#x27;t have a dry scalp and it is very rare that I would use it.</li>
            <li>I have some problems with my dry scalp and wanting to itch when I feel that sensation to, so when I tried this product that I received from Head and Shoulders/BzzAgent, I was happy to see that it worked instantly for me.</li>
            <li>Great thing about that is my daughter has coarse superthick dry hair.</li>
            <li>The thought of Head and Shoulders makes flashback to my childhood of using the original shampoo product, and then walking around for days smelling like old medicine.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and does not interfere with my other styling products.</li>
            <li>She has been using the new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection for almost a week now and it seems to be helping tremendously</li>
            <li>However it did leave a fresh feeling on my scalp which I think is the main idea of this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos and moisturizers and nothing has really worked.</li>
            <li>With this product, I was able to get that extra moisture without the heaviness of too much oil.</li>
            <li>AND most importantly, she is scratching at her hair less!</li>
            <li>but this product is not too strong and did the exact opposite!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sprays on clean with no mess, soothing your scalp within no time.</li>
            <li>Oh my gosh, when I put this product in my head,  at first I was like &amp;#34;ugh, ok&amp;#34;, but it really does sooth the scalp and controls the itching.</li>
            <li>When I first used this product on my scalp it was very tingly.  </li>
            <li>So refreshing for my dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>My only con was that it  has a strong peppermint scent</li>
            <li>this product certainly will help even if it&#x27;s not immediately.</li>
            <li>Head and Shoulders has got it right with this new product.</li>
            <li>It almost instantly stops any itching and it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li>I RECENTLY RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE FROM THE HEAD &amp; SHOULDERS COMPANY.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really get the relief  </li>
            <li>I even raved about this so much to all my family and friends that they&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH EASIER.</li>
            <li>You can really feel that cooling sensation from the peppermint when applying it to the scalp.</li>
            <li>I also really like the smell</li>
            <li>I have very itchy scalp with eczema patches and this soothes it and relieves the itch.</li>
            <li>It will burn if you&#x27;ve scratched your head too much</li>
            <li>Thanks to Bzzagent and Head &amp;Shoulders</li>
            <li>I rated it a 5 star because it really works grate</li>
            <li>but it causes me to have dandruff and a very sore scalp (even without scratching).</li>
            <li>Thanks to www.bzzagent.com</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent</li>
            <li>I received the entire Head &amp; Shoulders moisture care line free for being a Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>It really feels like a mint for the scalp and gives you a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li>and I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It really stops the itch and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>It really stops the itch and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since I&#x27;d never really heard of a scalp soother per say.</li>
            <li>Between the shampoo and this, I don&#x27;t know which soothed my itchy scalp, but one or a combination really worked.</li>
            <li>I use this  on my hair and my daughters hair and it helps so much.</li>
            <li>so I was very hopeful that this would help.</li>
            <li>Thanks to BzzAgent and Head&amp;Shoulders for providing me with a sample of the Scalp Soother.</li>
            <li>I went straight to my Buzz-kit and pulled out the Scalp Soother.  </li>
            <li>I think the Scalp Soother wasn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;soothing.&amp;#34; When I think of soothing I think calming, or relaxing.</li>
            <li>The scalp didnt have so much dandruff</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a bit of tingling, but not too much.</li>
            <li>This product provides so much relief when I can&#x27;t stand it anymore.</li>
            <li>Then, gently massage the oil onto the scalp, with the intention of evenly distributing the treatment.</li>
            <li>I really like this product..</li>
            <li>was gone and a day later I still am itch free.</li>
            <li>really didn&#x27;t provide me with anything</li>
            <li>Not only am I flake free now</li>
            <li>My scalp doesn&#x27;t need too much soothing, however, I tend to have some dryer areas that are known to be itchy.</li>
            <li>This product Does have a soothing effect which I would say is thanks to the peppermint.</li>
            <li>The Moisture Care &amp;#34;scalp soother&amp;#34; burns more if you use it after shampooing, because your scalp&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li>the Scalp Soother felt like it was really doing something.</li>
            <li>In the past this brand wasn&#x27;t my favorite and upon receiving this new line from the Bzz Agent campaign ( I received this for free)</li>
            <li>and I am glad we found each other.</li>
            <li>I love the tingling feeling i get due to the peppermint in it.</li>
            <li>but sure it does something for other hair types so gave it a 3 star.</li>
            <li>This product is simple to use, doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair and leave a nice cooling/refreshing sensation on your scalp.</li>
            <li>Okay so to start off my hair is super thick</li>
            <li>Instantly upon applying the scalp soother it leaves a soothing and cool sensation.</li>
            <li>the cool formal provides instant relief.</li>
            <li>I think I have found a new product for my hair!</li>
            <li>It also helps with preventing dry scalp and flaking which is a huge problem in my family.  </li>
            <li>I got this product free from Head &amp; Shoulders and it is my go to product every time my hair feels dry.</li>
            <li>And it just has my scalp feeling healthy and less stressed.</li>
            <li>Luckily there was no build up from the product, so it can be used daily.</li>
            <li>I think for me personally, the moisturing of the actual hair, was the most alluring.</li>
            <li>A coolness rushed over my scalp and it looks so healthy when usually it would look pretty dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps me to get only amount needed to sometimes apply on back of my head which itches the most.</li>
            <li>When I first sprayed this on my scalp, it just felt a little cool but within a minute my scalp was tingling all over and feel very soothed!</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair and its not good to wash it more than twice a week</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for anyone that has itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great at keeping my scalp from getting too uncomfortable between washes which is important in order to keep from needing to over wash my hair and therefore making it too dry or brittle.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>The one thing that I think is a con and one that I can overlook is if the product could be a little more thicker</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s provides a nice cooling feeling on my scalp and hardly find myself itching my head when used as directed.</li>
            <li>and my scalp tends to be drier than normal</li>
            <li>I normally just use oils.</li>
            <li>I recieved this product through BZZ Agent as a promotion from Head and Shoulders and I use this product in the morning, in the middle of the day, at night, pretty much anytime</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions but add a few more pumps throughout the scalp.</li>
            <li>It took a few minutes but my scalp was soothed and itch free and my wedding updo was saved!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times since I wash my hair more frequently in the summer, but I will definitely keep this around for winter!</li>
            <li>For the price thought might be worth it for someone you doesn&#x27;t mind reapplying on a regular bases.</li>
            <li>My scalp is sensitive, gets irritated easily and is very dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s crazy to think how many different oils, shampoos, and special product lines I have tried only to get relief from one that is available right from Amazon!</li>
            <li>The product itself doesn&#x27;t seem a whole lot different from the original Head and Shoulders, but the change in smell alone has convinced me to buy the new stuff next winter.</li>
            <li>After spraying it on, I massage it through and usually just style it as needed, although I mainly use it as a cherry on top for my wash and go days.</li>
            <li>this is my new go to product.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t associate the Head &amp; Shoulders brand with my hair type; but this product will be a new staple for me.</li>
            <li>I received the new Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother as a promotional offer from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li>I do suffer from itchy dry scalp so this helps tremendously when I have braids or any type of hair style.  </li>
            <li>and it just seems to calm the irritation immediately and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait for the summer to get here to try this in my hair while it is hot and humid outside...</li>
            <li>It keeps working throughout your busy day!</li>
            <li>Was unsure how it would be but since the first squirt on my itchy scalp definitely has given me relief.</li>
            <li>I found that it was a little too strong.  </li>
            <li>My day to day time is very limited due to demands of my eight month old son and my full time job, so finding something that helps me feel clean in hurry is must.  </li>
            <li>While I am transitioning my hair back to its natural state, I was excited to see that Head &amp; Shoulders has finally come out with a product for textured hair.</li>
            <li>I received a product sample, coupon, collateral or other special premium from BzzAgent or the brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the product 3 times now total and am still seeing a positive impact on my hair and scalps moisture levels.</li>
            <li>Its mess free and doesn&#x27;t drip.</li>
            <li>Its mess free and doesn&#x27;t drip.</li>
            <li>It can be used on wet or dry hair, or even when you feel your scalps needs refreshing or itching.</li>
            <li>I spritz it right on my dry spots and massage it in.</li>
            <li>Will definately be letting my family and friends know about this wonderous little gem that I tried, because I got it free from head &amp; shoulders.</li>
            <li>I just squirt a little in the part and smooth it on with my finger.</li>
            <li>My hair was breaking off and dull at the top</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even felt comfortable wearing my hair down!</li>
            <li>I really thought it was really helpful when brushing wet her.</li>
            <li>my scalp has clear of dandruff.</li>
            <li>After cleansing my scalp, I applied this directly to it.</li>
            <li>i have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>I am 100% natural</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not all natural</li>
            <li>This product is a MUST HAVE for people with natural hair.</li>
            <li>I personally woke up one morning and was getting ready for work when my scalp started to itch.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions on the bottle and applied the product directly to my scalp.</li>
            <li>Head and shoulders scalp soothers was a complete mystery to me.</li>
            <li>but this product helps me the next day to freshen up and mosturize my scalp while getting ready for work.</li>
            <li>I am a natural girl</li>
            <li>Used this on braids that were a month old.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised at the cooling, moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li>I have an intensely itchy scalp on the back portion of my head, but I don&#x27;t have dandruff.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair moisturized  &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>I must admit I was pleasantly  surprised.</li>
            <li>No matter how much shampoo/conditioner or hair treatment I applied I would feel itchy and scratch my head the next day after a wash.</li>
            <li>Okay so sometimes especially with curly hair you cannot wash everyday even when you have itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>, my scalp isn&#x27;t the dry and itchy scalp I had when I first started using the product.  </li>
            <li>Now after my long walks I just apply it after taking my shower and no more itchy scalp, I had even use it when I have my sweaty itchy scalp, the cool and tingle sensation when applying it, offers relief right</li>
            <li>The soother helps moisturize your hair during the day and morning so that it keeps fresh, especially if you are a person who does not have time for a complete was and dry in their day.</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase this product again and highly recommend it to any one who braids their hair or put in weaves and extensions.</li>
            <li>For a woman like me who alwasy wears braids has always searched high and low for soothing product.</li>
            <li>My son has very itchy scalp and his hair is long.</li>
            <li>IT DID HELP CALM DOWN MY ITCHY SCALP, BUT I NEEDED TO CONTINUE USING IT TO CONTINUE SEEING RESULTS.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be buying this in the future and highly suggest it to anyone with dry scalp issues, especially for those of you who have natural hair!</li>
            <li>, I feel like a doggie with fleas, I usually take a shower right away, it does calm my itchy scalp, but not completely, so finding Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother, offered a solution to that problem.</li>
            <li>With this product as soon as my scalp becomes irritated, normally around the nape area, I do a few quick sprays and there is an instant cooling relief.</li>
            <li>I have a very itchy dry scalp.</li>
            <li>Very comforting too a dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>The only downside (maybe just because my hair is really thick) is that it takes way more product than what the instructions say to cover your scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair is super curly and very dry, so every little bit of moisture really helps.</li>
            <li>I hoped it lived up to the major hype.</li>
            <li>But I use this about every other day on my scalp and I have seen a real reduction of flakes!</li>
            <li>ONCE APPLIED, I FELT A STRONG COOLING SENSATION THAT DIDN&#x27;T LAST FOR NO MORE THAN ABOUT 15 SECONDS.</li>
            <li>Just to mention, my hair type is wavy, frizzy, fine  strands, and thick ponytail ( 4 inches circumference).</li>
            <li>It keeps my head itch free doesnt leave my hair hard or flakey.</li>
            <li>Well as of lately my head has been itchy and irritated so when I got this product (free by the way)</li>
            <li>This product really works, I have tried a lot of products for my itchy scalp before that never really worked.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product for natural and relaxed hair types.</li>
            <li>By the second use I could notice a considerable difference in my scalp health and the softnes of my air.</li>
            <li>But lid was kind of weird.</li>
            <li>It felt kind of weird.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone suffering from a dry, itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>I was actually really afraid you&#x27;d be able to see it in my hair, but it really does go straight to the scalp -- and mine tends to be dry and itchy after not washing for three days.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this because I often have dry scalp.</li>
            <li>The other day I was getting ready for a wedding and my hair was already in an updo and my scalp started itching.</li>
            <li>and I live in Colorado (dry town USA), so</li>
            <li>So the first thing I did was squirt the product into the palm of my hand and gave it a little sniff.</li>
            <li>I can use it when I first get out of the shower, when my scalp is getting a little itchy, when my hair is getting &amp;#34;uncomfortably dry&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have mixed (black and white) hair that I wear natural and straight.</li>
            <li>You just spray this directly onto your scalp (the long nozzle reaches through your hair) and rub in with the pads of your fingers.</li>
            <li>wasnt very water down like a lot of scalp treatments and helped with the itch.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used the Head and Shoulder&#x27;s cowash the previous day and really didn&#x27;t want to wash again.</li>
            <li>my scalp really well wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have such dry and itchy scalp AND natural hair that is pressed.</li>
            <li>I have naturally thick, curly and super coarse hair</li>
            <li>This Is Such A Smart Little Invention.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s always evident when I&#x27;m having a flaky day, but for weeks now, I have seen little to none!</li>
            <li>It was a little intense, almost like I dumped a bottle of peppermint oil on my scalp...</li>
            <li>I have natural hair and my scalp can get a little sensitive.</li>
            <li>I like to use it after being outside when my scalp needs little cool down.</li>

            <li> My daughter is allergic to UV Rays and was experiencing some sun poisoning on most of her body when I tried it on her.</li>
            <li> I think the Soother application would have been easier if it had more aerosol like qualities or a  finer mist.</li>
            <li> I felt for sure.</li>
            <li> So although the rest of the product line may not have been my favorite this one</li>
            <li> Made my scalp feel so much better.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and smell of it as well..</li>
            <li> I love anything with peppermint in it.</li>

            <li> I was able to receive this product courtesy of bzzagent.com.</li>
            <li> but im more confident about about this brand.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my scalp feels.</li>
            <li> I tried this on those spots and I can&#x27;t say that it really made a difference (as I scratch my head lol).</li>

            <li> I Absolutely Love The Idea Of This.</li>
            <li> My Hair And Scalp Can Always Use More Moister</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff</li>
            <li> But after using 3 Moisture Care products for a month, I now have MORE dandruff than before.</li>
            <li> Im in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff.</li>

            <li> The peppermint oil leaves my scalp nice and cool.</li>
            <li> It is the best hair product I&#x27;ve used in a long time.</li>
            <li> I really liked the cool sensation that I received all over my scalp when I applied the serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that while it works really nicely on my scalp, it works even better on freshly shaved legs to combat itchiness and irritation.</li>
            <li> and I found that although it smells strong, it&#x27;s a pleasant smell, and the product really does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> This was a very cool experience.</li>
            <li> Its like very cool water tingling on your head.</li>
            <li> The tingle from the peppermint feels amazing on my freshly washed scalp.</li>
            <li> It is soothing and great for natural braided or twist up hairstyles.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product free.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free as part of a campaign for #BzzAgent and #Head&amp;Shoulders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got to try this out for free from Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li> The applicator bottle that the product came in is great because it allowed me to apply the product directly to my scalp.</li>
            <li> This is a great product thus far</li>
            <li> My scalp felt invigorated and most importantly  </li>
            <li> I Loved the smell of the product as much as the rest of the items in the line.</li>
            <li> I loved this product it really helps with the itching.</li>
            <li> It provides fast itch relief and it feels so good on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I loved the scalp soother.that tingle from the peppermint relived my scalp so fast</li>

            <li> It has a cool refreshing feeling that is perfect after a long day at the gym and it makes the hair feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Out of all of the products in the Moisture Care line I was most excited to try the Scalp Soother.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> So easy.</li>
            <li> I could tell easily from the package design that this product was meant for textured hair.</li>
            <li> could easily get that from any product that is water based.</li>
            <li> Feeling Amazing After A Good Shampooing and Deep Conditioning.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, immediately helped with itchiness, and didn&#x27;t give hair that &#x27;gel&#x27; feel.</li>
            <li> IN IT FROM SMELLING IT, NOT TO MENTION THAT STRONG PEPPERMINT SMELL TOO.</li>
            <li> THE SMELL IS STRONG BUT NOT SO STRONG THAT YOU COULDN&#x27;T STAND IT.</li>
            <li> As it progressed, the sensation did get stronger, but not too strong to the point of discomfort.</li>
            <li> Also I find the product is compariable to another high end, overpriced product, that I didn&#x27;t see nearly as good as results from.</li>
            <li> It provides a cool, tingling &amp; refreshing feeling.</li>
            <li> I just love the cool sensation my scalp feels.</li>
            <li> It did give a nice sensation when I first applied it</li>
            <li> It’s also super easy to use and the spray top is for targeted application, so you can use it anywhere at anytime.</li>
            <li> This is the head &amp; shoulders product that I absolutely loved all of the new products that came out.</li>
            <li> This is an easy and convenient to get itch free scalp.</li>
            <li> It worked quickly on my itchy scalp and the peppermint scent was an added bonus!  </li>
            <li> Luckily it does not have a medicinal smell at all!</li>
            <li> The positive - it smells really nice and the spray nozzle dispenses the product evenly with a fine mist.</li>
            <li> Thanks Head &amp; Shoulders for the free product!!</li>

            <li> received this product for free to do an review on thanks to Bzzagent and Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>

            <li> The instant scalp relief is amazing.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Head and Shoulders for letting me try this Moisture Care product for free.</li>
            <li> I love this product because I&#x27;m growing my hair out natural and just put braids in for protective styling.  </li>
            <li> It helped me keep my style fresh by not having to scratch all day.</li>
            <li> I tend to have issues with irritated scalp since I have transitioned from natural back to relaxed hair and this is honestly one product that I am glad to have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural and I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite product in the line.</li>
            <li> My hair is Loc&#x27;ed and therefore my my scalp is exposed to the elements every time i get a fresh retwist.</li>
            <li> My hair felt fresh and revived.</li>
            <li> spray on quite a bit at a time, I&#x27;m really surprised it hasn&#x27;t run out yet, but more for me.</li>
            <li> as far as actual healing is concerned honestly i think its nothing more than menthol in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Though I did receive this product FREE for review from BzzAgent, I am most definitely  fan.</li>
            <li> #ScalpSoother keeps my head fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li> my favorite product so far.</li>
            <li> I used in on freshly braided hair.</li>
            <li> After putting extensions for braids in my hair, is when my  scalp  is the most irritated , itchy and sensitive.  </li>
            <li> Besides the relief what I really liked about the product was it has nozzle dispenser with cap, this helps to get out only the required amount needed and avoid wastage.</li>
            <li> and I can honestly say this stuff instantly calms your itchy scalp so you don&#x27;t&#x27; be &amp;#34;digging&amp;#34; in your head all day at work or in the grocery store.</li>
            <li> In second relief from itchy dry scalp leaving scalp with a tinglely refreshing  cooling sensation This will be great hot summer days</li>
            <li> The nozzle is great for applying product right where you want it on the scalp and not on the hair and the cap locks in place, even being in my bag with heavy objects the cap stayed on.</li>
            <li> After i use this my scalp irritation is gone right away.</li>
            <li> I used this right after cowashing.</li>
            <li> The design of the nozzle help you spray the product right where you need it.</li>
            <li> right here I&#x27;m co-signing ALL DAY.</li>
            <li> PERSONALLY, WHEN I USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT FELT AMAZING.</li>
            <li> This leaves my scalp cool and calm while leaving my tresses straight and flowing between washes.</li>
            <li> It has a cool and refreshing tingle that stops your scalp from itching almost instantly.</li>
            <li> This really is helping me keep my scalp clean and moisturized.</li>
            <li> but this was the only one that worked, the peppermint oil did wonders for her scalp, this is a wonderful product to try hands down</li>
            <li> A few good squirts in those itchy areas, followed by a quick fingertip massage</li>
            <li> , I was lucky enough to get the head and shoulders moisture care scalp soother to try from bzzagent and it was an interesting experience.</li>
            <li> This product also has peppermint oil in it which creates a cool sensation with a tingle that really helps with the dryness</li>
            <li> I really love thus product and would purchase for my own personal use and would definitely recommend to others</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman with natural hair, I often wear weaves or braids and this product is perfect on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> So i put it to the test and after a long 10 hour day at work I had a nice scalp itch going.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day, and I feel like I have achieved an excellent balance between dry hair and greasy hair.  </li>
            <li> This will certainly be a stable of mine!</li>
            <li> This is truly a smart buy over and over again!</li>
            <li> course it would feel nice initially, so I decided to wait a bit and see if it really relieved her</li>
            <li> I have been keeping my hair braided the last few months and this is perfect for soothing an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I do like the bottle that it is a pump bottle making it easy to apply in either my hand or directly into my scalp.</li>
            <li> This was a cool new product to try!</li>
            <li> , it is very intense and soothes the scalp from itch.</li>
            <li> First I co-washed my hair,then I applied the smoother to my scalp.</li>
            <li> As a bzz agent I was given this product for free to try and I must say I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> the first thing I did was use the Moisture Care Scalp Soother.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the product overall and would recommend this specifically for women/men/</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I applied it to my scalp is exactly what it claims to deliver : relief.</li>
            <li> If you ever used a peppermint soap in your hair, that is exactly what it feels like.</li>
            <li> What is great about this is that it is a non-greasy formula with a peppermint oil complex and</li>
            <li> What works for one may be different for someone else, so I would recommend trying this product for yourself :-)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, it stops the itch instantly.</li>
            <li> It scared me a bit at first, but it eventually went away.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using Head and Shoulders, and my first time using a scalp soother.</li>
            <li> When I applied the solution on my scalp, nothing happened at first.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what is says... soothes the scalp.</li>
            <li> i would say this is a must for braids, the nozzle helps you get the product exactly where it&#x27;s needed and</li>
            <li> I was skeptic at first</li>
            <li> First time trying this product</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I used it after the shampoo/conditioner and scalp treatment.</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because although it seems like the product what the label says, and smells wonderful by the way, I was unable to use it.</li>
            <li> Then, sit back and feel it work its magic.</li>
            <li> I intend to keep using the product and supporting the brand.</li>
            <li> if it actually works, I may need to give it some more time.</li>
            <li> Use daily as often as needed because it goes on light with no greasy residue!</li>
            <li> When I first used it I didn&#x27;t feel a difference</li>
            <li> This product was sent to me to review by Head and Shoulders and this is a great product, I just would not buy it due to the fact that I don&#x27;t have a dry scalp and it is very rare that I would use it.</li>
            <li> I have some problems with my dry scalp and wanting to itch when I feel that sensation to, so when I tried this product that I received from Head and Shoulders/BzzAgent, I was happy to see that it worked instantly for me.</li>
            <li> Great thing about that is my daughter has coarse superthick dry hair.</li>
            <li> The thought of Head and Shoulders makes flashback to my childhood of using the original shampoo product, and then walking around for days smelling like old medicine.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and does not interfere with my other styling products.</li>
            <li> She has been using the new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection for almost a week now and it seems to be helping tremendously</li>
            <li> However it did leave a fresh feeling on my scalp which I think is the main idea of this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos and moisturizers and nothing has really worked.</li>
            <li> With this product, I was able to get that extra moisture without the heaviness of too much oil.</li>
            <li> AND most importantly, she is scratching at her hair less!</li>
            <li> but this product is not too strong and did the exact opposite!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sprays on clean with no mess, soothing your scalp within no time.</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, when I put this product in my head,  at first I was like &amp;#34;ugh, ok&amp;#34;, but it really does sooth the scalp and controls the itching.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product on my scalp it was very tingly.  </li>
            <li> So refreshing for my dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> My only con was that it  has a strong peppermint scent</li>
            <li> this product certainly will help even if it&#x27;s not immediately.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders has got it right with this new product.</li>
            <li> It almost instantly stops any itching and it&#x27;s light</li>
            <li> I RECENTLY RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE FROM THE HEAD &amp; SHOULDERS COMPANY.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really get the relief  </li>
            <li> I even raved about this so much to all my family and friends that they&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH EASIER.</li>
            <li> You can really feel that cooling sensation from the peppermint when applying it to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I also really like the smell</li>
            <li> I have very itchy scalp with eczema patches and this soothes it and relieves the itch.</li>
            <li> It will burn if you&#x27;ve scratched your head too much</li>
            <li> Thanks to Bzzagent and Head &amp;Shoulders</li>
            <li> I rated it a 5 star because it really works grate</li>
            <li> but it causes me to have dandruff and a very sore scalp (even without scratching).</li>
            <li> Thanks to www.bzzagent.com</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I received the entire Head &amp; Shoulders moisture care line free for being a Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> It really feels like a mint for the scalp and gives you a tingling sensation.</li>
            <li> and I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It really stops the itch and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> It really stops the itch and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since I&#x27;d never really heard of a scalp soother per say.</li>
            <li> Between the shampoo and this, I don&#x27;t know which soothed my itchy scalp, but one or a combination really worked.</li>
            <li> I use this  on my hair and my daughters hair and it helps so much.</li>
            <li> so I was very hopeful that this would help.</li>
            <li> Thanks to BzzAgent and Head&amp;Shoulders for providing me with a sample of the Scalp Soother.</li>
            <li> I went straight to my Buzz-kit and pulled out the Scalp Soother.  </li>
            <li> I think the Scalp Soother wasn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;soothing.&amp;#34; When I think of soothing I think calming, or relaxing.</li>
            <li> The scalp didnt have so much dandruff</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a bit of tingling, but not too much.</li>
            <li> This product provides so much relief when I can&#x27;t stand it anymore.</li>
            <li> Then, gently massage the oil onto the scalp, with the intention of evenly distributing the treatment.</li>
            <li> I really like this product..</li>
            <li> was gone and a day later I still am itch free.</li>
            <li> really didn&#x27;t provide me with anything</li>
            <li> Not only am I flake free now</li>
            <li> My scalp doesn&#x27;t need too much soothing, however, I tend to have some dryer areas that are known to be itchy.</li>
            <li> This product Does have a soothing effect which I would say is thanks to the peppermint.</li>
            <li> The Moisture Care &amp;#34;scalp soother&amp;#34; burns more if you use it after shampooing, because your scalp&#x27;s wet</li>
            <li> the Scalp Soother felt like it was really doing something.</li>
            <li> In the past this brand wasn&#x27;t my favorite and upon receiving this new line from the Bzz Agent campaign ( I received this for free)</li>
            <li> and I am glad we found each other.</li>
            <li> I love the tingling feeling i get due to the peppermint in it.</li>
            <li> but sure it does something for other hair types so gave it a 3 star.</li>
            <li> This product is simple to use, doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair and leave a nice cooling/refreshing sensation on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Okay so to start off my hair is super thick</li>
            <li> Instantly upon applying the scalp soother it leaves a soothing and cool sensation.</li>
            <li> the cool formal provides instant relief.</li>
            <li> I think I have found a new product for my hair!</li>
            <li> It also helps with preventing dry scalp and flaking which is a huge problem in my family.  </li>
            <li> I got this product free from Head &amp; Shoulders and it is my go to product every time my hair feels dry.</li>
            <li> And it just has my scalp feeling healthy and less stressed.</li>
            <li> Luckily there was no build up from the product, so it can be used daily.</li>
            <li> I think for me personally, the moisturing of the actual hair, was the most alluring.</li>
            <li> A coolness rushed over my scalp and it looks so healthy when usually it would look pretty dry.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps me to get only amount needed to sometimes apply on back of my head which itches the most.</li>
            <li> When I first sprayed this on my scalp, it just felt a little cool but within a minute my scalp was tingling all over and feel very soothed!</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair and its not good to wash it more than twice a week</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for anyone that has itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great at keeping my scalp from getting too uncomfortable between washes which is important in order to keep from needing to over wash my hair and therefore making it too dry or brittle.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> The one thing that I think is a con and one that I can overlook is if the product could be a little more thicker</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s provides a nice cooling feeling on my scalp and hardly find myself itching my head when used as directed.</li>
            <li> and my scalp tends to be drier than normal</li>
            <li> I normally just use oils.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product through BZZ Agent as a promotion from Head and Shoulders and I use this product in the morning, in the middle of the day, at night, pretty much anytime</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions but add a few more pumps throughout the scalp.</li>
            <li> It took a few minutes but my scalp was soothed and itch free and my wedding updo was saved!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times since I wash my hair more frequently in the summer, but I will definitely keep this around for winter!</li>
            <li> For the price thought might be worth it for someone you doesn&#x27;t mind reapplying on a regular bases.</li>
            <li> My scalp is sensitive, gets irritated easily and is very dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy to think how many different oils, shampoos, and special product lines I have tried only to get relief from one that is available right from Amazon!</li>
            <li> The product itself doesn&#x27;t seem a whole lot different from the original Head and Shoulders, but the change in smell alone has convinced me to buy the new stuff next winter.</li>
            <li> After spraying it on, I massage it through and usually just style it as needed, although I mainly use it as a cherry on top for my wash and go days.</li>
            <li> this is my new go to product.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t associate the Head &amp; Shoulders brand with my hair type; but this product will be a new staple for me.</li>
            <li> I received the new Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother as a promotional offer from Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I do suffer from itchy dry scalp so this helps tremendously when I have braids or any type of hair style.  </li>
            <li> and it just seems to calm the irritation immediately and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait for the summer to get here to try this in my hair while it is hot and humid outside...</li>
            <li> It keeps working throughout your busy day!</li>
            <li> Was unsure how it would be but since the first squirt on my itchy scalp definitely has given me relief.</li>
            <li> I found that it was a little too strong.  </li>
            <li> My day to day time is very limited due to demands of my eight month old son and my full time job, so finding something that helps me feel clean in hurry is must.  </li>
            <li> While I am transitioning my hair back to its natural state, I was excited to see that Head &amp; Shoulders has finally come out with a product for textured hair.</li>
            <li> I received a product sample, coupon, collateral or other special premium from BzzAgent or the brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product 3 times now total and am still seeing a positive impact on my hair and scalps moisture levels.</li>
            <li> Its mess free and doesn&#x27;t drip.</li>
            <li> Its mess free and doesn&#x27;t drip.</li>
            <li> It can be used on wet or dry hair, or even when you feel your scalps needs refreshing or itching.</li>
            <li> I spritz it right on my dry spots and massage it in.</li>
            <li> Will definately be letting my family and friends know about this wonderous little gem that I tried, because I got it free from head &amp; shoulders.</li>
            <li> I just squirt a little in the part and smooth it on with my finger.</li>
            <li> My hair was breaking off and dull at the top</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even felt comfortable wearing my hair down!</li>
            <li> I really thought it was really helpful when brushing wet her.</li>
            <li> my scalp has clear of dandruff.</li>
            <li> After cleansing my scalp, I applied this directly to it.</li>
            <li> i have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> I am 100% natural</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not all natural</li>
            <li> This product is a MUST HAVE for people with natural hair.</li>
            <li> I personally woke up one morning and was getting ready for work when my scalp started to itch.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions on the bottle and applied the product directly to my scalp.</li>
            <li> Head and shoulders scalp soothers was a complete mystery to me.</li>
            <li> but this product helps me the next day to freshen up and mosturize my scalp while getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> I am a natural girl</li>
            <li> Used this on braids that were a month old.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised at the cooling, moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li> I have an intensely itchy scalp on the back portion of my head, but I don&#x27;t have dandruff.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair moisturized  &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was pleasantly  surprised.</li>
            <li> No matter how much shampoo/conditioner or hair treatment I applied I would feel itchy and scratch my head the next day after a wash.</li>
            <li> Okay so sometimes especially with curly hair you cannot wash everyday even when you have itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> , my scalp isn&#x27;t the dry and itchy scalp I had when I first started using the product.  </li>
            <li> Now after my long walks I just apply it after taking my shower and no more itchy scalp, I had even use it when I have my sweaty itchy scalp, the cool and tingle sensation when applying it, offers relief right</li>
            <li> The soother helps moisturize your hair during the day and morning so that it keeps fresh, especially if you are a person who does not have time for a complete was and dry in their day.</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase this product again and highly recommend it to any one who braids their hair or put in weaves and extensions.</li>
            <li> For a woman like me who alwasy wears braids has always searched high and low for soothing product.</li>
            <li> My son has very itchy scalp and his hair is long.</li>
            <li> IT DID HELP CALM DOWN MY ITCHY SCALP, BUT I NEEDED TO CONTINUE USING IT TO CONTINUE SEEING RESULTS.</li>
            <li> I will certainly be buying this in the future and highly suggest it to anyone with dry scalp issues, especially for those of you who have natural hair!</li>
            <li> , I feel like a doggie with fleas, I usually take a shower right away, it does calm my itchy scalp, but not completely, so finding Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother, offered a solution to that problem.</li>
            <li> With this product as soon as my scalp becomes irritated, normally around the nape area, I do a few quick sprays and there is an instant cooling relief.</li>
            <li> I have a very itchy dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Very comforting too a dry itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> The only downside (maybe just because my hair is really thick) is that it takes way more product than what the instructions say to cover your scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair is super curly and very dry, so every little bit of moisture really helps.</li>
            <li> I hoped it lived up to the major hype.</li>
            <li> But I use this about every other day on my scalp and I have seen a real reduction of flakes!</li>
            <li> ONCE APPLIED, I FELT A STRONG COOLING SENSATION THAT DIDN&#x27;T LAST FOR NO MORE THAN ABOUT 15 SECONDS.</li>
            <li> Just to mention, my hair type is wavy, frizzy, fine  strands, and thick ponytail ( 4 inches circumference).</li>
            <li> It keeps my head itch free doesnt leave my hair hard or flakey.</li>
            <li> Well as of lately my head has been itchy and irritated so when I got this product (free by the way)</li>
            <li> This product really works, I have tried a lot of products for my itchy scalp before that never really worked.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product for natural and relaxed hair types.</li>
            <li> By the second use I could notice a considerable difference in my scalp health and the softnes of my air.</li>
            <li> But lid was kind of weird.</li>
            <li> It felt kind of weird.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone suffering from a dry, itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I was actually really afraid you&#x27;d be able to see it in my hair, but it really does go straight to the scalp -- and mine tends to be dry and itchy after not washing for three days.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this because I often have dry scalp.</li>
            <li> The other day I was getting ready for a wedding and my hair was already in an updo and my scalp started itching.</li>
            <li> and I live in Colorado (dry town USA), so</li>
            <li> So the first thing I did was squirt the product into the palm of my hand and gave it a little sniff.</li>
            <li> I can use it when I first get out of the shower, when my scalp is getting a little itchy, when my hair is getting &amp;#34;uncomfortably dry&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have mixed (black and white) hair that I wear natural and straight.</li>
            <li> You just spray this directly onto your scalp (the long nozzle reaches through your hair) and rub in with the pads of your fingers.</li>
            <li> wasnt very water down like a lot of scalp treatments and helped with the itch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used the Head and Shoulder&#x27;s cowash the previous day and really didn&#x27;t want to wash again.</li>
            <li> my scalp really well wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have such dry and itchy scalp AND natural hair that is pressed.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick, curly and super coarse hair</li>
            <li> This Is Such A Smart Little Invention.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s always evident when I&#x27;m having a flaky day, but for weeks now, I have seen little to none!</li>
            <li> It was a little intense, almost like I dumped a bottle of peppermint oil on my scalp...</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and my scalp can get a little sensitive.</li>
            <li> I like to use it after being outside when my scalp needs little cool down.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a major problem with dry or itchy scalp, but I tried this out through BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised by the tingling and cooling sensation due to it having peppermint oil in it.</li>
            <li> Normally after installing braids, my scalp can be reddened if the extensions were put in too tightly</li>
            <li> The bottle is small, I was scared to use to much because I didn&#x27;t want to run out before my shampoo was gone.</li>
            <li> I have a dry scalp and the entire collection is helping me get rid of flakes.</li>
            <li> Definitely give this spray a try if your scalp is dry and itchy all of the time.  </li>
            <li> --occasionally I end up with a dry itchy scalp as a result.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair that I typically wear in a twist-out.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, itchy scalp I definitely recommend you give this one a try.</li>
            <li> So, I use it on a dry scalp and each night before my next shampoo shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was quite surprised that the product was non-greasy and didn’t go running down my face like other products, rather it was creamy and fluid enough for me to massage onto my scalp in sections.</li>
            <li> I felt like the applicator nozzle or tip was annoying, as it comes off pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I have very dry flaky hair, and this differently helps!</li>
            <li> The city where I live tends to be humid and very hot, and my mayor scalp problem is when I get overheated, and sweaty after a long walk or a workout, then I get a crazy itchy scalp</li>
            <li> I have severe scalp issues due to a very poor hairdresser so although it&#x27;s getting better I still have some sensitivity</li>
            <li> I wear sew in extensions and after long wear my scalp becomes itchy and has dandruff...</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> I use Head and Shoulder products all winter long to prevent flakes, but I can&#x27;t say I ever felt like I was treating myself or that it was a luxury product  because of the not so luxurious smell.</li>
            <li> I have long nails and try to avoid scratching my head because it can leave scars on my scalp.</li>
            <li> You can feel the tingling long after you spray it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if anyone has tracks and ect in there hair, ladies stop patting your hair or taking that long tooth comb</li>
            <li> The tingle from the menthol lasted too long.  </li>
            <li> I also thought because of the long pointed look of the applicator nozzle that the soother would come out like a mousse, but it is not.  </li>
            <li> It has a mentholated effect that you can feel long after application.</li>
            <li> The quality ingredients in the scalp soother reach deep down into your scalp to actually stop the itch in its tracks!</li>
            <li> As a woman of AfroCaribbean decent, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find products for my hair type.</li>
            <li> My scalp has been in need of this soother for a very long time</li>
            <li> This works wonders because my scalp gets dry and itchy between washes and this product is a miracle for soothing a itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> My scalp is kinda of dry at times.</li>
            <li> During the warmer months my hair becomes dry and my scalp itchy.</li>
            <li> I APPLIED THIS TO MY DRY HAIR IN BETWEEN WASHES OVER A COURSE OF A MONTH.  </li>
            <li> I have always dealt with a itchy and dry scalp</li>
            <li> I received this product as part of a brand promotion from BzzAgent and used it product immediatley on my dry scalp/hair.</li>
            <li> My hair and scalp literally eat moisturizers and are often dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is constantly dry</li>
            <li> and I have  issues with a dry scalp and am prone to dandruff.</li>
            <li> I tried this product during a dry scalp day.</li>
            <li> i just used on dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made with peppermint oil and vitamin E oil and it cooled my dry itchy scalp in minutes.  </li>
            <li> My daughter always has a problem with a dry scalp in the summer</li>
            <li> Do you have a dry scalp?</li>
            <li> This can often lead my scalp to feel a bit dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my daughter to soothe her dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Her scalp &amp;#34;eats&amp;#34; moisturizers and is often dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had issues with dandruff and dry scalp but, since using this product</li>
            <li> It was so dry</li>
            <li> if you feel like your scalp is dry or the sun is hitting your head</li>
            <li> I find myself using it in the morning and in the evening because it truly controls the dry itchiness.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re out and about on the town and your hair is feeling crunching and dry?</li>
            <li> My scalp can get a bit dry, flacky and sore, so I decided to use this scalp soother as soon as I got is.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Which means I suffer from scalp irritation, intense burning and a ridiculous need to scratch, which then produces flakes and then comes the scalp sores.</li>
            <li> I do not feel the need to wash it out and let my hair air dry,</li>
            <li> it non greasy on my dry hair.</li>
            <li> Being a woman of color, washing  my hair every single day just isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s a manageable task.</li>
            <li> Right when I applied it to my scalp I felt a dramatic difference in the amount of irritation and a cooling affect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin enough to actually be applied directly on your scalp.</li>
            <li> I go like the way it comes out the bottle like a loose gel.</li>
            <li> You can re-apply throughout the day on wet or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I see less flaking (we use the shampoo and conditioner from the same line, by the way)</li>
            <li> I have used for than half the bottle in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> and my scalp tends to dry out and itch especially during harsh winters of Chicago.</li>
            <li> i recently braided my hair and the braids were a bit too tight.</li>
            <li> : if you are not into tingling sensation on your scalp, very sensitive scalp, or excessive sun exposure to the scalp (didn&#x27;t wear a hat to the beach) please do not use this!</li>
            <li> The only thing is it burned a little because I was scratching but with this soothing product my scratching days are over.</li>
            <li> It was a little sticky and we were concerned it would make hair feel grimy and gross, but it didn&#x27;t do anything of the sort.  </li>
            <li> I have been battling dry itchy flaky scalp for some time now and have tried some products that was recommended for me due to this scalp condition</li>
            <li> IN MY HAIR CARE PRODUCTS, SO THIS MADE ME REALLY CURIOUS.</li>
            <li> I used this as soon as I felt an itch or irritation, which was not very often with the Moisture Care line.</li>
            <li> The next thing I noticed was a tingling sensation that intensified over a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Give it a try, use it everyday for a week before making a solid opinion of it.</li>
            <li> I have thick natural kinky hair</li>
            <li> It has a small nozzle that you put against your scalp and you just press the serum directly on the area that&#x27;s a little itchy.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way though</li>
            <li> A little bit of this goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I decided to braid my hair and noticed my scalp was dry and tight feeling.</li>
            <li> I just see no need for it aside from rehydrating the hair with something other than water, which is how I&#x27;ve been using it since it doesn&#x27;t work for its intended purpose.</li>
            <li> which is why I gave 4 stars, but other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> This is due to the peppermint oil it is infused with.</li>
            <li> It smells like peppermint, too, but the smell goes away as the tingle does so it wont interfere with the scent of any other hair products you&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I thought that it was just menthol and tea tree oil and that it wouldn&#x27;t help my dandruff.</li>
            <li> 30 minutes after I was done applying the product like he does other products I have used on him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that don&#x27;t work as well as</li>
            <li> this.the peppermint oil is soothing, and even if your scalp is irritated, I didn&#x27;t experience any burning as with some other products.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t give it a 4 or 5 star due to it</li>
            <li> In only a few spritz, my scalp was soothed and  refreshed with peppermint and vitamin E!</li>
            <li> The winter is brutal on my scalp, and this is very soothing and has a fresh scent.</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t so dry as it usually is, due to the Moisture Care line from Head &amp; Shoulders, so A++ for that!!</li>
            <li> Mostly behind my ears and near the center of my head.</li>
            <li> I did notice a few flakes a few days later, but that could be because I need to shampoo my hair as well.</li>
            <li> When I can&#x27;t get my hair wet after going to the salon, I can get a little relief if my scalp starts to itch.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t oily, and feels water based (it&#x27;s hard to describe) but it definitely won&#x27;t have you walking around looking like a ball of grease!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is really dark</li>
            <li> I had to use a lot though because my hair is so thick, so I wish it came in a bigger bottle..</li>
            <li> I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy nor does it weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> Other than that I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> This product does re-leaves  dry scalp for a small period of time.</li>
            <li> I typically use it every 2 to 3 days in the evening and massage my scalp for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to buy expensive essential oils and products to get the same result!</li>
            <li> I have serious dry scalp issues that often cause me extreme discomfort, scabs and sores.</li>
            <li> I did not need to reapply every day which would mess up my styles.</li>
            <li> and it didnt leave a mess everywhere.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always wearing my hair in braids and twists and my scalp can sometimes get a little itchy.</li>
            <li> and I fell a little itch on my scalp</li>
            <li> and it burned a little.</li>
            <li> The spray comes out a little concentrated and not mist like.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t wowed by the rest of the line, but this little product I&#x27;m SOLD on.</li>
            <li> A Little Bottle Of Heaven.</li>
            <li> Whenever You Need A Little Moister To Your Scalp.</li>
            <li> However a little cumbersome to keep squirting it all over the head.</li>
            <li> Being biracial, it can very hard to find hair products that actually work.</li>
            <li> In using it for a few days, I noticed it did nothing for my scalp.</li>
            <li> After a few days my scalp started to itch</li>
            <li> I followed up with a few pumps of the Scalp Soother to my scalp.</li>
            <li> I did not know what my scalp was missing.  </li>
            <li> I took the leap, collected a few drops of the product and rubbed it into my scalp.</li>
            <li> Change in season always brings trouble for my scalp</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t mess up my hairstyle!  </li>
            <li> and I was a little scared that it would leave my hair very dried.</li>
            <li> This was my go to product for the past few weeks.  </li>
            <li> In the middle of the night, I wake up several times because my scalp itches so badly.</li>
            <li> There are limited brands I stand behind</li>
            <li> OMG I need this feeling everyday after a hard days work.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference on my scalp or felt any tingling which usually happens when using peppermint on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what the Scalp Soother did for my hair or scalp.</li>
            <li> getting even a small bit of extra moisture can be difficult.</li>
            <li> Even though the product does deliver and does everything it says it will, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this on a small child&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> (She is 8 by the way and usually squirms if I even touch her hair!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also tried using it as a hair/scalp refresher after going on a 4 mile walk, and was too lazy to wash my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> Helped with the itching dandruff usually causes me.</li>
            <li> but obviously I was wrong.</li>
            <li> No medicated smell (like ones I&#x27;ve used in the past) nor was it greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been prescribed numerous expensive types of medicated oils, sprays, rubs and shampoos that never resolved the issue...</li>
            <li> My colorist noticed tons of flakes while blow drying my hair and embarrassingly recommended their scalp spray for my excessive dandruff.</li>
            <li> so it doesnt clog my pores.. and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard or stiff</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using this product because I get dry skin when using coconut body wash and lotion</li>
            <li> I try not to put a lot of product on my hair, to avoid build up and a dingy look, but I figured, that putting a dab or two directly on my scalp wouldn&#x27;t hurt to bad.</li>
            <li> I also used it on my son&#x27;s head and he hasn&#x27;t complained of a itchy scalp yet</li>
            <li> It cooled on contact and it kept away itchiness away from where you applied it for at least 4 hours.</li>
            <li> After using it just one time, my head is itch-free for at least 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li> She has naturally thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was shocked by how cooling it was and how it sooth my scalp, while not being oily or giving my hair some weird bulidup.</li>
            <li> and my hair is not looking crazy after a long day!</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle, it&#x27;s not greasy</li>
            <li> Its difficult finding a scalp treatment that wont revert my hair or leave it greasy and stiff.</li>
            <li> How ever the smell is not pleasant</li>
            <li> and I have very thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and curly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, your hair is very thick and curly and you struggle with keeping it moisturized after washing and drying it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to those who want relief of itchy &amp; irritating scalp.</li>
            <li> The Scalp Soother decreased the  discomfort</li>
            <li> Plus I always get dandruff during winters which made the itch worse.</li>
            <li> and if you have any idea on how bad your scalp itches after you take them down then you would understand my pain.</li>
            <li> Omg I was s little shocked at this  product, didn&#x27;t think it was going to work</li>
            <li> a little disappointed that the nozzle was broken when I got it</li>
            <li> The winters here in Ohio have been quite brutal lately, so dry skin is something we deal with often.</li>
            <li> If you are seeking to &#x27;sooth&#x27; your scalp.. search no more and give this a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t burn or anything, it just felt weird.</li>
            <li> As for now, I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> then it starts to tingle like Mr. Winter is blowing cold air on my scalp.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t feel dirty after use.</li>
            <li> Nobody would have ever guessed that i went to the movies with dirty hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a bit skeptical, but now I am a believer in Head &amp; Shoulders!</li>
            <li> I must admit that  I was very skeptical of the product before trying it.</li>
            <li> Daughter has really bad flakes</li>
            <li> I suffer from bad dandruff since I have been using head and shoulders</li>
            <li> This scalp soother helped in between washes when the dandruff was bad.</li>
            <li> The sensation wasn&#x27;t horrible but it was slightly uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> but the smell isn&#x27;t annoying or over powering.</li>
            <li> I hate dandruff and a itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> I just hate the smell of hand sanitizers is all.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed if you are looking for something to keep your scalp moisturized!</li>
            <li> and it wasnt terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this product.. I use it on my sides which are cut short.. It almost instantly stops any itching and it&#x27;s light so it doesnt clog my pores.. and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair hard or stiff</li>
            <li> This has repaired the damage to my scalp. My hair was breaking off and dull at the top until I used this now it shines and my texture of hair holds up better.</li>
            <li> Was given this for free&lt;br /&gt;I love the results it brings my hair!!</li>
            <li> I tried the moisture care scalp soother and felt like product did nothing. The positive - it smells really nice and the spray nozzle dispenses the product evenly with a fine mist. I did not feel any scalp relief from the product at all. In using it for a few days, I noticed it did nothing for my scalp. Luckily there was no build up from the product, so it can be used daily. I just see no need for it aside from rehydrating the hair with something other than water, which is how I&#x27;ve been using it since it doesn&#x27;t work for its intended purpose. I received a free sample from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> Daughter has really bad flakes and I&#x27;ve tried so many different shampoos and moisturizers and nothing has really worked. She has been using the new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection for almost a week now and it seems to be helping tremendously I received the products for free through BzzAgent</li>
            <li> I love the scalp soother and it helps with my itchy scalp omg it a good product I&#x27;m so happy with my head and shoulders product thanks for Buzz agent #gotitfree</li>
            <li> I love this product because I&#x27;m growing my hair out natural and just put braids in for protective styling.  This works wonders because my scalp gets dry and itchy between washes and this product is a miracle for soothing a itchy scalp. I highly recommend this product and I&#x27;m sure it works on all hair types.</li>
            <li> i have braids on and within 3 weeks after having them, my scalp was just on fire ( was so itchy). But i happen to receive that product for free right on time from bzzagent. Not only it helps soothing the itchiness on myscalp, it smells so good. I would definitely recommend this product. Love it</li>
            <li> Used the soother and my hair loved it. I would recommend this product. So glad to have tried this product for free for a promotion, Thanks Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li> My scalp is kinda of dry at times. I was able to try the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Smoother, thanks to BuzzAgent and Head &amp; Shoulders at no cost. First I co-washed my hair,then I applied the smoother to my scalp. (And a couple of days after I wash my hair my scalp will start to itch.) Now I am day 3 on this co-wash and my scalp is still not itching. I truly recommend the product. For all types of hair textures, If you have a itching problem try the smoother.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review after receiving a free sample at BzzAgent.com This new Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother is amazing! After cleansing my scalp, I applied this directly to it. I was quite surprised by the tingling and cooling sensation due to it having peppermint oil in it. Peppermint oil is an essential oil that is good for eliminating bacteria and also beneficial to hair growth. Thank you BA and Head &amp; Shoulders for allowing me to try your product!</li>
            <li> I RECENTLY RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT FREE FROM THE HEAD &amp; SHOULDERS COMPANY. THE PROMOTIONAL OFFER DOES NOT INFUENCE MY REVIEW. THIS PRODUCT RELIEVES REDNESS, ITCHING AND DRYNESS ALMOST INSTANTLY. THE SCALP SOOTHER ALSO HAS A GREAT SMELL, SO IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR SMELLING CLEAN AND FRESH. PERSONALLY, WHEN I USED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME, IT FELT AMAZING. IT SOOTHES ON CONTACT. THE GREAT THING IS YOU CAN USE THIS WHENEVER YOU WANT. IT ALSO MOISTURIZES YOUR HAIR AND SCALP OVER TIME. LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!1</li>
            <li> I could not find any use for this product. Only good thing about it is it worked really good with smelly sour scalp. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> This is indeed a scalp soother!! I have been battling dry itchy flaky scalp for some time now and have tried some products that was recommended for me due to this scalp condition but I didn&#x27;t really get the relief  I was looking for. I was trilled when I received this &#x27;&#x27;miracle worker&#x27;&#x27; in the mail from BzzAgent!! Actually, they sent me Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother Treatment, Moisture Care Dandruff Co-Wash Conditioner and  Moisture Care 2-in-1 Dandruff Shampoo Plus Conditioner (all in full-sized bottle)!!! I have used this products and I can confidently say that it works! If you are seeking to &#x27;sooth&#x27; your scalp.. search no more and give this a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Thank you BzzAgent for this free samples and the opportunity of trying products before purchasing them. Like I already mentioned, I got these products free from BzzAgent, so my review is 100% hype free!!!!</li>
            <li> As a bzz agent I was given this product for free to try and I must say I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. During the warmer months my hair becomes dry and my scalp itchy. So I used the head and shoulders scalp soother and it actually have me relief. I also used it on my son&#x27;s head and he hasn&#x27;t complained of a itchy scalp yet and this was three days ago. The smell is subtle, it&#x27;s not greasy which is a big plus and it actually does what it says.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this product!! It soothed my scalp and felt so tingly. I had to use a lot though because my hair is so thick, so I wish it came in a bigger bottle..</li>
            <li> This products stops itching immediately.  I recently received this product as a part of a promotion from the brand. I use this as a quick spot treatment on my hair when it starts itching. I also use it between washes and its great.</li>
            <li> My hair is super curly and itchy. The Scalp soother does just that...soothers the itch and the dryness. And the smell, that hint of mint is awesome!! Thanks Head &amp; Shoulder for sending this products out FREE for me to try.</li>
            <li> Soothes my scalp and  has a great cooling effect. My scalp feels great after I spritz this product all over.&lt;br /&gt; I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand</li>
            <li> When I received the Head and Shoulders Moisture Care For Textured Hair Collection the first thing I did was use the Moisture Care Scalp Soother. It smells great (if you like peppermint) but I didn&#x27;t notice a difference on my scalp or felt any tingling which usually happens when using peppermint on the scalp. After washing my hair with the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care 2-in-1 shampoo I tried the Scalp Soother again and felt a nice tingle on my scalp. The nozzle is great for applying product right where you want it on the scalp and not on the hair and the cap locks in place, even being in my bag with heavy objects the cap stayed on. The bottle is small, I was scared to use to much because I didn&#x27;t want to run out before my shampoo was gone. As nice as this product felt on my scalp I&#x27;m not sure what the Scalp Soother did for my hair or scalp. After a few days my scalp started to itch so I added more Scalp Soother but it did not help. I washed my hair again but didn&#x27;t add the soother and the itch never came back so I assume it had to do with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free to do an review on thanks to Bzzagent and Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li> This does a good job soothing the scalp. It provides a nice cool, tingling &amp; refreshing feeling. It smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue. I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> This product was sent to me to review by Head and Shoulders and this is a great product, I just would not buy it due to the fact that I don&#x27;t have a dry scalp and it is very rare that I would use it. I&#x27;m glad it was sent to me and it feels great on the scalp with the peppermint oil working it&#x27;s magic but I just wouldn&#x27;t buy it myself. #GotItFree</li>
            <li> WOW!! This stuff is great. I got the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother free from BzzAgent as part of a 3 pc product line to test out. I was very excited because I love anything with a coconut scent and I have very thick, curly hair. Being biracial, it can very hard to find hair products that actually work. When I first sprayed this on my scalp, it just felt a little cool but within a minute my scalp was tingling all over and feel very soothed! My son even tried it and absolutely loved it! The winters here in Ohio have been quite brutal lately, so dry skin is something we deal with often. I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am with this product. I will certainly be buying this in the future and highly suggest it to anyone with dry scalp issues, especially for those of you who have natural hair! Kudos to Head &amp; Shoulders!! Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this product when I am on the go and my hair needs a refresher. It soothsayer my scalp without drying out my hair. It reliefs my itching instantly! I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> I love the Head and Shoulder Scalp Soother. I workout 5 days a week and my scalp tends to be drier than normal so this helps to soothe it.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free from Buzz Agent... .. this product has my scalp tingling.... it actually feel so soothing on my scalp... but&lt;br /&gt;it did not put any moisture in my hair...</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! this is my new go to product. I&#x27;m so happy i was sent this for free in my buzz kit. i have naturally curly hair so I&#x27;m always wearing my hair in braids and twists and my scalp can sometimes get a little itchy. I have been looking for a product to sooth my scalp for the longest and when i tried this i was like OMG! I just pump some on my scalp and massage it in and its like magic! the cooling sensation feels so good and soothing. After i use this my scalp irritation is gone right away. i LOVE this product. i will buy this over and over again. I even raved about this so much to all my family and friends that they&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> I LIKE THIS ONE TOO. I ALREADY USE PEPPERMINT AND ROSEMARY OIL IN MY HAIR CARE PRODUCTS, SO THIS MADE ME REALLY CURIOUS. RIGHT OFF THE TOP, I LIKE THE NOZZLE IN THAT IT MAKES APPLICATION SO MUCH EASIER. YOU CAN TELL IT HAS ALCOHOL IN IT FROM SMELLING IT, NOT TO MENTION THAT STRONG PEPPERMINT SMELL TOO. THE SMELL IS STRONG BUT NOT SO STRONG THAT YOU COULDN&#x27;T STAND IT. I APPLIED THIS TO MY DRY HAIR IN BETWEEN WASHES OVER A COURSE OF A MONTH.  I LIKE THAT IT&#x27;S NOT STICKY TOO. ONCE APPLIED, I FELT A STRONG COOLING SENSATION THAT DIDN&#x27;T LAST FOR NO MORE THAN ABOUT 15 SECONDS. IT DID HELP CALM DOWN MY ITCHY SCALP, BUT I NEEDED TO CONTINUE USING IT TO CONTINUE SEEING RESULTS. EVEN THOUGH I RECEIVED THIS AS A PROMOTION FROM THE BRAND, I WOULD PROBABLY GO AND BUY THIS IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li> The Scalp Soother is said to cool the scalp and to improve its moisture balance. After I had washed my hair I followed up with a few pumps of the Scalp Soother to my scalp. Instantly I could feel the cooling effects. I received a product sample, coupon, collateral or other special premium from BzzAgent or the brand.</li>
            <li> I have mixed (black and white) hair that I wear natural and straight. I got this product for free from Head &amp; Shoulders to test and review, this did not influence my opinion. I am so excited that the Head &amp; Shoulders brand has expanded with styling aids. I used this as soon as I felt an itch or irritation, which was not very often with the Moisture Care line. It cooled on contact and it kept away itchiness away from where you applied it for at least 4 hours. You can re-apply throughout the day on wet or dry hair. I loved the refreshing peppermint smell. I smelled it constantly throughout the day and it kept my mood uplifted just smelling it. It helped me keep my style fresh by not having to scratch all day. It kept flakes away while moisturizing my roots and scalp. Very good product if you have braids or a fixed style for long periods. I think this would also be great for weaves and extensions, too!</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, when I put this product in my head,  at first I was like &amp;#34;ugh, ok&amp;#34;, but it really does sooth the scalp and controls the itching. I love the cool sensation I get from the Moisture Care Scalp Soother that I received free from Head &amp; Shoulders!! I have always dealt with a itchy and dry scalp but when I used this product the itching has truly stopped and I am so thankful for it. My hair isn&#x27;t so dry as it usually is, due to the Moisture Care line from Head &amp; Shoulders, so A++ for that!!</li>
            <li> I love this product my new fave!!</li>
            <li> I like the applicator bottle, its so easy to use! It is soothing and great for natural braided or twist up hairstyles.</li>
            <li> I am not in constant need of this product but to have it on hand is a MUST!  Scalp irritation can occur at anytime, whether you have a dandruff problem or not.  The convenience of the bottle makes it a NO BRAINER on whether or not to keep this with you at all time!</li>
            <li> I can not express how much I love this product. I am 100% natural so my hair often struggles with moisture retention, so this product was just perfect for me. You can really feel that cooling sensation from the peppermint when applying it to the scalp. I loved this part because it felt as if my scalp was getting a lot of oxygen to my hair follicles and scalp. I will %100 be buying this product as well as adding it to my daily hair regimen. so grateful for the opportunity to try this product. I am so glad I got to try it free from Head &amp; Shoulders! :)</li>
            <li> I really love this scalp soother.  I received this from BzzAgent for review and this is great.  I did not know what my scalp was missing.  Its very moisturizing for my normally dry scalp and has a great cooling feeling about a minute after application.  I also really like the smell and it was immediate relieve to my itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I have some problems with my dry scalp and wanting to itch when I feel that sensation to, so when I tried this product that I received from Head and Shoulders/BzzAgent, I was happy to see that it worked instantly for me. This soother feels nice and cool on my scalp and smells pretty good as well. Love the pump and how much product comes out. I&#x27;ll definitely be using this regularly and suggest you get some too!</li>
            <li> Love love love this scalp soother. So refreshing for my dry itchy scalp. Got it free through bzzagent from head n shoulders and will def be buyin!</li>
            <li> Love this! It was offered to me from Head &amp; Shoulders for free to try out. I have thick natural kinky hair and I don&#x27;t associate the Head &amp; Shoulders brand with my hair type; but this product will be a new staple for me. I have very itchy scalp with eczema patches and this soothes it and relieves the itch. This product also has peppermint oil in it which creates a cool sensation with a tingle that really helps with the dryness and it just feels good. It will burn if you&#x27;ve scratched your head too much and it&#x27;s not all natural which is why I gave 4 stars, but other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free product to test and I used it on my daughter&#x27;s hair because of her itchy scalp and as soon as I put it on her, she stopped the itching and I tried a lot of products to stop her itch but this was the only one that worked, the peppermint oil did wonders for her scalp, this is a wonderful product to try hands down</li>
            <li> I love this. It leaves my hair n scalp feeling great. I received this free as a BzzAgent From head and shoulders. I will definitely be purchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li> I received this product as part of a brand promotion from BzzAgent and used it product immediatley on my dry scalp/hair. I have naturally thick, curly and super coarse hair so anything with moisture is a plus. My hair and scalp literally eat moisturizers and are often dry. I&#x27;ve tried a plether of products to help and was thrilled when I recieved this one from BzzAgent. I Loved the smell of the product as much as the rest of the items in the line. They all have this amazing coconutty scent to them and what seams to be a peppermint like substance.&lt;br /&gt;Upon applying the soother, the tingle/cooling sensation was very pleasant. I spent a decent amount of time massaging it into my scalp because it felt so wonderful. I think for me personally, the moisturing of the actual hair, was the most alluring. My hair is constantly dry and I live in Colorado (dry town USA), so getting even a small bit of extra moisture can be difficult. With this product, I was able to get that extra moisture without the heaviness of too much oil. I&#x27;ve used the product 3 times now total and am still seeing a positive impact on my hair and scalps moisture levels. I really enjoyed the product overall and would recommend this specifically for women/men/children with thicker, dryer hair.</li>
            <li> I received the Head &amp; Shoulders Scalp Soother from Bzz Agent to try and I have to say this is my favorite product for an itchy irritated scalp. Once I apply it to my scalp the product starts to work instantly. I would recommend this product to all my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Omg I was s little shocked at this  product, didn&#x27;t think it was going to work but it did</li>
            <li> Used this and it didn&#x27;t mess up my hairstyle!  It worked quickly on my itchy scalp and the peppermint scent was an added bonus!  I received the product as part of a free promotion but the benefits are priceless!</li>
            <li> Okay so to start off my hair is super thick and I have  issues with a dry scalp and am prone to dandruff. I tried this product during a dry scalp day. It has the perfect dispenser to quickly and easily deliver the product to the scalp without making a huge mess. The first thing I noticed when I applied it to my scalp is exactly what it claims to deliver : relief. My thirsty scalp was instantly moisturized. The next thing I noticed was a tingling sensation that intensified over a few minutes. This is due to the peppermint oil it is infused with. The sensation wasn&#x27;t horrible but it was slightly uncomfortable.Even though the product does deliver and does everything it says it will, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this on a small child&#x27;s head. Will definitely buy.I got this product for free to try from BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> I tend to have issues with irritated scalp since I have transitioned from natural back to relaxed hair and this is honestly one product that I am glad to have. Initially I received it as part of a product review from bzzagent and I am so glad that I joined the challenged. With this product as soon as my scalp becomes irritated, normally around the nape area, I do a few quick sprays and there is an instant cooling relief. I wish I would have found this product sooner because it would have saved me plenty uses of hair grease to help with the irritation. Truly an amazing product to have for textured hair.</li>
            <li> I recently got my hair braided, which starts with pain and then followed by itching.  The scalp soother is great for both, it helped ease the paid and stopped the itching almost immediately.  Great for itchy scalps!!!  The smell is amazing and the product is not heavy at all! Would definitely recommend! #gotitfree</li>
            <li> As a member of bzzagent I&#x27;ve received this product for free &amp; it is something that I will purchase &amp; continue to use. Sloths my scalp really well wet or dry hair. I recommend it to those who want relief of itchy &amp; irritating scalp.</li>
            <li> This was a very cool experience. I really thought it was really helpful when brushing wet her. But lid was kind of weird. But it did what it said it cooled my scalp</li>
            <li> I received the Head &amp; Shoulders Scalp Soother from BzzAgent to try out and it worked well on my hair..I wear sew in extensions and after long wear my scalp becomes itchy and has dandruff...This took the itchiness away..Nice product.. Glad I was able to try it.. #gotitfree</li>
            <li> I received the H&amp;S Moisture Care Scalp Soother as a promotion, and I used it after the 2in1 shampoo/conditioner and the Co-wash. This was the icing on the cake it felt so great on my scalp it was cooling and tingly, the smell was great as well. The only thing is it burned a little because I was scratching but with this soothing product my scratching days are over.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for free and these opinions are 100 % my own.  I recieved this product for free from Bzz agent.  I absolutely love this spray it stop itchiness instantly. I use it as a moisturizing product for my scalp daily. It keeps my head itch free doesnt leave my hair hard or flakey. love the tingly feeling that leaves my scalp freeling fresh and clean</li>

            <li> I loved the tingly feeling when using this product on my scalp.  It helps my hair feel refreshed and clean.  It also helps with preventing dry scalp and flaking which is a huge problem in my family.  Thanks to Bzzagent and Head &amp;Shoulders I was able to try this product free.</li>
            <li> I received head &amp; shoulders moisture care scalp soother for free, it works wonders, it refreshes my scalp and really helps the dandruff stay away.  I think this is a grate product that i would recammend others to use and try out.... try now it really works you will love it too. I received my head &amp; shoulders moisture care collection from bzzagent its grate. I rated it a 5 star because it really works grate</li>
            <li> I received the new Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother as a promotional offer from Bzzagent. It gave me an instant cooling sensation which felt amazing and wonderful. I loved the coconut smell. This product gave my hair moisture which I need. I really love thus product and would purchase for my own personal use and would definitely recommend to others</li>
            <li> No itchy braids and twists. this stops the problem in  a minute. i just used on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;was a free sample</li>
            <li> I tried this product through a BzzAgent campaign. Anywho, the daily moisturizer is the bomb! It has a cool refreshing feeling that is perfect after a long day at the gym and it makes the hair feel silky smooth. I tried the cowash with my go to shampoo on Saturday and my hair still feels amazing! I am definitely going to purchase that as my cowash moving forward. Haven&#x27;t tried the shampoo yet but all of the products smell heavenly. I&#x27;d recommend the cowash and leave in to friends in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> This product work really good on textured hair. My hair is very thick and curly. I suffer from bad dandruff since I have been using head and shoulders my scalp has clear of dandruff. I no longer have that itchy scalp and dryness like I use to. I got these products for free from buzzAgent.</li>
            <li> This was a product I reviewed via Bzzagent , and one I&#x27;m glad I got the pleasure of doing so. I&#x27;ve suffered with mild sebaceous dermatitis on my scalp but it causes me to have dandruff and a very sore scalp (even without scratching). After co-washing my hair with their Moisture Care system Co-Wash I massaged some of the Scalp Soother on my scalp and instantly I could feel it working. A coolness rushed over my scalp and it looks so healthy when usually it would look pretty dry.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little disappointed that the nozzle was broken when I got it but I&#x27;ve made it work by applying the solution to the tips of my fingers and massaging it thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;If you have issues with your scalp I&#x27;d definitely recommend this and the entire Moisture Care system.</li>
            <li> Great not just for naturals or textured hair but for everyone with a scalp. Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother does just that, soothes the scalp. Out of all of the products in the Moisture Care line I was most excited to try the Scalp Soother. If you ever used a peppermint soap in your hair, that is exactly what it feels like. I use this at night and its great addition to my nightly regimen as it literally soothes me to sleep. I can&#x27;t wait for the summer to get here to try this in my hair while it is hot and humid outside...it should be sooo soothing. I received this awesome product for free as a BzzAgent in promotion with Head and Shoulders.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free courtesy Bzzagent and head and shoulders.The scalp soother is refreshing especially on hot days. It&#x27;s like being in the shower with the water falling on your head. It&#x27;s the perfect supplement for getting that extra wash.</li>
            <li> The peppermint oil leaves my scalp nice and cool. The soother relieved the spot, then blended into my hair like a moisturizer. Nice product that I received from BzzAgent &amp; Head &amp;Shoulders for free to use and to review. (Don&#x27;t forget to take the cap off, lol, I did at first, wondered why it wasn&#x27;t spraying, lol, my fault, lol)</li>
            <li> After receiving this product as part of a promotion I tried this scalp soother.  It was refreshing to my scalp, it has a cooling sensation after it is applied to the scalp. A great benefit is that it has peppermint oil which is a great natural product, overall it is soothing and useful for those itchy scalp days.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for reducing or removing dandruff and improving hair quality overall.  For textured hair; this scalp treatment works in-between washes to provide cooling relief and improve moisture balance.  What is great about this is that it is a non-greasy formula with a peppermint oil complex and vitamin E.  It’s also super easy to use and the spray top is for targeted application, so you can use it anywhere at anytime. I&#x27;ve always thought there was no way for my hair/scalp to ever feel properly moisturized and I was going to be stuck with so-so hair for the rest of my life. Since discovering Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection I have realized that I can have the hair I want! I also love that it is pH balanced and gentle on chemically treated hair.  I use it every other day, and I feel like I have achieved an excellent balance between dry hair and greasy hair.  Which basically means my hair feels perfect now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand.</li>
            <li> This was my go to product for the past few weeks.  It&#x27;s made with peppermint oil and vitamin E oil and it cooled my dry itchy scalp in minutes.  It&#x27;s a wonderful product.  my scalp really enjoyed this treat.  I use it after I wash or anytime of the day my scalp needs the attention.  This product really works, I have tried a lot of products for my itchy scalp before that never really worked.  This is a great product. Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care was sent for free from Head &amp; Shoulders</li>
            <li> This product is a MUST HAVE for people with natural hair. I got this product free from Head &amp; Shoulders and it is my go to product every time my hair feels dry. Immediately when applied, this product smooths the scalp and distributes a lot of moisture in my scalp. In addition, the peppermint oil and vitamin E in there causes my scalp to tingle in a good way.</li>
            <li> I received the product for free to test it. This spray is the bees knees! A little goes a long way though, it is very intense and soothes the scalp from itch. I also like to use it after I detangle my hair. It also leaves your hair smelling really good as well.</li>
            <li> I have truly been enjoying this new product from Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care line. It has such a pleasant smell. My hair feels soft and fluffy. Thanks to www.bzzagent.com I had the pleasure of trying this product. I so recommend this product. I&#x27;m natural and I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my scalp feel. Its definitely refreshing. The peppermint scent is wonderful.As a BzzAgent I got this FREE in a BzzKit from head&amp;shoulders! Full size to try...and with a coupon to purchase my next bottle of Head&amp;Shoulders Scalp Soother!</li>
            <li> I received the Head and Shoulders Moisture Care scalp soother spray free as a tester from Head and Shoulders . This is by far my favorite product in the line. It has a cool and refreshing tingle that stops your scalp from itching almost instantly. The scent is fabulous as well. The only downside (maybe just because my hair is really thick) is that it takes way more product than what the instructions say to cover your scalp. Otherwise, an excellent product.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. I loved this product it really helps with the itching. I think it has tea tree oil in it so it smells good and it leaves your scalp tingling but it feels soothing,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Head and Shoulders shampoo and conditioner since I was younger, but I&#x27;d never used the &#x27;Scalp Soother&#x27; spray gel. I received it free from Head and Shoulders, through the BzzAgent website. I was hesitant to try it at first, because I thought that it smelled really strong. I finally used it and I found that although it smells strong, it&#x27;s a pleasant smell, and the product really does what it claims to do. It&#x27;s super soothing and cooling on itchy skin. I&#x27;ve found that while it works really nicely on my scalp, it works even better on freshly shaved legs to combat itchiness and irritation. I would reccomend this to all who are looking for itching skin remedies.</li>
            <li> Soothing and cool!&lt;br /&gt;I liked the sensation after applying it to the scalp area.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not a heavyweight hair product, so it&#x27;s easy-to-use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking scalp conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. This is the perfect answer for an itchy scalp.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. Instantly upon applying the scalp soother it leaves a soothing and cool sensation. Thanks to BzzAgent I was able to try this for free!</li>
            <li> I use Head and Shoulder products all winter long to prevent flakes, but I can&#x27;t say I ever felt like I was treating myself or that it was a luxury product  because of the not so luxurious smell. However, the new Head and Shoulders Moisture line has made an improvement on it&#x27;s scent, which I have really enjoyed. The product itself doesn&#x27;t seem a whole lot different from the original Head and Shoulders, but the change in smell alone has convinced me to buy the new stuff next winter. I received this as a Buzz Agent Campaign.</li>
            <li> I love this. It leaves my hair n scalp feeling great. I received this free as a BzzAgent From head and shoulders. I will definitely be purchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li> . My daughter always has a problem with a dry scalp in the summer so I was hoping that this 2 in 1 wash on top of the scalp soother it might do the trick. Well it did! My daughter has not complained of her scalp feeling itchy and she said that her hair smells good and feels good. The product did not disappoint on the quality. First the smell of the products are refreshing. The scalp soother smells like fresh peppermint and it does feel good on the scalp. Its like very cool water tingling on your head. I give these products 5 out 5 stars. In fact, I have already bought more to make sure that we do not run out. I received the product free from Head &amp; Shoulders</li>
            <li> Do you have a dry scalp? If so this is the product for you. I used the soother as a part of the moisture care collection and I was very pleased. I have a dry scalp and the entire collection is helping me get rid of flakes. For that I am truly grateful. Would defiantly recommend. I received the products courtesy of bzzzagent but did not receive any incentives to give a good review.</li>
            <li> I was able to try this product for free as part of a campaign for #BzzAgent and #Head&amp;Shoulders. Love this product! It provides fast itch relief and it feels so good on my scalp. Its provides a cooling sensation on my scalp. What works for one may be different for someone else, so I would recommend trying this product for yourself :-)</li>
            <li> It immediately stopped the itching and it felt so soothing on my scalp!</li>
            <li> Surprisingly better than I thought it&#x27;d be. Left my scalp feeling great and lasted all day/ Well satisfied.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free from Head and Shoulders. I must admit that  I was very skeptical of the product before trying it. The thought of Head and Shoulders makes flashback to my childhood of using the original shampoo product, and then walking around for days smelling like old medicine. So the first thing I did was squirt the product into the palm of my hand and gave it a little sniff. Luckily it does not have a medicinal smell at all! Score #1 for Moisture care scalp soother. My hair is Loc&#x27;ed and therefore my my scalp is exposed to the elements every time i get a fresh retwist. This can often lead my scalp to feel a bit dry and itchy. I try not to put a lot of product on my hair, to avoid build up and a dingy look, but I figured, that putting a dab or two directly on my scalp wouldn&#x27;t hurt to bad. I took the leap, collected a few drops of the product and rubbed it into my scalp. Score #2 for Moisture care! I received instant itch relief. I was hooked from the start. Now whenever I am home and I fell a little itch on my scalp, I grab the bottle, squirt out a drop or two and I apply it. Instant relief. I couldn&#x27;t ask for better results!</li>
            <li> I decided to braid my hair and noticed my scalp was dry and tight feeling. I&#x27;d used the Head and Shoulder&#x27;s cowash the previous day and really didn&#x27;t want to wash again. Before braiding, I sprayed the Head and Shoulders scalp soother and massaged it for 5 minutes. My hair felt fresh and revived. I received the entire Head &amp; Shoulders moisture care line free for being a Bzzagent.</li>
            <li> I had the chance to try this product from Head and Shoulders for free for my review of the product through bzz agent I love this product it smells great and makes my scalp feel refreshed and cool. I use this product when I get out of the shower and it just makes my whole scalp feel amazing. The spray nozzle bottle it comes in is easy to use and sprays just the right amount with every spray.  highly recommend this product and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Got to try this as part of a BzzAgent promotional campaign and loved it. If you&#x27;re like me, your hair is very thick and curly and you struggle with keeping it moisturized after washing and drying it. Well, this is a great fix. It&#x27;s peppermint scented but the smell isn&#x27;t annoying or over powering. It really feels like a mint for the scalp and gives you a tingling sensation. It isn&#x27;t oily, and feels water based (it&#x27;s hard to describe) but it definitely won&#x27;t have you walking around looking like a ball of grease!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray on quite a bit at a time, I&#x27;m really surprised it hasn&#x27;t run out yet, but more for me. After spraying it on, I massage it through and usually just style it as needed, although I mainly use it as a cherry on top for my wash and go days.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this! I received head &amp; shoulders scalp soother from Bzzagent to try out and I really like this product. I use it all the time now because it provides instant relief &amp; a cooling sensation to my scalp. It&#x27;s the perfect sized bottle and easy to apply. It also contains peppermint oil &amp; vitamin e which is the perfect combination. Its mess free and doesn&#x27;t drip. It really stops the itch and moisturizes very well. I&#x27;m glad I discovered this because this is exactly what I needed.</li>

            <li> I really like this product. I hate dandruff and a itchy scalp. And I have to say ever since I received this produced for free from Bzzagent I have no complaints in the region. I will definitely keep this stocked in my closet!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with this scalp soother. It leaves my scalp feeling tingly and the peppermint aroma is amazing. It leaves my scalp feel refreshed and not itchy. My hair is natural and this product is awesome and does wonders for my scalp is feeling dry and itchy. I will definitely purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I received Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother from BzzAgent to try for free. I absolutely love this product, it stops the itch instantly. Just spray it on and the itch is gone. I would buy this product and recommend it also.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest I was sent this product through Bzzagent for free, review is my own opinion and I am not being compensated for it. I really love this product it works and delivers on each of the benefits it claims. The price is right, its widely available, and it&#x27;s made by a trusted and well known brand. It can be used on wet or dry hair, or even when you feel your scalps needs refreshing or itching. I have been using this product for over 6 weeks and my hair feels amazing, my scalp isn&#x27;t the dry and itchy scalp I had when I first started using the product.  Also I find the product is compariable to another high end, overpriced product, that I didn&#x27;t see nearly as good as results from.</li>
            <li> **Disclaimer** I received this product from Head&amp;Shoulders as a Bzzagent with Bzzagent.com.  The product was sent to me to test and review.  Although this product was free I am only providing my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to start by saying I&#x27;ve never used any type of moisturizing spray for my scalp. I normally just use oils. When I first used this product on my scalp it was very tingly.  It scared me a bit at first, but it eventually went away. I used this right after cowashing. I live the fact that the design makes spraying your scalp very easy. The shell is just amazing and soothing alone.  I did the recommended spray amount (15 I believe) and massaged it into my scalp.  This spray threw me off because it was like water.  However, once it hit my scalp and I massaged it in I felt the oils kicking in.  I do suffer from itchy dry scalp so this helps tremendously when I have braids or any type of hair style.  Definitely give this spray a try if your scalp is dry and itchy all of the time.  It truly works.</li>
            <li> This little gem is the perfect solution to &#x27;between washing itching&#x27;. Being a woman of color, washing  my hair every single day just isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s a manageable task. My day to day time is very limited due to demands of my eight month old son and my full time job, so finding something that helps me feel clean in hurry is must.  Plus when you get a good workout going who doesn&#x27;t want to be clean from head to toe afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received my free sample, from head &amp; shoulders, of the scalp soother I hoped it lived up to the major hype. So i put it to the test and after a long 10 hour day at work I had a nice scalp itch going. Mostly behind my ears and near the center of my head. A few good squirts in those itchy areas, followed by a quick fingertip massage and there was instant itch relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt like the scalp soother heated up just a bit then it starts to tingle like Mr. Winter is blowing cold air on my scalp. Within moments my head was no longer itching and I felt a clean peacefulness. Will definately be letting my family and friends know about this wonderous little gem that I tried, because I got it free from head &amp; shoulders.</li>
            <li> I like it, I was lucky enough to get the head and shoulders moisture care scalp soother to try from bzzagent and it was an interesting experience. I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect since I&#x27;d never really heard of a scalp soother per say. I washed my hair and used the corresponding shampoo and conditioner I was also sent and gave the &amp;#34;soother&amp;#34; a try. It feels like a cooling sensation, it absolutely gave me a nice cool fresh feel. For some reason I didn&#x27;t expect it to feel like anything  I thought it was more of a remedy. Its a nice product that I think works best during a hot day but as far as actual healing is concerned honestly i think its nothing more than menthol in a bottle.</li>
            <li> I received the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother for free through BzzAgent to try and review. This was my first time using Head and Shoulders, and my first time using a scalp soother. I actually didn&#x27;t know this existed. But it does and seems to work. I love the smell of all the products I&#x27;ve tried in the H&amp;S Moisture Care line, but this was my favorite scent. Between the shampoo and this, I don&#x27;t know which soothed my itchy scalp, but one or a combination really worked.</li>
            <li> I received the product free from Head &amp; Shoulders to test. I have such dry and itchy scalp AND natural hair that is pressed. Its difficult finding a scalp treatment that wont revert my hair or leave it greasy and stiff. This leaves my scalp cool and calm while leaving my tresses straight and flowing between washes.</li>
            <li> Before you purchase this product know that this peppermint oil totally revitalizes your head. I was like OMG I need this feeling everyday after a hard days work. I will be purchasing and recommending this product in this line after my trial bottle is up because after 5 uses within 2 weeks it made me feel like I was on Cloud 9 each and every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;#GotItFree: I received this a a free gift.</li>
            <li> I received Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care collection for free from BzzAgent. I used the Scalp Soother today after washing with the co-wash. It made my scalp feel refreshed and cooled. The scent of the peppermint oil in it is very appealing. Just to mention, my hair type is wavy, frizzy, fine  strands, and thick ponytail ( 4 inches circumference). I recommend this scalp soother for women or men to comfort the scalp. I will keep using Head and Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother.</li>
            <li> I received this about 2 mos ago to review, and in those 2 mos this has become my absolute favorite product in my hair care routine. Every time I wash my hair, I pump this onto my scalp. The tingle from the peppermint feels amazing on my freshly washed scalp. It smells like peppermint, too, but the smell goes away as the tingle does so it wont interfere with the scent of any other hair products you&#x27;ve used. I like using this in between washes whenever my scalp itches for a quick reprieve.</li>
            <li> Now this stuff is great the smell and the cool breeze on the scalp! #bzzagent</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use products from Head &amp; Shoulders since teenage years so I was eager to try free full size samples received from Head &amp; Shoulders  I really love the scalp soother think this is the best out of moisture care line would give six stars I would absolutely love this product. Just part hair mist on scalp massage in. In second relief from itchy dry scalp leaving scalp with a tinglely refreshing  cooling sensation This will be great hot summer days</li>
            <li> I love this. It leaves my hair n scalp feeling great. I received this free as a BzzAgent From head and shoulders. I will definitely be purchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I thought that it was just menthol and tea tree oil and that it wouldn&#x27;t help my dandruff. But I use this about every other day on my scalp and I have seen a real reduction of flakes! My hair is really dark so it&#x27;s always evident when I&#x27;m having a flaky day, but for weeks now, I have seen little to none! I&#x27;ve even felt comfortable wearing my hair down! Brava! This was received free to test and and review.</li>
            <li> I did receive this product from Head &amp;Shoulders Via BzzAgent campaign.  The reviews are my own.&lt;br /&gt;I did use this product after my was and once during the middle of the week.  When it claims to sooth the scalp and keep it flake free it is the truth.  It also has no awful scent whats so ever which I need since my hair is relaxed and I wash it once a week.</li>
            <li> Though I did receive this product FREE for review from BzzAgent, I am most definitely  fan. I have super curly hair and its not good to wash it more than twice a week--occasionally I end up with a dry itchy scalp as a result. This product is simple to use, doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair and leave a nice cooling/refreshing sensation on your scalp. I like it!</li>
            <li> This  product has Vitamin E oil in it so it is really good my hair. I liked that this product wasn&#x27;t too oily and had a spray nozzle that made it very easy to apply. A little bit of this goes a long way. My only con was that it  has a strong peppermint scent but if you love peppermint scented things you&#x27;ll love this! I&#x27;m glad I got to try this out for free from Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li> I received s sample from BzzAgent to review, and this product is awesome. After using the co- wash and 2in1 shampoo, I applied the scalp soother. It is the best hair product I&#x27;ve used in a long time. It leaves a cool feeling to your scalp from the peppermint oils it contains.</li>
            <li> When given the opportunity to try this product for free by Head and Shoulders, I was excited. I have always used the traditional method of using a tooth comb to scratch my scalp., but we all know that leads to some bruises and soreness on the scalp. When I applied the solution on my scalp, nothing happened at first. But after a couple seconds, I started feeling the tingling sensation. I spread all over my head and felt so good. As it progressed, the sensation did get stronger, but not too strong to the point of discomfort. After the sensation subsided, there was no itch and I felt so good. Definitely a favorite of mine now!</li>
            <li> Free sample from buzzagent -&lt;br /&gt;I think that the Head &amp; Shoulders (H&amp;S) Moisture Care Scalp Soother is a good product for those moments when you don&#x27;t feel like cleansing your hair, but it needs a little love and affection. I personally woke up one morning and was getting ready for work when my scalp started to itch. As I had to be to work soon and didn’t have time to wash and condition my hair, I decided to try out the H&amp;S Moisture Care Scalp Soother. I followed the instructions on the bottle and applied the product directly to my scalp. The applicator bottle that the product came in is great because it allowed me to apply the product directly to my scalp. I was quite surprised that the product was non-greasy and didn’t go running down my face like other products, rather it was creamy and fluid enough for me to massage onto my scalp in sections. The product is almost scent-free with a light peppermint smell that quickly evaporates. After applying the product I felt a (good) tingling sensation, I assume the peppermint was smoothing my scalp at that point because the itching went away. My scalp felt a lot better within minutes of applying the H&amp;S Moisture Care Scalp Soother to my scalp. Overall, I think this product serves its purpose and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received the Head and Shoulders Scalp Soother free to try out by being a Bzz Agent. Head and shoulders scalp soothers was a complete mystery to me. I applied the product to my hair when it was itchy but nothing. It smells really nice but it did not soothe my itch. It felt like I was just spraying coconut water on my hair. The scalp soother is some what out of place in my opinion i can not see the fit with the rest of the product line.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this scalp soother it helps relieve my itchy scalp in between washes. I use this  on my hair and my daughters hair and it helps so much. i received this for free from head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> I recieved a full sized bottle FREE from BZZAGENT and HEAD &amp; SHOULDERS and I was really impressed! I workand sometimes ( don&#x27;t judge) I do not wash my hair but this product helps me the next day to freshen up and mosturize my scalp while getting ready for work. I was skeptical about using this product because I get dry skin when using coconut body wash and lotion but this product is not too strong and did the exact opposite! Did I mention how AMAZING this smells?!? Way to go head &amp; shoulders for making the Scalp Soother so pleasant to us!</li>
            <li> I received this product from BzzAgent in exchange for my review. I have using this product for several weeks and it has become a MUST for maintaining my hair. It does exactly what is says... soothes the scalp. What I love most is the sensation my scalp feels the moment the soothing peppermint makes contact. It feels so refreshing. While I am transitioning my hair back to its natural state, I was excited to see that Head &amp; Shoulders has finally come out with a product for textured hair. I would definitely recommend this product for natural and relaxed hair types. It provides cooling, soothing feeling while also moisturizing with vitamin E. Loving the results. #ScalpSoother keeps my head fresh and moisturized.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job at soothing the scalp. It provides a cool, tingling &amp; refreshing feeling. It smells great and does not leave any residue. I love it and it is my go to product when I do not have time to wash my hair. Thank you BzzAgent for the opportunity to try this product for free.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most innovative hair products I have ever tried! The quality ingredients in the scalp soother reach deep down into your scalp to actually stop the itch in its tracks! The product provides instant and continual relief upon application. It keeps working throughout your busy day! I would highly recommend this to anyone suffering from a dry, itchy scalp. An amazing product!!!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product through BZZ Agent as a promotion from Head and Shoulders and I use this product in the morning, in the middle of the day, at night, pretty much anytime I need a bit more moisture on my scalp.  Its great and I love the way it makes my scalp feel!  You will not be disappointed if you are looking for something to keep your scalp moisturized!</li>
            <li> I love the feeling I get with this product. Easy to use. Has a nice tingle to let you know it&#x27;s working</li>
            <li> I used this product on my daughter to soothe her dry scalp. She has naturally thick, curly hair. Her scalp &amp;#34;eats&amp;#34; moisturizers and is often dry. We have tried EVERYTHING to keep her from scratching at it. Quite naturally I was THRILLED to receive the H&amp;S BzzKit from BzzAgent.com. I received a full-sized bottle of the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She liked the smell instantly--coconutty-pepperminty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tingle/cooling sensation was something unexpectedly pleasant. As I was massaging it into her scalp she sighed and fell asleep. (She is 8 by the way and usually squirms if I even touch her hair!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it would feel nice initially, so I decided to wait a bit and see if it really relieved her discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been three days. When I comb her hair I see less flaking (we use the shampoo and conditioner from the same line, by the way) AND most importantly, she is scratching at her hair less! It&#x27;s crazy to think how many different oils, shampoos, and special product lines I have tried only to get relief from one that is available right from Amazon! (Also in Walmart.)</li>
            <li> i received this product for free from Bzzagent. I loved the scalp soother.that tingle from the peppermint relived my scalp so fast I didn&#x27;t feel the need to scratch all day.i also love that i&#x27;m see new growth. i would say this is a must for braids, the nozzle helps you get the product exactly where it&#x27;s needed and the smell is amazing! #GotItFree</li>
            <li> I just recently tried this and I am amazed at how soothing is is to my scalp. I have been keeping my hair braided the last few months and this is perfect for soothing an itchy scalp. I just squirt a little in the part and smooth it on with my finger. So easy. I will definitely keep using this! #GotItFree</li>
            <li> Worked well soothing my scalp. I am a natural girl and it wasnt terrible. It did however leave build up on my scalp. Im not a fan of scratching and product buildup under my nails.  I would recommend this product to friends. I will pair it with another type of shampoo and see it i get better results. I got this product free from being a bzz agent</li>
            <li> I immediately tried the scalp soother upon opening the box. I felt the tingling of the ointment and my scalp was no itching anymore. I did notice a few flakes a few days later, but that could be because I need to shampoo my hair as well. I am excited to try the shampoo and conditioner when I take my braids out this weekend.</li>
            <li> I was skeptic at first but I actually like this! It burns like heck but it gets rid of the dandruff. Must have! After one use I was able to see a difference. My scalp is sensitive, gets irritated easily and is very dry. I think I have found a new product for my hair! #MoistureCare and #GotItFree</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to say how much I love this product! I was lucky to receive this product to try through BzzAgent and I will always keep this item in stock. It&#x27;s provides a nice cooling feeling on my scalp and hardly find myself itching my head when used as directed.</li>
            <li> I Tried this product via BzzAgent and was highly impressed.  I used this while my hair was in braids and it stopped the itching and was cool and tingly.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand and loved it!  The soothing sensation was so nice and refreshing on my irritated scalp.  Change in season always brings trouble for my scalp but this is definitely a helper.  The only thing I wasn&#x27;t fond of was the sort-of greasy feeling it left on my roots after application.  Other than that I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> The city where I live tends to be humid and very hot, and my mayor scalp problem is when I get overheated, and sweaty after a long walk or a workout, then I get a crazy itchy scalp, I feel like a doggie with fleas, I usually take a shower right away, it does calm my itchy scalp, but not completely, so finding Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother, offered a solution to that problem. I did not know this product existed until my Bzzcampaign, after using this product I am so happy with the results. Now after my long walks I just apply it after taking my shower and no more itchy scalp, I had even use it when I have my sweaty itchy scalp, the cool and tingle sensation when applying it, offers relief right away.&lt;br /&gt;I #GotItFree because I am a BzzAgent.</li>
            <li> My scalp has been in need of this soother for a very long time and I am glad we found each other. I received this soother for free for review purposes and I truly love the result. I think applying it after washing my hair with the moisture care 2 in 1 shampoo and co wash made it the icing on a cake. This scalp soother has a non-greasy formula with peppermint oil and vitamin E  resulting in a  cooling relief after application and it does improve moisture balance in between washes. Its a must have because the itch on my scalp has reduced a lot.</li>
            <li> I received this free from BzzAgent to test and give my honest feedback. This is my favorite product in the Moisture Care line by leaps and bounds. I did not need to reapply every day which would mess up my styles. It smells nice and does not interfere with my other styling products. Head &amp; Shoulders really did a good job with this product so please do not discontinue it!</li>
            <li> Perfect for natural hair. I received Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Serum as a promotion. I can actually say it was a blessing. My son has very itchy scalp and his hair is long. He&#x27;s always scratching so I was very hopeful that this would help. I did it went above and beyond my expectations. First the smell is fabulous and my son likes it also. The feeling when I sprayed it on his scalp was as he stated &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34;. It made his scalp look so clean and moisturized. The test for me was to see if he would be scratching his head 30 minutes after I was done applying the product like he does other products I have used on him. Well 30 mins passed and hour passed 8 hours passed a day passed and I can actually say as for myself noticing him and also him letting me know he didn&#x27;t scratch his scalp for almost 2 days. I&#x27;m very happy with the results and I tend to purchase not only the serum when I run out but also the completed line. The one thing that I think is a con and one that I can overlook is if the product could be a little more thicker but hey its working so im not complaining. Head and Shoulders has got it right with this new product.</li>
            <li> First time trying this product and I must say I like it. Smells great and my scalp feels good after I use it. I did receive this product free from Head and shoulders through bzzagent and I&#x27;m so glad I did otherwise I would have never known about it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an African American woman with natural hair, I often wear weaves or braids and this product is perfect on my scalp.  I began working out so my scalp sweat a lot, this was perfect for the times I couldn&#x27;t wash my hair but needed to calm the itching and just to get that clean feeling.  Works immediately and didn&#x27;t affect the hairstyle</li>
            <li> This product is best used &amp;#34;whenever you need it&amp;#34; lol. And I love that! I can use it when I first get out of the shower, when my scalp is getting a little itchy, when my hair is getting &amp;#34;uncomfortably dry&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s the perfect consistency, its not like a lotion or a conditioner. It&#x27;s thin enough to actually be applied directly on your scalp. I will definitely be buying this all the time. I received mine free from Head and Shoulders via Bzzagent.  The  Best Product I&#x27;ve ever Tried!</li>
            <li> I had always known about the Head &amp; Shoulders brand but, their new Moisture Care line is amazing. I received three of their products to review from BzzAgent and I have to say that I&#x27;m already amazed at how my hair and scalp feel after using the products. The Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother is, I think, my favorite product so far. The instant scalp relief is amazing. I&#x27;ve always had issues with dandruff and dry scalp but, since using this product my scalp feels amazing!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product after I got it free thanks to H&amp;S and BzzAgent. While I did get it to try out this is my honest thoughts of the product. I only want to help you. First and foremost, I used it after the shampoo/conditioner and scalp treatment. As soon as I applied it I felt my scalp instantly tingle. It was so dry and it felt so amazing! By the second use I could notice a considerable difference in my scalp health and the softnes of my air. I like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky or greasy nor does it weigh my hair down. And, it has a great smell! This is a great product thus far and I cannot wait to see the continued benefits.</li>
            <li> I liked using this and was happy with the use of this product. Highly recommend for anyone that has itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> The Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother is must have for itchy scalp. All you have need to do is spray the scalp soother and rub it into your scalp for instant cooling. It&#x27;s sprays on clean with no mess, soothing your scalp within no time. This is an easy and convenient to get itch free scalp. You could bring this to work, gym, or school. No need to use a comb or your fingers to scratch your head. I have long nails and try to avoid scratching my head because it can leave scars on my scalp. The Scalp Soother helps me avoid that habit. I just love the cool sensation my scalp feels. You can feel the tingling long after you spray it. The Head &amp; Shoulder scalp smoother has peppermint oil which is refreshing but it also contains menthol. Remember to wash your hands after use because the smell of the menthol lingers. It&#x27;s non-greasy or sticky, so you&#x27;re hair won&#x27;t feel dirty after use. The bottle size is good value as you only need a little bit to get great results. After using it just one time, my head is itch-free for at least 2 or 3 days. It&#x27;s good to use between washes. My hair is super curly and very dry, so every little bit of moisture really helps. I would definitely recommend this for relief from itchy scalp.Thanks to BzzAgent and Head&amp;Shoulders for providing me with a sample of the Scalp Soother. The Scalp Soother is apart of the Head&amp;Shoulder Moisture Care Collection which has a 2-1 Shampoo &amp; Co-Wash Conditioner, and I also recommend both products from the moisture care collection.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. i love this product. I have used it more than once since i received it. I love the tingling feeling i get due to the peppermint in it. It let me think that it doing work. The peppermint only last for a short time so you don&#x27;t get that long-lasting over powering scent. If you have tried this Scalp soother by Head and shoulders, i suggest you do. Get that flake free scalp!</li>
            <li> if you feel like your scalp is dry or the sun is hitting your head just put the head and shoulder Moisture scalp use this yesterday this was my BFF I had it in my purse my hair was itching and I just put this on my hair and instant relief. I don&#x27;t know if anyone has tracks and ect in there hair, ladies stop patting your hair or taking that long tooth comb this will help. trust me.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free from buzzagent to try and I have to stay that this will continue to be on my beauty counter, its a must to have.</li>
            <li> I had just taken my braids out and if you have any idea on how bad your scalp itches after you take them down then you would understand my pain. I went straight to my Buzz-kit and pulled out the Scalp Soother.  I received it from Head &amp; Shoulders to test out and it couldn&#x27;t have come at a better time. The nozzle was easy to make sure the product got right where i needed it and it didnt leave a mess everywhere. wasnt very water down like a lot of scalp treatments and helped with the itch.</li>
            <li> I really love this scalp soother, it&#x27;s great for my protective styles because it has a nozzle it can get in between my braids and extensions with making the hair greasy. I typically use it every 2 to 3 days in the evening and massage my scalp for 20 minutes. The peppermint oil and the massages stimulates the scalp and causes better circulation which causes growth and a healthier scalp. This really is helping me keep my scalp clean and moisturized. I&#x27;m glad bzzz agent sent me this for free to try, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! It came in a bzzkit that I was sent free by bzzagent. The first time I used it I was shocked by how cooling it was and how it sooth my scalp, while not being oily or giving my hair some weird bulidup. I use this after washing my hair. And it just has my scalp feeling healthy and less stressed.</li>
            <li> This soother product is a must have for that on the spot tingling feeling that makes you know that it&#x27;s working. The soother works great in combination with the other head and shoulders products in this line. I received this for free from the company to try  .</li>
            <li> This is a great scalp soothing product safe to use on textured hair. I&#x27;ve tried other products that don&#x27;t work as well as this.the peppermint oil is soothing, and even if your scalp is irritated, I didn&#x27;t experience any burning as with some other products. When I can&#x27;t get my hair wet after going to the salon, I can get a little relief if my scalp starts to itch. Thanks to Head and Shoulders for letting me try this Moisture Care product for free. It&#x27;s my favorite product in the line!</li>
            <li> I received the scalp soother to review from Head &amp; Shoulders through BzzAgent. I have natural hair that I typically wear in a twist-out. Before I used the shampoo or the co-wash from the Moisture Care line, I tried the Scalp Soother immediately. I really liked the cool sensation that I received all over my scalp when I applied the serum. I also liked how you apply the product. It has a small nozzle that you put against your scalp and you just press the serum directly on the area that&#x27;s a little itchy. It has the mint tingle that feels good and soothes &amp; cools immediately. I&#x27;ve also now used it after the 2-n-1 shampoo/conditioner and the co-wash and it just seems to calm the irritation immediately and lasts for a long time. I find myself using it in the morning and in the evening because it truly controls the dry itchiness. This is a definite keeper!</li>
            <li> I received this free product from Head &amp; Shoulders. I keep hair braided. This scalp soother is amazing. I used in on freshly braided hair. My scalp felt instant relief. I also used this after working out. It has a great minty smell. It helps to eliminate any sweat odors on the scalp between washes. It doesn&#x27;t leave any type of residue. Great product. I will definitely used this again.</li>
            <li> Well as of lately my head has been itchy and irritated so when I got this product (free by the way) I was like let me try this and see because nothing has been working. Well let me tell you this product is a life saver or should I say a scalp saver. I have only used this once so I hope it continues to work. Thanks Head &amp; Shoulders for the free product!!</li>
            <li> I got this a a free sample from bzzagent  for review purposes. I gave it three stars because although it seems like the product what the label says, and smells wonderful by the way, I was unable to use it. I have severe scalp issues due to a very poor hairdresser so although it&#x27;s getting better I still have some sensitivity and it burned a little. However I&#x27;m sure that once I&#x27;m able to use it I&#x27;ll love it</li>
            <li> I received a free Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother Treatment to try and review. I found that it was a little too strong.  if i had a scab in my head it would have burned a lot.  The tingle from the menthol lasted too long.  It did keep my hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> I think the Scalp Soother wasn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;soothing.&amp;#34; When I think of soothing I think calming, or relaxing. But it was more &amp;#34;awakening&amp;#34; for me. Its like I could feel the tingling sensation from the peppermint oil stimulating my roots and scalp. I would also say that I did feel the &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; sensation that it claimed to have. I don&#x27;t necessarily care for that feeling. It felt kind of weird. It didn&#x27;t burn or anything, it just felt weird. The texture was light and non sticky/greasy. I didn&#x27;t recognize any scent. I do like the bottle that it is a pump bottle making it easy to apply in either my hand or directly into my scalp.</li>
            <li> This does what it says and it has a very nice scent. It is very good for your scalp</li>
            <li> Absolutly love this product the cool formal provides instant relief. The design of the nozzle help you spray the product right where you need it.</li>
            <li> loving this new product I got more free from head and shoulders</li>
            <li> Used this on braids that were a month old. honestly loved the result ! The scalp didnt have so much dandruff and it made the braids look refreshed! Got chosen to use this by a campaign on bzzagent but when this runs out i&#x27;ll definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this stuff!!! Amazing relief to itchy scalp for women with natural styles for the summer. Spray between braids for a cooling relief.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product through Bzz Agent and I&#x27;m so glad I did. I have serious dry scalp issues that often cause me extreme discomfort, scabs and sores. This soother instantly soothed, moisturized and relieved my discomfort. The Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother has been a saving gracing from years of discomfort. This product will stay in my hair care regimen.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a major problem with dry or itchy scalp, but I tried this out through BzzAgent and I was pleasantly surprised at the cooling, moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li> Let me take a minute to tell you how awesome this stuff is! I am a bzzagent and received this as a product to review. As a woman of AfroCaribbean decent, sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find products for my hair type. Since my hair is chemically altered (yes, I know!), I have only used this product after I have washed my hair. First, the sensation on the scalp is heaven! There&#x27;s a bit of tingling, but not too much. The scent is pleasant and the results are phenomenal! This will certainly be a stable of mine! My scalp is happy, happy, happy!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome!! I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. If you&#x27;re out and about on the town and your hair is feeling crunching and dry? Whip out your bottle of head and shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother and your hair will be quickly revitalized. I love this product, its summer time and the sun has been scorching my hair so this has been a great tool to revitalize my hair when I&#x27;m rocking a puff or twistout. It has a great smell and is tbhe perfect mix of moisture and liquid.</li>
            <li> I have an intensely itchy scalp on the back portion of my head, but I don&#x27;t have dandruff. In the middle of the night, I wake up several times because my scalp itches so badly. I&#x27;ve been diagnosed with PBC and I&#x27;m unsure if my Primary Biliary Cirrhosis  or prescription for Ursodiol is causing it. This product provides so much relief when I can&#x27;t stand it anymore. Its cooling, soothing, and makes the itching go away. Hope this is temporary, the itching that is.</li>
            <li> Holy guacamole! I love this stuff. I received my free, full size bottle in the mail from BzzAgent. I received my package over a month ago, and already purchased a second bottle so I don&#x27;t have to be without this miracle. Disclaimer: if you are not into tingling sensation on your scalp, very sensitive scalp, or excessive sun exposure to the scalp (didn&#x27;t wear a hat to the beach) please do not use this! My daughter is allergic to UV Rays and was experiencing some sun poisoning on most of her body when I tried it on her. Not the wisest mommy decision EVER! If you cleared for take off, this is an amazing experience. Follow the instructions but add a few more pumps throughout the scalp. Then, gently massage the oil onto the scalp, with the intention of evenly distributing the treatment. Then, sit back and feel it work its magic. I also tried using it as a hair/scalp refresher after going on a 4 mile walk, and was too lazy to wash my hair in the shower. Oh boy, it worked! Nobody would have ever guessed that i went to the movies with dirty hair. Give it a try, use it everyday for a week before making a solid opinion of it.</li>
            <li> Okay so sometimes especially with curly hair you cannot wash everyday even when you have itchy scalp. The other day I was getting ready for a wedding and my hair was already in an updo and my scalp started itching. I wanted to pull my hair out! Then I remembered I had received this Scalp Soother as a promotional offer from Head and Shoulders and rubbed some one the irritated areas. It took a few minutes but my scalp was soothed and itch free and my wedding updo was saved! Yay!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.. I use it often I have a very itchy dry scalp. I spritz it right on my dry spots and massage it in. I would totally buy this again.</li>
            <li> Tried the Head &amp;Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother courtesy of Head and Shoulders and Bzz Agent. While familiar with the Head and Shoulder Brand I had never heard of their Moisture care line, or their Scalp Soother. I was delighted to try the scalp Soother as I frequently wear my textured virgin hair in braids and Twists.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging&lt;br /&gt;Thought the product comes in a nice size bottle for applying.  I felt like the applicator nozzle or tip was annoying, as it comes off pretty easily. I also thought because of the long pointed look of the applicator nozzle that the soother would come out like a mousse, but it is not.  I could tell easily from the package design that this product was meant for textured hair. The spray comes out a little concentrated and not mist like. I think the Soother application would have been easier if it had more aerosol like qualities or a  finer mist. I felt that my hair got wetter than it needed to.&lt;br /&gt;Results&lt;br /&gt;You can definitely feel the Scalp soother working seconds after applying. My scalp felt invigorated and most importantly  itch free. I used it after installing braids in my hair.  After putting extensions for braids in my hair, is when my  scalp  is the most irritated , itchy and sensitive.  Normally after installing braids, my scalp can be reddened if the extensions were put in too tightly or I get hair bumps. The Scalp Soother decreased the  discomfort I felt for sure. It has a mentholated effect that you can feel long after application. I also used the product quite often while I had the braids to control the itching and flaking. I would definitely purchase this product again and highly recommend it to any one who braids their hair or put in weaves and extensions. This product will help to soothe your scalp in between prolonged washes.</li>
            <li> I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand. It&#x27;s a nice light syrum that doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down and stops my scalp from itching fairly instantaneously. My daughter also loves the minty scent. It&#x27;s a winner in my household!</li>
            <li> I received the co-wash, the 2 in 1 and the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp soother for free as part of the BzzAgent program. I wasn&#x27;t wowed by the rest of the line, but this little product I&#x27;m SOLD on. I will be heading out to the store, when my free sample is gone, to stock up on this right here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always suffered from an itchy scalp. It&#x27;s not flaky just itchy. I have to remind myself not to scratch my scalp because I&#x27;m speaking in front of a crowd or leading a class. I dabbed some of this product in my hair and before I knew it the itch I had was gone and a day later I still am itch free. So although the rest of the product line may not have been my favorite this one right here I&#x27;m co-signing ALL DAY. If you have dry, itchy scalp I definitely recommend you give this one a try.</li>
            <li> Helped with the itching dandruff usually causes me. Made my scalp feel so much better. I love the texture and smell of it as well..</li>
            <li> I honestly thought this would work like a leave in conditioner but obviously I was wrong. It did give a nice sensation when I first applied it but that was it ... could easily get that from any product that is water based. I couldn&#x27;t give it a 4 or 5 star due to it really didn&#x27;t provide me with anything but sure it does something for other hair types so gave it a 3 star.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I love anything with peppermint in it. Makes your hair moisturized  &amp; soft.</li>
            <li> This product I did not like it actually burned my scalp felt like I put icy hot on my scalp so it was not much fun for me.</li>
            <li> My scalp can get a bit dry, flacky and sore, so I decided to use this scalp soother as soon as I got is.&lt;br /&gt;I had a friend over and she too decided to use it. Listen people get this in your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soother is amazing. I instantly felt the tingling and an &amp;#34;ahhhhhh&amp;#34; moment. no joke.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase this product hen I run out of it.  I received the product as part of a promotion from the brand  and I &amp;#34;NEEED&amp;#34; to thank head and shoulders for creating such an awesome product.</li>
            <li> This is such a great product!  I was able to receive this product courtesy of bzzagent.com. Once I am finished with this product, I will definitely buy this product again. This is really great especially for naturals! As soon as I put it on my scalp, I automatically feel the tingly sensation on my scalp. This product definitely helps to promote a healthy scalp! This is a must buy!</li>
            <li> I have natural hair and my scalp can get a little sensitive. This product works wonders on soothing my itching and burning scalp.</li>
            <li> If you have tangled and stubborn hair then this is the line for you! In the past this brand wasn&#x27;t my favorite and upon receiving this new line from the Bzz Agent campaign ( I received this for free) I must admit I was pleasantly  surprised. No medicated smell (like ones I&#x27;ve used in the past) nor was it greasy. It&#x27;s absolutly great! Not only am I flake free now but im more confident about about this brand.</li>
            <li> I was excited to join the Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Collection for 2 reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I have naturally thick, curly hair. My hair requires lots of moisture and care; which means I can&#x27;t use any type of hair care products. There are limited brands I stand behind and I am very critical with products and brands that &amp;#34;claim&amp;#34; to work for all hair types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. I suffer from mild psoriasis of the scalp. Which means I suffer from scalp irritation, intense burning and a ridiculous need to scratch, which then produces flakes and then comes the scalp sores. I have been prescribed numerous expensive types of medicated oils, sprays, rubs and shampoos that never resolved the issue...only masked them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the scalp soother twice, but have not needed to use it after the 3rd use of the 2 in 1. It was a little intense, almost like I dumped a bottle of peppermint oil on my scalp...it would have been useful before I tried the wash and co wash :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit skeptical, but now I am a believer in Head &amp; Shoulders! I intend to keep using the product and supporting the brand. I can&#x27;t explain how happy I am that I found a product that addresses all issues!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate the smell of this product. It smells like hand sanitizer. The smell isn&#x27;t the only thing that made me not want to try this product. It dries really quickly and I was a little scared that it would leave my hair very dried. However it did leave a fresh feeling on my scalp which I think is the main idea of this product. So I gave it a 3 out of 5 because of the smell. I just hate the smell of hand sanitizers is all. I received the product free from Head &amp; Shoulders.</li>
            <li> OMG where do I begin&amp;#34; I JUST LOVE THIS!!! LOVE THIS!!!! LOVE THIS!!! I got it free from head&amp; shoulders the scalp soother is the best thing head &amp; shoulders came up with. I love the way it makes my scalp feels.</li>
            <li> I Love It!!! A Little Bottle Of Heaven. Left My Scalp Feeling Amazing After A Good Shampooing and Deep Conditioning. Why Didn&#x27;t I Know About This? #GoItFree BzzAgent #MoistureCare</li>
            <li> My scalp doesn&#x27;t need too much soothing, however, I tend to have some dryer areas that are known to be itchy. I tried this on those spots and I can&#x27;t say that it really made a difference (as I scratch my head lol). It does feel nice on the scalp, but I&#x27;m not too sure if it actually works, I may need to give it some more time. As for now, I am not impressed. Oh and the packaging around the nozzle is weird.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Note: I was given this product to try and review*</li>
            <li> This product Does have a soothing effect which I would say is thanks to the peppermint. How ever the smell is not pleasant and I do not like the combination of coconut and peppermint. If you have a dry/itching patch or scalp this product certainly will help even if it&#x27;s not immediately. I was able to try this product free thanks to being a bzzagent in return I just had to give my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> i received this product for free from Head &amp; Shoulders. i love the soothing tingle of this product. i recently braided my hair and the braids were a bit too tight. i used the product on my scalp and immediately felt relief. i really enjoy using this!</li>
            <li> Very comforting too a dry itchy scalp. I am a bzzz agent. I&#x27;m glad I got to try this product</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and my scalp tends to dry out and itch especially during harsh winters of Chicago. For my skin I could easily take care of dryness and itch by applying good deep moisturizer to provide 24 hours hydration. But my scalp was different story altogether. No matter how much shampoo/conditioner or hair treatment I applied I would feel itchy and scratch my head the next day after a wash. Plus I always get dandruff during winters which made the itch worse. I have always struggled to get through winters and it was relief when I received Head and Shoulders INSTANT relief Scalp Soother campaign from Bzzagent. Before the campaign I did not have any idea that there was a product designed specifically to provide immediate cooling relief to scalp. So it was no surprise that I opened and used the product from the day I received my bzzkit. I could not believe the instant cooling sensation I felt on applying the product on my entire scalp, it felt heavenly to massage it in my scalp like when you feel while in spa or having facial. The peppermint and teat tree extract work wonders in this formula. Besides the relief what I really liked about the product was it has nozzle dispenser with cap, this helps to get out only the required amount needed and avoid wastage. The cap is super awesome as it allows me to carry this in my purse or while travel without worrying about spilling contents. Brilliant design!! It helps me to get only amount needed to sometimes apply on back of my head which itches the most. I do not feel the need to wash it out and let my hair air dry, it non greasy on my dry hair. But I do need to remember to wash my hands after use as I accidentally rubbed my eyes and that was not experience I wish to</li>
            <li> My new favorite hair product! I love the tingly cooking effect it has my scalp. I have very dry flaky hair, and this differently helps!</li>
            <li> So I recieved this free product through bzzagent and I love it! For a woman like me who alwasy wears braids has always searched high and low for soothing product. You can istantly feel thi sproduct work istantly and it leaves a nice light smell to your hair. Thanks Head and Shoulders for a great product!</li>
            <li> This was a cool new product to try! The Head &amp; Shoulders Moisture Care Scalp Soother was an excellent addition to our current hair care regimen and great for dealing with itchy scalp in between washes.  It was a little sticky and we were concerned it would make hair feel grimy and gross, but it didn&#x27;t do anything of the sort.  Goes on easily, immediately helped with itchiness, and didn&#x27;t give hair that &#x27;gel&#x27; feel. Didn&#x27;t know there was a product to help deal with immediate itching and am so glad we got to try it through Bzz Agent!  Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I got this product free from BuzzAgent and love the whole line espically this one it really does soothe your scalp. The smell kind of reminds me of hand sanitizer but it wasnt too over powering. I love the tingle feeling it gives and I can actually go longer without washing my hair when I use this product.</li>
            <li> I received my product as a BzzAgent promotion from Head &amp; Shoulders. This is the head &amp; shoulders product that I absolutely loved all of the new products that came out. It gives you a nice tingly feeling when you put it on, and it feels great on the scalp. The soother helps moisturize your hair during the day and morning so that it keeps fresh, especially if you are a person who does not have time for a complete was and dry in their day. Great and easy product!</li>
            <li> Very very pleased with this product. i received this for free to test out and I think this is a miracle in a bottle for women who wear braids and extensions and need instant relief from an itchy scalp. I also think this is great for anyone with dry scalp. I loved the smell and the tingly feeling as soon as i sprayed it on. This is definitely a winner and i will be getting more to keep in the house.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I don&#x27;t have to buy expensive essential oils and products to get the same result! In only a few spritz, my scalp was soothed and  refreshed with peppermint and vitamin E! Use daily as often as needed because it goes on light with no greasy residue! Not only does it feel good but it smells naturally refreshing as well. Luckily, as a part of a review campaign from Head &amp; Shoulders, I was able to try the Scalp Soother of no cost to me, but I will definitely be purchasing more once I run out! This is truly a smart buy over and over again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried a product like this before, but I received it free from Head &amp; Shoulders and was pretty excited with the results. The Scalp Soother is great for days when I don&#x27;t feel like washing my hair. The smell is nice with a light coconut scent, though I don&#x27;t think it lingers, and it absorbs completely without looking greasy. I was actually really afraid you&#x27;d be able to see it in my hair, but it really does go straight to the scalp -- and mine tends to be dry and itchy after not washing for three days. You just spray this directly onto your scalp (the long nozzle reaches through your hair) and rub in with the pads of your fingers. There&#x27;s an instant cooling sensation, and then the problem is gone! I&#x27;ve only used it a handful of times since I wash my hair more frequently in the summer, but I will definitely keep this around for winter!</li>
            <li> First I love the smell of this product it smells so good. It works great in helping decrease scalp irritation that occurs. Right when I applied it to my scalp I felt a dramatic difference in the amount of irritation and a cooling affect. It is a amazing product for anyone with scalp problems including dandruff. This product has a amazing applicator which makes it easy to apply this product to my scalp. I received this as a complementary product through Bzzagent and I love it so much once the one I have runs out I am for sure buying another one.</li>
            <li> This Is Such A Smart Little Invention. I Absolutely Love The Idea Of This. You Can Use It Whenever You Need A Little Moister To Your Scalp. The Best Thing About It Is That It Works Instantly. As Soon As You Spray It On Your Scalp, It&#x27;s Instantly Feeling Refreshed. My Hair And Scalp Can Always Use More Moister So This Is Perfect For Me. I Will Definitely Be Buying More When I Run Out! :)&lt;br /&gt;**Received This Product Free For Testing Purposes**</li>
            <li> I receives this product in a kit from bzzagent.com. I had high hopes for this because I often have dry scalp.This product does re-leaves  dry scalp for a small period of time.I have used for than half the bottle in a short amount of time. For the price thought might be worth it for someone you doesn&#x27;t mind reapplying on a regular bases.I go like the way it comes out the bottle like a loose gel. That way you can trigger your scalp and the smell doesn&#x27;t linger so it doesn&#x27;t compete with the others fragrances I wear.</li>
            <li> This product is great if you have an irritated, dry scalp. My scalp tends to be the driest in the front, along my edges, and at the crown of my head. I applied the Scalp Soother all over and massaged it into my scalp. It gives a light tingle and a very pleasant scent. My scalp was immediately smoothed. Check out my video review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;cS_kXYBLzTQ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**This was not a paid review. I was sent this product from from #bzzagent and #HeadandShoulders to try out and give my honest opinion. I believe you will like this product after continuous use.</li>
            <li> i loved the peppermint scent and you can feel the tingles on you scalp so you know it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job after using this my hair was softer i stand by this and use it every wash day</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  You can feel the peppermint oil working and it feels great if you have a flaky scalp like me and my husband.  I use it everytime i wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a promotion and I can honestly say this stuff instantly calms your itchy scalp so you don&#x27;t&#x27; be &amp;#34;digging&amp;#34; in your head all day at work or in the grocery store. Also the ingredients help keep flakes at bay. Love this stuff</li>
            <li> I #GotItFree and received no compensation for my opinion. The Moisture Care &amp;#34;scalp soother&amp;#34; burns more if you use it after shampooing, because your scalp&#x27;s wet and you just massaged it. So, I use it on a dry scalp and each night before my next shampoo shampoo. I shampooed and conditioned twice a week and sprayed my scalp about every 48 hours. I like the fragrance of the Shampoo and Co-Wash and the Scalp Soother felt like it was really doing something. But after using 3 Moisture Care products for a month, I now have MORE dandruff than before. My colorist noticed tons of flakes while blow drying my hair and embarrassingly recommended their scalp spray for my excessive dandruff. That has never happened before!</li>
            <li> I tried this product through Bzzagent and absolutely love it! It soothes the scalp, keeping it nice and cool and is perfect for the summer months. I like to use it after being outside when my scalp needs little cool down. It&#x27;s great at keeping my scalp from getting too uncomfortable between washes which is important in order to keep from needing to over wash my hair and therefore making it too dry or brittle.</li>
            <li> Im in love with this product. I would have never tried this on my own but I was picked by bzzzagent. Great thing about that is my daughter has coarse superthick dry hair. This scalp soother helped in between washes when the dandruff was bad. We did one month of use and now it haz been 2 weeks of nothing and the big flakey dandruff have yet to return. We are going to continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I adore this soother not only does it leave my hair head feeling clean it really does soothe that itchy dry feeling that you can sometimes get it is great. I got it free from Bzzagent. #GotItFree</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff. It is like Paul Mitchell&#x27;s tea tree scalp treatment except 1000 times better. It leaves my scalp feeling sooooo good. Not to mention it keeps the dandruff away! I love it!</li>
            <li> I can not believe I have never tried anything like this before! I got one of these through a Bzz Agent campaign to review and I loved it instantly. Has a refreshing scent and feel to it, you can use it at anytime! It&#x27;s great during the season changes when I feel my hair and scalp drying out, it just gives it that extra boost.</li>
            <li> This is a great product it helps stop itching and helps with the basic health of your scalp. When I first used it I didn&#x27;t feel a difference but the next time I used it, it almost immediately stopped the itching. I also like that it gradually stops my scalp from itching. This is an awesome product for anyone. I received this free from head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> It just great. Was unsure how it would be but since the first squirt on my itchy scalp definitely has given me relief. However a little cumbersome to keep squirting it all over the head. However would definitely recommend this product. Literally I can call this &#x27;cool&#x27; product. Got this product free for being a  Buzzagent to try and review the product.</li>
            <li> Awesome, I wear my hair natural and in twists.  The winter is brutal on my scalp, and this is very soothing and has a fresh scent.</li>
