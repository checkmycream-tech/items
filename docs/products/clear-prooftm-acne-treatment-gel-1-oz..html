            <li> ~A very good product and works very well without any problems to my skin....I recommend highly.....Blessings!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do the intended job</li>
            <li> Great item at a great price plus 2 Day free shipping with Prime!  What a great deal!</li>
            <li> As always, Mary Kay&#x27;s acne gel does not disappoint.  This was a new version of what I was using before and I worried that it would be inferior.  I&#x27;m glad I was wrong because it worked right away.  I&#x27;ve used other more expensive brands and have been disappointed with the results.  Mary Kay is dependable and I plan to continue using the acne gel for those problematic breakouts.</li>
            <li> This product for me is awesome. it cleared my skin practically over night. I tried some many products in the past and was unsuccessful. Finally a product that work for acne.</li>
            <li> I expected the one with the pink cap ( like it posted) but I received with black cap. But I give it a try, ummm... Works for a few days because I noticed my acne kinda back down alittle. But like it said, face will become dry and of course it did. But after 1 week it wasn&#x27;t working with the acne on my face anymore.</li>
            <li> Item as described and shipping was prompt!</li>
            <li> Not the product as advertised</li>
            <li> What I wanted! easy process!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I use a little every night it works great and then use a good lotion and eye cream afterwards A+</li>
            <li> Didnt work for me. I am in my 30s and have mild to moderatw adult acne. I used this medication for about 3 weeks, it irritated my skin and burned.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Perfect control of blemishes</li>
            <li> Product as advertised, super fast delivery</li>

            <li> exactly as advertised and received quickly</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed. I was running low on this and didn&#x27;t want to deal with a MK rep. This acne gel seems to work better than the normal OTC ones I have tried from the store locally. Shipping was quick and item as described but in newer packaging.</li>
            <li> This is great!&lt;br /&gt;I had so many pimples on my chin a week ago now they are finally going away and new ones haven&#x27;t popped out either, it does dry your skin a little but worth it</li>
