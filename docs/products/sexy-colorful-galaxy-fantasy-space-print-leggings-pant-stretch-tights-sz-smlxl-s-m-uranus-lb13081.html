            <li>I love these leggings, I think they are gorgeous, and most importantly.</li>
            <li>Quality is good - these won&#x27;t last forever, but not disposable either, and the print is great.</li>

            <li>I do not recommend ordering through this seller, I wish I was able to give no stars.</li>

            <li>Okay so i got these</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love them, plus they match the necklace I got for my birthday.</li>
            <li>my original estimated delivery date was for February 24th, but they came today!</li>
            <li>I was nervous about how they would fit, especially shipping from China, but they feel comfy and look great!</li>
            <li>Well stitching, comfortable, stretchy, and so cute.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find that the color is very bright and the print very pretty.</li>
            <li>The package arrived before the due date which was wonderful!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a great fit for me personally</li>
            <li>Kinda cheap,</li>
            <li>The elastic waist was comfortable and helped stretch it.</li>
            <li>They are exactly what they look like!!</li>
            <li>Just like pic, fits me perfectly for a small 8th grader.</li>
            <li>It was love at first sight.</li>
            <li>Sizes are true to form in my case.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price</li>
            <li>but I suspect that won&#x27;t be for a while anyway which is not bad at all for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>on time, shipped quickly, and there is no reason to give this product anything but 5 stars.</li>
            <li>i was worried they&#x27;d be too small, but they are pretty amazing!!!</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly!!!They are so pretty and made well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased and would definitely recommend these to friends.</li>
            <li>They look just as they do in the picture and have a great resemblance to the coveted black milk leggings which is exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>and they came super fast!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the right one.</li>
            <li>When i got these leggings i was super surprised at how quickly they arrived!</li>
            <li>Not bad at all for the price though, they seem like decent quality</li>
            <li>They did fit a little tight at first, it worked out for the best.</li>
            <li>but the first thing I had to do was re-stitch the crotch because the seams popped.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they will last longer.</li>
            <li>So pretty and so comfy.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed, exactly what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li>They were pretty low-quality</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>you might need to pay a little more for a US supplier, but I think it&#x27;s worth it for faster/reliable delivery.</li>
            <li>These leggings were sized smaller and no stretch to them, so they didn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>When these wear out, I&#x27;d probably get her another pair if she wants them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely not as stretchy or durable as most standard types of leggings.</li>
            <li>I love these, they are a bit tight but they stretch a lot when you wear them.</li>
            <li>and they came a bit more red then expected but doesnt matter.</li>
            <li>The fabric is pretty cheap, and will probably only last me for one performance, however, if you don&#x27;t plan on doing anything too active in them</li>
            <li>After moving around in them for a bit, they also started to tear in the stitching near the crotch.</li>
            <li>so far theres no holes</li>
            <li>It also came in 2weeks early.</li>
            <li>They arrived in a wrong size, although she really loved them!&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>I got these leggings for a  performance and was concerned that the color would not be vibrant enough.</li>
            <li>These are supposed to be one size fits all, but they are SUPER TIGHT &amp; make marks on my legs.  </li>
            <li>These didn&#x27;t fit as expected and are not worth returning all the way to China.</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas present for my 13 year old granddaughter.</li>
            <li>It was only one white spot near my bum, I tried various panties and the only problematic color was red!</li>

            <li> They ship from China so expect slow delivery (mine arrived a week and a half after ordering) but free shipping (amirite?).</li>
            <li> However they were a bit big on me and moved around loosely at the waist.</li>
            <li> The only concern in the center seam in the crotch area that seems to stretch a lot when worn which I suspect will eventually tear from wash and wear</li>
            <li> it was not cost-effective to return them to the U.S. from abroad, the seller sent other smaller leggings without charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but, i flipped them inside out and noticed there were places with little tiny holes that the thread missed during production, so</li>
            <li> Well, I would prefer black or a dark colour for the stitching instead of white, but still, they&#x27;re amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> i was actually nervous about size because im very small but</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> They were pretty though, too bad they didnt work for us.</li>
            <li> It goes with so many shirts and OMG IM JUST OBSESSED!!!</li>
            <li> i was so anxious to try them on</li>
            <li> they were a little uncomfortable , and a little small</li>
            <li> These are the funky, silly and attention grabbing tights I wanted for yoga and late night sonic dances.</li>
            <li> &amp; I was totally skeptical.</li>
            <li> the seams were a bit weird in places</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> These people are horrible!</li>

            <li> I was nervous about how they would fit, especially shipping from China, but they feel comfy and look great! Well, I would prefer black or a dark colour for the stitching instead of white, but still, they&#x27;re amazing!&lt;br /&gt;I was also nervous about how the fabric would stretch, worrying that it might become transparent. It was only one white spot near my bum, I tried various panties and the only problematic color was red! Nothing else could be seen!&lt;br /&gt;These were amazing!</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price but the first thing I had to do was re-stitch the crotch because the seams popped. If you&#x27;re quite slender then you might not have any of the stitching issues I did. Definitely not as stretchy or durable as most standard types of leggings.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them.  I would order them again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is happy with the fit, design, style and color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I got these leggings for a  performance and was concerned that the color would not be vibrant enough. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the color is very bright and the print very pretty. However they were a bit big on me and moved around loosely at the waist.

            <li> They fit perfectly!!!They are so pretty and made well.I would recommend it to a friend:)&lt;br /&gt;My friends love them !</li>
            <li> I ordered leggings for my teenage daughter. They arrived in a wrong size, although she really loved them!&lt;br /&gt;As it was not cost-effective to return them to the U.S. from abroad, the seller sent other smaller leggings without charge.&lt;br /&gt;The leggings look superb in real life and are always a conversation piece.</li>
            <li> they were a little uncomfortable , and a little small and  i think i would get a bigger size next time.</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted these for her birthday &amp; I was totally skeptical. Quality is good - these won&#x27;t last forever, but not disposable either, and the print is great. The Uranus print ended up looking more blue/red than purple/blue, but my daughter still loves them. Sizing seemed good - I think I went by the PinkQueen website sizing chart. When these wear out, I&#x27;d probably get her another pair if she wants them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many suppliers for these, so check where it&#x27;s shipped from - you might need to pay a little more for a US supplier, but I think it&#x27;s worth it for faster/reliable delivery.</li>
            <li> So pretty and so comfy. I love these, they are a bit tight but they stretch a lot when you wear them.</li>

            <li> Excellent quality for the price and of course, awesome design. Sizes are true to form in my case. Would definitely buy again if needed.</li>
            <li> The pants are awesome</li>
            <li> Beautiful leggings! They look just as they do in the picture and have a great resemblance to the coveted black milk leggings which is exactly what I wanted! The only concern in the center seam in the crotch area that seems to stretch a lot when worn which I suspect will eventually tear from wash and wear but I suspect that won&#x27;t be for a while anyway which is not bad at all for the price I paid. I&#x27;m very pleased and would definitely recommend these to friends. Just for those wondering in terms of size, I am petite (5&#x27;3 and 105 lbs) so it&#x27;s a great fit for me personally</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, exactly what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;Came on time, shipped quickly, and there is no reason to give this product anything but 5 stars.</li>
            <li> These didn&#x27;t fit as expected and are not worth returning all the way to China. They were pretty low-quality any how. They have been donated. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Kinda cheap, but I love them. There&#x27;s a seam that runs along the crotch and butt and I can see the white thread they used. I always get compliments on them, though. I would recommend them.</li>
            <li> These people are horrible! It&#x27;s been 2 months and u have yet to receive my item. I contacted them about it and they asked fir my order id I sent them it 6 different times and they keep telling me it&#x27;s not the right one. So after all of that I just asked for a refund cause it was too muchange for leggings and they told me I shouldn&#x27;t of bought through them and I&#x27;m not getting a refund and if biding receive my product it&#x27;s my fault. I had to dispute the charges through my bank to get my money back and I still never even received the leggings. I do not recommend ordering through this seller, I wish I was able to give no stars.</li>
            <li> The sticking came out in a mounth after i got its but other wise awesome!</li>
            <li> Just like pic, fits me perfectly for a small 8th grader.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves them !!!! Fits great, soft and great quality. Great price also&lt;br /&gt;I was apprehensive but very happy I purchased these leggings, best gift in her eyes.</li>
            <li> When i got these leggings i was super surprised at how quickly they arrived! my original estimated delivery date was for February 24th, but they came today! i was so anxious to try them on and they fit perfectly and looked amazing!! the only issue was, as soon as i put them on i could hear popping noises from the stitching which freaked me out.. the more i moved around in them they continued doing it.. so far theres no holes but, i flipped them inside out and noticed there were places with little tiny holes that the thread missed during production, so the seams were a bit weird in places but ive been fixing and re-aligning them myself. Not bad at all for the price though, they seem like decent quality and they came super fast! thanks!</li>
            <li> this is rap i have a solo dance the 14 of april and a week ago they said they would be her this week and now its saying it will take untill april 15 and i need these or i get kicked off my dance team</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas present for my 13 year old granddaughter. She loves them. If you want a pair for yourself you should know that the size medium is currently being worn by a girl who&#x27;s about four foot ten and weighs 80 pounds. And they&#x27;re snug!</li>
            <li> They are exactly what they look like!! Size was perfect and the coloring is just like the picture. The package arrived before the due date which was wonderful!</li>
            <li> Okay so i got these and they came a bit more red then expected but doesnt matter. Well stitching, comfortable, stretchy, and so cute. I love it i was actually nervous about size because im very small but no problem and stitching but it was great. It also came in 2weeks early. Very good price for perfect leggings. It looks more redish, very smooth and great details. The elastic waist was comfortable and helped stretch it. It goes with so many shirts and OMG IM JUST OBSESSED!!! PERFECT!! and matches my galaxy bow!! You should totally get it if not yet.</li>
            <li> These are supposed to be one size fits all, but they are SUPER TIGHT &amp; make marks on my legs.  Bummed.</li>
            <li> I love these leggings, I think they are gorgeous, and most importantly. i was worried they&#x27;d be too small, but they are pretty amazing!!! Only problem i had was that they took forever to get!!</li>
            <li> These were purchased for my daughter and they were very cute on her.  After 2 washes they came apart at the seam.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> It was love at first sight. They did fit a little tight at first, it worked out for the best. I love them, plus they match the necklace I got for my birthday.</li>
