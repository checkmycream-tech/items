            <li>Comfortable and holds hair nicely.</li>
            <li>These are OKAY.</li>
            <li>Kind of rigid and cheap.</li>
            <li>I just pop one of these headbands on and it tames the flyaways around my face and makes me look more put together.  </li>
            <li>which is why I&#x27;m having to order more.  </li>
            <li>And they&#x27;re cute.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>My favorite headbands.</li>
            <li>Pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>Love these head bands but they break so easily.</li>
            <li>A very smooth, comfortable feel.</li>
            <li>These blend in well to your hair and are comfortable and cute.  </li>
            <li>Pretty cute too!</li>
            <li>Cheap and easy to use.</li>
            <li>My granddaughter has baby fine hair, and not all headbands work well.</li>
            <li>I wear glasses, and have really fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Just headbands is fine.  </li>
            <li>Just glasses is fine.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fine for the price</li>
            <li>cheap and break easily, but fit my purpose.</li>
            <li>They were fine and fit the purpose that they were bought for.</li>
            <li>keeping hair back for photos and procedures- work great</li>
            <li>These headbands are comfortable</li>
            <li>These are great headbands that don&#x27;t slip off and have just enough understated variety that you can mix and match them with outfits.</li>
            <li>so most headbands just slide right off my head.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what Scunci did, but they did something wonderful.</li>
            <li>But even more important, they hold my hair back which is fine textured AND are the most comfortable headbands I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>These are ok, the aren&#x27;t all that comfortable and stylish but they are pretty decent for the price and shipping</li>
            <li>Super comfortable and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>I hope the brand makes more toothed headbands as gentle as these.</li>
            <li>Cute, simple, cheap!</li>
            <li>These headbands came extraordinarily quickly which made me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but they all fit pretty well.</li>
            <li>I tried on the first of the Effortless Beauty Skinny Plastic Headbands and wore it for an hour, I was stunned and excited.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair</li>
            <li>These are made from cheap, brittle plastic with creates too much pressure against the head.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through a lot of headbands in my day (especially growing up in the 80s), but these are by far the most comfortable and secure ones that I have bought!  </li>
            <li>Worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>But they are by far the most comfortable and the only kind I keep coming back to, so I just buy more when they stretch out.</li>
            <li>they are nice and simple.</li>
            <li>Great for throwing my bangs back to wash my face or actually where out with my hair teased a bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week so far so good.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic little headbands and work great for someone like me who is currently growing out my bangs.  </li>
            <li>Quality is good but size is not a good fit for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give it a higher rating</li>
            <li>Product came exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THESE AND WEAR THEM DAILY!!!</li>
            <li>I have a flat head so most elastic and cloth headbands do not stay on.</li>
            <li>I have always had a love-hate relationship with headbands, loving them because they are cute and so easy to maintain a hairstyle with, but hating that they give me headaches because they occupy the same space behind my ears.  </li>
            <li>They are small on my head.may be they are good size for school girls.</li>
            <li>I would buy these specific headbands in bulk and recommend them to my fellow migraine sufferers who are wary of headbands - these are ideal for the kind of person who has frequent head pains and needs something that won&#x27;t aggravate any of that pain or pressure.</li>
            <li>These headbands are great because they&#x27;re thin and lightweight, and they don&#x27;t really pinch the side of my head.</li>
            <li>and they really keep your hair away from your eyes.</li>
            <li>They are just simple, light headbands that don&#x27;t hurt your head.</li>
            <li>They really don&#x27;t stay on my head...</li>
            <li>they told me that the shipment had already left but that they would give me the product for free.</li>
            <li>But really, it is all about the gentle comfort.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wear many headbands because, without the little teeth to hold them on, they slide right off my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thumbs up for new and improved accessories!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x60;t know if I would get this particular style again.</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T BOTHER WITH HIGH PRICED ONES</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like colors; need light colors or, even better, clear or silver for pale or white hair.</li>
            <li>The swirly neutral colors are gorgeous and blend right in with my pale complexion and dark hair.</li>
            <li>Very cheap, headbands broke after a half day use!</li>
            <li>I have a very small head, so most headbands do fit me, but inevitably they all wind up giving me headaches.</li>
            <li>I bought these because of the fascinating color swirls and the tiny rounded teeth on the sides, which seemed so much different than other toothed</li>
            <li>The smaller, more rounded teeth do not dig in to my hair, and the end parts that sit behind my ears are so gentle and light that I barely feel them.</li>
            <li>These very basic headbands are nice and will stay in place, you need to be very careful with them they break easily, but with proper care they will last a long time</li>
            <li>Not cheap plastic that breaks easily.</li>
            <li>She said, \\&quot;These are good because they&#x27;re tight, but not too tight, and they hold my hair back.\\</li>
            <li>These headbands are not plain, they are far nicer looking than I imaged</li>
            <li>I have NEVER experienced this kind of comfort with a headband before.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think it is a decent deal for a pack</li>
            <li>No sharp teeth!</li>
            <li>kind of felt weak in the middle when I put them on.</li>
            <li>as they do break if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>I was worried because often headbands feel tight and uncomfortable, but these are great.  </li>
            <li>Arrived 2 days past the very first day it could have come.</li>
            <li>Not a big deal as far as I&#x27;m concerned since they do their job of keeping my hair back so well.</li>
            <li>I spent years using gentle hair ties to pull my hair back into half ponytails, but I really missed headbands.</li>
            <li>i love these headbands i started growing my hair long and they do the job none of them have broken</li>

            <li> I spent years using gentle hair ties to pull my hair back into half ponytails, but I really missed headbands.</li>
            <li> i love these headbands i started growing my hair long and they do the job none of them have broken</li>
            <li> There were other options in the nearby supermarket but they were huge and I needed something simple and minimalist to avoid further unnecessary attention</li>
            <li> I tried using for all day use on lazy days but it tends to move around too much</li>
            <li> and I can tell they aren&#x27;t going to last long.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately they fit too big on my head</li>
            <li> They hold well in my fine hair, and I am not having to remove them like other bands from the pressure behind my ears.  </li>
            <li> (in the 90&#x27;s--it wasn&#x27;t THAT long ago), but they must have improved the design, because I used to have the earpiece problem with them.  </li>
            <li> A well spent ten bucks.</li>
            <li> They are not too tight and stay put in her hair thanks to the little \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; in the band.</li>
            <li> &quot; The headbands have little teeth on the inner side, and I think that&#x27;s what makes the difference.</li>
            <li> so I barely use them :/</li>
            <li> and I have lots of short tendrils around my face that make for messy looking hairdos.  </li>
            <li> The head bands were as to be expected.</li>
            <li> Only thing I didn&#x27;t like about these headbands were that they&#x27;re just a bit too small for my head, but then again, I do have a big round head.</li>
            <li> but I feel like they get stretched out a little.</li>
            <li> I expected a few to be too small or too big</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that they do stretch out</li>

            <li> I have a flat head so most elastic and cloth headbands do not stay on. This was perfect for keeping hair off my face and stays on very well.  It is lightweight and does not pinch behind the ears.  Very comfortable!</li>
            <li> These very basic headbands are nice and will stay in place, you need to be very careful with them they break easily, but with proper care they will last a long time</li>
            <li> I usually hate headbands, but these are so comfortable and they really keep your hair away from your eyes. Even my daughter who also dislikes wearing a headband will wear this type. Great for the money, and they stay in place. I always keep one in my bag.</li>
            <li> I love these headbands! They are the perfect size, blend into my hair color well, and last forever. Would order again!</li>
            <li> holds up my hair and fits my big head!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through a lot of headbands in my day (especially growing up in the 80s), but these are by far the most comfortable and secure ones that I have bought!  They hold well in my fine hair, and I am not having to remove them like other bands from the pressure behind my ears.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> They are small on my head.may be they are good size for school girls. Quality is good but size is not a good fit for me.</li>
            <li> This skinny headbands are great for polishing an otherwise \\&quot;easy\\&quot; look. I wear them to work with a bun or on weekends with a ponytail. The neutral colors go with everything - black, gray swirl, brown swirl and a dark bluish one. I recommend them!</li>
            <li> Cheap and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Those are my granddaughter&#x27;s words.  I bought these for her for a stocking stuffer (she&#x27;s 15).  She said, \\&quot;These are good because they&#x27;re tight, but not too tight, and they hold my hair back.\\&quot; The headbands have little teeth on the inner side, and I think that&#x27;s what makes the difference. My granddaughter has baby fine hair, and not all headbands work well.</li>
            <li> These are the best. They are just simple, light headbands that don&#x27;t hurt your head. Great for throwing my bangs back to wash my face or actually where out with my hair teased a bit. I like that they blend with my hair. Every once in a while one will break/ I will lose one. But I always buy them again.</li>
            <li> keeping hair back for photos and procedures- work great</li>
            <li> i love these headbands i started growing my hair long and they do the job none of them have broken</li>
            <li> I wear glasses, and have really fine hair.  I have always had a love-hate relationship with headbands, loving them because they are cute and so easy to maintain a hairstyle with, but hating that they give me headaches because they occupy the same space behind my ears.  Just headbands is fine.  Just glasses is fine.  But together, they have posed a problem.  That, and I can&#x27;t wear many headbands because, without the little teeth to hold them on, they slide right off my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Sc&amp;uuml;nchi headbands are astounding.  They&#x27;ve got the little teeth that make them stay in my thin hair, and they are slender enough where they can sit under my glasses earpiece and I don&#x27;t feel them at all.  I have NEVER experienced this kind of comfort with a headband before.  I mean, I have had sc&amp;uuml;nchi headbands as a kid (in the 90&#x27;s--it wasn&#x27;t THAT long ago), but they must have improved the design, because I used to have the earpiece problem with them.  Thumbs up for new and improved accessories!</li>
            <li> Cute, simple, cheap! I&#x27;d give it a higher rating but unfortunately they fit too big on my head so I barely use them :/</li>
            <li> These headbands are not plain, they are far nicer looking than I imaged they would be. But even more important, they hold my hair back which is fine textured AND are the most comfortable headbands I have ever owned. These are headbands I will be reordering. Almost wish I had placed an order for 2 sets. So comfortable sometimes I have to reach up and check to see if I am am wearing a headband!</li>
            <li> I thought this was a great price for four headbands.  Hair accessories can be so expensive.  And it&#x27;s nice having a variety of neutral colors.  These headbands are comfortable but I feel like they get stretched out a little.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for some comfy headbands for awhile now and these are it! Super comfortable and very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> Product came exactly as ordered. It was in perfect condition, and it arrived quickly. Will definitely order from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my daughter and she likes them. They are not too tight and stay put in her hair thanks to the little \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; in the band. Great value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always so hard for me to find headbands because usually they&#x27;re too tight and hurt my ears/side of my of head. These headbands are great because they&#x27;re thin and lightweight, and they don&#x27;t really pinch the side of my head. There&#x27;s also teeth on the inside of the headband to help hold your hair back. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like about these headbands were that they&#x27;re just a bit too small for my head, but then again, I do have a big round head. So if your head is small-average, then these headbands would be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> Runs a little bit small. It&#x27;s like for small headed people, I mean it fits for me but it slides with little movement. Also if you have thick hair, know that this will slide off in an instant you move.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair away from my face but sometimes I can hear the plastic cracking a little when I put in on my head. I haven&#x27;t had any break on me yet.</li>
            <li> Really good headbands! Not cheap plastic that breaks easily. Arrived 2 days past the very first day it could have come.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and holds hair nicely. Don&#x27;t like colors; need light colors or, even better, clear or silver for pale or white hair.</li>
            <li> Grea!! Doesn&#x27;t cut into your head like some do. And the variation of colors is a plus, can wear them with anything.</li>
            <li> cheap and break easily, but fit my purpose.</li>
            <li> All were great. I expected a few to be too small or too big but they all fit pretty well. I&#x27;ve used all of them and they&#x27;re great.</li>
            <li> These are OKAY. I don&#x60;t know if I would buy them again, though. They are sort of flimsy and I can tell they aren&#x27;t going to last long. Also, they tend to slip around a lot. I have quite a bit of hair and I usually double them when I&#x60;m working out to keep the hair out of my face, but I still find that I have to keep readjusting them to keep the hair back. Overall, I think it is a decent deal for a pack but I don&#x60;t know if I would get this particular style again. Kind of rigid and cheap. I also felt like I had a bit of a headache after wearing them for an extended period of time, but maybe I just have a bit head. Who knows.</li>
            <li> Not the sturdiest but no headband made of hard plastic that is thin is... They stay put and don&#x27;t leave me with a headache. Worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> It fits vey well over my hair. I would have given 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t get a headache from wearing it all day.</li>
            <li> They really don&#x27;t stay on my head...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and I use this whenever I wash my face or apply masks. I was looking for something to prevent my hair from getting to my face whenever I leave my asks and this did the trick. There were other options in the nearby supermarket but they were huge and I needed something simple and minimalist to avoid further unnecessary attention (as if applying masks weren&#x27;t enough).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It look a little flimsy but there are 4 of them, so I don&#x27;t have to worry if 1 breaks. I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have curly, frizzy hair and I have lots of short tendrils around my face that make for messy looking hairdos.  I just pop one of these headbands on and it tames the flyaways around my face and makes me look more put together.  These blend in well to your hair and are comfortable and cute.  I was worried because often headbands feel tight and uncomfortable, but these are great.  So inexpensive too!</li>
            <li> Came as packaged and they work well for headbands</li>
            <li> These are ok, the aren&#x27;t all that comfortable and stylish but they are pretty decent for the price and shipping</li>
            <li> These are great hairbands.  I bought them for myself and wear them often.  Just enough tension to hold my hair back, but not so much to be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic little headbands and work great for someone like me who is currently growing out my bangs.  I&#x27;ve been wearing them for awhile and am having to order another pack.  The only complaint I have is that they do stretch out which is why I&#x27;m having to order more.  But they are by far the most comfortable and the only kind I keep coming back to, so I just buy more when they stretch out.</li>
            <li> these are great, I used them to grow out my bangs and without them&lt;br /&gt;I dont think I could have done it, I like the fact there is teeth all&lt;br /&gt;over so all the hair stays in place, Hope they will continue to make&lt;br /&gt;them as they do break if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THESE AND WEAR THEM DAILY!!! DON&#x27;T BOTHER WITH HIGH PRICED ONES AS I GOT SOME OF THEM TOO THESE ARE GREAT!</li>
            <li> I have bought scads of headbands over the years and, prior to this purchase, all but one gave me a headache after a short time. These don&#x27;t. A well spent ten bucks.</li>
            <li> These are great headbands that don&#x27;t slip off and have just enough understated variety that you can mix and match them with outfits. They&#x27;ve converted me from a non-headband person to a full-flegged headband wearer!</li>
            <li> Love these head bands but they break so easily.</li>
            <li> I should have gotten these at a drug store but they&#x27;re perfectly fine!</li>
            <li> Too thin - 2 already broke.</li>
            <li> They stay in place, don&#x27;t squeeze your head, and don&#x27;t need to be readjusted throughout the day.  And they&#x27;re cute.</li>
            <li> These are made from cheap, brittle plastic with creates too much pressure against the head.  Lesson learned, never buy a headband sight unseen.</li>
            <li> I think everyone deserves 5 stars  ... these were just what they said they would be ... It&#x27;s not their fault that they didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
            <li> The head bands were as to be expected. I had no complaints. They were fine and fit the purpose that they were bought for.</li>
            <li> Very cheap, headbands broke after a half day use!</li>
            <li> These headbands came extraordinarily quickly which made me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brother and I have a brother-sister facial night every week and we use these to keep the hair out of out faces.&lt;br /&gt;These are also great to use at bed time to sleep with on, so there isnt any hair in your face and you reduce the amount of acne on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Im very pleased with these, theyre very comfortable and sturdy and work as described!</li>
            <li> love this product. there&#x27;s one for every outfit and they dont look tacky. they are nice and simple. at one point i wanted to cancel my order and wait till christmas to order them. when i contacted the seller they were so helpful. they told me that the shipment had already left but that they would give me the product for free. truly is a great product though.</li>
            <li> I bought these on a whim with a discount, because I&#x27;ve been searching everywhere for headbands that won&#x27;t dig into my head, interfere with my glasses, or exacerbate my migraines and tension headaches. I have a very small head, so most headbands do fit me, but inevitably they all wind up giving me headaches. I spent years using gentle hair ties to pull my hair back into half ponytails, but I really missed headbands. I bought these because of the fascinating color swirls and the tiny rounded teeth on the sides, which seemed so much different than other toothed headbands.&lt;br /&gt;When I tried on the first of the Effortless Beauty Skinny Plastic Headbands and wore it for an hour, I was stunned and excited. No headache. No pain! No pressure! No sharp teeth! A very smooth, comfortable feel. The smaller, more rounded teeth do not dig in to my hair, and the end parts that sit behind my ears are so gentle and light that I barely feel them. They don&#x27;t even interfere with my glasses arms behind my ears. The swirly neutral colors are gorgeous and blend right in with my pale complexion and dark hair. But really, it is all about the gentle comfort. I&#x27;m not sure what Scunci did, but they did something wonderful. I hope the brand makes more toothed headbands as gentle as these. I would buy these specific headbands in bulk and recommend them to my fellow migraine sufferers who are wary of headbands - these are ideal for the kind of person who has frequent head pains and needs something that won&#x27;t aggravate any of that pain or pressure.</li>
            <li> My favorite headbands. Standard. Pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> Great headband to keep hair off my face for washing my face. I tried using for all day use on lazy days but it tends to move around too much</li>
            <li> I have a really round head, so headbands typically give me a headache after a few hours of wear. These are snug but they haven&#x27;t given me any discomfort. Pretty cute too!</li>
            <li> Several have already broken.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fine for the price but 1 or 2 of them kind of felt weak in the middle when I put them on. Like they&#x27;re about to snap.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair so most headbands just slide right off my head. These stay put without giving me a headache by the end of the day. They&#x27;re thin enough that I hardly remember I&#x27;m wearing them, although if I&#x27;ve got glasses on there are times the earpieces bump my headband. Not a big deal as far as I&#x27;m concerned since they do their job of keeping my hair back so well.</li>
