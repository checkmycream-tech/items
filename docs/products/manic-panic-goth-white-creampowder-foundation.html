            <li>When I got it in the mail, I got a bracelet with it as a \\&quot;thank you for the order\\&quot; and it made me happy.</li>
            <li>Works great for Harley Quinn and The Joker.</li>
            <li>I love this!!</li>
            <li>Perfect for people with very light skin tone.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly, I have hsd so many compliments on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Was not expecting this kind of coverage!</li>
            <li>I love the coverage and wear of my Mac foundation, and now the color is perfect too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Coverage is beautiful, it has a nice feel</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly after I orderd, excellent quality.</li>
            <li>I loved it till I had my reaction.</li>
            <li>But a good foundation I do recommend is Manic Panic&#x27;s Vampire Veil and Virgin Snow pressed powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The makeup went on fairly well</li>
            <li>It is not cakey, it smooths out well and is really good for that pin up look.  </li>
            <li>If I ever find time again, it&#x27;ll be good for clubbing.</li>
            <li>No breakouts, good coverage and touch ups.</li>
            <li>This is NOT a Powder just so everyone knows it is a creme/powder foundation type makeup but still is good quality of course and will do the trick.</li>
            <li>Good costume make up.</li>
            <li>The makeup looks good in moderation, but in truth you could&#x27;ve just bough some eyeshadow primer and used that.</li>
            <li>I loved this.</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s loved working with it.</li>
            <li>this was a good makeup for halloween.  </li>
            <li>quite fair skinned.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extremely light, does not settle in creases, blends well (no foundation lines!), and gives you that beautiful pallid complexion you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>It looked good, very believable.</li>
            <li>not a foundation is more like a primer for that is perfect thats for sure.</li>
            <li>I  was very pleased with the results of my eye shadow colrs on my lids after using this product.  </li>
            <li>I looked very convincingly undead without looking like a circus clown...</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for a Halloween costume, great coverage and went on smooth!</li>
            <li>Goes on very smoothly and makes my skin look amazing!</li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sexy!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Before you apply this to your face, make sure that you wash your face!</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the smooth texture and great coverage.  </li>
            <li>, my face looked like a clown iin my beautiful kimono that I was so excited about.</li>
            <li>I bought the stuff for Halloween and it worked amazingly.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product</li>
            <li>Hmmm...this stuff is nice for highlighting, touch ups, covering blemishes and stuff like that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not streaky at all, and goes on nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better quality than halloween makeup but not quite as good as say \\&quot;covergirl\\&quot; but it did the job.  </li>
            <li>Regardless, it is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s kind of chalky looking by itself, and your face will immediately be ruined the moment you have to rub your nose.</li>
            <li>Really nice product.</li>
            <li>Does not feel greasy and nice look and feel</li>
            <li>these works perfect as one and is really smoth</li>
            <li>Kind of greasy, so should use a finishing powder to help it set.  </li>
            <li>The makeup rubs off very easily.</li>
            <li>It went on very easily and wore well.</li>
            <li>Very easy to blend</li>
            <li>but I am sure it smells nice to some others).</li>
            <li>I am sure there are techniques and products that can be combined with this too make it work nicely, however it is not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this!</li>
            <li>Not bad, fairly priced.</li>
            <li>very smooth application.  </li>
            <li>I purchase this product for my stage makeup, it really easy to blend out and color is still fit your skin, the smell is good too.</li>
            <li>I find it to work 10 times better for my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it since as a primer for my eyeshadow and it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I think is better.</li>
            <li>I bought the liquid one too to see which would be better</li>
            <li>but I love how this one blends.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I even used a primer (Nyx) and finishing powder on top.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect white foundation, meanwhile I&#x27;ll continue to wear this.</li>
            <li>I found out fingers in my option worked better than a makeup sponge.</li>
            <li>If you need it to be darker you can just add more.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it works sooooo well.</li>
            <li>This helped finish off my costume perfectly, and arrived in a very short time.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is PHENOMENAL.</li>
            <li>I love it, spreads evenly &amp; fits for gothic style or costume</li>
            <li>It probably needs something over it to smooth it and keep it in place, because the minute I knew I couldn&#x27;t touch my face or it would come off was the minute my face started itching all over (of course!)</li>
            <li>Greatf or costume makeup and makes an even better eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>it works ok..</li>
            <li>but this was ok</li>
            <li>I had to put on more than one application and then blot it so that it would not looked streaked.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and i was able to do my shagrath makeup</li>
            <li>used acrylic on top.</li>
            <li>I love this as a primer.  </li>
            <li>I needed this for a cosplay and it worked perfectly, stayed on the entire day with no problem and provided even coverage.</li>
            <li>Finally; one day I decided that somewhere, there must be the perfect makeup for me.</li>
            <li>However this product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>xD worked okay for my GLaDOS cosplay, though.</li>
            <li>Now if you do want paper white then this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li>We got so many compliments on our makeup.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use a primer if your pores are not invisible.</li>
            <li>It did not wear as well as Ben Nye, but went on much better and came off more easily.</li>
            <li>The application with a sponge is easy, and it feels very smooth and not clumpy.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this foundation to lighten the foundation i already own but after doing a light even coat it covered all my blemishes and left my skin looking flawless and matte.</li>
            <li>in all, it did exactly what I needed and had a good finish.</li>
            <li>It can be great for Halloween, but it doesn&#x27;t smooth over the skin very well.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good coverage over primer and easily buildable.</li>
            <li>My plan was to apply a light coat of it as a foundation, then apply a very light skin tone atop it .  </li>
            <li>It was fine for me if I made sure I washed my face thoroughly after wearing it.</li>
            <li>Otherwise a great product, not heavy at all, it does melt in the heat though.</li>
            <li>Also used on my eyes for that perfect bold white</li>
            <li>it gave me that perfect super white look</li>
            <li>Went on easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy on the skin.</li>
            <li>Easy application and removal.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for a costume effect or under the eyes to conceal dark spots.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and smooth look.</li>
            <li>I do recommend exfoliating before putting product on as it does then to settle in pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li>; without a primer it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li>Went on fine but would not &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; even with using powder.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>Cheaply made, but again its fine for costume makeup.</li>
            <li>It goes on creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have light brown hair</li>
            <li>and I added some from my finger to the roots of my hair and it made it look gray and dead, looked perfect with the costume.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend it, worked great for me.</li>
            <li>A light coating covers and blends well without making you look like a clown.</li>
            <li>how I wanted it and just didn&#x27;t go on smooth.</li>
            <li>Smooth creme texture.</li>
            <li>It goes on evenly and smoothly with just fingers and doesn&#x27;t leave lines or patches.</li>
            <li>What can I say it was fabulous.</li>
            <li>Applies smooth (i use a cosmetic sponge from thedollar store) andis unscented.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t go on smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth to apply and blend to your skin.</li>
            <li>on smooth and covers evenly.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and lasts the length of conventions.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to collect in my pores, and it feels rather light weight.</li>
            <li>This foundation is far superior to any tube cream or grease makeup you will find.</li>
            <li>this was really good while it lasted, and I imagine if you have naturally oil free skin (like a child)</li>
            <li>My fair foundation over top warms the color back up</li>
            <li>Even though I still have a good amount of MOONLIGHT left; I have ordered more DREAMTONE and will continue buying these products.</li>
            <li>It gives the perfect pale for cosplay or costumes.</li>
            <li>Also make sure you do not touch your face or it rubs right off.</li>
            <li>and it was very easy to control how much and where to put it on.</li>
            <li>Best used with a small brush and applied in layers.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this foundation until I put it on.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I was looking for a nice white for my face that doesn&#x27;t feel like a mud mask like most Halloween make-up does.  </li>
            <li>Came off clean with a couple make up remover cloths.</li>
            <li>Being a very light skinned, Redhead; I have ALWAYS had a problem finding the exact right shade of makeup.</li>
            <li>Teenage daughter loved the makeup.</li>
            <li>I painted it on thickly with a nylon brush and it was great!</li>
            <li>I dressed as a vampiress for Halloween, so I needed to &amp;#34;whiten&amp;#34; myself for the full effect.</li>
            <li>It blends really nice,  no harsh lines.</li>
            <li>FINALLY; a makeup color that works for someone extra fair and has good coverage!&lt;br /&gt;  Suzanne Klee</li>
            <li>/&gt;It mixes perfectly with my Mac Studio Sculpt NC15 foundation (no separation or clumping), so it works very well to lighten and tone down the orange glow of the \\&quot;fairest\\&quot; shade mac makes.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tested it out but from other review, I think its great.</li>
            <li>No no no, the color is super of course but is too caky..</li>
            <li>I needed this as a face primer for a costume and it started running out quick.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is a great product if you want a nice even white without a thick greasy texture, just be sure to have some make-up remover on hand and a bottle of lotion.</li>
            <li>It did not run when it got hot and was pretty easy to take off when I was done.</li>
            <li>It reflected light way way too much.</li>
            <li>Does anyone else know what kind of white foundation I should use?</li>
            <li>but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I can apply it lightly for \\&quot;light\\&quot; white coverage or heavier for a more goth or puppet-like look.  </li>
            <li>nice and white~</li>
            <li>I think you can make it more opaque by layering on the product, but I used one application to get that \\&quot;nearly dead\\&quot; look.  </li>
            <li>Sucked sucked sucked , even with setting powder i couldn&#x27;t make it look right</li>
            <li>This foundation goes on very sheer and smooth, leaving a powdery matte flawless very pale natural-looking canvas.</li>
            <li>The only issue is it&#x27;ll wipe off very easily.</li>
            <li>Overall its a good foundation looks very natural looking,</li>
            <li>Other than that it is pretty good.</li>
            <li>As you can see from the pic I uploaded, I don&#x27;t have very light skin, but I was able to be as pale as I wanted.</li>
            <li>Looks great with my pale skin!</li>
            <li>Really nice product to give that white ghost look :) it is really easy to use and with few strokes on skin</li>
            <li>When they arrived; I put a few drops of the MOONLIGHT into some of the DREAMTONE and mixed the perfect color, for me.</li>
            <li>You can apply it heavier for a vamp or goth look but for the extraordinarily pale, like myself, this is the only foundation you&#x27;ll need :D</li>
            <li>A very nice highlighting tool for us very pale people</li>
            <li>Works pretty well</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve included photos of the size of the container, one to show the creamy thickness of the foundation, and two photos one showing the foundation applied to my skin and one showing the remainder the foundation after washing my skin with hot water and soap.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li>i suggest also using a moisturizer with spf50 or higher since there is none in this foundation.</li>
            <li>very obviously weren&#x27;t acquainted with this</li>
            <li>You are much better off getting Mehron Clown White foundation.</li>
            <li>was my first time using the cream foundation because I wanted to see how cream worked on my skin type.</li>
            <li>Also I would recommend exfoliating first and using lotion.</li>
            <li>Also stays on very well throughout the day, just don&#x27;t itch your face!</li>
            <li>However, the one problem is that the powder comes off super-easy in a hot climates.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>; Powder Cream Foundation is exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it was only for one night, I used the majority (95%) of it for the one face.</li>
            <li>Sure enough; I found Manic Panic&#x27;s liquid Foundation.</li>
            <li>bought Manic Panic Virgin White Liquid Foundation but having more olive skin, it showed through.</li>
            <li>I applied with my fingers, but you could use an appropriate brush or blender brush to sheer it out some.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this to do my everyday make up, but it really came in handy when i had to do my Halloween makeup for cosmo class</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited to try this because it&#x27;s very hard for me to find foundation in the store that matches my fair complexion.</li>
            <li>haha looked funny</li>
            <li>Though this can rub off if you are not careful, it is light weight on your face.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite white foundation,  it really does go on like a powder!</li>
            <li>This makeup marries everything that was right with the original Manic Panic pressed powder (I&#x27;m talking the stuff in the square compact from the 90s) and the MP white liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>It also smudges easily and I am personally not a fan of the perfume smell it gives off (just me</li>
            <li>this product did what it was supposed to do and it was easy on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;(rather than that liquid clown white)</li>
            <li>I like how it is pure white and goes on easily</li>
            <li>You can use the Virgin powder to set it further if you wish, but I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a problem with it rubbing off easily.</li>
            <li>This made the perfect under-the-hood ghost white, along with some Urban Decay black circles.</li>
            <li>Great staying power and you control the white out by how heavy you apply.</li>
            <li>goes on smoothe and easy and didn&#x27;t block any of my fine small pores.</li>
            <li>This product is real makeup that is creamy and blends well.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin very flakey and look like it&#x27;s peeling.</li>
            <li>is shot being the only thing available.</li>
            <li>I would reccomend using it only in important places like under your eyes or wear it at night so no one can tell...</li>
            <li>It was MUCH easier on my skin and easier to remove than greasepaint.</li>
            <li>I used a sponge to apply it with and it covers very well.  </li>
            <li>Very airbrushed look.</li>
            <li>The product works really well.</li>
            <li>I have to scrub it really well before applying.</li>
            <li>This is fortunate because it was smaller than I thought it would be</li>
            <li>I was ready to go.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need to use too much for coverage.</li>
            <li>I suppose I should&#x27;ve read the title more carefully.</li>
            <li>it really works to my skin and stayed up all the day.</li>
            <li>since my face is not oily but don&#x27;t used it if your skin is oily it won&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>Very ghostly effect I need.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin looking very even.</li>
            <li>But for Halloween, cosplay, or when I really want to &amp;#34;bring on the goth&amp;#34;, It&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it goes on very creamy and is very blendable.</li>
            <li>What I really don&#x27;t like about this foundation is that it isn&#x27;t spreadable.</li>
            <li>It really is all or nothing.</li>
            <li>I love all the manic panic white makeup that I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li>I used a primer with it and it came out kind of blotchy, patchy and uneven</li>
            <li>This is great if you are looking for pale white color.</li>
            <li>Remember with this, however, that less is more - apply very lightly at first; if you apply too much, you&#x27;ll look like a mime.</li>
            <li>Both gave me a really nice white color while still feeling like a normal makeup (not the gross, sticky pancake finish).</li>
            <li>I recently attended the yearly convention of a certain popular vampire RPG, and wore this every single day of the convention.</li>
            <li>I may go back to my Charles of the Ritz soon and save the manic for special outings.</li>
            <li>It goes on the skin nice and smoothly, I would recommend not caking it on so much, or it&#x27;ll just look really weird.</li>
            <li>I needed this for our new Mime dance group and it is better than the other stuff I got from store.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much the only foundation I&#x27;ve found light enough.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time and in a kawaii black satin pullstring pouch :) Is not greasy/oily and lasts all day if set with powder.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to cover up my slightly darker</li>
            <li>It arrived on time, and it took only one layer to make my face look all white :)  ,</li>
            <li>So to make it work I wear it over my regular foundation, since my regular foundation is more resistant to my skin oils.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for my Halloween costume - it is just thick enough that I can still have that ghostly gothic look.</li>
            <li>already it only accentuated my natural tones if I applied it lightly.</li>
            <li>It holds liquid liner particularly well.  </li>
            <li>I love that it lets you determine how pale you want to go by how much product you use.</li>
            <li>It seems to be a great value, because it barely takes an to make a nice base.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Manic Panic products.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>what I understand, this is the brand that high school Goth kids use.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>It arrived today in it&#x27;s cute little pouch</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re blending it in, it will go sheer just fine if you prefer a general, non-greasy pallor instead of opaque coverage.</li>
            <li>There are pictures of me from parties when I seriously look dead LOL!</li>
            <li>It is a velvety smooth wet that dries like a powder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricier than white make up from a costume store, but considering what you get for your money, it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li>and I find this make up to be way better that any greasy theater make up because it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling cakey or heavy.</li>
            <li>My wife liked how easy to apply it was and how a little bit covered a larger area than expected.</li>
            <li>Very good coverage and high quality, but is not good for people with dry skin!!!</li>
            <li>I would have given this product 2 stars because it is not horrific, but I find the price a bit high for the small amount of product you get.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and am prone to getting dermatitis and none of the manic panic products bother my skin at all.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on or stay on well; I was pretty bummed overall.</li>
            <li>It last on my face for hours despite being in hot weather.</li>
            <li>I do cosplay for fun, and one of my favorites is Harley Quinn, but getting a good shade of white is so difficult.  </li>
            <li>If you want a more solid white look just add some white powder and voila!</li>
            <li>I uses it for my day of the dead costume and it was easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t look good when my skin is the least bit dry.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the color is great; the only thing is, the foundation smears really bad and makes your face super oily, and it leaves streaks all over.</li>
            <li>had been searching for an opaque white makeup for a sugar skull costume and this was a smart purchase.</li>
            <li>For me I was expecting a more smooth white finish but this was hard to get it white enough</li>
            <li>When i bought this i suppose i hadent expected it to be as smooth and white</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li>I applied it with a soft sponge.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Had no trouble at all applying water-based facepaints over it.</li>
            <li>My daughters skin is sensitive and it did not bother her at all.  </li>
            <li>I used this white face powder as Harley Quinn (from batman) and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m also an adult, so I had to go to work.</li>
            <li>white is a bluish white vs creamy white, so it should cancel out most of the yellow or orange tones in virtually every skin color to get a truly \\&quot;goth\\&quot; pale.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It feels like clown makeup but looks natural.</li>
            <li>They mixed very well.</li>
            <li>It makes you look naturally</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also hell to get out of dark colored clothing, and tends to rub off your skin and get onto other things very easily.</li>
            <li>it is good but the size of it is small, I&#x27;ve expected to be  bigger</li>
            <li>I use all white foundation lightly with my normal makeup, because I am naturally extremely pale.</li>
            <li>Love this and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li>It works much better than white face paints that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>you can put on a little for a ghostly paleness or a lot for more solid white, recommend you also purchase the fixing powder to prevent creasing.</li>
            <li>You can apply it from a very light pale white to a ghost white.</li>
            <li>It stays on very well, it has an oily texture, but lasts long.</li>
            <li>Unless you&#x27;re a pretty darn dedicated goth, it&#x27;s not really every day make-up unless you&#x27;re using it as an eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li>If you have a lot of blemishes or flaky skin, I would recommend taking care of those issues before using this product, as it doesn&#x27;t do much to hide acne or dry skin.</li>
            <li>Disappointed that this doesn&#x27;t cover better or look more white.</li>
            <li>It is certainly white and it goes on evenly enough but after a few hours it seems to slide into every tiny wrinkle and turns your smooth porcelain doll look into a bloodless mottled zombie face.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes that this would look good on camera, however, I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li>You need to be very careful with it because too much covering the face makes it look like your skin is peeling and holey.</li>
            <li>You can always add more later, but it&#x27;s pretty hard to make it lighter once it&#x27;s already on too thick.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that if you have large pores, it fills them up and looks much whiter than the rest of your face.  </li>
            <li>Decent amount of product, but may not last very long if you apply heavily on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not real easy to mix with other things, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to blend super well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pale skinned already.</li>
            <li>stars is too less, but 4 is too much.</li>
            <li>I am already pretty pale, so I have plenty left to try again.</li>
            <li>Needs a setting of powder on noses and other high traffic facial areas.</li>

            <li> Perfect for people with very light skin tone.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly, I have hsd so many compliments on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Was not expecting this kind of coverage!</li>
            <li> I love the coverage and wear of my Mac foundation, and now the color is perfect too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Coverage is beautiful, it has a nice feel</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly after I orderd, excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I loved it till I had my reaction.</li>
            <li> But a good foundation I do recommend is Manic Panic&#x27;s Vampire Veil and Virgin Snow pressed powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The makeup went on fairly well</li>
            <li> It is not cakey, it smooths out well and is really good for that pin up look.  </li>
            <li> If I ever find time again, it&#x27;ll be good for clubbing.</li>
            <li> No breakouts, good coverage and touch ups.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a Powder just so everyone knows it is a creme/powder foundation type makeup but still is good quality of course and will do the trick.</li>
            <li> Good costume make up.</li>
            <li> The makeup looks good in moderation, but in truth you could&#x27;ve just bough some eyeshadow primer and used that.</li>
            <li> I loved this.</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s loved working with it.</li>
            <li> this was a good makeup for halloween.  </li>
            <li> quite fair skinned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely light, does not settle in creases, blends well (no foundation lines!), and gives you that beautiful pallid complexion you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> It looked good, very believable.</li>
            <li> not a foundation is more like a primer for that is perfect thats for sure.</li>
            <li> I  was very pleased with the results of my eye shadow colrs on my lids after using this product.  </li>
            <li> I looked very convincingly undead without looking like a circus clown...</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a Halloween costume, great coverage and went on smooth!</li>
            <li> Goes on very smoothly and makes my skin look amazing!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sexy!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Before you apply this to your face, make sure that you wash your face!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the smooth texture and great coverage.  </li>
            <li> , my face looked like a clown iin my beautiful kimono that I was so excited about.</li>
            <li> I bought the stuff for Halloween and it worked amazingly.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product</li>
            <li> Hmmm...this stuff is nice for highlighting, touch ups, covering blemishes and stuff like that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not streaky at all, and goes on nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better quality than halloween makeup but not quite as good as say \\&quot;covergirl\\&quot; but it did the job.  </li>
            <li> Regardless, it is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s kind of chalky looking by itself, and your face will immediately be ruined the moment you have to rub your nose.</li>
            <li> Really nice product.</li>
            <li> Does not feel greasy and nice look and feel</li>
            <li> these works perfect as one and is really smoth</li>
            <li> Kind of greasy, so should use a finishing powder to help it set.  </li>
            <li> The makeup rubs off very easily.</li>
            <li> It went on very easily and wore well.</li>
            <li> Very easy to blend</li>
            <li> but I am sure it smells nice to some others).</li>
            <li> I am sure there are techniques and products that can be combined with this too make it work nicely, however it is not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this!</li>
            <li> Not bad, fairly priced.</li>
            <li> very smooth application.  </li>
            <li> I purchase this product for my stage makeup, it really easy to blend out and color is still fit your skin, the smell is good too.</li>
            <li> I find it to work 10 times better for my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it since as a primer for my eyeshadow and it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I think is better.</li>
            <li> I bought the liquid one too to see which would be better</li>
            <li> but I love how this one blends.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I even used a primer (Nyx) and finishing powder on top.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect white foundation, meanwhile I&#x27;ll continue to wear this.</li>
            <li> I found out fingers in my option worked better than a makeup sponge.</li>
            <li> If you need it to be darker you can just add more.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it works sooooo well.</li>
            <li> This helped finish off my costume perfectly, and arrived in a very short time.  </li>
            <li> The coverage is PHENOMENAL.</li>
            <li> I love it, spreads evenly &amp; fits for gothic style or costume</li>
            <li> It probably needs something over it to smooth it and keep it in place, because the minute I knew I couldn&#x27;t touch my face or it would come off was the minute my face started itching all over (of course!)</li>
            <li> Greatf or costume makeup and makes an even better eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> it works ok..</li>
            <li> but this was ok</li>
            <li> I had to put on more than one application and then blot it so that it would not looked streaked.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and i was able to do my shagrath makeup</li>
            <li> used acrylic on top.</li>
            <li> I love this as a primer.  </li>
            <li> I needed this for a cosplay and it worked perfectly, stayed on the entire day with no problem and provided even coverage.</li>
            <li> Finally; one day I decided that somewhere, there must be the perfect makeup for me.</li>
            <li> However this product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> xD worked okay for my GLaDOS cosplay, though.</li>
            <li> Now if you do want paper white then this is perfect for you.</li>
            <li> We got so many compliments on our makeup.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use a primer if your pores are not invisible.</li>
            <li> It did not wear as well as Ben Nye, but went on much better and came off more easily.</li>
            <li> The application with a sponge is easy, and it feels very smooth and not clumpy.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this foundation to lighten the foundation i already own but after doing a light even coat it covered all my blemishes and left my skin looking flawless and matte.</li>
            <li> in all, it did exactly what I needed and had a good finish.</li>
            <li> It can be great for Halloween, but it doesn&#x27;t smooth over the skin very well.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good coverage over primer and easily buildable.</li>
            <li> My plan was to apply a light coat of it as a foundation, then apply a very light skin tone atop it .  </li>
            <li> It was fine for me if I made sure I washed my face thoroughly after wearing it.</li>
            <li> Otherwise a great product, not heavy at all, it does melt in the heat though.</li>
            <li> Also used on my eyes for that perfect bold white</li>
            <li> it gave me that perfect super white look</li>
            <li> Went on easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy on the skin.</li>
            <li> Easy application and removal.  </li>
            <li> It is perfect for a costume effect or under the eyes to conceal dark spots.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and smooth look.</li>
            <li> I do recommend exfoliating before putting product on as it does then to settle in pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li> ; without a primer it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li> Went on fine but would not &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; even with using powder.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made, but again its fine for costume makeup.</li>
            <li> It goes on creamy and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have light brown hair</li>
            <li> and I added some from my finger to the roots of my hair and it made it look gray and dead, looked perfect with the costume.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend it, worked great for me.</li>
            <li> A light coating covers and blends well without making you look like a clown.</li>
            <li> how I wanted it and just didn&#x27;t go on smooth.</li>
            <li> Smooth creme texture.</li>
            <li> It goes on evenly and smoothly with just fingers and doesn&#x27;t leave lines or patches.</li>
            <li> What can I say it was fabulous.</li>
            <li> Applies smooth (i use a cosmetic sponge from thedollar store) andis unscented.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth to apply and blend to your skin.</li>
            <li> on smooth and covers evenly.  </li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and lasts the length of conventions.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to collect in my pores, and it feels rather light weight.</li>
            <li> This foundation is far superior to any tube cream or grease makeup you will find.</li>
            <li> this was really good while it lasted, and I imagine if you have naturally oil free skin (like a child)</li>
            <li> My fair foundation over top warms the color back up</li>
            <li> Even though I still have a good amount of MOONLIGHT left; I have ordered more DREAMTONE and will continue buying these products.</li>
            <li> It gives the perfect pale for cosplay or costumes.</li>
            <li> Also make sure you do not touch your face or it rubs right off.</li>
            <li> and it was very easy to control how much and where to put it on.</li>
            <li> Best used with a small brush and applied in layers.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this foundation until I put it on.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was looking for a nice white for my face that doesn&#x27;t feel like a mud mask like most Halloween make-up does.  </li>
            <li> Came off clean with a couple make up remover cloths.</li>
            <li> Being a very light skinned, Redhead; I have ALWAYS had a problem finding the exact right shade of makeup.</li>
            <li> Teenage daughter loved the makeup.</li>
            <li> I painted it on thickly with a nylon brush and it was great!</li>
            <li> I dressed as a vampiress for Halloween, so I needed to &amp;#34;whiten&amp;#34; myself for the full effect.</li>
            <li> It blends really nice,  no harsh lines.</li>
            <li> FINALLY; a makeup color that works for someone extra fair and has good coverage!&lt;br /&gt;  Suzanne Klee</li>
            <li> /&gt;It mixes perfectly with my Mac Studio Sculpt NC15 foundation (no separation or clumping), so it works very well to lighten and tone down the orange glow of the \\&quot;fairest\\&quot; shade mac makes.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tested it out but from other review, I think its great.</li>
            <li> No no no, the color is super of course but is too caky..</li>
            <li> I needed this as a face primer for a costume and it started running out quick.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it is a great product if you want a nice even white without a thick greasy texture, just be sure to have some make-up remover on hand and a bottle of lotion.</li>
            <li> It did not run when it got hot and was pretty easy to take off when I was done.</li>
            <li> It reflected light way way too much.</li>
            <li> Does anyone else know what kind of white foundation I should use?</li>
            <li> but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I can apply it lightly for \\&quot;light\\&quot; white coverage or heavier for a more goth or puppet-like look.  </li>
            <li> nice and white~</li>
            <li> I think you can make it more opaque by layering on the product, but I used one application to get that \\&quot;nearly dead\\&quot; look.  </li>
            <li> Sucked sucked sucked , even with setting powder i couldn&#x27;t make it look right</li>
            <li> This foundation goes on very sheer and smooth, leaving a powdery matte flawless very pale natural-looking canvas.</li>
            <li> The only issue is it&#x27;ll wipe off very easily.</li>
            <li> Overall its a good foundation looks very natural looking,</li>
            <li> Other than that it is pretty good.</li>
            <li> As you can see from the pic I uploaded, I don&#x27;t have very light skin, but I was able to be as pale as I wanted.</li>
            <li> Looks great with my pale skin!</li>
            <li> Really nice product to give that white ghost look :) it is really easy to use and with few strokes on skin</li>
            <li> When they arrived; I put a few drops of the MOONLIGHT into some of the DREAMTONE and mixed the perfect color, for me.</li>
            <li> You can apply it heavier for a vamp or goth look but for the extraordinarily pale, like myself, this is the only foundation you&#x27;ll need :D</li>
            <li> A very nice highlighting tool for us very pale people</li>
            <li> Works pretty well</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve included photos of the size of the container, one to show the creamy thickness of the foundation, and two photos one showing the foundation applied to my skin and one showing the remainder the foundation after washing my skin with hot water and soap.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> i suggest also using a moisturizer with spf50 or higher since there is none in this foundation.</li>
            <li> very obviously weren&#x27;t acquainted with this</li>
            <li> You are much better off getting Mehron Clown White foundation.</li>
            <li> was my first time using the cream foundation because I wanted to see how cream worked on my skin type.</li>
            <li> Also I would recommend exfoliating first and using lotion.</li>
            <li> Also stays on very well throughout the day, just don&#x27;t itch your face!</li>
            <li> However, the one problem is that the powder comes off super-easy in a hot climates.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> ; Powder Cream Foundation is exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it was only for one night, I used the majority (95%) of it for the one face.</li>
            <li> Sure enough; I found Manic Panic&#x27;s liquid Foundation.</li>
            <li> bought Manic Panic Virgin White Liquid Foundation but having more olive skin, it showed through.</li>
            <li> I applied with my fingers, but you could use an appropriate brush or blender brush to sheer it out some.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to do my everyday make up, but it really came in handy when i had to do my Halloween makeup for cosmo class</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to try this because it&#x27;s very hard for me to find foundation in the store that matches my fair complexion.</li>
            <li> haha looked funny</li>
            <li> Though this can rub off if you are not careful, it is light weight on your face.  </li>
            <li> My new favorite white foundation,  it really does go on like a powder!</li>
            <li> This makeup marries everything that was right with the original Manic Panic pressed powder (I&#x27;m talking the stuff in the square compact from the 90s) and the MP white liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> It also smudges easily and I am personally not a fan of the perfume smell it gives off (just me</li>
            <li> this product did what it was supposed to do and it was easy on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;(rather than that liquid clown white)</li>
            <li> I like how it is pure white and goes on easily</li>
            <li> You can use the Virgin powder to set it further if you wish, but I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a problem with it rubbing off easily.</li>
            <li> This made the perfect under-the-hood ghost white, along with some Urban Decay black circles.</li>
            <li> Great staying power and you control the white out by how heavy you apply.</li>
            <li> goes on smoothe and easy and didn&#x27;t block any of my fine small pores.</li>
            <li> This product is real makeup that is creamy and blends well.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin very flakey and look like it&#x27;s peeling.</li>
            <li> is shot being the only thing available.</li>
            <li> I would reccomend using it only in important places like under your eyes or wear it at night so no one can tell...</li>
            <li> It was MUCH easier on my skin and easier to remove than greasepaint.</li>
            <li> I used a sponge to apply it with and it covers very well.  </li>
            <li> Very airbrushed look.</li>
            <li> The product works really well.</li>
            <li> I have to scrub it really well before applying.</li>
            <li> This is fortunate because it was smaller than I thought it would be</li>
            <li> I was ready to go.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need to use too much for coverage.</li>
            <li> I suppose I should&#x27;ve read the title more carefully.</li>
            <li> it really works to my skin and stayed up all the day.</li>
            <li> since my face is not oily but don&#x27;t used it if your skin is oily it won&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> Very ghostly effect I need.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin looking very even.</li>
            <li> But for Halloween, cosplay, or when I really want to &amp;#34;bring on the goth&amp;#34;, It&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it goes on very creamy and is very blendable.</li>
            <li> What I really don&#x27;t like about this foundation is that it isn&#x27;t spreadable.</li>
            <li> It really is all or nothing.</li>
            <li> I love all the manic panic white makeup that I have tried so far.  </li>
            <li> I used a primer with it and it came out kind of blotchy, patchy and uneven</li>
            <li> This is great if you are looking for pale white color.</li>
            <li> Remember with this, however, that less is more - apply very lightly at first; if you apply too much, you&#x27;ll look like a mime.</li>
            <li> Both gave me a really nice white color while still feeling like a normal makeup (not the gross, sticky pancake finish).</li>
            <li> I recently attended the yearly convention of a certain popular vampire RPG, and wore this every single day of the convention.</li>
            <li> I may go back to my Charles of the Ritz soon and save the manic for special outings.</li>
            <li> It goes on the skin nice and smoothly, I would recommend not caking it on so much, or it&#x27;ll just look really weird.</li>
            <li> I needed this for our new Mime dance group and it is better than the other stuff I got from store.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the only foundation I&#x27;ve found light enough.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and in a kawaii black satin pullstring pouch :) Is not greasy/oily and lasts all day if set with powder.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to cover up my slightly darker</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, and it took only one layer to make my face look all white :)  ,</li>
            <li> So to make it work I wear it over my regular foundation, since my regular foundation is more resistant to my skin oils.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my Halloween costume - it is just thick enough that I can still have that ghostly gothic look.</li>
            <li> already it only accentuated my natural tones if I applied it lightly.</li>
            <li> It holds liquid liner particularly well.  </li>
            <li> I love that it lets you determine how pale you want to go by how much product you use.</li>
            <li> It seems to be a great value, because it barely takes an to make a nice base.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Manic Panic products.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> what I understand, this is the brand that high school Goth kids use.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> It arrived today in it&#x27;s cute little pouch</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re blending it in, it will go sheer just fine if you prefer a general, non-greasy pallor instead of opaque coverage.</li>
            <li> There are pictures of me from parties when I seriously look dead LOL!</li>
            <li> It is a velvety smooth wet that dries like a powder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricier than white make up from a costume store, but considering what you get for your money, it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li> and I find this make up to be way better that any greasy theater make up because it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling cakey or heavy.</li>
            <li> My wife liked how easy to apply it was and how a little bit covered a larger area than expected.</li>
            <li> Very good coverage and high quality, but is not good for people with dry skin!!!</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 2 stars because it is not horrific, but I find the price a bit high for the small amount of product you get.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and am prone to getting dermatitis and none of the manic panic products bother my skin at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on or stay on well; I was pretty bummed overall.</li>
            <li> It last on my face for hours despite being in hot weather.</li>
            <li> I do cosplay for fun, and one of my favorites is Harley Quinn, but getting a good shade of white is so difficult.  </li>
            <li> If you want a more solid white look just add some white powder and voila!</li>
            <li> I uses it for my day of the dead costume and it was easy to apply.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t look good when my skin is the least bit dry.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the color is great; the only thing is, the foundation smears really bad and makes your face super oily, and it leaves streaks all over.</li>
            <li> had been searching for an opaque white makeup for a sugar skull costume and this was a smart purchase.</li>
            <li> For me I was expecting a more smooth white finish but this was hard to get it white enough</li>
            <li> When i bought this i suppose i hadent expected it to be as smooth and white</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> I applied it with a soft sponge.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Had no trouble at all applying water-based facepaints over it.</li>
            <li> My daughters skin is sensitive and it did not bother her at all.  </li>
            <li> I used this white face powder as Harley Quinn (from batman) and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m also an adult, so I had to go to work.</li>
            <li> white is a bluish white vs creamy white, so it should cancel out most of the yellow or orange tones in virtually every skin color to get a truly \\&quot;goth\\&quot; pale.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels like clown makeup but looks natural.</li>
            <li> They mixed very well.</li>
            <li> It makes you look naturally</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also hell to get out of dark colored clothing, and tends to rub off your skin and get onto other things very easily.</li>
            <li> it is good but the size of it is small, I&#x27;ve expected to be  bigger</li>
            <li> I use all white foundation lightly with my normal makeup, because I am naturally extremely pale.</li>
            <li> Love this and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> It works much better than white face paints that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> you can put on a little for a ghostly paleness or a lot for more solid white, recommend you also purchase the fixing powder to prevent creasing.</li>
            <li> You can apply it from a very light pale white to a ghost white.</li>
            <li> It stays on very well, it has an oily texture, but lasts long.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re a pretty darn dedicated goth, it&#x27;s not really every day make-up unless you&#x27;re using it as an eyeshadow primer.</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of blemishes or flaky skin, I would recommend taking care of those issues before using this product, as it doesn&#x27;t do much to hide acne or dry skin.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that this doesn&#x27;t cover better or look more white.</li>
            <li> It is certainly white and it goes on evenly enough but after a few hours it seems to slide into every tiny wrinkle and turns your smooth porcelain doll look into a bloodless mottled zombie face.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this would look good on camera, however, I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> You need to be very careful with it because too much covering the face makes it look like your skin is peeling and holey.</li>
            <li> You can always add more later, but it&#x27;s pretty hard to make it lighter once it&#x27;s already on too thick.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that if you have large pores, it fills them up and looks much whiter than the rest of your face.  </li>
            <li> Decent amount of product, but may not last very long if you apply heavily on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real easy to mix with other things, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to blend super well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale skinned already.</li>
            <li> stars is too less, but 4 is too much.</li>
            <li> I am already pretty pale, so I have plenty left to try again.</li>
            <li> Needs a setting of powder on noses and other high traffic facial areas.</li>
            <li> If you want a little white without needing to mix it with a normal foundation, this product is not for you.</li>
            <li> I am a pale girl to begin with but the coverage on this was less than adequate.</li>
            <li> Completely neutralizes my dark circles and helps to neutralize red from blemishes as well.  </li>
            <li> My very pale skin has dark grey under eye circles that orange/yellow/green concealers cannot hide properly, but this true white seems to work.  </li>
            <li> Its okay for costume makeup but not everyday wear, it is a weird texture, and shows all your blemishes and every little crease in your face.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t cause any irritation and I only reapplied some on my arms after a long evening/night and a party.</li>
            <li> I think it will end up lasting a long time for me though.</li>
            <li> Goth White foundation I would describe is not really a dry powder but more of a creamy foundation, it clings to the skin something fierce and can be very difficult to remove at times.</li>
            <li> and I assume it will last me a very long time of every day use.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin I recommend doing the same thing.</li>
            <li> I added flat black eye shadow all around my eyes and on my cheek bones, blended a lot, and I looked pretty darn dead...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Kelly: I begged my mom to get me this because I have very pale skin that is VERY senstive.</li>
            <li> It also left my skin feeling dry afterwards but a little lotion fixed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not quite as white as I expected but worked well.  </li>
            <li> The reason for this purchase was not for everyday wear, but for some experimental makeup I wanted to try.</li>
            <li> and there is no trace of grey</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and got it 2 days earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Wears all day like a good base makeup.</li>
            <li> I see other white foundations from this company</li>
            <li> MOISTURIZE AND EXFOLIATE BEFORE YOU USE THIS, it will seriously dry out your face.</li>
            <li> Almost like it is covering dry skin (except there isn&#x27;t any dry skin there because I moisturize before application).</li>
            <li> Didnt dry out my lips and lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> did dry face out</li>
            <li> I also never accidentally rubbed it off throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: be prepared for it to accentuate any areas of dry skin or enlarged pores in a way that doesn&#x27;t happen with skin toned makeup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too wet (so that it never dries and smears everywhere) or too powdery which can make skin look dry and flaky.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully it didn&#x27;t make a mess as it was packaged neatly and it hardened back up as soon as I brought it in the house.</li>
            <li> i had a base coat of white, \\&quot;goth white\\&quot; obviously, and more black, brown and green on my face than white.</li>
            <li> It was hard to get even coverage, you almost have to completely shave your face to ensure it goes on evenly.</li>
            <li> The application ranges from translucent from one layer to almost totally opaque with a few.</li>
            <li> This makeup is quite heavy, and it took the entire cup to do my face, neck, forearms, and chest.</li>
            <li> I had to be careful not to scratch my face at all, or to lean my head on anything, b/c the powder would rub off on whatever my face touched.</li>
            <li> I never realized how pale I actually was until I used this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pale so it could work regularly either way</li>
            <li> sadly a few other attendees (all guys - all the girls were in the know about Goth White!)</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way, may need to mix with lighter foundation to get pale rather than white.</li>
            <li> not greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> However as I&#x27;ve found, a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been mixing the lightest foundation available at my local drugstore with the Halloween white creme makeup you can buy from Halloween stores, but it doesn&#x27;t last all day and clogs my pores horribly.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a creme matte highlight for my ivory skin, it&#x27;s rather cakey so using very little is key.</li>
            <li> I am very pale, but my pink hue still came through even with multiple layers.</li>
            <li> it is a little hard to control as far as lightening the shade</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after a few hours this began sliding off my face, and settle into my pores and smile lines (gross) because of my skin producing oils :/</li>
            <li> One being Elvira Mistress of the Dark.  </li>
            <li> I am blending it with light/ivory makeups that are too dark for me.</li>
            <li> Used this as a more face-friendly base for clown stage makeup.</li>
            <li> Makes me want to order more of these babies since I like using cream eyeshadow base.</li>
            <li> Pale and can be adjusted when applying for a heavy coverge or just a pale sheer finish for goths going to school who don&#x27;t want to look like Halloweenish killer clowns.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did wear down as the evening went on.</li>
            <li> I bought mine as part of a kit that included Manic Panic&#x27;s black lipstick, this foundation, and their black polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate that I wasted my money on this product, when I can go to a Halloween store and spend $2.99 on something that works better.</li>
            <li> I have a neck tattoo that&#x27;s all black and wanted to see if this would cover it before I put the colored make up on.</li>
            <li> Got stubborn, tried &amp;#34;other solutions&amp;#34; for a year and a half, gave up, bought this again</li>
            <li> not sure if I&#x27;d purchase again since I usually wear white face everyday</li>
            <li> It was wet and stayed wet and smeared everywhere, was difficult taking off and was just a big mess.</li>
            <li> I found this a few years ago and began using it to cover my dark cirles.  </li>
            <li> It worked, but it really settled into my pores and looked terrible when I first tried it.  </li>
            <li> so I can be on the look out for other foundations with it in or any other make up!!!</li>
            <li> When I stepped out in the sun I noticed the makeup made my face look like it was peeling little peices of skin or something...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not oily when you put it on, but can get a little if you apply with your fingers.</li>
            <li> Not fantastic.</li>
            <li> Worse yet, I went through the entire jar after three applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed this for a few \\&quot;Helloween\\&quot; makeup tutorials I did.  </li>
            <li> The application was uneven, and it made the texture on my skin look blotchy.</li>
            <li> I bought this foundation to use for costume purposes, but it goes on so smoothly that I now use it as a base layer under my skin-tone foundation.  </li>
            <li> worked well for day of the dead make up.</li>
            <li> I failed to look at the specs of this product and was a little surprised at the small amount there was.</li>
            <li> Seeing as I&#x27;m already pale</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I was that pale, but</li>
            <li> Makes you really pale.</li>
            <li> Super for Goth or base for sugar skull type make up.</li>
            <li> You can also make it thin or thick pending on how white you want to be.</li>
            <li> It took very little to truly cover our skin for Halloween costumes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a bit expensive for container no bigger than about two inches.</li>
            <li> That is the only thing wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I used a small bottle and shook them together.</li>
            <li> The container is small, but I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> however, in pictures, the only color that showed up was the white base coat.</li>
            <li> It came in a satin-like pouch for it and on the back of the Goth White Powder Cream Foundation it says it can also be used as an eyeshadow base.</li>
            <li> Stuff like this makes me reconsider all the crap I buy on Amazon... when you can test it out first</li>
            <li> Also there&#x27;s hardly any in the container.</li>
            <li> Found it hard to blend in.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would look like white face paint</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would react poorly with my adult acne, but no problems at all.</li>
            <li> I ended up going to the party in regular clothes and makeup and felt disappointed all night in the lack of custom and money wasted on this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also posted a picture of the makeup test I did with it, excuse the crazy look on my face</li>
            <li> Broke out my sensitive skin :(</li>
            <li> I had to do some serious scrubbing in the shower in the morning to get it all off my skin and out of my hair</li>
            <li> I hate the thick oily stuff that irritates sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> This stuff was complete crap.</li>
            <li> Goes on as thick or thin as you need it.</li>
            <li> It looks horrible and cakey, leaves creases, if you touch your face at all throughout the day, the stuff will wipe right off..</li>
            <li> The Manic Panic goes on thin and streaky.</li>
            <li> that a fountain did this to me, but this is far by the worst reaction I ever had!!.</li>
            <li> I am using it for geisha base and it works extremely well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a VERY pale person and have had horrible trouble finding something that works with my complection.</li>
            <li> The quality is alright, but I think it&#x27;s too expensive for the amount.</li>
            <li> It worked at giving me a paler complexion, but it made my face break out like crazy.</li>
            <li> I had everything else I needed (including a wig that I also bought on Amazon and was also a fail) and stupidly didn&#x27;t experiment with this makeup until Halloween night.</li>
            <li> Very fake looking, clumpy, didn&#x27;t cover well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was using this as a base for a cover up.</li>
            <li> Nongreasy like a base makeup.</li>
            <li> do not buy this item unless you wanna look like one of those creepy clowns from the movies that come to kill people in terrible violent ways!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> My chin got the worst of it, it still hurts and I pimples now on 4/29/15.....</li>
            <li> this was probably the worst make-up i could have bought.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works pretty well, I might go with the dreamtone liquid foundation from here on out though, as it might be what I&#x27;m looking for. MOISTURIZE AND EXFOLIATE BEFORE YOU USE THIS, it will seriously dry out your face.</li>
            <li> I love this!!! I never realized how pale I actually was until I used this and it matches everything and covered all my blemishes. Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> I am giving this two stars, I bought this for my daughter. Here is her review of the product.&lt;br /&gt;Kelly: I begged my mom to get me this because I have very pale skin that is VERY senstive. I was so happy once I got it, I used it to help get rid of my redness and it worked I was so happy!! Till about 3 hours later, I had to redo my eyeliner and eye shadow. I noticed the foundation was flaking!! I told my mom and she looked at my face, she said to take it off. So I took some of it off on my chin, she said it was all red and I had hives!!! I used two face wipes to get it off. This happened Sunday 4/26/15!! I was gonna go to church, but then I couldn&#x27;t. I had to take an allergy pill and I fell asleep. For two days I had to take an allergy pill!! This is the second time ever that a fountain did this to me, but this is far by the worst reaction I ever had!!. My chin got the worst of it, it still hurts and I pimples now on 4/29/15.....I loved it till I had my reaction. If anyone knows the ingredients for it please tell me. I want to figure out what is in it that bugged me so I can be on the look out for other foundations with it in or any other make up!!! Does anyone else know what kind of white foundation I should use? I see other white foundations from this company but I am scared. Hence why I want to know what the ingredients are.</li>
            <li> Teenage daughter loved the makeup. Will purchase again. Easy to apply and smooth look.</li>
            <li> When i bought this i suppose i hadent expected it to be as smooth and white was it was. It went beyond my expectations in the color category. it is a little hard to control as far as lightening the shade but it gets easier with time.</li>
            <li> This product is real makeup that is creamy and blends well. Super for Goth or base for sugar skull type make up.</li>
            <li> I bought mine as part of a kit that included Manic Panic&#x27;s black lipstick, this foundation, and their black polish.&lt;br /&gt;The Goth White foundation I would describe is not really a dry powder but more of a creamy foundation, it clings to the skin something fierce and can be very difficult to remove at times. It&#x27;s also hell to get out of dark colored clothing, and tends to rub off your skin and get onto other things very easily. The foundation cakes up, especially in creases and folds in the skin. I&#x27;ve tried it, and it just didn&#x27;t work for me, it was a disaster. It&#x27;s also a bit expensive for container no bigger than about two inches. But a good foundation I do recommend is Manic Panic&#x27;s Vampire Veil and Virgin Snow pressed powder.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve included photos of the size of the container, one to show the creamy thickness of the foundation, and two photos one showing the foundation applied to my skin and one showing the remainder the foundation after washing my skin with hot water and soap.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> This stuff was complete crap. I&#x27;m a VERY pale person and have had horrible trouble finding something that works with my complection. I&#x27;ve been mixing the lightest foundation available at my local drugstore with the Halloween white creme makeup you can buy from Halloween stores, but it doesn&#x27;t last all day and clogs my pores horribly. So, I thought I&#x27;d try this. It looks horrible and cakey, leaves creases, if you touch your face at all throughout the day, the stuff will wipe right off.. I would give it 0 stars if I could. I hate that I wasted my money on this product, when I can go to a Halloween store and spend $2.99 on something that works better. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Sucked sucked sucked , even with setting powder i couldn&#x27;t make it look right</li>
            <li> Went on easily.  I used it for a Halloween costume as Jack Frost.  Not quite as white as I expected but worked well.  It did smear on clothes, my car &amp; everywhere else I touched (no surprise).  I applied it with a soft sponge.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Use it all the time.</li>
            <li> Very good coverage and high quality, but is not good for people with dry skin!!! Makes your skin very flakey and look like it&#x27;s peeling. Can also be a bit drying.</li>
            <li> Its okay for costume makeup but not everyday wear, it is a weird texture, and shows all your blemishes and every little crease in your face. Cheaply made, but again its fine for costume makeup.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time, and it took only one layer to make my face look all white :)  ,</li>
            <li> I  was very pleased with the results of my eye shadow colrs on my lids after using this product.  It goes on creamy and smooth.  I have to scoop up another one and toss my Urban Decay Primer Potion.  I find it to work 10 times better for my skin.</li>
            <li> I used this for my Halloween costume as a Mummy. I wore a dress and was basically covered in this, especially my face/neck/arms/chest. It didn&#x27;t cause any irritation and I only reapplied some on my arms after a long evening/night and a party. I added flat black eye shadow all around my eyes and on my cheek bones, blended a lot, and I looked pretty darn dead... so it definitely did it&#x27;s job. I applied it with my finger and it was very easy to control how much and where to put it on. I have light brown hair and I added some from my finger to the roots of my hair and it made it look gray and dead, looked perfect with the costume. I had to do some serious scrubbing in the shower in the morning to get it all off my skin and out of my hair but it was worth it. I definitely recommend it, worked great for me.</li>
            <li> My wife liked how easy to apply it was and how a little bit covered a larger area than expected.</li>
            <li> I never realized how white i was.. I originally bought this foundation to lighten the foundation i already own but after doing a light even coat it covered all my blemishes and left my skin looking flawless and matte. You can apply it heavier for a vamp or goth look but for the extraordinarily pale, like myself, this is the only foundation you&#x27;ll need :D i suggest also using a moisturizer with spf50 or higher since there is none in this foundation.</li>
            <li> I bought this foundation for Halloween.  I was very pleased with the smooth texture and great coverage.  My only complaint is that if you have large pores, it fills them up and looks much whiter than the rest of your face.  A pore filling primer helped to alleviate this.  I&#x27;ve used it since as a primer for my eyeshadow and it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> No no no, the color is super of course but is too caky.. with heat is awful.&lt;br /&gt;Is not a foundation is more like a primer for that is perfect thats for sure. If I buy again manic oanic I´ll try the liquid one.. I think is better.</li>
            <li> It stays on very well, it has an oily texture, but lasts long. Great for costumes.</li>
            <li> Perfect for making &amp;#34;ghost&amp;#34; makeup</li>
            <li> Spreads easily, very white! Don&#x27;t order during the summer months. It&#x27;s only June and it came a bit melted. Thankfully it didn&#x27;t make a mess as it was packaged neatly and it hardened back up as soon as I brought it in the house.</li>
            <li> this was probably the worst make-up i could have bought. i typed in \\&quot;costuming make-up\\&quot; and this was the only think that popped up for what i needed. It reflected light way way too much. i had a base coat of white, \\&quot;goth white\\&quot; obviously, and more black, brown and green on my face than white. however, in pictures, the only color that showed up was the white base coat. there is never a need for white that deep. do not buy this item unless you wanna look like one of those creepy clowns from the movies that come to kill people in terrible violent ways!</li>
            <li> I have used this since I was in middle school. It gives the perfect pale for cosplay or costumes. It is a velvety smooth wet that dries like a powder. Great staying power and you control the white out by how heavy you apply.</li>
            <li> I was using this for a vampire costume for halloween. It worked at giving me a paler complexion, but it made my face break out like crazy. I have sensitive skin so I probably wouldn&#x27;t use this again.</li>
            <li> This makeup was the best for my Harley Quinn Cosplay! Love!</li>
            <li> Goes on very smoothly and makes my skin look amazing!</li>
            <li> Great makeup indeed! I bought the liquid one too to see which would be better but I love how this one blends. I&#x27;m using this for a Harley Quinn cosplay for an upcoming convention and could not be happier with the result!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also posted a picture of the makeup test I did with it, excuse the crazy look on my face hahah.</li>
            <li> This foundation is far superior to any tube cream or grease makeup you will find. I needed to paint my face white once, and it was at a time nowhere around Halloween, so I gave this is shot being the only thing available. The application with a sponge is easy, and it feels very smooth and not clumpy. Even after hours of wear, my face is still ghost white!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product but I&#x27;m a Victorian, vampire goth and that means a very white face. Seeing as I&#x27;m already pale I didn&#x27;t think I Would need a lot to give me a ghostly look. When I stepped out in the sun I noticed the makeup made my face look like it was peeling little peices of skin or something... So I tried exfoliating my face before putting it on again, same thing happened... I would reccomend using it only in important places like under your eyes or wear it at night so no one can tell... Lol</li>
            <li> The quality is alright, but I think it&#x27;s too expensive for the amount. I needed this as a face primer for a costume and it started running out quick.</li>
            <li> Perfect for people with very light skin tone. A light coating covers and blends well without making you look like a clown.</li>
            <li> Hmmm...this stuff is nice for highlighting, touch ups, covering blemishes and stuff like that. It&#x27;s not real easy to mix with other things, as it doesn&#x27;t seem to blend super well. Also there&#x27;s hardly any in the container. Bottom line, It&#x27;s....fine. Not fantastic.</li>
            <li> This makeup marries everything that was right with the original Manic Panic pressed powder (I&#x27;m talking the stuff in the square compact from the 90s) and the MP white liquid foundation. It&#x27;s extremely light, does not settle in creases, blends well (no foundation lines!), and gives you that beautiful pallid complexion you&#x27;re looking for. Remember with this, however, that less is more - apply very lightly at first; if you apply too much, you&#x27;ll look like a mime. You can always add more later, but it&#x27;s pretty hard to make it lighter once it&#x27;s already on too thick. You can use the Virgin powder to set it further if you wish, but I really didn&#x27;t notice much of a problem with it rubbing off easily. I recently attended the yearly convention of a certain popular vampire RPG, and wore this every single day of the convention. I looked very convincingly undead without looking like a circus clown...sadly a few other attendees (all guys - all the girls were in the know about Goth White!) very obviously weren&#x27;t acquainted with this makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: this is the perfect makeup Goths of every stripe have been waiting for all these years. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> goes on smoothe and easy and didn&#x27;t block any of my fine small pores. not greasy and a little goes a long way. you can put on a little for a ghostly paleness or a lot for more solid white, recommend you also purchase the fixing powder to prevent creasing.</li>
            <li> it is good but the size of it is small, I&#x27;ve expected to be  bigger</li>
            <li> You are much better off getting Mehron Clown White foundation. I bought both for a Halloween costume. One night I wore the Manic Panic, one night I wore the Mehron. The Manic Panic goes on thin and streaky. I am very pale, but my pink hue still came through even with multiple layers. I even used a primer (Nyx) and finishing powder on top. The makeup rubs off very easily. Worse yet, I went through the entire jar after three applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for the Mehron. The application ranges from translucent from one layer to almost totally opaque with a few. It&#x27;s not streaky at all, and goes on nice. The smallest jar (4 oz) will last a long time because I barely made a dent after several layers.</li>
            <li> This foundation goes on very sheer and smooth, leaving a powdery matte flawless very pale natural-looking canvas. Unfortunately after a few hours this began sliding off my face, and settle into my pores and smile lines (gross) because of my skin producing oils :/ this was really good while it lasted, and I imagine if you have naturally oil free skin (like a child) then the foundation would continue to  stick and last longer. So to make it work I wear it over my regular foundation, since my regular foundation is more resistant to my skin oils. Doing this prolonged the wear time and I still get the effect I want. Overall its a good foundation looks very natural looking, not sure if I&#x27;d purchase again since I usually wear white face everyday (I like the vampy look) I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect white foundation, meanwhile I&#x27;ll continue to wear this.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is just my skin type, but whenever I apply this stuff, it turns sort of grainy. Almost like it is covering dry skin (except there isn&#x27;t any dry skin there because I moisturize before application). It does not spread well as a foundation.&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time using the cream foundation because I wanted to see how cream worked on my skin type. I think I will stick to using powder or liquid.</li>
            <li> It is certainly white and it goes on evenly enough but after a few hours it seems to slide into every tiny wrinkle and turns your smooth porcelain doll look into a bloodless mottled zombie face.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Manic Panic products.  They&#x27;re the perfect makeup for Halloween!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was looking for a nice white for my face that doesn&#x27;t feel like a mud mask like most Halloween make-up does.  It arrived today in it&#x27;s cute little pouch and I decided to test it on my hand.  Coverage is beautiful, it has a nice feel but yes it does still wipe off on things.  Here&#x27;s the thing to know though, it does not wash off with regular soap!  I washed it twice with hand soap before rubbing it off with a paper towel.  It also left my skin feeling dry afterwards but a little lotion fixed that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a great product if you want a nice even white without a thick greasy texture, just be sure to have some make-up remover on hand and a bottle of lotion.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to try this because it&#x27;s very hard for me to find foundation in the store that matches my fair complexion. Anyway, the color is great; the only thing is, the foundation smears really bad and makes your face super oily, and it leaves streaks all over. It doesn&#x27;t go on or stay on well; I was pretty bummed overall.</li>
            <li> I needed this for a few \\&quot;Helloween\\&quot; makeup tutorials I did.  One being Elvira Mistress of the Dark.  The makeup went on fairly well and I used manic panic powder in anemic to set it. It&#x27;s better quality than halloween makeup but not quite as good as say \\&quot;covergirl\\&quot; but it did the job.  I added it in to my makeup bag and have used it as a brow highlighter.  Not bad, fairly priced. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> For me I was expecting a more smooth white finish but this was hard to get it white enough how I wanted it and just didn&#x27;t go on smooth. I found out fingers in my option worked better than a makeup sponge. Also make sure you do not touch your face or it rubs right off. I have allergies and was rubbing my nose without thinking and when I got home looked in the mirror and it was all gone on my nose haha looked funny but oh well. Next time Im going to see what happens if I do a couple coats but wait between coats to see if I can get it whiter. Some also told me to use talc powder to help set the make up so I might try that.</li>
            <li> Used this as a more face-friendly base for clown stage makeup. I painted it on thickly with a nylon brush and it was great! It was MUCH easier on my skin and easier to remove than greasepaint. If you&#x27;re blending it in, it will go sheer just fine if you prefer a general, non-greasy pallor instead of opaque coverage. Had no trouble at all applying water-based facepaints over it. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only share of foundation that matches my skin. I luvvvv it</li>
            <li> The reason for this purchase was not for everyday wear, but for some experimental makeup I wanted to try. I had high hopes that this would look good on camera, however, I was extremely disappointed. The application was uneven, and it made the texture on my skin look blotchy. It claims to have a powder finish but it looked oily on my skin (combination). I tried applying the product with a brush and a sponge on separate occasions, yet neither seemed to give me the look I was going for. It also smudges easily and I am personally not a fan of the perfume smell it gives off (just me but I am sure it smells nice to some others). I would have given this product 2 stars because it is not horrific, but I find the price a bit high for the small amount of product you get. I am sure there are techniques and products that can be combined with this too make it work nicely, however it is not what I was looking for. I would not consider purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> It can be great for Halloween, but it doesn&#x27;t smooth over the skin very well.  Cakes up in you&#x27;re face.</li>
            <li> I love all the manic panic white makeup that I have tried so far.  It is not cakey, it smooths out well and is really good for that pin up look.  I would say that it might photograph too white but I have not tried that yet.  Regardless, it is a nice product.  I have very sensitive skin and am prone to getting dermatitis and none of the manic panic products bother my skin at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for my Halloween costume - it is just thick enough that I can still have that ghostly gothic look. I was afraid it would look like white face paint but it doesn&#x27;t at all. If you need it to be darker you can just add more. Love it!</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh I love this stuff, it works sooooo well. I use it for cosplays and costumes and even just for myself sometimes.</li>
            <li> I had a feeling about this when I ordered it.  My plan was to apply a light coat of it as a foundation, then apply a very light skin tone atop it .  It worked perfectly, I have hsd so many compliments on my skin.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I dressed as a vampiress for Halloween, so I needed to &amp;#34;whiten&amp;#34; myself for the full effect. This makeup is quite heavy, and it took the entire cup to do my face, neck, forearms, and chest. It looked good, very believable. I&#x27;d buy this again.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with product. Smooth creme texture. Didnt dry out my lips and lasts for hours. Also used on my eyes for that perfect bold white</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much the only foundation I&#x27;ve found light enough. It&#x27;s not oily when you put it on, but can get a little if you apply with your fingers. It seems to be a great value, because it barely takes an to make a nice base. Also works wonderfully as an eye primer/base.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a creme matte highlight for my ivory skin, it&#x27;s rather cakey so using very little is key.</li>
            <li> This helped finish off my costume perfectly, and arrived in a very short time.  If I ever find time again, it&#x27;ll be good for clubbing.</li>
            <li> I needed white makeup for a dance my daughter was in and did not want to use the white grease makeup.  My daughters skin is sensitive and it did not bother her at all.  I used a sponge to apply it with and it covers very well.  I can apply it lightly for \\&quot;light\\&quot; white coverage or heavier for a more goth or puppet-like look.  I will definately order this again.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly after I orderd, excellent quality.</li>
            <li> I bought the stuff for Halloween and it worked amazingly. Just wish it came in a bigger container because I was using it to cover all visible parts of my body. There are pictures of me from parties when I seriously look dead LOL!</li>
            <li> Perfect ! Everything I needed . A very nice highlighting tool for us very pale people</li>
            <li> This is great if you are looking for pale white color. I am using it for geisha base and it works extremely well! Was not expecting this kind of coverage!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this! Goes on as thick or thin as you need it. Very airbrushed look. Best used with a small brush and applied in layers. Also I would recommend exfoliating first and using lotion. Also stays on very well throughout the day, just don&#x27;t itch your face! lol</li>
            <li> I bought this to do sugar skull makeup. Pretty good coverage over primer and easily buildable. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This was perfect! It goes on evenly and smoothly with just fingers and doesn&#x27;t leave lines or patches. It last on my face for hours despite being in hot weather. It didn&#x27;t come of or leave a residue on my clothes. It&#x27;s pricier than white make up from a costume store, but considering what you get for your money, it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this!! I needed this for our new Mime dance group and it is better than the other stuff I got from store. I just need a big jar of it. I will be searching .... Does anyone know where I can find this in bigger jar?</li>
            <li> The coverage is PHENOMENAL. It took very little to truly cover our skin for Halloween costumes. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The product works really well. As you can see from the pic I uploaded, I don&#x27;t have very light skin, but I was able to be as pale as I wanted. However, the one problem is that the powder comes off super-easy in a hot climates. I had to be careful not to scratch my face at all, or to lean my head on anything, b/c the powder would rub off on whatever my face touched. Otherwise a great product, not heavy at all, it does melt in the heat though.</li>
            <li> I like this but it doesn&#x27;t look good when my skin is the least bit dry. It shows flakes all over my face. I have to scrub it really well before applying. If you have dry skin I recommend doing the same thing. Other than that it is pretty good.</li>
            <li> great for gothic shoot.</li>
            <li> Got it for Halloween, but continued to use it after.  I mixed my foundation in with it for under my eyes to brighten.</li>
            <li> This is violet scented. That is the only thing wrong with it. It went on very easily and wore well. It did not wear as well as Ben Nye, but went on much better and came off more easily.</li>
            <li> This is pale/ white I love it, spreads evenly &amp; fits for gothic style or costume hell I&#x27;m pale so it could work regularly either way it&#x27;s sexy!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my Harley Quinn Cosplay!</li>
            <li> I used this white face powder as Harley Quinn (from batman) and it worked very well. However, it&#x27;s kind of chalky looking by itself, and your face will immediately be ruined the moment you have to rub your nose. It probably needs something over it to smooth it and keep it in place, because the minute I knew I couldn&#x27;t touch my face or it would come off was the minute my face started itching all over (of course!)</li>
            <li> perfect for halloween</li>
            <li> Love this and a little goes a long way! This is fortunate because it was smaller than I thought it would be but it covers so well that I don&#x27;t mind. Great product!</li>
            <li> I failed to look at the specs of this product and was a little surprised at the small amount there was. However as I&#x27;ve found, a little bit goes a long way. Greatf or costume makeup and makes an even better eyeshadow primer. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> If you have deep pores this makeup will not blend in well. I even used a primer and could still see tiny white spots of makeup in my pores.</li>
            <li> I was a ghost for Halloween. But I&#x27;m also an adult, so I had to go to work. This made the perfect under-the-hood ghost white, along with some Urban Decay black circles. Needs a setting of powder on noses and other high traffic facial areas. No breakouts, good coverage and touch ups.</li>
            <li> Really nice product to give that white ghost look :) it is really easy to use and with few strokes on skin I was ready to go.</li>
            <li> My new favorite white foundation,  it really does go on like a powder! It blends really nice,  no harsh lines. Very happy with the product and it arrived way before I though it would, so I&#x27;m very happy about the timely fashion.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a Powder just so everyone knows it is a creme/powder foundation type makeup but still is good quality of course and will do the trick. And manic panic is vegan and does not test its products on animals which is a big deal to me.</li>
            <li> So I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with this product, but one thing I wasn&#x27;t expecting was the size. I didn&#x27;t know how big the product would be, and for over $10 I was hoping for a bigger size. I think it will end up lasting a long time for me though. I like how it is pure white and goes on easily and you don&#x27;t need to use too much for coverage. I am blending it with light/ivory makeups that are too dark for me.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that this doesn&#x27;t cover better or look more white. I will buy Mac next time.</li>
            <li> Good costume make up. It did not run when it got hot and was pretty easy to take off when I was done.</li>
            <li> I like it, however it is much smaller than I thought it would be, and is definitely NOT a powder. I suppose I should&#x27;ve read the title more carefully. The makeup looks good in moderation, but in truth you could&#x27;ve just bough some eyeshadow primer and used that. You need to be very careful with it because too much covering the face makes it look like your skin is peeling and holey.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice and smooth. Very easy to blend</li>
            <li> Was using this as a base for a cover up. I have a neck tattoo that&#x27;s all black and wanted to see if this would cover it before I put the colored make up on. It was wet and stayed wet and smeared everywhere, was difficult taking off and was just a big mess. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> it works ok.. I prefer powder to cream but this was ok</li>
            <li> We bought this for a ghostly look for a halloween costume. You can apply it from a very light pale white to a ghost white. Easy on the skin. Wears all day like a good base makeup. Nongreasy like a base makeup.</li>
            <li> it really works to my skin and stayed up all the day. since my face is not oily but don&#x27;t used it if your skin is oily it won&#x27;t really work. ;)</li>
            <li> Its creamy and feelsgreat when you put it on your face.</li>
            <li> Really nice product. Does not feel greasy and nice look and feel</li>
            <li> This Manic Panic &amp;#34;Goth White&amp;#34; Powder Cream Foundation is exactly what I hoped it would be. White, white, white! Love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this foundation to use for costume purposes, but it goes on so smoothly that I now use it as a base layer under my skin-tone foundation.  My very pale skin has dark grey under eye circles that orange/yellow/green concealers cannot hide properly, but this true white seems to work.  My fair foundation over top warms the color back up and there is no trace of grey underneath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This white is a bluish white vs creamy white, so it should cancel out most of the yellow or orange tones in virtually every skin color to get a truly \\&quot;goth\\&quot; pale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It mixes perfectly with my Mac Studio Sculpt NC15 foundation (no separation or clumping), so it works very well to lighten and tone down the orange glow of the \\&quot;fairest\\&quot; shade mac makes.  I love the coverage and wear of my Mac foundation, and now the color is perfect too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-1 star for it being perfumed. It could do without it, and it smells a bit girly for my liking.</li>
            <li> My daughter needed it for a hip hop dance competition.  What can I say it was fabulous. Easy application and removal.  They won a Platinum Medal.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful. I bought it to use when I have to do costumes that require a lighter complexion, being a porcelain skin tone already it only accentuated my natural tones if I applied it lightly. I had no issues with it lasting - I use a primer under all of my make-up and always set any cream based foundation for longer wear and to help against smearing. No complaints, it was perfect.</li>
            <li> I am a pale girl to begin with but the coverage on this was less than adequate. I had to put on more than one application and then blot it so that it would not looked streaked.</li>
            <li> Looks great with my pale skin! Before you apply this to your face, make sure that you wash your face!</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and in a kawaii black satin pullstring pouch :) Is not greasy/oily and lasts all day if set with powder. Pale and can be adjusted when applying for a heavy coverge or just a pale sheer finish for goths going to school who don&#x27;t want to look like Halloweenish killer clowns. :) Applies smooth (i use a cosmetic sponge from thedollar store) andis unscented. Blends evenly and I assume it will last me a very long time of every day use. 5 Stars!!!</li>
            <li> very smooth application.  Very ghostly effect I need.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way, may need to mix with lighter foundation to get pale rather than white.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to do my everyday make up, but it really came in handy when i had to do my Halloween makeup for cosmo class it was perfect  it gave me that perfect super white look and i was able to do my shagrath makeup</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to go for a gothic type of look or you have really white skin this is a great product. It goes on the skin nice and smoothly, I would recommend not caking it on so much, or it&#x27;ll just look really weird. It feels like clown makeup but looks natural.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go on smooth. Broke out my sensitive skin :(</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been searching for an opaque white makeup for a sugar skull costume and this was a smart purchase. I had used those $1 white cream foundations that are sold during Halloween and that stuff is just watery..runny..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is buildable, opaque, and stays well. Very happy to have come across this product.</li>
            <li> covers well... looks great...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tested it out but from other review, I think its great. When I got it in the mail, I got a bracelet with it as a \\&quot;thank you for the order\\&quot; and it made me happy. It came in a satin-like pouch for it and on the back of the Goth White Powder Cream Foundation it says it can also be used as an eyeshadow base. Makes me want to order more of these babies since I like using cream eyeshadow base.</li>
            <li> I needed white face paint for my vampire Halloween costume.  I hate the thick oily stuff that irritates sensitive skin.  Though this can rub off if you are not careful, it is light weight on your face.  You can also make it thin or thick pending on how white you want to be.</li>
            <li> I loved this. I got it for a cosplay that I am doing and I find this make up to be way better that any greasy theater make up because it doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling cakey or heavy. It&#x27;s smooth to apply and blend to your skin. The only issue is it&#x27;ll wipe off very easily. So when you do apply it it&#x27;s best to put on some powder to settle it. I would definitely recommend this makeup.</li>
            <li> I love that it lets you determine how pale you want to go by how much product you use. I do recommend exfoliating before putting product on as it does then to settle in pores and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I love the way my eyes look  and is really difficult to find a white concealer these works perfect as one and is really smoth</li>
            <li> Great makeup! I uses it for my day of the dead costume and it was easy to apply. And it didn&#x27;t break me out the next day.</li>
            <li> Found it hard to blend in.</li>
            <li> If I could have tried this before buying, I would not have bought this. I&#x27;m pretty pale skinned already. I bought this to use for halloween to dress up like a Geisha. I had everything else I needed (including a wig that I also bought on Amazon and was also a fail) and stupidly didn&#x27;t experiment with this makeup until Halloween night. Very fake looking, clumpy, didn&#x27;t cover well, my face looked like a clown iin my beautiful kimono that I was so excited about. I ended up going to the party in regular clothes and makeup and felt disappointed all night in the lack of custom and money wasted on this product. I&#x27;m still disappointed. Stuff like this makes me reconsider all the crap I buy on Amazon... when you can test it out first and you can only return if you pay $$ in shipping.</li>
            <li> worked well for day of the dead make up. used acrylic on top. did dry face out</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for my Halloween costume.  Turns out it&#x27;s the perfect shade for my skin.  I didn&#x27;t think I was that pale, but oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth and covers evenly.  Leaves skin looking very even.</li>
            <li> this product did what it was supposed to do and it was easy on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;(rather than that liquid clown white)</li>
            <li> I love this as a primer.  It holds liquid liner particularly well.  I put it on before I apply my makeup so I don&#x27;t have to worry about &amp;#34;raccoon eyes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a Halloween costume, great coverage and went on smooth! I&#x27;m glad it was only for one night, I used the majority (95%) of it for the one face. Came off clean with a couple make up remover cloths. I&#x27;d definitely purchase again, but with the amount of the product kept in mind.</li>
            <li> Unless you&#x27;re a pretty darn dedicated goth, it&#x27;s not really every day make-up unless you&#x27;re using it as an eyeshadow primer. But for Halloween, cosplay, or when I really want to &amp;#34;bring on the goth&amp;#34;, It&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: when one &amp;#34;brings on the goth&amp;#34;, one must remember to blend their white cream foundation around their neck so it doesn&#x27;t look like a mask.</li>
            <li> I needed this for a cosplay and it worked perfectly, stayed on the entire day with no problem and provided even coverage.</li>
            <li> I purchase this product for my stage makeup, it really easy to blend out and color is still fit your skin, the smell is good too.</li>
            <li> Being a very light skinned, Redhead; I have ALWAYS had a problem finding the exact right shade of makeup. After Merle Norman discontinued their \\&quot;Palest Ivory\\&quot; color; I was stuck with trying 100 different kinds and brands of makeup. Finally; one day I decided that somewhere, there must be the perfect makeup for me. I thought (to myself) that Witches and Vampires must buy their makeup somewhere; so that&#x27;s what I searched for Online. Sure enough; I found Manic Panic&#x27;s liquid Foundation. I bought the DREAMTONE and the GOTHIC FOUNDATION MOONLIGHT and purchased them both. When they arrived; I put a few drops of the MOONLIGHT into some of the DREAMTONE and mixed the perfect color, for me. I used a small bottle and shook them together. They mixed very well. The color is perfect and the quality of both makeups is excellent! Even though I still have a good amount of MOONLIGHT left; I have ordered more DREAMTONE and will continue buying these products. FINALLY; a makeup color that works for someone extra fair and has good coverage!&lt;br /&gt;  Suzanne Klee</li>
            <li> This was plenty of make up to do 4 Zombie faces for Halloween. I probably could have provided for dozens more.&lt;br /&gt;From what I understand, this is the brand that high school Goth kids use.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to apply. Looks &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It did wear down as the evening went on.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! it goes on very creamy and is very blendable. It is perfect for a costume effect or under the eyes to conceal dark spots. It even works as an eyeshadow primer!</li>
            <li> I use all white foundation lightly with my normal makeup, because I am naturally extremely pale. This foundation covers nicely (especially with a proper brush), but it would cause me to break out whenever I used it. It was fine for me if I made sure I washed my face thoroughly after wearing it.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my niece and she&#x27;s loved working with it.</li>
            <li> Great for Halloween!  Makes you really pale.</li>
            <li> I bought this make up to use for cosplay. Being that one of my costumes is an albino girl, I figured this was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;I bought Manic Panic Virgin White Liquid Foundation but having more olive skin, it showed through. Plus it was streaky.&lt;br /&gt;So I figured I&#x27;d buy this to put over it and to help set the liquid undercoat. It worked alright. The \\&quot;streaky brush\\&quot; look is gone and I&#x27;m able to cover up my slightly darker skin.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER.&lt;br /&gt;This make up is OILY. It will gather in the creases of your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars is too less, but 4 is too much.</li>
            <li> I do cosplay for fun, and one of my favorites is Harley Quinn, but getting a good shade of white is so difficult.  However this product is fantastic! It&#x27;s not too wet (so that it never dries and smears everywhere) or too powdery which can make skin look dry and flaky.  It goes on smooth and lasts the length of conventions.  If you want a more solid white look just add some white powder and voila!</li>
            <li> I probably should have used makeup remover. showering does not work xD worked okay for my GLaDOS cosplay, though. nice and white~</li>
            <li> Worked for what I needed. I used a primer with it and it came out kind of blotchy, patchy and uneven; without a primer it&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with the Manic Panic Virgin White Powder (I think that was the name) and it worked wonderfully. Both gave me a really nice white color while still feeling like a normal makeup (not the gross, sticky pancake finish). I also never accidentally rubbed it off throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note: be prepared for it to accentuate any areas of dry skin or enlarged pores in a way that doesn&#x27;t happen with skin toned makeup. Also, the container for this product was much smaller than I had anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it did exactly what I needed and had a good finish.</li>
            <li> I never cared for this brand to begin with but I thought it was only the eye shadow that was such a problem. What I really don&#x27;t like about this foundation is that it isn&#x27;t spreadable. If you want a little white without needing to mix it with a normal foundation, this product is not for you. It really is all or nothing. A thin and light layer is not possible.  Now if you do want paper white then this is perfect for you. With that said it is kinda greasy  but not to the point that it comes off on your clothes or hands which is a plus.  I may go back to my Charles of the Ritz soon and save the manic for special outings.</li>
            <li> I used this product for cosplay makeup. Works great for Harley Quinn and The Joker. We got so many compliments on our makeup.</li>
            <li> It worked, but it really settled into my pores and looked terrible when I first tried it.  Make sure you use a primer if your pores are not invisible.</li>
            <li> Not the coverage I was hoping for. Went on fine but would not &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; even with using powder. Had to end up buying face paint to achieve my desired look.</li>
            <li> this was a good makeup for halloween.  I was afraid it would react poorly with my adult acne, but no problems at all.</li>
            <li> I found this a few years ago and began using it to cover my dark cirles.  I loved it from day one! Got stubborn, tried &amp;#34;other solutions&amp;#34; for a year and a half, gave up, bought this again and now I will never be without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Must use moisturizer before applying this product. Apply, cover with powder before it creases. Completely neutralizes my dark circles and helps to neutralize red from blemishes as well.  Happy customer, great product!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and got it 2 days earlier than expected. The foundation works well. It goes on easy and smooth. It works much better than white face paints that I have used in the past. It makes you look naturally quite fair skinned. If you have a lot of blemishes or flaky skin, I would recommend taking care of those issues before using this product, as it doesn&#x27;t do much to hide acne or dry skin. It doesn&#x27;t seem to collect in my pores, and it feels rather light weight. The container is small, but I would purchase it again. I would suggest getting a powder to set it with if you need it to last longer.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this foundation until I put it on. It was hard to get even coverage, you almost have to completely shave your face to ensure it goes on evenly. I used a makeup wedge to apply it. Maybe it just takes practice? I am already pretty pale, so I have plenty left to try again.</li>
            <li> I used this for a look I created for Halloween.  I think you can make it more opaque by layering on the product, but I used one application to get that \\&quot;nearly dead\\&quot; look.  Kind of greasy, so should use a finishing powder to help it set.  I applied with my fingers, but you could use an appropriate brush or blender brush to sheer it out some. I only wore it once, but it didn&#x27;t make me break out.  Decent amount of product, but may not last very long if you apply heavily on a daily basis.</li>
