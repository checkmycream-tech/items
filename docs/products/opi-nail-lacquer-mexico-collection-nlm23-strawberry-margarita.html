            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>This is a nice OPI color with no pearl, shimmer or glitter at all; what used to be called a creme color.    </li>
            <li>but I do think this is a nice girly girl color.</li>
            <li>I just buy my own and take it with me.</li>
            <li>Perfect for Spring and Summer or anytime really.</li>
            <li>My favorite nail polish brand and color, this is an amazing nail polish.</li>
            <li>Quick ship, fair prices, and he combines shipping.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Just absolutely adorable, just like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the color.  </li>
            <li>Love this color.</li>
            <li>I will have to dilute it with something in order to be able to use it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great, bright pink and everytime I wear it</li>
            <li>This is the perfect pink</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect shade of pink.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!  :-)</li>
            <li>Such a happy color.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful color , staying power is good lasted a week with a base coat and a good top coat.</li>
            <li>Perfect to my outfits,dry out very fast and look natural pink,Long lasting :)</li>
            <li>I will say I ALWAYS google the color (Starwberry Margarita), brand (OPI) and \\&quot;swatch\\&quot; to see the true color on nails.</li>
            <li>The product has great quality and texture but the only thing I don not like is that the color is much brighter than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bright pink</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a gorgeous creamy pink, but not too fuchsia, not to bubblegummy.  </li>
            <li>The product I ordered came in a timely manner and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I love the color of this polish; it is definitely pick!</li>
            <li>This color is very bright pink, like a hot pink.</li>
            <li>This is just a light pink color, nothing special about it.</li>
            <li>and I was hoping for a more hot pink look.</li>
            <li>You can get this color in much cheaper brands.</li>
            <li>I love OPI and know that this particular item from Action Packaged Inc. is grossly overpriced.</li>
            <li>love the color, and it does not easily chip</li>
            <li>A little more sheer than darker colors are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if the salon polish was old and that caused it to be a darker color.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why there is so much hype, possibly because the name is fancy.</li>
            <li>It seemed old.  </li>
            <li>The color is okay a little to pink not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>A large amount of the nail polish spilled out into the bubble wrap, so I received half a bottle of nail polish.</li>
            <li>I expected a darker more pale pink color.</li>

            <li> it last a long time in your nails and in my opinion this polish can be used all year long.</li>
            <li> Like other OPI nail polishes goes on well and wears well.  </li>
            <li> On Amazon you can find this for less!</li>
            <li> Sometimes hard to tell in pics or descriptions.  </li>

            <li> The polish was thick and sticky.  </li>
            <li> It can be hard to tell in bottle and unfortunately the OPI swatches on the website are almost never close.</li>

            <li> Very nice color and product!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite polishes!</li>
            <li> The product I ordered came in a timely manner and was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love OPI and know that this particular item from Action Packaged Inc. is grossly overpriced. In a local store this would only be $8.50. Shop elsewhere; this merchant is ripping you off! On Amazon you can find this for less!</li>
            <li> I used this color at a salon, same name and everything, and bought it because of that. It was not the same color at all. I&#x27;m wondering if the salon polish was old and that caused it to be a darker color. This color is very bright pink, like a hot pink. I expected a darker more pale pink color.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful color.Perfect to my outfits,dry out very fast and look natural pink,Long lasting :) Very satisfied from this product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice OPI color with no pearl, shimmer or glitter at all; what used to be called a creme color.    Sometimes hard to tell in pics or descriptions.  I prefer the shimmer or pearl nail colors but I do think this is a nice girly girl color. Like other OPI nail polishes goes on well and wears well.  A little more sheer than darker colors are. Bought here on Amazon from a merchant and experience was good.</li>
            <li> I always get tons of compliments on this color - and it&#x27;s often hard to find in the nail shops.  I just buy my own and take it with me.</li>
            <li> My nail technician  was wearing it one day. I was like I have to get this. Then browsed amazon and found it and ordered it.</li>
            <li> thankyou for the order</li>
            <li> Gorgeous color! i love growing my collection! This is the perfect pink</li>
            <li> The color is okay a little to pink not what I was looking for. But it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> My favorite nail polish brand and color, this is an amazing nail polish. it last a long time in your nails and in my opinion this polish can be used all year long.</li>
            <li> Product was not sealed properly. A large amount of the nail polish spilled out into the bubble wrap, so I received half a bottle of nail polish.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this polish; it is definitely pick! Also, it arrived promptly, and I didn&#x27;t have to leave the house.</li>
            <li> I love this color!  Can&#x27;t wait to wear it this summer!  It&#x27;s a gorgeous creamy pink, but not too fuchsia, not to bubblegummy.  Just absolutely adorable, just like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OPI is the best!</li>
            <li> Such a happy color.  OPI is always my go to brand because they hold up better and have a great selection of colors</li>
            <li> Nah. This is just a light pink color, nothing special about it. I don&#x27;t know why there is so much hype, possibly because the name is fancy. You can get this color in much cheaper brands. Almost every brand of nail polish has this simple color.</li>
            <li> perfect nail polish. love the color, and it does not easily chip</li>
            <li> Love the color.  Can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love this color. It&#x27;s the perfect shade of pink. I take it with me to the nail salon.</li>
            <li> One of my all-time favorites, especially for Spring and Summer.  It&#x27;s a great, bright pink and everytime I wear it I get compliments on it and people want to know the name of it.  I tell them to go to Amazon.  Great shipper/seller.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent choice of color. It last for a long time. The color stands out like a ray of sunshine</li>
            <li> Beautiful color , staying power is good lasted a week with a base coat and a good top coat.Perfect for Spring and Summer or anytime really.</li>
            <li> It seemed old.  The polish was thick and sticky.  I will have to dilute it with something in order to be able to use it.  I do like the color, it is great for summer.</li>
            <li> The product has great quality and texture but the only thing I don not like is that the color is much brighter than I thought it would be. It&#x27;s a bright pink and I was hoping for a more hot pink look. However, it&#x27;s hard to tell the color unless you can see the bottle in person. I would buy from this brand again but I think I could get good quality for a cheaper price even.</li>
            <li> Great color for summer!</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Very fast shipping!  :-)</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this OPI color although I have to say I am rarely displeased with any OPI. I have tried several different bran of polish as I get a manicure every 7-10 days and OPI stands up to the rest. I will say I ALWAYS google the color (Starwberry Margarita), brand (OPI) and \\&quot;swatch\\&quot; to see the true color on nails. It can be hard to tell in bottle and unfortunately the OPI swatches on the website are almost never close. I always purchase from XPRESSURSELF, I have NEVER had a problem. Quick ship, fair prices, and he combines shipping. This is a BIG plus for me since I tend to hold off and buy 3-5 different colors at a time.</li>
