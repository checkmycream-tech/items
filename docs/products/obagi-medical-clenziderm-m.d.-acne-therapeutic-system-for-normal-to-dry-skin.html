    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It&#x27;s been 3 months and my skin is incredible!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t totally impressed with this...</li>
            <li>My skin is by no means perfect, yet, but it is getting there.  </li>
            <li>Best product out there.</li>
            <li>excellent treatment for acne.</li>
            <li>Great seller!</li>
            <li>I am so happy with the results!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very, very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African-American, so I know perfect skincare products vary.</li>
            <li>[...]    I have used Obagi Nu-Derm products for years and they are the best!  </li>
            <li>I LOVE AMAZON!!!</li>
            <li>works very good.</li>
            <li>Great product, works great!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost an ideal product.</li>
            <li>Loved the product!</li>
            <li>I found the therapeutic lotion to be a good pimple zapper!</li>
            <li>so it wouldn&#x27;t overdry and that seems to work really great.  </li>
            <li>Works great..</li>
            <li>great results...love it.. .</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m happy she stopped selling it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with this cleaning system and would tell a friend to try it for themself.</li>
            <li>Great price for Obagi products.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li>These products are amazing!</li>
            <li>The step 3 Therapeutic Moisturizer is amazing!</li>
            <li>I liked it!</li>
            <li>What an incredibly pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>I thought it was a medically-prescribed product, but was happy to find out that I would be able to purchase it online, and at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li>I use this in combination with my home microdermabrasion and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good for some time.</li>
            <li>Unsuccessfully, I tried monthly microdermabrasion, proactive, Perricone and all-natural Yonka with good but inconsistent results.</li>
            <li>Good to have two on hand</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Within about two weeks, many of my pimple were gone and my cystic acne had greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied about how it worked for me and how it improved the appearance and texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Yesterday for the first time in my life, someone told me that my skin is so flawless.</li>
            <li>Used it for 2 weeks and absolutely love Obagi!</li>
            <li>First , I will say that the seller was excellent no problems with getting the product .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and my skin has never looked better!  </li>
            <li>This is honestly the longest I have gone without getting a cyst.  </li>
            <li>I did try it and it seemed nice</li>
            <li>I have just begun to use this product so cannot give an honest opinion yet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products for Cystic Acne, and this is by far the best thing I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li>It is great at first for clearing up acne.</li>
            <li>Therapeutic lotion is super burning though!!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this product.</li>
            <li>I started using this product about five months ago, and my skin looks 100% better.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see how my face was better when it was cracking and burning more and more with each application.     </li>
            <li>I feel like the lotion leaves my skin more oily feeling than it should.</li>
            <li>I love Obagi, but the Clenziderm line just wasn&#x27;t the one for me.</li>
            <li>This is outstanding.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this kit &amp; try out more Obagi products.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>she liked the product although she did not notice huge improvement in skin..</li>
            <li>skin looks better than it ever has before</li>
            <li>I tried many over the counter topicals but nothing worked.</li>
            <li>Love Obagi.  </li>
            <li>I decided to drop some more money and give it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she is already seeing fantastic results too!</li>
            <li>When I felt a pimple coming and applied this to the area, most times it went away and the pimple never came.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Liked a smooth cleanser a lot, cleans well and feels well after.</li>
            <li>I found that Exposed Skincare works perfectly for me, and helps me stay clean and clear.</li>
            <li>and my skin looks beautiful and clear</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using obagi for a long time and it&#x27;s changed my acne ridden skin to flawless.</li>
            <li>cleanser is nice and mild.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad this product is still available.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced over drying of my skin and am ecstatic about the results so far.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as the MD version</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I heard good things about this line however, this particular one didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>As far as the product, I love, love, love Clenziderm!  </li>
            <li>but I may like to use it in the very Hot TEXAS summer when it&#x27;s 105 degrees &amp; when I tend to be more oily.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t appreciate that they are using so much more plastic to contain a product that is not even 2 ounces!</li>
            <li>The merchant offers a  great price and is easy to reach if their are questions which is rare these days.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay because the MD dries my skin out tooooo much!!</li>
            <li>AND I have tried proactive, acnefree, neutragena advanced acne treatment and murad(ALL</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I always wanted but never achieved even with Perricone or Yonka, and My skin feels so smooth and hydrated</li>
            <li>So silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far I have seen good reults.</li>
            <li>has not looked this good since my early 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you decided to try this system Iwish you the same amazing results I got!</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see significant results in my face</li>
            <li>The normal to oily kit has a stronger cleanser and a toner, both of which are highly effective.</li>
            <li>Even though the oral antibiotics were somewhat successful, I did not like being on daily medication</li>
            <li>:) I recommend this product to anyone who is willing to follow the directions and use this product the way it&#x27;s meant to be used.</li>
            <li>The cream face wash doesn&#x27;t clean my skin.  </li>
            <li>The best solution for my skin, I&#x27;m a 40 years old teenager that still have acne, this is the only product that I used in my life that works, and I&#x27;m using acne products for 25 years.</li>
            <li>I have been through one full kit, and all of my cystic acne is gone.</li>
            <li>started with a face full of acne</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>For 12 years now, I&#x27;ve used so many different types of products to assist in resolving a less than perfect complexion.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s seen tremendous improvement with her acne.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly and packaging on kit was sealed.</li>
            <li>It also reduces an already existing pimple fairly quickly (than if I were to just leave it alone) and this reduces the scarring.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle and smooth.</li>
            <li>In fact I am way more oily then normal.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using this system for a few months I am happy to say I am pretty much acne free!</li>
            <li>I do feel that it is worth noting that I have fairly oily/combination skin, but I considered how incredibly sensitive my skin is and decided to purchase the normal to dry formula and am very pleased with my decision.</li>
            <li>and I have tried everything imaginable without success.</li>
            <li>I had the really gross cystic acne, and I can honestly say...</li>
            <li>I am just thrilled that I FINALLY found something that works for me.</li>
            <li>definitely worth the $65</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to have found something that is finally working.</li>
            <li>Products were fresh and nothing was expired.</li>
            <li>The magic seems to be in the steps 2 and 3, where the medication can soak in and do the work under the skin (face washes only clean the surface).</li>
            <li>I believe I reviewed this product already, right after i started using it, and my review was favorable.</li>
            <li>This one is just right</li>
            <li>I also use a damp washcloth to wipe the cleanser off my face to really get my face clean.</li>
            <li>I try to reccomend this product to anyone with acne, because it truly is a miracle, and I LOVE that this line does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>If you have issues with sensitive skin or your skin is easily irritated, maybe you should consult with a dermatologist before using this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m in my twenties, I&#x27;m really trying hard to get rid of it for good!</li>
            <li>When I use is consistantly, my skin is clear and smooth.</li>
            <li>After the first week I noticed an improvment with my skin and was elated.</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference in my skin after the first day of using this product.</li>
            <li>I went back to Proactiv and it was do much better and not damaging.</li>
            <li>At first it felt like acid on my face</li>
            <li>but before I did I thought I would try  a topical one more time.</li>
            <li>One of the reviewers was exactly like me</li>
            <li>and I noticed that my skin isn&#x27;t oily at all throughout the day and it&#x27;s been a hot and humid summer.</li>
            <li>This is the first review I have ever written.</li>
            <li>I use the cleanser and moisturizer every night but only use the therapeutic lotion at night because it&#x27;s the most drying product.</li>
            <li>Luckily my skin took it fine, but it did burn like hell initially when I was using it.</li>
            <li>I will never waste my time buying cheap face washes at the drug store ever again.</li>
            <li>After using this product a few more times, I would break out with swollen bumps that itched and my face turned bright red.</li>
            <li>The skin is really much smoother!</li>
            <li>I am only on week two of using the system, but so far I love it!</li>
            <li>esthetician I visit from time to time to get chemical peels and microdermabrasions from told me that although Obagi is a good product, that it may be too harsh for certain skin types.</li>
            <li>That other review prompted me to get this amazing product that changed my skin overnight.</li>
            <li>I love the gentle cleanser from the dry/normal, especially in the Winter months.</li>
            <li>The Obagi product for normal to dry skin is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my face, hands down.</li>
            <li>I tried Proactive, Dermalogica, Mary Kay and pretty much every acne product at Ulta.</li>
            <li>My results continued and now, just over three months later, though I have an occasional pimple or hormone-related cystic acne breakout, I can finally say that I have good skin!</li>
            <li>with all topical products, it took a while to start to see results, so don&#x27;t give up until you have finished a full kit!</li>
            <li>I have the dry skin3 step which sounds like most people have this as well.     </li>
            <li>I have large pores and blackheads on my chin and around my nose, and cystic acne every now and then, for years.</li>
            <li>I was browsing amazon a few months ago searching for a new product with good reviews</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;m older (hormones!).  </li>
            <li>I find the normal to dry slightly drying, but the lotion is very good.</li>
            <li>After one week, my skin was clear, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Again, I have only been using this about 3 weeks but have never seen such amazing results.</li>
            <li>and they use that light that really can make imperfections obvious.</li>
            <li>, I tried blue light treatment that involved a cream placed on my face for an hour followed by blue light treatment for an hour.</li>
            <li>The first kit I bought was the Clenziderm for normal to oily skin which is what I have.</li>
            <li>This kit really didn&#x27;t work too well for me</li>
            <li>complexion is very nice!&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I first ordered the oily to normal skin .</li>
            <li>said it dries the skin too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Proavtiv, which does absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>Not only does it assist with any flare ups, but it assist with what looks like a natural glow of the skin and a much better looking complexion.</li>
            <li>It got pretty severe when I was in high school, and lessened as I got older, but still would act up every now and then.</li>
            <li>The system probably lasted me about 7mos using once daily, so the cost/benefit and longevity was well worth it!</li>
            <li>I developed adult acne after getting pregnant with my son 13 years ago.</li>
            <li>For 3 full days, my face was cherry red</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne for most of my teen years and now as an adult (26), I&#x27;d get frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li>I no longer have to live with that feeling of my whole face hurting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to more consistent clear skin and few to none hormone breakouts.</li>
            <li>The reviews were raving plus my esthetician highly recommended it</li>
            <li>I highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>On day 5, my face peeled off and I started looking normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll post again after a few more weeks to see how it works when I&#x27;ve been through monthly cycle, which i always break out during.</li>
            <li>After consistent use for a year as my first real skin care product, I&#x27;ve noticed no real improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>I even had a dermatologist prescribe me high blood pressure medication because a side effect was clear skin!</li>
            <li>I still wear face make up because of my minimal dark spots and uneven complexion from acne scars, but my skin looks essentially flawless with makeup.</li>
            <li>I stopped using ProActiv because it stopped working for me, and needed a new skincare program.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d get a new cyst about every 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the products for  almost 3 weeks and have not had ANY new breakouts.</li>
            <li>So far I have not had a new cyst since using the product!  </li>
            <li>and I wish that prior to ALL my doctor visits, over the counter products and the blue light treatment, somone had told me about it.     </li>
            <li>As with any treatment I know that it works differently on each person, but I have tried proactiv, differin, murad, duac gel, sodium sulfacetamide wash, acne free and on and on, and this one finally seems to give results.  </li>
            <li>I could see how it could be too harsh for someone who may have more sensitive skin than mine.</li>
            <li>I also started using the clarisonic and my face looks so vibrant, clear and YOUNG!</li>
            <li>If you have somewhat sensitive skin, I highly recommend using this approach.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I chose the normal to dry because it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out the way retin-A does, but gradually helps your acne.</li>
            <li>First week of using this system, it caused my skin to burn and dry out way too much.</li>
            <li>I recently visited Essence Skin Clinic for the first time where I learned about the Obagi Clenziderm product line for acne.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had no excessive drying of my skin, and I&#x27;m beginning to see drastic improvement of my skin.  </li>
            <li>More IS NOT better.  </li>
            <li>I saw her spots disappear and even her wrinkles left too, so I figured if Obagi had an acne line I was willing to try it.</li>
            <li>Just a little pimple here and there, which most of the times you can barely see it.</li>
            <li>We really liike this product and even though it says it&#x27;s for normal to dry skin, it clears up acne fast on my daughter&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li>I bought the normal to dry skin because I live in the desert area &amp; can peel/dry pretty easy with harsh products.  </li>
            <li>Low and behold in my first 2-3 weeks of this Obaji stuff, my skin is almost clear.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In summary, the first and third product (for me) are negligible and completely replaceable by Cetaphil or Aveeno brands.</li>
            <li>This is the first product i&#x27;ve used that seems to help clear up my skin, without making it worse before getting better.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed that so many people had great experiences.</li>
            <li>It takes a while for that to start to clear, but it will with this</li>
            <li>My esthetician said it was hormonal and to change my diet, which I did, but still could not get my skin to clear up.</li>
            <li>I am 27 years old</li>
            <li>I have cystic acne at age 46 and early (surgical menopause).  </li>
            <li>I have tried everything for my cystic adult Acne.</li>
            <li>If you are at the point where you are willing to try this, you probably have some long term damage and scarring.</li>
            <li>After much trial and error I came back to this one.</li>
            <li>Struggled with adolescent and adult acne, tried everything even prescription meds.</li>
            <li>All in all, my skin cleared up in 3.5 days, I developed that glow</li>
            <li>friend had seen a dermatologist for age spots she had developed and the Dr. suggested one of the Obagi systems to her.</li>
            <li>The unexpected happened as she told me, &amp;#34;Your</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 21 years old and started getting acne at the age of 16.</li>
            <li>So I really paid $70+ just to get the second bottle, the Therapeutic Lotion.</li>
            <li>went on Amazon to see if they sold the product, and I was surprised that they did.</li>
            <li>This, needless to say, was a good day for me.</li>
            <li>I recommend the normal to dry unless you have very oily skin.</li>
            <li>Only to be told I&#x27;d need to do a couple more due to my skin not reacting to the treatment and possibly continue ocassional treatments after.</li>
            <li>First time user and will continue using this product for a very long time....</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product that actually WORKS!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched between using Normal To Dry and Normal</li>
            <li>I ordered this Normal to dry Skin, and I received the Normal to Oily Skin.</li>
            <li>so I switched to the NuDerm line and it has removed quite a bit of my scarring, my face isn&#x27;t red like it used to be, the texture is smooth, and the break out are few and far between...</li>
            <li>Acne ensued over the last few years and with the addition of bioidentical estrogen and testosterone (which I love), my skin took a further beating.  </li>
            <li>Obagi products can become HIGHLY drying and can reverse your current problem into an opposite, new problem.  </li>
            <li>I occasionally get a pimple here and there, which I notice is usually related to a new product I might use on my face (I stick to oil-free products now) or if I eat something very spicy, but NOTHING compared to what I was getting the 20 years prior.</li>
            <li>First time using it my black heads were gone and it took about a week for my blemishes to clear.  </li>
            <li>I started getting adult acne when I turned 30 and suffered for almost 6 years before finding the  Clenziderm Normal to Dry system.</li>
            <li>We tried several other products without much success.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had clear skin since 1 month after starting.</li>
            <li>I spent, considering how much I have spent at the dr. office, drugstore, dept. store, Whole Foods, skin care MD, etc.  </li>
            <li>My pores seem smaller and my old breakouts are healing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: After my second kit, I changed over to the Normal to oily version of the same product.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products over the years that have either done nothing to ones that made it even worse.</li>
            <li>Then I saw the reviews for the normal to dry skin system.</li>
            <li>I  then ordered the normal to dry .</li>
            <li>but I got the kit for dry and normal skin since people using the oily/normal skin kit</li>
            <li>I use the normal to dry line so as to not excessively dry out my skin and my skin</li>
            <li>Honestly, I was very skeptical and did not have high hopes.</li>
            <li>This product does not dry my skin.  </li>
            <li>and some helped a little at first</li>
            <li>The face wash is gental on the skin, the step 2 Therapeutic Lotion (isn&#x27;t always so \\&quot;therapeutic\\&quot;)sometimes feels a little hot or burning on your face, but seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed for the price of this product as there are much better moisturizers, face washes, and creams available for a much cheaper or equivalent</li>
            <li>Taking a tip from other reviewer, I ordered the normal to dry instead of normal to oily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months now for minor breakouts and my skin has completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>While most college students are grown out of their teen acne, mine seemed to only get worse.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and I am wearing less and less makeup</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Use a few cycles of the normal to dry to get your skin used to the product and then gradually change over to the normal to oily.</li>
            <li>we get SO LITTLE for how much we&#x27;re paying</li>
            <li>but my esetician told me to use the normal to dry, not the one for oily skin, because it would make my skin too dry.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on Amazon (both good and bad) about Obagi Clenziderm.  </li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m very, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African-American, so I know perfect skincare products vary.</li>
            <li> [...]    I have used Obagi Nu-Derm products for years and they are the best!  </li>
            <li> I LOVE AMAZON!!!</li>
            <li> works very good.</li>
            <li> Great product, works great!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost an ideal product.</li>
            <li> Loved the product!</li>
            <li> I found the therapeutic lotion to be a good pimple zapper!</li>
            <li> so it wouldn&#x27;t overdry and that seems to work really great.  </li>
            <li> Works great..</li>
            <li> great results...love it.. .</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m happy she stopped selling it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this cleaning system and would tell a friend to try it for themself.</li>
            <li> Great price for Obagi products.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this product!!</li>
            <li> These products are amazing!</li>
            <li> The step 3 Therapeutic Moisturizer is amazing!</li>
            <li> I liked it!</li>
            <li> What an incredibly pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a medically-prescribed product, but was happy to find out that I would be able to purchase it online, and at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with my home microdermabrasion and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good for some time.</li>
            <li> Unsuccessfully, I tried monthly microdermabrasion, proactive, Perricone and all-natural Yonka with good but inconsistent results.</li>
            <li> Good to have two on hand</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Within about two weeks, many of my pimple were gone and my cystic acne had greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied about how it worked for me and how it improved the appearance and texture of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Yesterday for the first time in my life, someone told me that my skin is so flawless.</li>
            <li> Used it for 2 weeks and absolutely love Obagi!</li>
            <li> First , I will say that the seller was excellent no problems with getting the product .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and my skin has never looked better!  </li>
            <li> This is honestly the longest I have gone without getting a cyst.  </li>
            <li> I did try it and it seemed nice</li>
            <li> I have just begun to use this product so cannot give an honest opinion yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products for Cystic Acne, and this is by far the best thing I&#x27;ve come across.</li>
            <li> It is great at first for clearing up acne.</li>
            <li> Therapeutic lotion is super burning though!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product about five months ago, and my skin looks 100% better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see how my face was better when it was cracking and burning more and more with each application.     </li>
            <li> I feel like the lotion leaves my skin more oily feeling than it should.</li>
            <li> I love Obagi, but the Clenziderm line just wasn&#x27;t the one for me.</li>
            <li> This is outstanding.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this kit &amp; try out more Obagi products.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> she liked the product although she did not notice huge improvement in skin..</li>
            <li> skin looks better than it ever has before</li>
            <li> I tried many over the counter topicals but nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Love Obagi.  </li>
            <li> I decided to drop some more money and give it a try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she is already seeing fantastic results too!</li>
            <li> When I felt a pimple coming and applied this to the area, most times it went away and the pimple never came.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Liked a smooth cleanser a lot, cleans well and feels well after.</li>
            <li> I found that Exposed Skincare works perfectly for me, and helps me stay clean and clear.</li>
            <li> and my skin looks beautiful and clear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using obagi for a long time and it&#x27;s changed my acne ridden skin to flawless.</li>
            <li> cleanser is nice and mild.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad this product is still available.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced over drying of my skin and am ecstatic about the results so far.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as the MD version</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I heard good things about this line however, this particular one didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> As far as the product, I love, love, love Clenziderm!  </li>
            <li> but I may like to use it in the very Hot TEXAS summer when it&#x27;s 105 degrees &amp; when I tend to be more oily.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t appreciate that they are using so much more plastic to contain a product that is not even 2 ounces!</li>
            <li> The merchant offers a  great price and is easy to reach if their are questions which is rare these days.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay because the MD dries my skin out tooooo much!!</li>
            <li> AND I have tried proactive, acnefree, neutragena advanced acne treatment and murad(ALL</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I always wanted but never achieved even with Perricone or Yonka, and My skin feels so smooth and hydrated</li>
            <li> So silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far I have seen good reults.</li>
            <li> has not looked this good since my early 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you decided to try this system Iwish you the same amazing results I got!</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see significant results in my face</li>
            <li> The normal to oily kit has a stronger cleanser and a toner, both of which are highly effective.</li>
            <li> Even though the oral antibiotics were somewhat successful, I did not like being on daily medication</li>
            <li> :) I recommend this product to anyone who is willing to follow the directions and use this product the way it&#x27;s meant to be used.</li>
            <li> The cream face wash doesn&#x27;t clean my skin.  </li>
            <li> The best solution for my skin, I&#x27;m a 40 years old teenager that still have acne, this is the only product that I used in my life that works, and I&#x27;m using acne products for 25 years.</li>
            <li> I have been through one full kit, and all of my cystic acne is gone.</li>
            <li> started with a face full of acne</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> For 12 years now, I&#x27;ve used so many different types of products to assist in resolving a less than perfect complexion.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s seen tremendous improvement with her acne.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and packaging on kit was sealed.</li>
            <li> It also reduces an already existing pimple fairly quickly (than if I were to just leave it alone) and this reduces the scarring.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle and smooth.</li>
            <li> In fact I am way more oily then normal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using this system for a few months I am happy to say I am pretty much acne free!</li>
            <li> I do feel that it is worth noting that I have fairly oily/combination skin, but I considered how incredibly sensitive my skin is and decided to purchase the normal to dry formula and am very pleased with my decision.</li>
            <li> and I have tried everything imaginable without success.</li>
            <li> I had the really gross cystic acne, and I can honestly say...</li>
            <li> I am just thrilled that I FINALLY found something that works for me.</li>
            <li> definitely worth the $65</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to have found something that is finally working.</li>
            <li> Products were fresh and nothing was expired.</li>
            <li> The magic seems to be in the steps 2 and 3, where the medication can soak in and do the work under the skin (face washes only clean the surface).</li>
            <li> I believe I reviewed this product already, right after i started using it, and my review was favorable.</li>
            <li> This one is just right</li>
            <li> I also use a damp washcloth to wipe the cleanser off my face to really get my face clean.</li>
            <li> I try to reccomend this product to anyone with acne, because it truly is a miracle, and I LOVE that this line does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> If you have issues with sensitive skin or your skin is easily irritated, maybe you should consult with a dermatologist before using this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m in my twenties, I&#x27;m really trying hard to get rid of it for good!</li>
            <li> When I use is consistantly, my skin is clear and smooth.</li>
            <li> After the first week I noticed an improvment with my skin and was elated.</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in my skin after the first day of using this product.</li>
            <li> I went back to Proactiv and it was do much better and not damaging.</li>
            <li> At first it felt like acid on my face</li>
            <li> but before I did I thought I would try  a topical one more time.</li>
            <li> One of the reviewers was exactly like me</li>
            <li> and I noticed that my skin isn&#x27;t oily at all throughout the day and it&#x27;s been a hot and humid summer.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have ever written.</li>
            <li> I use the cleanser and moisturizer every night but only use the therapeutic lotion at night because it&#x27;s the most drying product.</li>
            <li> Luckily my skin took it fine, but it did burn like hell initially when I was using it.</li>
            <li> I will never waste my time buying cheap face washes at the drug store ever again.</li>
            <li> After using this product a few more times, I would break out with swollen bumps that itched and my face turned bright red.</li>
            <li> The skin is really much smoother!</li>
            <li> I am only on week two of using the system, but so far I love it!</li>
            <li> esthetician I visit from time to time to get chemical peels and microdermabrasions from told me that although Obagi is a good product, that it may be too harsh for certain skin types.</li>
            <li> That other review prompted me to get this amazing product that changed my skin overnight.</li>
            <li> I love the gentle cleanser from the dry/normal, especially in the Winter months.</li>
            <li> The Obagi product for normal to dry skin is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my face, hands down.</li>
            <li> I tried Proactive, Dermalogica, Mary Kay and pretty much every acne product at Ulta.</li>
            <li> My results continued and now, just over three months later, though I have an occasional pimple or hormone-related cystic acne breakout, I can finally say that I have good skin!</li>
            <li> with all topical products, it took a while to start to see results, so don&#x27;t give up until you have finished a full kit!</li>
            <li> I have the dry skin3 step which sounds like most people have this as well.     </li>
            <li> I have large pores and blackheads on my chin and around my nose, and cystic acne every now and then, for years.</li>
            <li> I was browsing amazon a few months ago searching for a new product with good reviews</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;m older (hormones!).  </li>
            <li> I find the normal to dry slightly drying, but the lotion is very good.</li>
            <li> After one week, my skin was clear, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Again, I have only been using this about 3 weeks but have never seen such amazing results.</li>
            <li> and they use that light that really can make imperfections obvious.</li>
            <li> , I tried blue light treatment that involved a cream placed on my face for an hour followed by blue light treatment for an hour.</li>
            <li> The first kit I bought was the Clenziderm for normal to oily skin which is what I have.</li>
            <li> This kit really didn&#x27;t work too well for me</li>
            <li> complexion is very nice!&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I first ordered the oily to normal skin .</li>
            <li> said it dries the skin too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Proavtiv, which does absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> Not only does it assist with any flare ups, but it assist with what looks like a natural glow of the skin and a much better looking complexion.</li>
            <li> It got pretty severe when I was in high school, and lessened as I got older, but still would act up every now and then.</li>
            <li> The system probably lasted me about 7mos using once daily, so the cost/benefit and longevity was well worth it!</li>
            <li> I developed adult acne after getting pregnant with my son 13 years ago.</li>
            <li> For 3 full days, my face was cherry red</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for most of my teen years and now as an adult (26), I&#x27;d get frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li> I no longer have to live with that feeling of my whole face hurting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to more consistent clear skin and few to none hormone breakouts.</li>
            <li> The reviews were raving plus my esthetician highly recommended it</li>
            <li> I highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> On day 5, my face peeled off and I started looking normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll post again after a few more weeks to see how it works when I&#x27;ve been through monthly cycle, which i always break out during.</li>
            <li> After consistent use for a year as my first real skin care product, I&#x27;ve noticed no real improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I even had a dermatologist prescribe me high blood pressure medication because a side effect was clear skin!</li>
            <li> I still wear face make up because of my minimal dark spots and uneven complexion from acne scars, but my skin looks essentially flawless with makeup.</li>
            <li> I stopped using ProActiv because it stopped working for me, and needed a new skincare program.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get a new cyst about every 2-3 days.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the products for  almost 3 weeks and have not had ANY new breakouts.</li>
            <li> So far I have not had a new cyst since using the product!  </li>
            <li> and I wish that prior to ALL my doctor visits, over the counter products and the blue light treatment, somone had told me about it.     </li>
            <li> As with any treatment I know that it works differently on each person, but I have tried proactiv, differin, murad, duac gel, sodium sulfacetamide wash, acne free and on and on, and this one finally seems to give results.  </li>
            <li> I could see how it could be too harsh for someone who may have more sensitive skin than mine.</li>
            <li> I also started using the clarisonic and my face looks so vibrant, clear and YOUNG!</li>
            <li> If you have somewhat sensitive skin, I highly recommend using this approach.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I chose the normal to dry because it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out the way retin-A does, but gradually helps your acne.</li>
            <li> First week of using this system, it caused my skin to burn and dry out way too much.</li>
            <li> I recently visited Essence Skin Clinic for the first time where I learned about the Obagi Clenziderm product line for acne.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no excessive drying of my skin, and I&#x27;m beginning to see drastic improvement of my skin.  </li>
            <li> More IS NOT better.  </li>
            <li> I saw her spots disappear and even her wrinkles left too, so I figured if Obagi had an acne line I was willing to try it.</li>
            <li> Just a little pimple here and there, which most of the times you can barely see it.</li>
            <li> We really liike this product and even though it says it&#x27;s for normal to dry skin, it clears up acne fast on my daughter&#x27;s face.  </li>
            <li> I bought the normal to dry skin because I live in the desert area &amp; can peel/dry pretty easy with harsh products.  </li>
            <li> Low and behold in my first 2-3 weeks of this Obaji stuff, my skin is almost clear.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In summary, the first and third product (for me) are negligible and completely replaceable by Cetaphil or Aveeno brands.</li>
            <li> This is the first product i&#x27;ve used that seems to help clear up my skin, without making it worse before getting better.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed that so many people had great experiences.</li>
            <li> It takes a while for that to start to clear, but it will with this</li>
            <li> My esthetician said it was hormonal and to change my diet, which I did, but still could not get my skin to clear up.</li>
            <li> I am 27 years old</li>
            <li> I have cystic acne at age 46 and early (surgical menopause).  </li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my cystic adult Acne.</li>
            <li> If you are at the point where you are willing to try this, you probably have some long term damage and scarring.</li>
            <li> After much trial and error I came back to this one.</li>
            <li> Struggled with adolescent and adult acne, tried everything even prescription meds.</li>
            <li> All in all, my skin cleared up in 3.5 days, I developed that glow</li>
            <li> friend had seen a dermatologist for age spots she had developed and the Dr. suggested one of the Obagi systems to her.</li>
            <li> The unexpected happened as she told me, &amp;#34;Your</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 21 years old and started getting acne at the age of 16.</li>
            <li> So I really paid $70+ just to get the second bottle, the Therapeutic Lotion.</li>
            <li> went on Amazon to see if they sold the product, and I was surprised that they did.</li>
            <li> This, needless to say, was a good day for me.</li>
            <li> I recommend the normal to dry unless you have very oily skin.</li>
            <li> Only to be told I&#x27;d need to do a couple more due to my skin not reacting to the treatment and possibly continue ocassional treatments after.</li>
            <li> First time user and will continue using this product for a very long time....</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product that actually WORKS!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched between using Normal To Dry and Normal</li>
            <li> I ordered this Normal to dry Skin, and I received the Normal to Oily Skin.</li>
            <li> so I switched to the NuDerm line and it has removed quite a bit of my scarring, my face isn&#x27;t red like it used to be, the texture is smooth, and the break out are few and far between...</li>
            <li> Acne ensued over the last few years and with the addition of bioidentical estrogen and testosterone (which I love), my skin took a further beating.  </li>
            <li> Obagi products can become HIGHLY drying and can reverse your current problem into an opposite, new problem.  </li>
            <li> I occasionally get a pimple here and there, which I notice is usually related to a new product I might use on my face (I stick to oil-free products now) or if I eat something very spicy, but NOTHING compared to what I was getting the 20 years prior.</li>
            <li> First time using it my black heads were gone and it took about a week for my blemishes to clear.  </li>
            <li> I started getting adult acne when I turned 30 and suffered for almost 6 years before finding the  Clenziderm Normal to Dry system.</li>
            <li> We tried several other products without much success.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had clear skin since 1 month after starting.</li>
            <li> I spent, considering how much I have spent at the dr. office, drugstore, dept. store, Whole Foods, skin care MD, etc.  </li>
            <li> My pores seem smaller and my old breakouts are healing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: After my second kit, I changed over to the Normal to oily version of the same product.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many products over the years that have either done nothing to ones that made it even worse.</li>
            <li> Then I saw the reviews for the normal to dry skin system.</li>
            <li> I  then ordered the normal to dry .</li>
            <li> but I got the kit for dry and normal skin since people using the oily/normal skin kit</li>
            <li> I use the normal to dry line so as to not excessively dry out my skin and my skin</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was very skeptical and did not have high hopes.</li>
            <li> This product does not dry my skin.  </li>
            <li> and some helped a little at first</li>
            <li> The face wash is gental on the skin, the step 2 Therapeutic Lotion (isn&#x27;t always so \\&quot;therapeutic\\&quot;)sometimes feels a little hot or burning on your face, but seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed for the price of this product as there are much better moisturizers, face washes, and creams available for a much cheaper or equivalent</li>
            <li> Taking a tip from other reviewer, I ordered the normal to dry instead of normal to oily</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months now for minor breakouts and my skin has completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> While most college students are grown out of their teen acne, mine seemed to only get worse.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth and I am wearing less and less makeup</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Use a few cycles of the normal to dry to get your skin used to the product and then gradually change over to the normal to oily.</li>
            <li> we get SO LITTLE for how much we&#x27;re paying</li>
            <li> but my esetician told me to use the normal to dry, not the one for oily skin, because it would make my skin too dry.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on Amazon (both good and bad) about Obagi Clenziderm.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser works like no other and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin.</li>
            <li> I woke up with no new cysts and my skin was much calmer and less oily.  </li>
            <li> On the advice of the other reviewers I ordered the kit for normal to dry skin so as to avoid over drying.</li>
            <li> (I say attempted because nearly all of my face was covered with pimples and cystic acne and you aren&#x27;t supposed to do the microderm over active breakouts).</li>
            <li> However, my skin quickly went back to breaking out and looked worse than before.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been difficult to find a product that&#x27;s strong enough to help my skin but without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> When I do get a breakout, it doesn&#x27;t get as big as it used to &amp; it doesn&#x27;t stay as long.  </li>
            <li> They last a long time anyways.</li>
            <li> My skin has peeled a little as it adjusts to the new products, but I must admit that my pores have shrunk and stopped producing day to day bumps.  </li>
            <li> My skin is oily but is very dry after just a shower or a brief swim at the local swimming pool.</li>
            <li> I only use the Therapeutic Lotion on breakouts because my skin tends to dry out if I use it all over.</li>
            <li> With continued use, my face was so dry I was breaking out all over again and had to regain extra moisture.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve seen countless dermatologists over the years, all who prescribed painful, unsuccessful medications and eventually told me that I would more than likely grow out of it.</li>
            <li> Like most people with acne, I was desperate for a solution...</li>
            <li> The therapeutic moisturizer from dry/normal is also such a treat for dry winter skin!!</li>
            <li> Currently I have found products I feel equal result with less damaging effects.</li>
            <li> but they are no longer the painful huge mounds and typically clear up in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> My skin felt so dry after washing it,</li>
            <li> and I never feel as if my skin is dry.  </li>
            <li> I wait until my face is completely dry before applying the therapeutic lotion.  </li>
            <li> I washed my face with the cream and then dried it off with my white towel and a ton of the tinted sunscreen that I had been wearing earlier</li>
            <li> I can not live with out this.  </li>
            <li> I have not had one single cyst since I started using this regimen.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical and did not want to pay the full price (over $100)</li>
            <li> One of the medications I used when I was younger scarred my cheek areas badly, so I am working now to fade those, but this product is so gentle that I can actually work on that while keeping my skin clear with Clenziderm.   </li>
            <li> I am also getting married this summer and was desperate to find something to finally clear my skin once and for all.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using this a week ago with over half of it left.</li>
            <li> I had bad break outs and tried most over the counter products which didnt work, including proactive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 &amp; have struggled with adult acne since my late 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I spent 500 dollars.</li>
            <li> I still get a few hormonal breakouts here and there, but they are tiny and don&#x27;t stick around forever like the cystic</li>
            <li> It is a bit expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for roughly two months now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a big waste and they&#x27;re not fooling anyone!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could have purchased the same stuff from the drugstore for less than $20!</li>
            <li> The only slight help is microdermabrasion but still those big suckers keep coming.  </li>
            <li> and now it&#x27;s only a slight stinging sensation for a few minutes while it sinks in and</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m left with a small can of Benzoyl Peroxide and Moisturizer for $100.  </li>
            <li> I am hooked and now will try their other products....</li>
            <li> It has taken it to the next level, and I am not even getting the small hormonal breakouts anymore.</li>
            <li> and I tried other products instead.</li>
            <li> I only occasionaly get a small blemish and thats it.  </li>
            <li> I tried other acne creams, face washes, nothing worked.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews, if you&#x27;ve tried everything, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try this.</li>
            <li> I also use a prescription salicylic acid (6%) that is a higher strength than this fake stuff--so I dont have an allergy.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using Clenziderm since Nov. 2011 with very minimal results.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews and not a single one was negative.</li>
            <li> and once again I was let down.</li>
            <li> The ingredients were too strong for my skin and it burned and irritated my skin severely :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;So disappointed that I spent $100 on a face wash cream that doesn&#x27;t clean my face.</li>
            <li> I normally only review products that I find to be either outstanding or horrible.</li>
            <li> I need less makeup to cover my skin</li>
            <li> that is typical for acne treatment products.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser in the oily/normal leaves my skin tight</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but worthed.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m going to give it a little longer and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I am 46 and have been suffering with painful cystic adult acne for several years.</li>
            <li> My acne was painful and rarely came to a head.</li>
            <li> I received and began using my kit in mid-January and within a few days I began to see a noticeable clearing/smoothing of a few areas of my skin.</li>
            <li> To Oily for a few years now.</li>
            <li> Some products have drying properties while others in the set are way too heavy and oily on the skin.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this product after she worked at a dermatologist&#x27;s office for a few months as an intern in school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had so much trouble with my skin that I&#x27;m jaded so, although this is working well now</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Nothing seemed to help, and it was always too harsh for my skin.  </li>
            <li> A few people mentioned even though they had oily skin this kit worked for them.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the therapeutic moisturizer because it feels heavy on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product are the parabens in the cleanser and moisturizer, but I&#x27;ll take it if it doesn&#x27;t make my skin worse.</li>
            <li> A few reviews mentioned drying skin...</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to use an additional heavy duty moisturizer and not use the product everyday as acne clears.</li>
            <li> but if I feel a zit coming on I will put it on at night too (hint- it will bleach you pillow case and wash cloths due to the peroxide in it, I found that out the hard way).</li>
            <li> I am a high school teacher and it was driving me crazy that my skin was worse than my teenage students.  </li>
            <li> It makes me feel sick to pay this much for 1.6oz., but it works!</li>
            <li> You need very little</li>
            <li> I notice I get a few pimples when I&#x27;ve been too lazy at night or miss my morning application if I&#x27;m runing late.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if there is a price difference, but this is misleading.  </li>
            <li> And no more cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less than a month after using the product, all my acne was gone!!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy it, altho it was very pricey ($100+), because I was desperate for something to work and it did!</li>
            <li> I am only writing it because I know how awful adult acne is and how hard it is to find something that works.</li>
            <li> At least give this a shot.    </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how dirty my face would still be if I had been wearing actual makeup.</li>
            <li> and I mean everything.  </li>
            <li> Where has this product been for the past 20 years?!?</li>
            <li> There are gentler and less expensive products out there.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out but feels crazy.</li>
            <li> After the treatment was over, my acne got worse.</li>
            <li> which probably is what made me break out even worse.</li>
            <li> In fact, I think it may have made it worse.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to anyone who has to deal with the horrible embarrassment of adlt cystic acne.</li>
            <li> Both creams dried my skin out so badly that I couldn&#x27;t continue the use because it was so painful on my skin.</li>
            <li> Desperate</li>
            <li> I am now out if Proactiv and desperately need to use dkbething, so I&#x27;m going to give this another shot,  </li>
            <li> As a Prime member, this is really disappointing.</li>
            <li> This sounded just plain awful.     </li>
            <li> My chin was the worst spot and as soon as one horrible zit would heal I could feel another 2 or 3 budding.</li>
            <li> and they were very expensive.</li>
            <li> So disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Seems like I&#x27;m always disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love this product. So stop asking.</li>
            <li> This product line has truly made such a difference in my skin and I have tried everything imaginable without success. I&#x27;ve had acne since I was ten and I&#x27;ve seen countless dermatologists over the years, all who prescribed painful, unsuccessful medications and eventually told me that I would more than likely grow out of it. I am now twenty-four and have finally found a method that works for me. I ordered this product after a friend who is an esthetician performed a facial and attempted a microderm on me (I say attempted because nearly all of my face was covered with pimples and cystic acne and you aren&#x27;t supposed to do the microderm over active breakouts). I received and began using my kit in mid-January and within a few days I began to see a noticeable clearing/smoothing of a few areas of my skin. Within about two weeks, many of my pimple were gone and my cystic acne had greatly reduced. My results continued and now, just over three months later, though I have an occasional pimple or hormone-related cystic acne breakout, I can finally say that I have good skin! One of the medications I used when I was younger scarred my cheek areas badly, so I am working now to fade those, but this product is so gentle that I can actually work on that while keeping my skin clear with Clenziderm.   I do feel that it is worth noting that I have fairly oily/combination skin, but I considered how incredibly sensitive my skin is and decided to purchase the normal to dry formula and am very pleased with my decision. Also, I suggest investing in some sunscreen if you don&#x27;t use it already. I&#x27;ve noticed it has increased my sensitivity to sun if I slack off and forget to apply  sunscreen like I should.</li>
            <li> I cannot rave enough about this product. I am 21, and I have suffered with acne since I was about 13. I had the really gross cystic acne, and I can honestly say... I have not had one single cyst since I started using this regimen. I started using this product about five months ago, and my skin looks 100% better. I try to reccomend this product to anyone with acne, because it truly is a miracle, and I LOVE that this line does not dry out my skin. Like most people with acne, I was desperate for a solution...so I tried everything on the market, and clenziderm truly changed my life! It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I went to see an Aesthetician for a microdermabrasion treatment and she introduced me to Obagi. I was SO hesitant to try this because it was $140 total at her office AND I have tried proactive, acnefree, neutragena advanced acne treatment and murad(ALL of which, stianed my clothes and sheets so I had to sleep with a towel on my pillow)     I went to the dermatologist for perscription strength medecine such as Differen and Retin-A with oral antiobiotics which caused side effects AND require you to spend money monthly on medications and doctor visits. Both creams dried my skin out so badly that I couldn&#x27;t continue the use because it was so painful on my skin. I didn&#x27;t see how my face was better when it was cracking and burning more and more with each application.     Desperate, I tried blue light treatment that involved a cream placed on my face for an hour followed by blue light treatment for an hour. For 3 full days, my face was cherry red and I had to stay out of the sunlight- not to mention it hurt. On day 5, my face peeled off and I started looking normal. I spent 500 dollars. After the treatment was over, my acne got worse. Only to be told I&#x27;d need to do a couple more due to my skin not reacting to the treatment and possibly continue ocassional treatments after. This sounded just plain awful.     I finally found an Aesthetician who convinced me to try Obagi and I wish that prior to ALL my doctor visits, over the counter products and the blue light treatment, somone had told me about it.     Like all acne, treatment results vary from person to person. I wanted to post this for those who have tried EVERYTHING and still have not found a solution. At least give this a shot.    The only downside is you must be consistant with the usage. I notice I get a few pimples when I&#x27;ve been too lazy at night or miss my morning application if I&#x27;m runing late.Then I apply it and it goes away within days. When I use is consistantly, my skin is clear and smooth. I have the dry skin3 step which sounds like most people have this as well.     Amazon also has the CHEAPEST price I have found, anywhere!</li>
            <li> I have only been use this product for a week and already I can see a difference on my skin.</li>
            <li> I am 27 years old and I have had medium-severe acne since I was 13. I have tried EVERYTHING!!! I have have prescription oral and topical medication, proactive, and just about everything over the counter and some helped a little at first and then it would come back. I was browsing amazon a few months ago searching for a new product with good reviews and I came across this. The reviews were raving plus my esthetician highly recommended it but it was $150 at her office so I went with amazon. It&#x27;s been 3 months and my skin is incredible! Yesterday for the first time in my life, someone told me that my skin is so flawless. I have known this person for a month and she couldn&#x27;t believe that my skin hasn&#x27;t always looked that way. I am just thrilled that I FINALLY found something that works for me. I also started using the clarisonic and my face looks so vibrant, clear and YOUNG! I never leave reviews but I just had to share so that maybe this could help someone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched between using Normal To Dry and Normal To Oily for a few years now. Currently I have found products I feel equal result with less damaging effects. I feel like the lotion leaves my skin more oily feeling than it should. There are gentler and less expensive products out there.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t totally impressed with this... I didn&#x27;t see significant results in my face so I switched to the NuDerm line and it has removed quite a bit of my scarring, my face isn&#x27;t red like it used to be, the texture is smooth, and the break out are few and far between... I love Obagi, but the Clenziderm line just wasn&#x27;t the one for me.</li>
            <li> I believe I reviewed this product already, right after i started using it, and my review was favorable. After the first week I noticed an improvment with my skin and was elated. However, my skin quickly went back to breaking out and looked worse than before. This product burned my face with each wash and the lotion was not soothing at all. My skin felt so dry after washing it, which probably is what made me break out even worse. It is very similar to Proactiv, which also didn&#x27;t help my skin. I stopped using this a week ago with over half of it left. I will never use this again, nor would I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about everything for my acne. Now that I&#x27;m in my twenties, I&#x27;m really trying hard to get rid of it for good! So I&#x27;ve been using Clenziderm since Nov. 2011 with very minimal results. I read all the reviews and not a single one was negative. I just haven&#x27;t notice a significant difference and am really disappointed because I was almost sure this was going to work for me based on other reviews. I haven&#x27;t given up yet though..</li>
            <li> So disappointed with this product.  The cream face wash doesn&#x27;t clean my skin.  I washed my face with the cream and then dried it off with my white towel and a ton of the tinted sunscreen that I had been wearing earlier came off onto the towel.  The same thing happened the day before when I tried washing off my tinted moisturizer.  I can&#x27;t imagine how dirty my face would still be if I had been wearing actual makeup. GROSS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed that I spent $100 on a face wash cream that doesn&#x27;t clean my face. Now I&#x27;m left with a small can of Benzoyl Peroxide and Moisturizer for $100.  I could have purchased the same stuff from the drugstore for less than $20!</li>
            <li> The products are mixed.  Some products have drying properties while others in the set are way too heavy and oily on the skin.</li>
            <li> I have cystic acne at age 46 and early (surgical menopause).  Acne ensued over the last few years and with the addition of bioidentical estrogen and testosterone (which I love), my skin took a further beating.  I have tried everything and I mean everything.  The only slight help is microdermabrasion but still those big suckers keep coming.  Low and behold in my first 2-3 weeks of this Obaji stuff, my skin is almost clear.  I cannot believe it.  Taking a tip from other reviewer, I ordered the normal to dry instead of normal to oily so it wouldn&#x27;t overdry and that seems to work really great.  I am hooked and now will try their other products....definitely worth the $65 I spent, considering how much I have spent at the dr. office, drugstore, dept. store, Whole Foods, skin care MD, etc.  The magic seems to be in the steps 2 and 3, where the medication can soak in and do the work under the skin (face washes only clean the surface).</li>
            <li> Used it for 2 weeks and absolutely love Obagi! My acne has cleared up. I hope that it continues to work!</li>
            <li> I am of Asian descent, and I&#x27;ve had acne since I was about 10. It got pretty severe when I was in high school, and lessened as I got older, but still would act up every now and then. I was hoping this would help but it didn&#x27;t at all. In fact, I think it may have made it worse. I stopped using ProActiv because it stopped working for me, and needed a new skincare program. This program did not work for me. I found that Exposed Skincare works perfectly for me, and helps me stay clean and clear.</li>
            <li> These products are amazing!</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference in my skin after the first day of using this product. After one week, my skin was clear, soft and smooth. I normally only review products that I find to be either outstanding or horrible. This is outstanding. I recommend the normal to dry unless you have very oily skin. I find the normal to dry slightly drying, but the lotion is very good. I use this in combination with my home microdermabrasion and my skin hasn&#x27;t looked this good for some time.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything for my cystic adult Acne. Everything. This is the only thing that has ever made a substantial impact. I have been through one full kit, and all of my cystic acne is gone. I still get a few hormonal breakouts here and there, but they are tiny and don&#x27;t stick around forever like the cystic stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all topical products, it took a while to start to see results, so don&#x27;t give up until you have finished a full kit! If you are at the point where you are willing to try this, you probably have some long term damage and scarring. It takes a while for that to start to clear, but it will with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled to have found something that is finally working. I no longer have to live with that feeling of my whole face hurting. My skin feels so smooth and I am wearing less and less makeup every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After my second kit, I changed over to the Normal to oily version of the same product. It has taken it to the next level, and I am not even getting the small hormonal breakouts anymore. If you have somewhat sensitive skin, I highly recommend using this approach. Use a few cycles of the normal to dry to get your skin used to the product and then gradually change over to the normal to oily. The normal to oily kit has a stronger cleanser and a toner, both of which are highly effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 &amp; have struggled with adult acne since my late 20&#x27;s.  I have tried every acnes system out there from dermalogica &amp; murad to whatever the TV is selling this week.  Nothing has EVER worked as the reviews/commercials say, until I started using the Obagi system.  I bought the normal to dry skin because I live in the desert area &amp; can peel/dry pretty easy with harsh products.  My skin has peeled a little as it adjusts to the new products, but I must admit that my pores have shrunk and stopped producing day to day bumps.  The big, hormonal breakouts have drastically reduced.  When I do get a breakout, it doesn&#x27;t get as big as it used to &amp; it doesn&#x27;t stay as long.  My skin is by no means perfect, yet, but it is getting there.  I will continue to buy this kit &amp; try out more Obagi products.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Menopause has not been a friend to my skin but after using it a couple of days my skin has cleared up.  You need very little and I never feel as if my skin is dry.  Thank you, Obagi!!</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-forties and have struggled with acne for years. I used to buy this product years ago, but had stopped for a while and I tried other products instead. After much trial and error I came back to this one. I use the cleaner and moisturizer every night. I only use the Therapeutic Lotion on breakouts because my skin tends to dry out if I use it all over. I&#x27;ve been back to using this system since mid-March and my skin is beginning to improve again. I&#x27;m so glad this product is still available.</li>
            <li> First week of using this system, it caused my skin to burn and dry out way too much. Took my skin almost two weeks to recover from the burns. Very disappointed that so many people had great experiences. Seems like I&#x27;m always disappointed. I went back to Proactiv and it was do much better and not damaging. I am now out if Proactiv and desperately need to use dkbething, so I&#x27;m going to give this another shot,  I&#x27;m cade I may overused it. I did use if twice a day when it says to start off only using it once a day. So hoping it was my lack of following directions. Will post updates.</li>
            <li> Omg! Works great.. First time user and will continue using this product for a very long time....great results...love it.. .</li>
            <li> my teenager and I ( yes, me.) have tried several over the counter acne products, nothing worked until we tried this. It&#x27;s a little pricey but worthed. They last a long time anyways.</li>
            <li> Let me tell you: do not use this product without a Doctor&#x27;s instruction. Obagi products can become HIGHLY drying and can reverse your current problem into an opposite, new problem.  It is great at first for clearing up acne. Once you see improvements, I would BACK OFF. With continued use, my face was so dry I was breaking out all over again and had to regain extra moisture. I couldn&#x27;t keep up!</li>
            <li> Best product out there. Struggled with adolescent and adult acne, tried everything even prescription meds. I&#x27;m 26 and I&#x27;ve been using obagi for 9months- started with a face full of acne and I&#x27;ve had clear skin since 1 month after starting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months now for minor breakouts and my skin has completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> bought for my daughter..she liked the product although she did not notice huge improvement in skin..immediately..bought a second time..results not in yet</li>
            <li> I ordered this Normal to dry Skin, and I received the Normal to Oily Skin. This product has been discontinued. The products listed in the order are not what I received!!</li>
            <li> I used to get this product from my esetician but she no longer sells it so I ordered it on Amazon...its way cheaper this way so I&#x27;m happy she stopped selling it, otherwise I would have never needed to order it, it took about a week or two to come.  As far as the product, I love, love, love Clenziderm!  I had bad break outs and tried most over the counter products which didnt work, including proactive.  My esetician recomended Clenziderm and ever since using it I only occasionaly get a small blemish and thats it.  This product does not dry my skin.  I have oily skin but my esetician told me to use the normal to dry, not the one for oily skin, because it would make my skin too dry. I can not live with out this.  I have been using it for about a year.  First time using it my black heads were gone and it took about a week for my blemishes to clear.  I don&#x27;t use the moisturizer because I don&#x27;t need to.  I only use the therapeutic cream at night before bed.  The cleanser I use at night and in the morning. I recommend this product to everyone suffering with break outs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve said it before and I say it again...works very good. I&#x27;m happy with this cleaning system and would tell a friend to try it for themself.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a month and it&#x27;s fantastic.  At first it felt like acid on my face but I guess I&#x27;ve adjusted and now it&#x27;s only a slight stinging sensation for a few minutes while it sinks in and dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks better than it ever has before and I&#x27;ve had acne since I was about 12.  I&#x27;ve been using prescription benzaclin since I was 16 and still used it at 30.  A friend of mine recommended this product after she worked at a dermatologist&#x27;s office for a few months as an intern in school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had so much trouble with my skin that I&#x27;m jaded so, although this is working well now and my skin looks beautiful and clear, I&#x27;m going to give it a little longer and see what happens.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product!! Was using Proactiv for years and it stopped working for me. Started using Obagi and it&#x27;s a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> excellent treatment for acne. Both my daughters use it regularly and have for about 4 years. It is a bit expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> &#x27;m 33 and began getting hormonal breakouts along my jawline a couple years ago. Unsuccessfully, I tried monthly microdermabrasion, proactive, Perricone and all-natural Yonka with good but inconsistent results. At Bikram yoga, an aesthetician recommended Obagi. I have combo skin/dehydrated skin, so I bought both oily/normal and dry/normal systems. I love the gentle cleanser from the dry/normal, especially in the Winter months. It&#x27;s very gentle and smooth. The therapeutic moisturizer from dry/normal is also such a treat for dry winter skin!! What a glow! The cleanser in the oily/normal leaves my skin tight but I may like to use it in the very Hot TEXAS summer when it&#x27;s 105 degrees &amp; when I tend to be more oily. The pore toner in the oily/normal is such a treat- I like to use it winter or summer. The therapeutic treatment that comes with both systems I only used on my acne along the jawline. All in all, my skin cleared up in 3.5 days, I developed that glow I always wanted but never achieved even with Perricone or Yonka, and My skin feels so smooth and hydrated I don&#x27;t even wear make-up to work. I&#x27;m looking forward to more consistent clear skin and few to none hormone breakouts.</li>
            <li> Great product, works great!! Not as strong as the MD version but that&#x27;s okay because the MD dries my skin out tooooo much!! This one is just right</li>
            <li> I just finished the entire product and I did not see a difference on my skin.  I used it for a total of three months or so.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been suffering from acne from about age 13.  I am 26 now.  I recently visited Essence Skin Clinic for the first time where I learned about the Obagi Clenziderm product line for acne.  I have been going to the dermatologist throughout my teen years and have used probably 15 different prescriptions.  Nothing seemed to help, and it was always too harsh for my skin.  I am only on week two of using the system, but so far I love it! I was really skeptical and did not want to pay the full price (over $100) but I decided to go for it anyway.  Now that I see I can get it cheaper from Amazon I&#x27;ll probably do that.  I&#x27;ve had no excessive drying of my skin, and I&#x27;m beginning to see drastic improvement of my skin.  I had a mixture of smaller pimples and blackheads as well as cystic acne.  I&#x27;d get a new cyst about every 2-3 days.  Just when one would heal, another would pop up.  So far I have not had a new cyst since using the product!  This is honestly the longest I have gone without getting a cyst.  I am a high school teacher and it was driving me crazy that my skin was worse than my teenage students.  I am also getting married this summer and was desperate to find something to finally clear my skin once and for all.  As with any treatment I know that it works differently on each person, but I have tried proactiv, differin, murad, duac gel, sodium sulfacetamide wash, acne free and on and on, and this one finally seems to give results.  I&#x27;ll post again after a few more weeks to see how it works when I&#x27;ve been through monthly cycle, which i always break out during.</li>
            <li> I am 46 and have been suffering with painful cystic adult acne for several years. I have tried both over the counter products as well as prescription oral antibiotics to deal with the acne. Even though the oral antibiotics were somewhat successful, I did not like being on daily medication and they were very expensive. So I went off last year. The acne came back with a vengeance. I tried many over the counter topicals but nothing worked. So I was going to go back on the antibiotics, but before I did I thought I would try  a topical one more time. I read the reviews on Amazon (both good and bad) about Obagi Clenziderm.  One of the reviewers was exactly like me so, I ordered it.  Honestly, I was very skeptical and did not have high hopes. What an incredibly pleasant surprise. Since day 1 I noticed a difference. I woke up with no new cysts and my skin was much calmer and less oily.  That hadn&#x27;t happened in months!  I have been using the products for  almost 3 weeks and have not had ANY new breakouts. I truly cannot believe it!  My pores seem smaller and my old breakouts are healing. I need less makeup to cover my skin and I noticed that my skin isn&#x27;t oily at all throughout the day and it&#x27;s been a hot and humid summer. Even the oral antibiotics did not work this well. On the advice of the other reviewers I ordered the kit for normal to dry skin so as to avoid over drying. I am only using the three step system at night and only use the recommended amount. More IS NOT better.  I also use a damp washcloth to wipe the cleanser off my face to really get my face clean. I wait until my face is completely dry before applying the therapeutic lotion.  When that dries I apply the moisturizer. I use my regular anti-aging products in the morning.  I haven&#x27;t experienced over drying of my skin and am ecstatic about the results so far. Again, I have only been using this about 3 weeks but have never seen such amazing results. This is the first review I have ever written. I am only writing it because I know how awful adult acne is and how hard it is to find something that works. That other review prompted me to get this amazing product that changed my skin overnight. I know it won&#x27;t work the same on everyone, but if you are in peri-menopause or menopause and your skin is suffering as a result, give this a try.</li>
            <li> Love Obagi.  I have been on the Nuderm for 1 year now.  I started to alternate my Nuderm with the Clenziderm as I have acne that pops up now that I&#x27;m older (hormones!).  The merchant offers a  great price and is easy to reach if their are questions which is rare these days.</li>
            <li> Great seller! Loved the product!</li>
            <li> The item description says this &#x27;System includes CLENZIderm M.D. Daily Care Foaming Cleanser 4oz., Pore Therapy 4oz., Serum Gel 1.7oz. and cotton swabs&#x27;.  I just received it today, the package has 1 Daily Care Cream Cleanser, 1 Therapeutic Lotion and 1 Therapeutic Moisturizer.  I am not sure if there is a price difference, but this is misleading.  Please check with the supplier before you order this.</li>
            <li> I developed adult acne after getting pregnant with my son 13 years ago. My acne was painful and rarely came to a head. My chin was the worst spot and as soon as one horrible zit would heal I could feel another 2 or 3 budding. I have tried so many products over the years that have either done nothing to ones that made it even worse. I tried Proactive, Dermalogica, Mary Kay and pretty much every acne product at Ulta. I even had a dermatologist prescribe me high blood pressure medication because a side effect was clear skin! After having my blood pressure bottom out I threw the pills away. NOTHING worked.&lt;br /&gt;My friend had seen a dermatologist for age spots she had developed and the Dr. suggested one of the Obagi systems to her. I saw her spots disappear and even her wrinkles left too, so I figured if Obagi had an acne line I was willing to try it. The first kit I bought was the Clenziderm for normal to oily skin which is what I have. In fact I am way more oily then normal. This kit really didn&#x27;t work too well for me and once again I was let down. Then I saw the reviews for the normal to dry skin system. A few people mentioned even though they had oily skin this kit worked for them. I decided to drop some more money and give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;After using this system for a few months I am happy to say I am pretty much acne free! I am so happy with the results! I still do get a spot here or there but they are no longer the painful huge mounds and typically clear up in a couple of days. I use the cleanser in the morning and at night, I use the therapeutic lotion typically only in the am but if I feel a zit coming on I will put it on at night too (hint- it will bleach you pillow case and wash cloths due to the peroxide in it, I found that out the hard way). I don&#x27;t use the therapeutic moisturizer because it feels heavy on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the system for my teenage daughter 2 weeks ago and she is already seeing fantastic results too! If you decided to try this system Iwish you the same amazing results I got!</li>
            <li> For 12 years now, I&#x27;ve used so many different types of products to assist in resolving a less than perfect complexion. My skin is oily but is very dry after just a shower or a brief swim at the local swimming pool. It&#x27;s been difficult to find a product that&#x27;s strong enough to help my skin but without drying out my skin. The Obagi product for normal to dry skin is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used on my face, hands down. Not only does it assist with any flare ups, but it assist with what looks like a natural glow of the skin and a much better looking complexion. I had gone to the Dentist some time ago and they use that light that really can make imperfections obvious. The unexpected happened as she told me, &amp;#34;Your complexion is very nice!&amp;#34;. This, needless to say, was a good day for me. :) I recommend this product to anyone who is willing to follow the directions and use this product the way it&#x27;s meant to be used.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my daughter.  She&#x27;s seen tremendous improvement with her acne.  We tried several other products without much success.  Would definitely recommend trying.</li>
            <li> Swear by this for acne!</li>
            <li> The best solution for my skin, I&#x27;m a 40 years old teenager that still have acne, this is the only product that I used in my life that works, and I&#x27;m using acne products for 25 years.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly and packaging on kit was sealed. Products were fresh and nothing was expired. So far I have seen good reults.</li>
            <li> After consistent use for a year as my first real skin care product, I&#x27;ve noticed no real improvement in my skin. Very disappointed for the price of this product as there are much better moisturizers, face washes, and creams available for a much cheaper or equivalent price.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t believe the hype.</li>
            <li> This is only my experience of using this product , Yours may be different . First , I will say that the seller was excellent no problems with getting the product . It was delivered as the seller stated . I will rate the seller 100%. Now the product . I had a severe breakout about 3 months ago and after doing research I ran accross this product . I first ordered the oily to normal skin . When I applied it this stuff stung like nothing before . I used the entire product and so no iprovement . I  then ordered the normal to dry . No improvement . The only thing Obagi did for me was to make me almost $200 pooerer. It did nothing but burn my skin and did nothing to help the break outs .</li>
            <li> Finally a product that works. I do not have acne but for about a year I had some stubborn pimples that won&#x27;t go away. I tried other acne creams, face washes, nothing worked. With this kit a saw an improvement after couple of times that I used it. The cleanser works like no other and doesn&#x27;t dry the skin. I have combination skin but I got the kit for dry and normal skin since people using the oily/normal skin kit said it dries the skin too much. I&#x27;m very satisfied about how it worked for me and how it improved the appearance and texture of my skin.  I also got separately the pore therapy toner and I use that 1-2 times a week. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything (every facial cleanser on the market, facials, microdermabrasion, retin-A, minocycline, tetracycline, birth controls..you name it.) I have large pores and blackheads on my chin and around my nose, and cystic acne every now and then, for years. I&#x27;m 21 years old and started getting acne at the age of 16. While most college students are grown out of their teen acne, mine seemed to only get worse. I read the reviews and thought, why not give it a try. I&#x27;m glad I chose the normal to dry because it doesn&#x27;t dry my face out the way retin-A does, but gradually helps your acne. It&#x27;s almost an ideal product. I use the cleanser and moisturizer every night but only use the therapeutic lotion at night because it&#x27;s the most drying product. I get the occasional cyst or break out around my menstrual cycle, but I&#x27;m finally getting compliments on my skin!! I have NEVER received compliments on my skin. I still wear face make up because of my minimal dark spots and uneven complexion from acne scars, but my skin looks essentially flawless with makeup. I&#x27;ve been using this for roughly two months now and I&#x27;m very, very happy with it. Like the other reviews, if you&#x27;ve tried everything, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try this. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product are the parabens in the cleanser and moisturizer, but I&#x27;ll take it if it doesn&#x27;t make my skin worse. I would definitely recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using obagi for a long time and it&#x27;s changed my acne ridden skin to flawless.</li>
            <li> I heard good things about this line however, this particular one didn&#x27;t work for me. The ingredients were too strong for my skin and it burned and irritated my skin severely :(</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I couldn&#x27;t find a way to purchase the Therapeutic Lotion (with 5% benzoyl peroxide) by itself. I found the therapeutic lotion to be a good pimple zapper! When I felt a pimple coming and applied this to the area, most times it went away and the pimple never came. It also reduces an already existing pimple fairly quickly (than if I were to just leave it alone) and this reduces the scarring. I love this product but it is SO EXPENSIVE because the bottle size is misleading...we get SO LITTLE for how much we&#x27;re paying and I really don&#x27;t appreciate that they are using so much more plastic to contain a product that is not even 2 ounces! It&#x27;s a big waste and they&#x27;re not fooling anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser is nice and mild. I use a stronger cleanser at night but this one works well for my morning face wash. It feels and works just like Cetaphil&#x27;s Daily Facial Cleanser though which costs $7 for an 8oz bottle. For the 3rd bottle in this pack, I use a different moisturizer so I don&#x27;t use the third product at all. I did try it and it seemed nice enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the first and third product (for me) are negligible and completely replaceable by Cetaphil or Aveeno brands. So I really paid $70+ just to get the second bottle, the Therapeutic Lotion. It makes me feel sick to pay this much for 1.6oz., but it works! The second I don&#x27;t need it anymore or find something else that works the same on my face that is cheaper, I will stop buying this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne for most of my teen years and now as an adult (26), I&#x27;d get frequent breakouts. I&#x27;m African-American, so I know perfect skincare products vary. I&#x27;ve tried Proavtiv, which does absolutely nothing for my skin. I discovered Obagi when I went to get a specialized facial. I decided to buy it, altho it was very pricey ($100+), because I was desperate for something to work and it did! My skin was the clearest it has ever been.. Radiant!! I&#x27;d constantly get compliments, which NEVER happened before. The system probably lasted me about 7mos using once daily, so the cost/benefit and longevity was well worth it! I wised up and bought from Amazon and will continue to! I also use their NuDerm sunscreen SPF 50, which works well too!</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about this product. I have severe cystic acne, and this is the ONLY product I have ever found to save me from an episode. I highly, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have just begun to use this product so cannot give an honest opinion yet.</li>
            <li> Where has this product been for the past 20 years?!? Not only have I suffered acne since I was like 12, it continued into my 30s! I was constantly breaking out. If I ate something oily or greasy, and especially if I ate chocolate, nuts or jalapenos, I immediately broke out. When that &amp;#34;time of the month&amp;#34; hit, I broke out. If I was stressed, I broke out. Basically, I was always breaking out, I never knew what was causing it anymore. I had tried some over-the-counter products, none of which helped. Then I went to see a dermatologist who was trying to sell me this product at four times the cost of what I bought it here on Amazon. I told her I&#x27;d go home and think about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went on Amazon to see if they sold the product, and I was surprised that they did. I thought it was a medically-prescribed product, but was happy to find out that I would be able to purchase it online, and at a fraction of the price! Less than a month after using the product, all my acne was gone!! I couldn&#x27;t believe it!! ALL of it! I occasionally get a pimple here and there, which I notice is usually related to a new product I might use on my face (I stick to oil-free products now) or if I eat something very spicy, but NOTHING compared to what I was getting the 20 years prior. Just a little pimple here and there, which most of the times you can barely see it. And no more cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An esthetician I visit from time to time to get chemical peels and microdermabrasions from told me that although Obagi is a good product, that it may be too harsh for certain skin types. I do have to agree with that. Luckily my skin took it fine, but it did burn like hell initially when I was using it. I could see how it could be too harsh for someone who may have more sensitive skin than mine. So that is one thing to think about and consider. If you have issues with sensitive skin or your skin is easily irritated, maybe you should consult with a dermatologist before using this product.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately years of acne has left pock-marked scars on my face. I&#x27;m currently looking into products for that as well...on Amazon. And it looks like there is hope :) I LOVE AMAZON!!!</li>
            <li> I started getting adult acne when I turned 30 and suffered for almost 6 years before finding the  Clenziderm Normal to Dry system. My skin would break out with cystic acne that took forever to go away and by the time one cleared another one would have begun. My esthetician said it was hormonal and to change my diet, which I did, but still could not get my skin to clear up. My sister talked to a Dermatologist friend of hers who recommended this line and it has done wonders for my skin. I don&#x27;t think there will ever be a time when I don&#x27;t use these products.  I use the normal to dry line so as to not excessively dry out my skin and my skin has not looked this good since my early 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to anyone who has to deal with the horrible embarrassment of adlt cystic acne. It has done wonders for me!!</li>
            <li> My daughter likes this kit as it seems to work!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products for Cystic Acne, and this is by far the best thing I&#x27;ve come across. I am in my mid 20&#x27;s and have struggled with acne for years. I have dry, sensitive skin. This is the first product i&#x27;ve used that seems to help clear up my skin, without making it worse before getting better. The face wash is gental on the skin, the step 2 Therapeutic Lotion (isn&#x27;t always so \\&quot;therapeutic\\&quot;)sometimes feels a little hot or burning on your face, but seems to do the trick. The step 3 Therapeutic Moisturizer is amazing! So silky and smooth. I highly recommend this product that actually WORKS! I will never waste my time buying cheap face washes at the drug store ever again.</li>
            <li> We really liike this product and even though it says it&#x27;s for normal to dry skin, it clears up acne fast on my daughter&#x27;s face.  Good to have two on hand, we ran out and had to reorder and she had a breakout inbetween.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product out there for acne and they work for just a while and then my skin turns.  I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and my skin has never looked better!  Love this product.</li>
            <li> I had to revise my review.  After using this product a few more times, I would break out with swollen bumps that itched and my face turned bright red. I finally had to just throw it all away.  I don&#x27;t have any issues with my Obagi products that I have purchased at a doctors office.  I also use a prescription salicylic acid (6%) that is a higher strength than this fake stuff--so I dont have an allergy.  Dont buy it...go to the Obagi link and see what they say about their products being sold on Amazon.  As a Prime member, this is really disappointing. [...]    I have used Obagi Nu-Derm products for years and they are the best!  However, Nu-Derm doesn&#x27;t do acne...so Clenziderm it is!  Great price for Obagi products.  A few reviews mentioned drying skin...that is typical for acne treatment products.  My suggestion is to use an additional heavy duty moisturizer and not use the product everyday as acne clears.</li>
            <li> I liked it! The skin is really much smoother! Liked a smooth cleanser a lot, cleans well and feels well after. Therapeutic lotion is super burning though!! Doesn&#x27;t dry out but feels crazy. I thought maybe it&#x27;s just for my skin, but roommate tried and told the same.</li>
            <li> Good product. I received item on time.</li>
