            <li>Pop the \\&quot;pods\\&quot; in the microwave (or boil them), pop it on your head, and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li>Great for oil treatments.</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Great easy to use warming cap</li>
            <li>does not stay warm for more than 6 mins!</li>
            <li>Keeps hair warm as it says for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>It stays warm for up to 30 min.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ll warm it up for an additional 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>as it sits on your head it will warm up and do its purpose....</li>
            <li>This was kind of a joke to me.  </li>
            <li>and I really liked how it made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>This therapy wrap gets really warm but insulated all the heat so that none of the excess heat escapes.</li>
            <li>Really love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the morning my hair is noticeably shinier, softer, and more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the morning my hair is noticeably shinier, softer, and more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s WAY better.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair and after using this my hair feels softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>but once it is heated it works like magic.</li>
            <li>It takes more that 80 secs to get the desired heat</li>
            <li>i love this wrap....</li>
            <li>i love my purchase and would recommend it to others</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Please make sure you do your research when purchasing oils.</li>
            <li>I put a shower cap on then put the turban wrap on top.</li>
            <li>It is becoming more bouncy and shiny - which I love.</li>
            <li>Well I don&#x27;t have the kind of money to do that, and I&#x27;ve heard many things about hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li>It seems a fair price for a product that appears reasonably durable if taken care of.</li>
            <li>It seems a fair price for a product that appears reasonably durable if taken care of.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to microwave and heat up, fits well, and stays on through the duration of the conditioning.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to wash.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>, you really just want to warm it up.</li>
            <li>The gel packs stayed warm for over an hour and really helped to penetrate my hair.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>, it is quick and easy to use, it creates no noise and it&#x27;s comfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So quick and easy to do my hair steam treatments.</li>
            <li>: First, make sure to read the instructions thoroughly and follow them.</li>
            <li>Put a plastic cap over your hair before you put on the turban to keep it (mostly) clean and prolong the life of the product.</li>
            <li>My hot oil treatment was a success :)</li>
            <li>However, good for my personal hair salon!</li>
            <li>Secondly, pick a good oil for your hair.</li>
            <li>I have seen an orange/darker color available at a higher price.  </li>
            <li>I have seen an orange/darker color available at a higher price.  </li>
            <li>Follow the instructions so there&#x27;s no safety hazards with the gels as they can become very hot.</li>
            <li>I recommend castor oil (black castor oil here on Amazon is great), jojoba, apricot kernel and avocado.</li>
            <li>and I thought that a warm towel would have the same impact.</li>
            <li>I heated the wrap with the heating packs inside for a total of 45 seconds and it stayed really warm for about 20-25 mins.</li>
            <li>The whole pack stay warm for 20-30 minutes and only takes 45 seconds to heat up.</li>
            <li>This product is nice to the touch and is large enough for my head, which I consider rather large.</li>
            <li>the microwave scorching hot and then place it on your head</li>
            <li>Silicone packs heat quickly in hot water or microwave.</li>
            <li>I hoped that the packets could be heated by placing them in hot water but the product specifies the microwave.</li>
            <li>I like it and would have loved to have given it a 5 stars but upon using it the first time and following directions one of the gel packs bust open.  </li>
            <li>My hair thanks me for it on the daily basis, by looking fabulous!</li>
            <li>it bun-like at the top of your head if your hair is long.  </li>
            <li>Directions were simple and easy to understand.</li>
            <li>I have quite a bit of it, but it&#x27;s fine and a bit fragile.</li>
            <li>Recommend washing by hand or on gentle setting in a garment bag.  </li>
            <li>Recommend washing by hand or on gentle setting in a garment bag.  </li>
            <li>even i dont really feel the heat on my head anymore because i got used to the warmth.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>You have to spend too much time trying to not \\&quot;over-cook\\&quot; it in the microwave.  </li>
            <li>Nobody wants to spend a lot of time doing that.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels much softer afterwards.</li>
            <li>This is a great deep conditioning tool to have for those who don&#x27;t want to purchase more expensive steamers or hood dryers.</li>
            <li>How the plant is grown, harvested and produced really affect</li>
            <li>After I&#x27;ve covered my whole head with oil</li>
            <li>now my hair is really seeing some difference.</li>
            <li>and I like the flexibility to still be able to do other things while I&#x27;m conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s relevant because all of my hair was not able to fit in the shower cap that came with the product, but was well covered by this wrap.</li>
            <li>generally mix a couple oils including an essential oil such as rose in a little glass bowl and warm it up under water.</li>
            <li>The gel packs that heat up tend to slide down from the top of the cap.</li>
            <li>It is what I wanted, because it gives me more freedom to move around than the sit down heat  caps.  </li>
            <li>for those natural ladies with lots of hair (or big heads), this is a really good option, i&#x27;d like a hair steamer but unless you get a really pricey one, its not worth it</li>
            <li>, the gels will be hot so let them cool a few minutes then manage with rubber gloves, stays warm for about half hour</li>
            <li>This terry cloth turban is white, and has sections to hold 3 heat packs (top to back and each side) by one zipper.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this if your hair needs ANY TLC.llow the enclosed directions.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this if your hair needs ANY TLC.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who is thinking about buying it but is unsure.</li>
            <li>and it works well really well for a busy mom.</li>
            <li>The warm towel cools down really quickly and warms unevenly.</li>
            <li>Clear Caps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice!</li>
            <li>Selected this for consistent heat and the ability to move around while deep conditioning hair.  </li>
            <li>After the treatment I  style my hair as usual -- a no-heat wrapping method (it&#x27;s just too fried to take more damage).  </li>

            <li>It did only for the first 5-6 times</li>
            <li>Makes my hair beyond soft!</li>
            <li>I like the hair wrap because  I am extremely busy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural hair</li>
            <li>Just be careful when using because the gel packs can get pretty hot and if not heated properly they can burst.</li>
            <li>It wraps securely but is heavy</li>
            <li>used it last week when doing my hot oil treatment and deep condition.</li>
            <li>Works well so far, only one use.</li>
            <li>once it cools down i heat it back up and replace it for a second cycle...very convenient to be able to still move around, no cord, its soft, you could lay down with it if you like.....</li>
            <li>I thought that since I have a larger head and really thick hair that it wouldn&#x27;t fit all the way around my hair.</li>
            <li>One star taken away because I&#x27;m still not sure the side gel packs are inserted right.  </li>
            <li>One star taken away because I&#x27;m still not sure the side gel packs are inserted right.  </li>
            <li>It is professionally dyed, dry with split ends, and extra damaged after trying the blonde ombre.</li>

            <li> Great easy to use warming cap</li>
            <li> I bought this product before, however, I like the price of this one.</li>
            <li> Update 3/31/2014.  Went one week without using this for heat condition.  My hair was back to frizzy, unruly, and breaking off tangled at the ends when brushing or running fingers through hair.  I thought it was because i&#x27;m over the \\&quot;halfway point\\&quot; until my next 6-8 week salon visit.  Wrong!  Did the heat treatment and voila!  My hair is shiny and manageable with virtually no breakage.  (There is no cure for split ends except cutting them off, but moisture really helps those ends!) By the way, if you have gray hair, this smooths out those weird kinks.  I don&#x27;t want to ever be without this turban!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/02/2015.  Traveled without this and my hair was a nightmare.  Still swear by it!  Really love it!&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Original Post:  Selected this for consistent heat and the ability to move around while deep conditioning hair.  I have long (to bra strap), dark brown, less than 5% gray, semi-coarse hair. It is professionally dyed, dry with split ends, and extra damaged after trying the blonde ombre. :-(  This terry cloth turban is white, and has sections to hold 3 heat packs (top to back and each side) by one zipper.  It was not intuitive to me, how to put the side packs in, but I made it work.  The turban secures to the head by two straps that you criss-cross from back to front and velcro in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use [[ASIN:B004FK5XTY GVP Conditioning Balm: Compare to Matrix Biolage Conditioning Balm]].  While in the shower, squeeze excess water out of hair with a washcloth and comb conditioner through hair.  Circle it bun-like at the top of your head if your hair is long.  Put a plastic cap over your hair before you put on the turban to keep it (mostly) clean and prolong the life of the product. (I had week-old hair dye transferred to the turban where I didn&#x27;t cover all the hair around my ears.)Place the heat packs in the turban and microwave, taking care not to overheat the packs and accidentally burn your ears, like I did! Follow the enclosed directions.  I found a 45/15/15 second session works in my microwave.  After 30 mins I reheat the turban 45/15 secs again and put it back on for another 30 mins.  After the treatment I  style my hair as usual -- a no-heat wrapping method (it&#x27;s just too fried to take more damage).  In the morning my hair is noticeably shinier, softer, and more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an excellent weekly treatment, and would work great with hair oils and protein treatments.  It seems a fair price for a product that appears reasonably durable if taken care of. One star taken away because I&#x27;m still not sure the side gel packs are inserted right.  Also a teeny concerned how long the zipper and velcro will hold up.  Recommend washing by hand or on gentle setting in a garment bag.  I have seen an orange/darker color available at a higher price.  BOTTOM LINE:  Highly recommend this if your hair needs ANY TLC.llow the enclosed directions.  I found a 45/15/15 second session works in my microwave.

            <li> I like it and would have loved to have given it a 5 stars but upon using it the first time and following directions one of the gel packs bust open.  Going to contact the seller and see about getting a replacement.</li>
            <li> It should come with directions. Runs a little big, at least for me. I didn&#x27;t have to heat it as long as it said. The gel packs that heat up tend to slide down from the top of the cap. Just have to get used to it. Recommend it? Yes. Also it arrived in just a few days. Great seller!</li>
            <li> This is a good head wrap.  I&#x27;m not sure if the packs it comes with are reusable or not.  Works well so far, only one use.</li>
            <li> it fits my head perfectly. it last at least 30 min even i dont really feel the heat on my head anymore because i got used to the warmth. However, good for my personal hair salon!</li>
            <li> It is what I wanted, because it gives me more freedom to move around than the sit down heat  caps.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Product Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 Turban&lt;br /&gt;3 Gel Packs&lt;br /&gt;1 Box&lt;br /&gt;1 sheet of Instructions&lt;br /&gt;3 Clear Caps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice! Keeps hair warm as it says for 20 minutes. Follow the instructions so there&#x27;s no safety hazards with the gels as they can become very hot. The gels can be slid into pockets on the sides and backs and secured with a zipper in the front of the turban. Have been using the turban during those Moisturizer/Condition/Perm days. Will post results in following months.</li>
            <li> does not stay warm for more than 6 mins! will not buy this again</li>
            <li> Should have bought one that plugs in.  I read great reviews online and wanted to love the item because it does the job while allowing you freedom to move around.  You have to spend too much time trying to not \\&quot;over-cook\\&quot; it in the microwave.  I followed directions, and took my time with it, but it still wouldn&#x27;t evenly distribute heat.  Well, I take that back.  It did only for the first 5-6 times I used it.  Then the gel insert just couldn&#x27;t hold up.  I had to take it off every 10-15 mins to reheat it.  Nobody wants to spend a lot of time doing that.  So I found one on amazon to replace it, one that plugs into the wall.  It&#x27;s WAY better.  I&#x27;d recommend getting one that plugs into the wall to avoid wasting money and time.</li>
            <li> I love it! I can leave it on and carry on with my daily routine without having to sit still. My hair feels much softer afterwards. I have curly hair and after using this my hair feels softer and more manageable. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is thinking about buying it but is unsure. Trust me you won&#x27;t be disappointed. The only down side is It takes longer than 45 secs to heat up but once it is heated it works like magic. Just follow the instruction and you can&#x27;t go wrong. It is just like going to my hairdressers.</li>
            <li> I like the hair wrap because  I am extremely busy and I like the flexibility to still be able to do other things while I&#x27;m conditioning my hair. It takes more that 80 secs to get the desired heat but overall, it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Been using it for the past year and it does what is is suppose to do. It stays warm for up to 30 min. Now I need to replace the gel tabs and can&#x27;t seem to find them anywhere :(</li>
            <li> i love this wrap....i actually placed my gel packs in the turban and then i usually stick it in the microwave for about 45 seconds, if i take it out and it still needs so warmth i&#x27;ll warm it up for an additional 10 seconds. remember that you dont want to take it out the microwave scorching hot and then place it on your head, you really just want to warm it up. as it sits on your head it will warm up and do its purpose....i co-wash my hair, add coconut oil, olive oil, and BJ castor oil, and shea moisture deep conditioner, put the plastic cap on and then place the turban. once it cools down i heat it back up and replace it for a second cycle...very convenient to be able to still move around, no cord, its soft, you could lay down with it if you like.....i love my purchase and would recommend it to others</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural hair African American and I&#x27;ve had it for over a year. It helps with deep conditioning and I love it</li>
            <li> This is a great deep conditioning tool to have for those who don&#x27;t want to purchase more expensive steamers or hood dryers. The gel packs stayed warm for over an hour and really helped to penetrate my hair. Just be careful when using because the gel packs can get pretty hot and if not heated properly they can burst.</li>
            <li> Definitely holds in heat. Silicone packs heat quickly in hot water or microwave. It wraps securely but is heavy so if you dont like weight on your head its not for you. Great for oil treatments.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I use it twice on wash day once a week.  My hair thanks me for it on the daily basis, by looking fabulous!</li>
            <li> for those natural ladies with lots of hair (or big heads), this is a really good option, i&#x27;d like a hair steamer but unless you get a really pricey one, its not worth it so this is a great alternative, i only steep my inserts in boiling water, that microwave stuff is not the same, the gels will be hot so let them cool a few minutes then manage with rubber gloves, stays warm for about half hour</li>
            <li> This was an excellent purchase!! It worked just as advertised. Pop the \\&quot;pods\\&quot; in the microwave (or boil them), pop it on your head, and you&#x27;re good to go! I have an average size head (I think so at least) but lots and lots of natural hair (I&#x27;m black in case there is confusion with the \\&quot;natural hair\\&quot; reference).  It&#x27;s relevant because all of my hair was not able to fit in the shower cap that came with the product, but was well covered by this wrap. It lasted about 20-30 minutes as advertised and was just what I needed!!</li>
            <li> This product is nice to the touch and is large enough for my head, which I consider rather large. With that said the microwaveable packs do not fit the pouches all that well. It takes a little fiddling with to get them in there properly. I also don&#x27;t like the idea of putting something that has just came out of the microwave on my head. I hoped that the packets could be heated by placing them in hot water but the product specifies the microwave. If you do not mind placing microwaved items on your head then this is a great buy!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair beyond soft! I used it twice in one day! Lol. I love it and its at an excellent price too!</li>
            <li> This was kind of a joke to me.  No real benefit, except to move around. Didn&#x27;t seem like the heat generated evenly. It did generate heat for about 10 to 15 minutes.  It would be easier to just sit still and use a hair dryer.  I will give it another try down the road.</li>
            <li> I got this to use for deep conditioning my hair.  It works great!  It&#x27;s easy to microwave and heat up, fits well, and stays on through the duration of the conditioning.  It&#x27;s also easy to wash.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I haven&#x27;t had problems using it and it works well really well for a busy mom. No complains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Therapy Cordless Thermal Turban Heat Wrap - White</li>
            <li> I have fine hair. I have quite a bit of it, but it&#x27;s fine and a bit fragile. I&#x27;ve also had thyroid problems that have left my hair pretty sad. I had a salon deep conditioning once several years ago and I really liked how it made my hair feel. Well I don&#x27;t have the kind of money to do that, and I&#x27;ve heard many things about hot oil treatments. I looked at several options here on Amazon, including bonnet dryers.&lt;br /&gt;I picked this one because I can do things while I use it, it is quick and easy to use, it creates no noise and it&#x27;s comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;A couple tips: First, make sure to read the instructions thoroughly and follow them. Secondly, pick a good oil for your hair. I recommend castor oil (black castor oil here on Amazon is great), jojoba, apricot kernel and avocado. Please make sure you do your research when purchasing oils. How the plant is grown, harvested and produced really affect it.&lt;br /&gt;I generally mix a couple oils including an essential oil such as rose in a little glass bowl and warm it up under water. Then I pour some in my hands and begin working it through my hair, massaging my scalp as I go. After I&#x27;ve covered my whole head with oil I put a shower cap on then put the turban wrap on top. Then I go about my business, usually keeping it on for 30 minutes to an hour. My hair is always softer after use and after doing a deep conditioning at least once a week for a few weeks now my hair is really seeing some difference. It is becoming more bouncy and shiny - which I love.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I purchased this product. I have seen a couple of hair bloggers using it and I thought that a warm towel would have the same impact. Well, I was wrong. The warm towel cools down really quickly and warms unevenly. This therapy wrap gets really warm but insulated all the heat so that none of the excess heat escapes. The whole pack stay warm for 20-30 minutes and only takes 45 seconds to heat up. I thought that since I have a larger head and really thick hair that it wouldn&#x27;t fit all the way around my hair. It did. It secures in place and thoroughly covers my entire scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it last week when doing my hot oil treatment and deep condition. I noticed that my twist out was softer and bouncier because of it. So, as I type this, I am deep conditioning with the therapy wrap on again. It definitely will be a part of my regimen from now on.</li>
            <li> This wrap is my number one method for deep conditioning my hair (and I have other hair steamers, dryers, etc at my disposal). While I would like it slightly larger (I have a lot of hair), it is still my staple. I do think I overheating it in the microwave, but it&#x27;s still working.</li>
            <li> You have to microwave the hat with the heat packs in it.  They take longer to heat up than the instructions say they do and they get cold really fast.</li>
            <li> This is awesome! So quick and easy to do my hair steam treatments. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Directions were simple and easy to understand. I heated the wrap with the heating packs inside for a total of 45 seconds and it stayed really warm for about 20-25 mins. I help aid in the heating process I used 1 of the shower caps that was provided and I also put 2 foil shower caps I&#x27;d purchased from the Dollar Tree on before putting the heating head wrap on. My hot oil treatment was a success :)</li>
