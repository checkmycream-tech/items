            <li>An excellent product!</li>
            <li>can use a goodly amount of oil!  </li>
            <li>can use a goodly amount of oil!  </li>
            <li>It smells good and works great!  </li>
            <li>A great find here.</li>
            <li>This is a great product to add to braids.</li>
            <li>and still it didn&#x27;t work that great.  </li>
            <li>What I found is that this was a great idea to help me have hair that looked great.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li>The oil has a pleasant fragrance, too.</li>
            <li>it took awhile for me to write this review because i wanted to give it a fair amount of time to work but it doesnt work    </li>
            <li>and everybody was talking about how good it was</li>
            <li>i figured this would be good to...</li>
            <li>Smells so good and provides a weightless moisture and shine.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a miracle in a bottle, but it keeps the split ends together until a haircut, keeps the ends from splitting afterward, leaves a gorgeous shine without looking oily, and smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is actually a surprisingly good hair and scalp oil.</li>
            <li>Since my hair is waist length, my thirsty waves are the perfect hair for just about any product originally marketed to Women of Color.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is very pleasant - citrus, without being too cloyingly sweet.</li>
            <li>I really liked this product because its very light weight doesn&#x27;t give you that greasy look or feel!</li>
            <li>its a good healthy hair product.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;d have a bottle i could spray an oily product of my own out it one day if i did not like this.</li>
            <li>Makes it nice and shiny.</li>
            <li>Interestingly, this product is also good at helping to remove heavier petroleum based pomades from the hair.</li>
            <li>In these situations, this hair oil has proven to be incredibly handy.  </li>
            <li>It smelled really nice, so I sprayed what I thought was a conservative amount.</li>
            <li>I liked the moisture it gave my scalp</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; inexpensive, the shampoo is great in the brand, but this is just OK.</li>
            <li>Good ingredients, some are OK, inexpensive, as mostly corn oil</li>
            <li>This product has a light and pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok- smells nice, but don&#x27;t think i will buy again.</li>
            <li>I think this works best on Natural hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had life-long problems with tousled hair, and this is a suitable product for me.  </li>
            <li>It does leave a nice glossy sheen that made my hair look quite healthy.  </li>
            <li>The scent is not overpowering but rather is pleasant and mild.</li>
            <li>all works together to form a very light citrus scented oil with notes of spices and nuts.  </li>
            <li>Very smooth hair therapy oil that works well on the calp and doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li>I love this oil.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this oil for about four months,, and my hair is growing rapidly, texture is better and, and is always shiny..</li>
            <li>The bottle is a pain to hold as it gets wider at the top.</li>
            <li>I would caution you to be sure to put on a heat protecting product before the oil if you plan to straighten your hair.  </li>
            <li>I keep the oil (it really is mostly vegetable oil)</li>
            <li>For people with more coarse hair, using the oil on the scalp might be perfect.</li>
            <li>I like this one way better.</li>
            <li>I have trird most of the products in the Motions line</li>
            <li>and I have been quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I picked this up for a dear friend who is very fond of the Motions line , and she was happy to receive the gift.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>Pantene products work OK for every day, but still no spray in shine product that&#x27;s not just stuff on your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this product for one year, and my Sisterlocks love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While this product would never work on my hair, it is absolutely fabulous on theirs!</li>
            <li>Nothing hurts or itches, but if I go through the roots in the mirror, I&#x27;m able to see it.</li>
            <li>so cannot truthfully recommend this to anyone else.  </li>
            <li>My intention is to seal in moisture while giving my hair some more shine.</li>
            <li>I think that it does an okay job of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most of the oils that I have used have a pump which helps control where you place the oil.</li>
            <li>The oils seem to penetrate the hair shaft and not just sit on top of the hair strands creating a greasy head of hair.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Someone else that has dry scalp and maybe thicker hair could find this is the best oil for them.</li>
            <li>THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT TO ME IT SHOULD HAVE MORE OF THIS GREAT MARULA OIL SINCE THOS OIL SEEMS TO BE WHAT SHOULD BE AT THE TOP</li>
            <li>I have been looking for something that would help make my hair look more smooth and reflect the light to show more shine.  </li>
            <li>The oil soaks in readily to my olive skin type, and feels/smells really good.</li>
            <li>Many products with natural oils or extracts give me hives, scalp irritation, or dandruff (to be fair, most products without these ingredients cause issues, too.)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice burst of pleasant, natural-smelling fragrance to help wash away the week&#x27;s environmental and physical effects.</li>
            <li>The smells nice and the spray feature is very fast and convenient.</li>
            <li>and I feel this is a mistake if you have thinner or baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The mist isn&#x27;t fine enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the problem lies in my fine, bleached hair.</li>
            <li>My scalp is fine</li>
            <li>But my fine hair just doesn&#x27;t like this oil.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I find this to be a great new Hair Oil product, cheaper than mot Argan Oils which used to be the \\&quot;Gold Standard\\&quot; of hair oil treatments, and the scent is far more pleasant than the new Suave Argan Oil spray called [[ASIN:B00A0IWSIO Suave Suave Professionals</li>

            <li>This product helped keep my scalp from being itchy, made my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>Leaves hairs shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really liked the idea of this product, but no matter how much I tried, I couldn&#x27;t get it on the scalp (where I wanted it)without getting it all over my hair as well.  </li>
            <li>One light misting and my hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m black and I&#x27;m so glad Amazon has this hair oil spray available, and for the lowest price I&#x27;ve seen, so it&#x27;s a great Add</li>
            <li>For the first time, their hair looked shiny and felt silky smooth!</li>
            <li>first thing I notice was there was a spray at the top of this bottle.</li>
            <li>Motions products are generally quite good.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite Motions product so far, and plan to buy more when this bottle is used up.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great if you have dry hair &amp; you need something quick &amp; inexpensive to make your hair shine.</li>
            <li>most of motions products really suck for me</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s only a couple that are really good</li>
            <li>AND IT MAKES HAIR MUCH MORE MANAGEABLE,EASIER AND DETANGLE AND VERY GLOSSY.</li>
            <li>It does feel good on your scalp, especially during winter months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product, but if you&#x27;re looking for this to act as a fill-in for the coveted, yet pricey, Moroccan oil, I think you just might need to continue your search...</li>
            <li>I was hoping it was be a nice and easy final step to make her hair manageable.</li>
            <li>great and unexpected perk of using this oil is that my flat iron works better.  </li>
            <li>For me this product worked best on freshly shampooed and conditioned natural hair rather than on dry.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice light smell and actually penetrates the scalp.</li>
            <li>It also dries fairly quickly, so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy all day.  </li>
            <li>This product offers good quality and really works as intended.  </li>
            <li>The very first ingredient on the product is oil.</li>
            <li>The very first one is corn oil, which I didn&#x27;t even know was used to moisturize hair.</li>
            <li>Seeing as her hair type seemed ideal for this product, I&#x27;m not sure who it would work for.</li>
            <li>As many lines for African-American Women are trying to reach new audiences, their advertising will often say \\&quot;For</li>
            <li>dryness- researched marula is good for dry hair &amp; thought i&#x27;d try this.</li>
            <li>However, my husband, who is of English and Scandanavian descent, has fine curly hair and he can use these products too, just much more sparingly.  </li>
            <li>That alone is worth the purchase price.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that I will not be buying these products anytime in the future.</li>
            <li>away from my roots, it brings a nice shine and final polish to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I did not feel the oil absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li>If you have a normally greasy scalp, apply the oild mostly to your damaged ends and then as a light finishing touch as you pat it over the area where you normally part your hair.  </li>
            <li>I would never srpay this directly unto my hair and most of my hair</li>
            <li>If you have a normally greasy scalp, apply the oild mostly to your damaged ends and then as a light finishing touch as you pat it over the area where you normally part your hair.  </li>
            <li>I would never srpay this directly unto my hair and most of my hair</li>
            <li>It looked greasy but was rapidly absorbed.</li>
            <li>I would say it is worth a try.</li>
            <li>This time it gave just the right amount of shine and defrizzing.  </li>
            <li>Their derections have you spraying this right UNTO your hair</li>
            <li>After being initially pleased that this Motions product arrived intact (not spilled, like other products I&#x27;d ordered, and also secure in a closed plastic bag), I was thrilled the the scent of the oil.</li>
            <li>absolutely would not recommend this product for anyone with fine or thin hair, but it worked great for me.  </li>
            <li>it is when you first put it on</li>
            <li>Otherwise it&#x27;s like frying your hair in hot grease--highly damaging.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product, but I am only giving it 2 stars because it contains parabens.  </li>
            <li>The oil is equally light when applied with your hands and not sprayed directly unto the hair as their directions suggest.  </li>
            <li>fact, I am willing to overlook their use of a sweetener in their hair product and plan on buying another bottle once I run out of this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead of misting the oil directly onto my hair, for application to the hair shaft, I pump a spritz or three of oil into the palm of my hand, spread it between both hands, and lightly run my oiled palms over first the ends, then shaft, of my hair.</li>
            <li>It helps with dry scalp and its very easy to dispense.</li>
            <li>oil is, overall, one that I&#x27;d consider buying again in the future, in light of its low cost and high volume of product, but in light of the fact that the first ingredient on the label is corn oil, I&#x27;m not so sure that Motions is being completely accurate in billing this first as Marula oil.</li>
            <li>tried this on my dry hair and found that my fine hair felt full of goo and looked like I had not washed it in a couple days.</li>
            <li>If i put the oil on my scalp, it pretty much looks like I need to wash my hair.</li>
            <li>Considering that, I normally apply it at night, before I head to bed, so the bulk of the oil will get absorbed in before I head out</li>
            <li>This product is light I spray about ten sprays in my hand and work it in from roots to tips with my fingers, it leaves a nice shine without all the buildup (I wash my hair every other week).</li>
            <li>I decided to use it on my dry skin and love the product on my legs and arms this winter.  </li>
            <li>It feels like it really goes to work on the hair shafts softening up dry hair and making it more manageable and healthier looking.</li>
            <li>I only wished that Motions&#x27; other products worked as successfully as these two did.</li>
            <li>Their spraying mechanism doesn&#x27;t disperse the oil in fine enough a mist, if you ask me.  </li>
            <li>Their spraying mechanism doesn&#x27;t disperse the oil in fine enough a mist, if you ask me.  </li>
            <li>You have to watch how much you use though...</li>
            <li>If you use too much it will be greasy .</li>
            <li>So the second time I used it, I sprayed it a couple times into the palm of my hand and ran my hands lightly through my hair from about 1/3 from the scalp to the ends, with a concentration on the ends.  </li>
            <li>After using ths product, my hair is easier to straighten, gets straighter, and stays straight longer.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the chamomile scent cuts the lavendar a bit, but the result is very luscious and pleasing without being overdone, flowery, or too sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do much at all for the long-haul or your hair health though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really like this product</li>
            <li>and when I used too much, it went from shiny to greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very oily, but it does seem to help make my hair more...pliable?</li>
            <li>I slicked her hair with straight petrolium jelly.</li>
            <li>The result was very greasy looking hair.  </li>
            <li>This is very oily and great for my supremely dry dark hair.</li>
            <li>&quot; but see photos showing women of color in the ads, that if you have baby fine hair that is straight as can be, you will need to experiment by using much less at first until you find the correct amount to gain some moisture or shine benefit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never understood the need for all the extras , but my friend says that the full Motions line is essential.</li>
            <li>It was a little challenging to determine how much to use.</li>
            <li>I have a dry scalp, so I needed something that was going to make my hair shiny and smooth and also help to protect it from the damage that it gets when I straighten it.  </li>
            <li>When used on my dry natural hair it left a bit of an oily residue, whereas it absorbed better into my damp hair.  </li>
            <li>I use this Motions oil on about a weekly basis, to give my dry scalp a light boost of moisture.</li>
            <li>Also, it was difficult to recreate the perfect balance it initially brought to my hair.</li>
            <li>I used the same hair brush I used to brush this into my daughter&#x27;s hair and had to wash my hair again quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I used this product, I sprayed three light sprays (each side and the back), and my hair became an instant grease ball.  </li>
            <li>its a dry oil that means oil isnt running all down you neck and face  its really good for sealing the ends of you</li>
            <li>A dab of this (I use about a quarter-size is good to bring the ends of my hair back to life, and about two quarters is good for the rest of my hair (I have long hair - it goes down to the small of my lowerback).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have what has been called \\&quot;Ethnic hair\\&quot; which frizzes easily and if left to its own, will loc up into long spirals that are hard to disentangle.  </li>
            <li>I tried it on my wet hair, thinking to lock in the moisture, and found that my hair felt full of glue while I tried to work it in.</li>
            <li>There are other soothing ingredients such as Rose oil (listed as Geraniol), lemon oil, honey and several more.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have very long, fine, formerly bleached hair.</li>
            <li>Basically, this means that the ends, from my ears down, get really dry and snarl very easily.</li>
            <li>i have fine caucasian hair but been bleaching/coloring it a few years causing</li>
            <li>Then, I further suggest spraying one spray into the palm of your hand, rubbing your hands together and then gently aplying it to the thirstiest or most damaged parts of your hair wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>Save $6 to $8 bucks and go with either Motions or Clear Scalp&#x27;s Oil products.  </li>
            <li>Clear Scalp doesn&#x27;t even use a spray, you just put some drops in your hands and apply the way I do with this product.  </li>

            <li>lightly spritzed their hair with this product, after washed and air dried.</li>
            <li>The Marula Natural Therapy Hair works wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to nearly everything.</li>
            <li>If your hair is naturally oily, or if you&#x27;ve had problems with any of the ingredients in the product, I would steer clear.</li>

            <li>Motions Salon Haircare Marula Natural Therapy Hair and Scalp Oil.</li>
            <li>The oil coats the hair and makes it soft.  </li>
            <li>did work really well for my son&#x27;s very short hair.</li>
            <li>i love this for curly thick hair.  </li>
            <li>This in particular causes a (thankfully) sparse, gritty type of buildup.</li>
            <li>ingredient list is a bit more manageable and not as evil-sounding as some of the other hair products on the market, including other products from the Motions line.</li>

            <li>This makes your scalp not dry and clear up dandruff and itchy scalp issues.</li>
            <li>I translated the ones I could identify easily into their common names for ease of reading.  </li>
            <li>It has one of the \\&quot;calmer\\&quot; lavendar scents, not sharp, as some lavendars are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why it was necessary, but I am enjoying the results of the overall product</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, Marula Oil in the new Motions Natural Therapy Hair &amp; Scalp Oil Spray has a long history of use by Native Tsonga peoples of South Africa and Mozambique, both as a body and hair moisturizer and in cooking.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t experiment with this right before some important event or you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li>The oil itself is very light, with a thin feel to it when rubbed between the fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a solid, decent product, and I will continue to buy it in the future.</li>

            <li>TO HAVE ONLY NATURAL AND/OR ORGANIC INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li>Motions Marula Natural Therapy Hair and Scalp Oil is the ultimate luxury that your hairs deserve.</li>
            <li>These Motions products are, I think, developed for people with a very different hair type than mine.</li>
            <li>I wish I had not spent the money.</li>
            <li>In addition to having naturally straighening-resistant hair, my natural hair color is now about 70% gray, which is even more difficult to defrizz/straighten.  </li>
            <li>While my hair is dark blonde, very fine and silky, and dad&#x27;s is  medium thickness, dark brown with some curl, theirs is completely different!</li>
            <li>These were the only two products that did not tangle my hair and left it feeling soft and somewhat moisturized.</li>
            <li>healthier long-term is a product made with red palm oil that you have to leave in for a day or two &amp; your hair looks wet when it&#x27;s on, but it does really repair your hair.</li>
            <li>I used this product on my natural African American hair.  </li>
            <li>so I would suggest spray it into the trash first until you get even sprays ( just a few sprays).  </li>
            <li>I used Motions Haircare Marula Natural Therapy Hair and Scalp on my scalp to help with dry scalp.</li>
            <li>and I spray some of the Marula oil into my palm and use my fingers to daub it directly into those dry spots.  </li>
            <li>This product restores natural oils to my kinky curly dry hair.</li>
            <li>A few quick spritzes - focused away from the roots, of course - down the length of my hair, and then I run my fingers through a few times to help distribute the oil a little more evenly.  </li>
            <li>While it is, in fact, TRUE that their products CAN be used by all hair types, not all people with thinner or naturally straighter hair will be familiar with both the purpose of such a product and how much of it to apply which is why you will see some angry or bad reviews here from Users who tried this very nourishing, natural Marula Oil spray and found they had over-applied the product only to wind up with greasy hair.  </li>
            <li>I tried several times and got better with practice, but it always looked at least a little greasy.  </li>
            <li>If you had bad results spraying this ONTO your hair, try my way of spraying it INTO your palms and then gently working it INTO your hair only where it is most needed.  </li>

            <li> An excellent product!</li>
            <li> can use a goodly amount of oil!  </li>
            <li> can use a goodly amount of oil!  </li>
            <li> It smells good and works great!  </li>
            <li> A great find here.</li>
            <li> This is a great product to add to braids.</li>
            <li> and still it didn&#x27;t work that great.  </li>
            <li> What I found is that this was a great idea to help me have hair that looked great.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant.</li>
            <li> The oil has a pleasant fragrance, too.</li>
            <li> it took awhile for me to write this review because i wanted to give it a fair amount of time to work but it doesnt work    </li>
            <li> and everybody was talking about how good it was</li>
            <li> i figured this would be good to...</li>
            <li> Smells so good and provides a weightless moisture and shine.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a miracle in a bottle, but it keeps the split ends together until a haircut, keeps the ends from splitting afterward, leaves a gorgeous shine without looking oily, and smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Anyway, this is actually a surprisingly good hair and scalp oil.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is waist length, my thirsty waves are the perfect hair for just about any product originally marketed to Women of Color.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is very pleasant - citrus, without being too cloyingly sweet.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product because its very light weight doesn&#x27;t give you that greasy look or feel!</li>
            <li> its a good healthy hair product.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d have a bottle i could spray an oily product of my own out it one day if i did not like this.</li>
            <li> Makes it nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> Interestingly, this product is also good at helping to remove heavier petroleum based pomades from the hair.</li>
            <li> In these situations, this hair oil has proven to be incredibly handy.  </li>
            <li> It smelled really nice, so I sprayed what I thought was a conservative amount.</li>
            <li> I liked the moisture it gave my scalp</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; inexpensive, the shampoo is great in the brand, but this is just OK.</li>
            <li> Good ingredients, some are OK, inexpensive, as mostly corn oil</li>
            <li> This product has a light and pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok- smells nice, but don&#x27;t think i will buy again.</li>
            <li> I think this works best on Natural hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had life-long problems with tousled hair, and this is a suitable product for me.  </li>
            <li> It does leave a nice glossy sheen that made my hair look quite healthy.  </li>
            <li> The scent is not overpowering but rather is pleasant and mild.</li>
            <li> all works together to form a very light citrus scented oil with notes of spices and nuts.  </li>
            <li> Very smooth hair therapy oil that works well on the calp and doesn&#x27;t irritate.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for about four months,, and my hair is growing rapidly, texture is better and, and is always shiny..</li>
            <li> The bottle is a pain to hold as it gets wider at the top.</li>
            <li> I would caution you to be sure to put on a heat protecting product before the oil if you plan to straighten your hair.  </li>
            <li> I keep the oil (it really is mostly vegetable oil)</li>
            <li> For people with more coarse hair, using the oil on the scalp might be perfect.</li>
            <li> I like this one way better.</li>
            <li> I have trird most of the products in the Motions line</li>
            <li> and I have been quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I picked this up for a dear friend who is very fond of the Motions line , and she was happy to receive the gift.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Pantene products work OK for every day, but still no spray in shine product that&#x27;s not just stuff on your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this product for one year, and my Sisterlocks love it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While this product would never work on my hair, it is absolutely fabulous on theirs!</li>
            <li> Nothing hurts or itches, but if I go through the roots in the mirror, I&#x27;m able to see it.</li>
            <li> so cannot truthfully recommend this to anyone else.  </li>
            <li> My intention is to seal in moisture while giving my hair some more shine.</li>
            <li> I think that it does an okay job of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most of the oils that I have used have a pump which helps control where you place the oil.</li>
            <li> The oils seem to penetrate the hair shaft and not just sit on top of the hair strands creating a greasy head of hair.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> Someone else that has dry scalp and maybe thicker hair could find this is the best oil for them.</li>
            <li> THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT TO ME IT SHOULD HAVE MORE OF THIS GREAT MARULA OIL SINCE THOS OIL SEEMS TO BE WHAT SHOULD BE AT THE TOP</li>
            <li> I have been looking for something that would help make my hair look more smooth and reflect the light to show more shine.  </li>
            <li> The oil soaks in readily to my olive skin type, and feels/smells really good.</li>
            <li> Many products with natural oils or extracts give me hives, scalp irritation, or dandruff (to be fair, most products without these ingredients cause issues, too.)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice burst of pleasant, natural-smelling fragrance to help wash away the week&#x27;s environmental and physical effects.</li>
            <li> The smells nice and the spray feature is very fast and convenient.</li>
            <li> and I feel this is a mistake if you have thinner or baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> The mist isn&#x27;t fine enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the problem lies in my fine, bleached hair.</li>
            <li> My scalp is fine</li>
            <li> But my fine hair just doesn&#x27;t like this oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I find this to be a great new Hair Oil product, cheaper than mot Argan Oils which used to be the \\&quot;Gold Standard\\&quot; of hair oil treatments, and the scent is far more pleasant than the new Suave Argan Oil spray called [[ASIN:B00A0IWSIO Suave Suave Professionals</li>

            <li> This product helped keep my scalp from being itchy, made my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li> Leaves hairs shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really liked the idea of this product, but no matter how much I tried, I couldn&#x27;t get it on the scalp (where I wanted it)without getting it all over my hair as well.  </li>
            <li> One light misting and my hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and I&#x27;m so glad Amazon has this hair oil spray available, and for the lowest price I&#x27;ve seen, so it&#x27;s a great Add</li>
            <li> For the first time, their hair looked shiny and felt silky smooth!</li>
            <li> first thing I notice was there was a spray at the top of this bottle.</li>
            <li> Motions products are generally quite good.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite Motions product so far, and plan to buy more when this bottle is used up.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great if you have dry hair &amp; you need something quick &amp; inexpensive to make your hair shine.</li>
            <li> most of motions products really suck for me</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s only a couple that are really good</li>
            <li> AND IT MAKES HAIR MUCH MORE MANAGEABLE,EASIER AND DETANGLE AND VERY GLOSSY.</li>
            <li> It does feel good on your scalp, especially during winter months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad product, but if you&#x27;re looking for this to act as a fill-in for the coveted, yet pricey, Moroccan oil, I think you just might need to continue your search...</li>
            <li> I was hoping it was be a nice and easy final step to make her hair manageable.</li>
            <li> great and unexpected perk of using this oil is that my flat iron works better.  </li>
            <li> For me this product worked best on freshly shampooed and conditioned natural hair rather than on dry.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice light smell and actually penetrates the scalp.</li>
            <li> It also dries fairly quickly, so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy all day.  </li>
            <li> This product offers good quality and really works as intended.  </li>
            <li> The very first ingredient on the product is oil.</li>
            <li> The very first one is corn oil, which I didn&#x27;t even know was used to moisturize hair.</li>
            <li> Seeing as her hair type seemed ideal for this product, I&#x27;m not sure who it would work for.</li>
            <li> As many lines for African-American Women are trying to reach new audiences, their advertising will often say \\&quot;For</li>
            <li> dryness- researched marula is good for dry hair &amp; thought i&#x27;d try this.</li>
            <li> However, my husband, who is of English and Scandanavian descent, has fine curly hair and he can use these products too, just much more sparingly.  </li>
            <li> That alone is worth the purchase price.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that I will not be buying these products anytime in the future.</li>
            <li> away from my roots, it brings a nice shine and final polish to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I did not feel the oil absorbed into my skin.</li>
            <li> If you have a normally greasy scalp, apply the oild mostly to your damaged ends and then as a light finishing touch as you pat it over the area where you normally part your hair.  </li>
            <li> I would never srpay this directly unto my hair and most of my hair</li>
            <li> If you have a normally greasy scalp, apply the oild mostly to your damaged ends and then as a light finishing touch as you pat it over the area where you normally part your hair.  </li>
            <li> I would never srpay this directly unto my hair and most of my hair</li>
            <li> It looked greasy but was rapidly absorbed.</li>
            <li> I would say it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> This time it gave just the right amount of shine and defrizzing.  </li>
            <li> Their derections have you spraying this right UNTO your hair</li>
            <li> After being initially pleased that this Motions product arrived intact (not spilled, like other products I&#x27;d ordered, and also secure in a closed plastic bag), I was thrilled the the scent of the oil.</li>
            <li> absolutely would not recommend this product for anyone with fine or thin hair, but it worked great for me.  </li>
            <li> it is when you first put it on</li>
            <li> Otherwise it&#x27;s like frying your hair in hot grease--highly damaging.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I am only giving it 2 stars because it contains parabens.  </li>
            <li> The oil is equally light when applied with your hands and not sprayed directly unto the hair as their directions suggest.  </li>
            <li> fact, I am willing to overlook their use of a sweetener in their hair product and plan on buying another bottle once I run out of this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Instead of misting the oil directly onto my hair, for application to the hair shaft, I pump a spritz or three of oil into the palm of my hand, spread it between both hands, and lightly run my oiled palms over first the ends, then shaft, of my hair.</li>
            <li> It helps with dry scalp and its very easy to dispense.</li>
            <li> oil is, overall, one that I&#x27;d consider buying again in the future, in light of its low cost and high volume of product, but in light of the fact that the first ingredient on the label is corn oil, I&#x27;m not so sure that Motions is being completely accurate in billing this first as Marula oil.</li>
            <li> tried this on my dry hair and found that my fine hair felt full of goo and looked like I had not washed it in a couple days.</li>
            <li> If i put the oil on my scalp, it pretty much looks like I need to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Considering that, I normally apply it at night, before I head to bed, so the bulk of the oil will get absorbed in before I head out</li>
            <li> This product is light I spray about ten sprays in my hand and work it in from roots to tips with my fingers, it leaves a nice shine without all the buildup (I wash my hair every other week).</li>
            <li> I decided to use it on my dry skin and love the product on my legs and arms this winter.  </li>
            <li> It feels like it really goes to work on the hair shafts softening up dry hair and making it more manageable and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> I only wished that Motions&#x27; other products worked as successfully as these two did.</li>
            <li> Their spraying mechanism doesn&#x27;t disperse the oil in fine enough a mist, if you ask me.  </li>
            <li> Their spraying mechanism doesn&#x27;t disperse the oil in fine enough a mist, if you ask me.  </li>
            <li> You have to watch how much you use though...</li>
            <li> If you use too much it will be greasy .</li>
            <li> So the second time I used it, I sprayed it a couple times into the palm of my hand and ran my hands lightly through my hair from about 1/3 from the scalp to the ends, with a concentration on the ends.  </li>
            <li> After using ths product, my hair is easier to straighten, gets straighter, and stays straight longer.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the chamomile scent cuts the lavendar a bit, but the result is very luscious and pleasing without being overdone, flowery, or too sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do much at all for the long-haul or your hair health though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really like this product</li>
            <li> and when I used too much, it went from shiny to greasy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very oily, but it does seem to help make my hair more...pliable?</li>
            <li> I slicked her hair with straight petrolium jelly.</li>
            <li> The result was very greasy looking hair.  </li>
            <li> This is very oily and great for my supremely dry dark hair.</li>
            <li> &quot; but see photos showing women of color in the ads, that if you have baby fine hair that is straight as can be, you will need to experiment by using much less at first until you find the correct amount to gain some moisture or shine benefit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never understood the need for all the extras , but my friend says that the full Motions line is essential.</li>
            <li> It was a little challenging to determine how much to use.</li>
            <li> I have a dry scalp, so I needed something that was going to make my hair shiny and smooth and also help to protect it from the damage that it gets when I straighten it.  </li>
            <li> When used on my dry natural hair it left a bit of an oily residue, whereas it absorbed better into my damp hair.  </li>
            <li> I use this Motions oil on about a weekly basis, to give my dry scalp a light boost of moisture.</li>
            <li> Also, it was difficult to recreate the perfect balance it initially brought to my hair.</li>
            <li> I used the same hair brush I used to brush this into my daughter&#x27;s hair and had to wash my hair again quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I used this product, I sprayed three light sprays (each side and the back), and my hair became an instant grease ball.  </li>
            <li> its a dry oil that means oil isnt running all down you neck and face  its really good for sealing the ends of you</li>
            <li> A dab of this (I use about a quarter-size is good to bring the ends of my hair back to life, and about two quarters is good for the rest of my hair (I have long hair - it goes down to the small of my lowerback).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have what has been called \\&quot;Ethnic hair\\&quot; which frizzes easily and if left to its own, will loc up into long spirals that are hard to disentangle.  </li>
            <li> I tried it on my wet hair, thinking to lock in the moisture, and found that my hair felt full of glue while I tried to work it in.</li>
            <li> There are other soothing ingredients such as Rose oil (listed as Geraniol), lemon oil, honey and several more.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have very long, fine, formerly bleached hair.</li>
            <li> Basically, this means that the ends, from my ears down, get really dry and snarl very easily.</li>
            <li> i have fine caucasian hair but been bleaching/coloring it a few years causing</li>
            <li> Then, I further suggest spraying one spray into the palm of your hand, rubbing your hands together and then gently aplying it to the thirstiest or most damaged parts of your hair wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Save $6 to $8 bucks and go with either Motions or Clear Scalp&#x27;s Oil products.  </li>
            <li> Clear Scalp doesn&#x27;t even use a spray, you just put some drops in your hands and apply the way I do with this product.  </li>

            <li> I wanted to try Motions Salon Haircare Marula Natural Therapy Hair and Scalp Oil on my daughter and granddaughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> lightly spritzed their hair with this product, after washed and air dried.</li>
            <li> The Marula Natural Therapy Hair works wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to nearly everything.</li>
            <li> If your hair is naturally oily, or if you&#x27;ve had problems with any of the ingredients in the product, I would steer clear.</li>

            <li> Motions Salon Haircare Marula Natural Therapy Hair and Scalp Oil.</li>
            <li> The oil coats the hair and makes it soft.  </li>
            <li> did work really well for my son&#x27;s very short hair.</li>
            <li> i love this for curly thick hair.  </li>
            <li> This in particular causes a (thankfully) sparse, gritty type of buildup.</li>
            <li> ingredient list is a bit more manageable and not as evil-sounding as some of the other hair products on the market, including other products from the Motions line.</li>
            <li> Motions Marula oil spray and other items as Add on Items at such low prices for free shipping.</li>
            <li> This makes your scalp not dry and clear up dandruff and itchy scalp issues.</li>
            <li> I translated the ones I could identify easily into their common names for ease of reading.  </li>
            <li> It has one of the \\&quot;calmer\\&quot; lavendar scents, not sharp, as some lavendars are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it was necessary, but I am enjoying the results of the overall product</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, Marula Oil in the new Motions Natural Therapy Hair &amp; Scalp Oil Spray has a long history of use by Native Tsonga peoples of South Africa and Mozambique, both as a body and hair moisturizer and in cooking.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t experiment with this right before some important event or you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> The oil itself is very light, with a thin feel to it when rubbed between the fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a solid, decent product, and I will continue to buy it in the future.</li>

            <li> TO HAVE ONLY NATURAL AND/OR ORGANIC INGREDIENTS.</li>
            <li> Motions Marula Natural Therapy Hair and Scalp Oil is the ultimate luxury that your hairs deserve.</li>
            <li> These Motions products are, I think, developed for people with a very different hair type than mine.</li>
            <li> I wish I had not spent the money.</li>
            <li> In addition to having naturally straighening-resistant hair, my natural hair color is now about 70% gray, which is even more difficult to defrizz/straighten.  </li>
            <li> While my hair is dark blonde, very fine and silky, and dad&#x27;s is  medium thickness, dark brown with some curl, theirs is completely different!</li>
            <li> These were the only two products that did not tangle my hair and left it feeling soft and somewhat moisturized.</li>
            <li> healthier long-term is a product made with red palm oil that you have to leave in for a day or two &amp; your hair looks wet when it&#x27;s on, but it does really repair your hair.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my natural African American hair.  </li>
            <li> so I would suggest spray it into the trash first until you get even sprays ( just a few sprays).  </li>
            <li> I used Motions Haircare Marula Natural Therapy Hair and Scalp on my scalp to help with dry scalp.</li>
            <li> and I spray some of the Marula oil into my palm and use my fingers to daub it directly into those dry spots.  </li>
            <li> This product restores natural oils to my kinky curly dry hair.</li>
            <li> A few quick spritzes - focused away from the roots, of course - down the length of my hair, and then I run my fingers through a few times to help distribute the oil a little more evenly.  </li>
            <li> While it is, in fact, TRUE that their products CAN be used by all hair types, not all people with thinner or naturally straighter hair will be familiar with both the purpose of such a product and how much of it to apply which is why you will see some angry or bad reviews here from Users who tried this very nourishing, natural Marula Oil spray and found they had over-applied the product only to wind up with greasy hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried several times and got better with practice, but it always looked at least a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> If you had bad results spraying this ONTO your hair, try my way of spraying it INTO your palms and then gently working it INTO your hair only where it is most needed.  </li>

            <li> Less than I would normally use, but apparently too much, her hair was shiny, slick and greasy.</li>
            <li> I have really dark thick hair that gets extremely dry (mostly because I always forget to drink water, so I&#x27;m dehydrated a lot).</li>
            <li> When my scalp is feeling dry (and inevitably frustratingly itchy), I part my hair, and lightly press the pump until the lightest mist is applied to multiple spots on my scalp, then comb the oil through.</li>
            <li> And only using about two pumps per shampoo, this product will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> The spray bottle emits just a small amount with each push so that you&#x27;re not overwhelmed with too much product in one place.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, thinning hair, find a different product!  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, very coarse, long and wavy/curly Caucasian hair that tends to get very frizzy.  </li>
            <li> The only draw back is that you only need a little.</li>
            <li> but her&#x27;s is long.</li>
            <li> I have long relaxed hair halfway down my back and this has been all I&#x27;ve used in my hair daily for about 5yrs</li>
            <li> With that being said, the reviews on these other Motions products I ordered will probably be the same.</li>
            <li> There are several other botanical ingredients.  </li>
            <li> but my scalp is dry or rather</li>
            <li> I put some in as a leave in-conditioner before detangling my hair and then again after my hair is dry.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this product to people with dry hair.</li>
            <li> tend to experience off and on dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> If your scalp has naturally dry skin, one application of this each day is quite helpful.</li>
            <li> and I was surprised because some of the other Motions products had too heavy of a perfume for me.  </li>
            <li> One is a redhead, one is a blonde, but both have massively thick and heavy, completely straight hair.</li>
            <li> It weighs down the frizzier hairs, so that the overall appearance is smoother.  </li>
            <li> It minimizes breakage when my hair is wet and dry.</li>
            <li> I have a few dry spots on my scalp at the hairline, around my ears and on the back of my neck that suffer from having my hair in tension styles</li>
            <li> Thick to the point of never having found a hairtie that is big enough to make a single ponytail.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found the product too greasy and messy to use more than a few time</li>
            <li> its not really greasy(well</li>
            <li> : It doesn&#x27;t feel all greasy to me, even on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Then when my hair dried it looked like I poured regular oil all over</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oil, use it lightly, a very little bit goes a long, long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few upper end, expensive products, but none of the yet add up, so I&#x27;m still searching for that spray-in sheen that&#x27;s not silicone &amp; that really helps your hair.</li>
            <li> as someone that doesn&#x27;t have what you would call a hair &amp;#34;routine&amp;#34; I cant speak on how it interacts with any other products others may have in their regimen.</li>
            <li> now, I tried other creams, moisturizers but none</li>
            <li> due that it leaves my hair greasy, even just a couple sprays, so i leave it in day or night before a hair wash.</li>
            <li> I use other Motions products and have been a fan.  </li>
            <li> ive use this on flat ironed hair and unflat ironed hair and both times my hair was hard or dry feeling    </li>
            <li> After the initial application of this oil in this manner, it DOES make my hair look a bit greasy and heavy, but the oil absorbs in after a few hours.</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of breakage on your part line, I suggest using a light hair wax to really tamp down those horrible itty bitty cowlicks!  </li>

            <li> I got this for my daughters long, thick, dry hair.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both have dark, medium body hair</li>
            <li> The oil is in a spray bottle and it may take a few tries before you get the spray pump to give you evenly measured sprays</li>
            <li> and my hair is now dull and dry looking and feels rough to the touch</li>
            <li> It also keeps down the frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can spray a lot on my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t run down my face or get all over the place like Palmer&#x27;s spray oil did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It feels lightweight on my hair and does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Another hair wash later, I tried again with much much less product, I combed it through, which was difficult because her hair still felt dry.</li>
            <li> me , just shampoo and a little gel takes care of my hair care.</li>
            <li> Marula Oil Therapy is also LESS THAN HALF THE PRICE of that Suave Product!  </li>

            <li> However, I found a little worked</li>
            <li> I think that over the past few weeks, when I&#x27;ve used the oil every other day, my hair has gotten softer.  </li>
            <li> The oil helps nourish those broken hairs we all get at our parts and helps them lay down flat.  </li>
            <li> The oil helps nourish those broken hairs we all get at our parts and helps them lay down flat.  </li>
            <li> Other beneficial ingredients in the hair oil include extracts of Chamomile, Lavendar, Black Elderberry Flower (Sambucus nigra), Sunflower, Common Cowslip flower (a type of Primrose), Calendula, Rosemary and extract of Cinnamon bark.  </li>
            <li> every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use this product for a few days, it goes away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Her hair gets really dried out and so does her scalp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this isn&#x27;t the only hair product I would use - it&#x27;s absolutely useless for obtaining volume, for example, although once I&#x27;ve achieved volume with mousse and a diffuser a little oil on the tips doesn&#x27;t weigh it down -</li>
            <li> It has a slightly synthetic, but not at all unpleasant fragrance that doesn&#x27;t last long before fading away.</li>
            <li> A lightweight oil with a salon scent that makes your hair look a little shinier than it does ordinarily.</li>
            <li> I do not like that slick feel to my hair from products.  </li>
            <li> not sure how I feel about the ingredients though.</li>
            <li> Sadly this is a total pass.</li>
            <li> If you have very thin hair, then this product might work well only on the ends of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The place of sorbitol in it, however, is confusing.</li>
            <li> Nearly impossible, actually.  </li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> I was totally disappointed that an entire line of hair products missed the mark.</li>
            <li> so i thought worse case</li>
            <li> I then read reviews giving this product poor ratings because it&#x27;s too oily;</li>
            <li> Using it in this way soothes my drying scalp without weighing down my hair too terribly much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a perfect product, but It&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> it is terribly greasy.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this oil.  It smells good and works great!  You have to watch how much you use though...a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it took awhile for me to write this review because i wanted to give it a fair amount of time to work but it doesnt work    Pros  its not really greasy(well it is when you first put it on but then it drys up)   its a dry oil that means oil isnt running all down you neck and face  its really good for sealing the ends of you hair    Cons   it says its suppose to hydrate your hair and scalp, it hydrates my hair but my scalp is dry or rather yet it makes my hair look hydrated.  it dosent make your hair softer. ive use this on flat ironed hair and unflat ironed hair and both times my hair was hard or dry feeling    most of motions products really suck for me atleast there&#x27;s only a couple that are really good and this is not one of them i thought since this was marula oil and everybody was talking about how good it was i figured this would be good to...its not, save your money</li>
            <li> This PRODUCT CAN AND HAS MADE MY HAIR BEHAVE LIKE ITS HEALTHIER AND WILL RESIST FALLOUT. A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY AND IT MAKES HAIR MUCH MORE MANAGEABLE,EASIER AND DETANGLE AND VERY GLOSSY. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT TO ME IT SHOULD HAVE MORE OF THIS GREAT MARULA OIL SINCE THOS OIL SEEMS TO BE WHAT SHOULD BE AT THE TOP AND NOT @ THE BOTTOM OF ITS INGREDIENTS LIST I ALSO WOULD LIKE ITFOR IT TO HAVE ONLY NATURAL AND/OR ORGANIC INGREDIENTS. AND FOR SOME IT CAN STOP OR CONTROL HAIR LOSS!</li>
            <li> I adore this oil. Smells so good and provides a weightless moisture and shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and I&#x27;m so glad Amazon has this hair oil spray available, and for the lowest price I&#x27;ve seen, so it&#x27;s a great Add On Item. The price is lower than CVS. So I&#x27;m sooo thankful I can get Motions Marula oil spray and other items as Add on Items at such low prices for free shipping. The smells nice and the spray feature is very fast and convenient. its a good healthy hair product. A great find here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years....as someone that doesn&#x27;t have what you would call a hair &amp;#34;routine&amp;#34; I cant speak on how it interacts with any other products others may have in their regimen. I have long relaxed hair halfway down my back and this has been all I&#x27;ve used in my hair daily for about 5yrs now, I tried other creams, moisturizers but none seemed to be lightweight and not leave a residue. This product is light I spray about ten sprays in my hand and work it in from roots to tips with my fingers, it leaves a nice shine without all the buildup (I wash my hair every other week). I recently ran out of my last bottle and walmart was out when I went to pick up another so I grabbed some argan oil spray instead...its not working out for me... its been about two weeks since I last used it and my hair is now dull and dry looking and feels rough to the touch, I never knew what a difference it was making until now that I don&#x27;t have it....going to walmart today hopefully its back in stock. Im not saying its a miracle product but if you&#x27;re low maintenance like I am and don&#x27;t want to fool with a bunch of different products &amp; steps...this ones a keeper!!</li>
            <li> NO ONE SELLS THIS HAIR GOLD HERE ANYMORE IN AL, I CANNOT GET ENUFF!!</li>
            <li> I really liked this product because its very light weight doesn&#x27;t give you that greasy look or feel! you must try</li>
            <li> due that it leaves my hair greasy, even just a couple sprays, so i leave it in day or night before a hair wash. it&#x27;s ok- smells nice, but don&#x27;t think i will buy again. i have fine caucasian hair but been bleaching/coloring it a few years causing dryness- researched marula is good for dry hair &amp; thought i&#x27;d try this. i prefer no chemicals so i thought worse case i&#x27;d have a bottle i could spray an oily product of my own out it one day if i did not like this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for about four months,, and my hair is growing rapidly, texture is better and, and is always shiny..I didnt know it would make my hair grow but it is..</li>
            <li> This is a great product to add to braids. (I am African American) This makes your scalp not dry and clear up dandruff and itchy scalp issues. The scent is pleasant. The only draw back is that you only need a little. If you use too much it will be greasy . A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rewriting my review now that I&#x27;ve nearly finished the bottle. This caused me to break out at my hairline and my shoulders where my hair lies. Also, it was difficult to recreate the perfect balance it initially brought to my hair. The bottle is a pain to hold as it gets wider at the top. I&#x27;ve recently switched to maracuja oil. I bought mine from an inexpensive dealer on ebay.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick, very coarse, long and wavy/curly Caucasian hair that tends to get very frizzy.  It is also colored and highlighted.  I realized this product&#x27;s target market is for people with African hair, but figured I&#x27;d give it a try since I&#x27;ve never had a problem with products being too heavy--quite the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this product, I sprayed three light sprays (each side and the back), and my hair became an instant grease ball.  Not good.  So the second time I used it, I sprayed it a couple times into the palm of my hand and ran my hands lightly through my hair from about 1/3 from the scalp to the ends, with a concentration on the ends.  This time it gave just the right amount of shine and defrizzing.  My hair is not greasy and has plenty of body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great and unexpected perk of using this oil is that my flat iron works better.  In addition to having naturally straighening-resistant hair, my natural hair color is now about 70% gray, which is even more difficult to defrizz/straighten.  Nearly impossible, actually.  I bought a top-of the line straighter some months back (GHD) and still it didn&#x27;t work that great.  After using ths product, my hair is easier to straighten, gets straighter, and stays straight longer.  That alone is worth the purchase price.  I would caution you to be sure to put on a heat protecting product before the oil if you plan to straighten your hair.  Otherwise it&#x27;s like frying your hair in hot grease--highly damaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely would not recommend this product for anyone with fine or thin hair, but it worked great for me.  And only using about two pumps per shampoo, this product will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> I ordered several projects from the Motions hair line. Prior to the last order, I ordered their curl butter and another product and was totally dissatisfied. With that being said, the reviews on these other Motions products I ordered will probably be the same. I was totally disappointed that an entire line of hair products missed the mark. I can honestly say that I will not be buying these products anytime in the future. Not only did they do what they said they&#x27;d do, after the 1st hour or so, but the residue and build up in my hair, caused me to have to cut sections of my hair to get the residue and knots out of my hair. Out of the 9 products I tried there were only two that did anything for me and that was moisturizing cleanser and the deep conditioning hair masque. These were the only two products that did not tangle my hair and left it feeling soft and somewhat moisturized. I can actually run a comb or brush through it without pulling out plugs. I only wished that Motions&#x27; other products worked as successfully as these two did.</li>
            <li> After being initially pleased that this Motions product arrived intact (not spilled, like other products I&#x27;d ordered, and also secure in a closed plastic bag), I was thrilled the the scent of the oil. It has one of the \\&quot;calmer\\&quot; lavendar scents, not sharp, as some lavendars are. Perhaps the chamomile scent cuts the lavendar a bit, but the result is very luscious and pleasing without being overdone, flowery, or too sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I keep the oil (it really is mostly vegetable oil) away from my roots, it brings a nice shine and final polish to my hair.  It also keeps down the frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark brown, wavy-straight, caucasian hair of normal thickness. If i put the oil on my scalp, it pretty much looks like I need to wash my hair. So I reserve the use on the hair shaft and tips. For people with more coarse hair, using the oil on the scalp might be perfect. If you have very thin hair, then this product might work well only on the ends of the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bonus use of this Motions product is to use it as a skin lotion. The oil soaks in readily to my olive skin type, and feels/smells really good. I feel like I am giving my skin vitamins. There is no greasy sensation with my skin type. This is my favorite Motions product so far, and plan to buy more when this bottle is used up.</li>
            <li> Unlike the Motions Naturally You Radiating Hair gloss I like this one way better. It has a nice light smell and actually penetrates the scalp. I use this regularly and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily at all.It helps with dry scalp and its very easy to dispense. So far so good!</li>
            <li> This scalp oil made my scalp too oily. I did not feel the oil absorbed into my skin. It also made my scalp itch, and I had to wash it out to stop the itching. This product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I used Motions Haircare Marula Natural Therapy Hair and Scalp on my scalp to help with dry scalp. This oil kept my scalp moisturized. This also kept my hair moisturized and soft. I think this works best on Natural hair. I have trird most of the products in the Motions line and I have been quite pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The Motions line is well respected amongst product users. I picked this up for a dear friend who is very fond of the Motions line , and she was happy to receive the gift.&lt;br /&gt;For me , just shampoo and a little gel takes care of my hair care. I&#x27;ve never understood the need for all the extras , but my friend says that the full Motions line is essential. And who am I to disagree , her hair always looks great !</li>
            <li> This stuff is great if you have dry hair &amp; you need something quick &amp; inexpensive to make your hair shine. Doesn&#x27;t do much at all for the long-haul or your hair health though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use &amp; inexpensive, the shampoo is great in the brand, but this is just OK. Good ingredients, some are OK, inexpensive, as mostly corn oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the sprayer, but it still gets on your hands when you brush &amp; shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cello-Fix it&#x27;s not! I&#x27;m STILL trying to find the Cello-Fix I used to use until they stopped making it! I&#x27;ve tried a few upper end, expensive products, but none of the yet add up, so I&#x27;m still searching for that spray-in sheen that&#x27;s not silicone &amp; that really helps your hair. The only thing I&#x27;ve found that really does works &amp; measures up to make hair look healthier long-term is a product made with red palm oil that you have to leave in for a day or two &amp; your hair looks wet when it&#x27;s on, but it does really repair your hair. Pantene products work OK for every day, but still no spray in shine product that&#x27;s not just stuff on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product feels oily until it sets in, or you towel it off.</li>
            <li> I love this product, but I am only giving it 2 stars because it contains parabens.  I have used this product for one year, and my Sisterlocks love it.  However I will discontinue use as soon as I&#x27;ve finished using my bottles.</li>
            <li> Daverat&#x27;s Wife speaking (forgive my typos, please, I have Rheumatoid Arthritis) As many lines for African-American Women are trying to reach new audiences, their advertising will often say \\&quot;For all Hair Types\\&quot; in their descriptions.  While it is, in fact, TRUE that their products CAN be used by all hair types, not all people with thinner or naturally straighter hair will be familiar with both the purpose of such a product and how much of it to apply which is why you will see some angry or bad reviews here from Users who tried this very nourishing, natural Marula Oil spray and found they had over-applied the product only to wind up with greasy hair.  I have what has been called \\&quot;Ethnic hair\\&quot; which frizzes easily and if left to its own, will loc up into long spirals that are hard to disentangle.  Since my hair is waist length, my thirsty waves are the perfect hair for just about any product originally marketed to Women of Color.  However, my husband, who is of English and Scandanavian descent, has fine curly hair and he can use these products too, just much more sparingly.  Remember when you see something saying \\&quot;For all hair types\\&quot; but see photos showing women of color in the ads, that if you have baby fine hair that is straight as can be, you will need to experiment by using much less at first until you find the correct amount to gain some moisture or shine benefit.  If you just spray the stuff on as directed, you may wind up looking like Fonzie on a saturday night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, Marula Oil in the new Motions Natural Therapy Hair &amp; Scalp Oil Spray has a long history of use by Native Tsonga peoples of South Africa and Mozambique, both as a body and hair moisturizer and in cooking.  The oil comes from the nut of the Marula tree whose species is known as \\&quot;Sclerocarya birrea\\&quot;. There is also Marula seed oil in the mix.  Other beneficial ingredients in the hair oil include extracts of Chamomile, Lavendar, Black Elderberry Flower (Sambucus nigra), Sunflower, Common Cowslip flower (a type of Primrose), Calendula, Rosemary and extract of Cinnamon bark.  There are several other botanical ingredients.  I translated the ones I could identify easily into their common names for ease of reading.  There are other soothing ingredients such as Rose oil (listed as Geraniol), lemon oil, honey and several more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all works together to form a very light citrus scented oil with notes of spices and nuts.  The oil is in a spray bottle and it may take a few tries before you get the spray pump to give you evenly measured sprays so I would suggest spray it into the trash first until you get even sprays ( just a few sprays).  Then, I further suggest spraying one spray into the palm of your hand, rubbing your hands together and then gently aplying it to the thirstiest or most damaged parts of your hair wet or dry.  Their derections have you spraying this right UNTO your hair and I feel this is a mistake if you have thinner or baby fine hair.  The mist isn&#x27;t fine enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a \\&quot;work-in\\&quot; oil treatment.  I put some in as a leave in-conditioner before detangling my hair and then again after my hair is dry.  I also use it as a styling aid to help me use a paddle brush to put my hair upinto a french twist or into any  braids or protective style such as twists.  I have a few dry spots on my scalp at the hairline, around my ears and on the back of my neck that suffer from having my hair in tension styles and I spray some of the Marula oil into my palm and use my fingers to daub it directly into those dry spots.  it doesn&#x27;t sting like some treatments and it immediately relieves the soreness, helping to reduce flakes and inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product and I was surprised because some of the other Motions products had too heavy of a perfume for me.  This product has a light and pleasant scent.  The oil is equally light when applied with your hands and not sprayed directly unto the hair as their directions suggest.  If you had bad results spraying this ONTO your hair, try my way of spraying it INTO your palms and then gently working it INTO your hair only where it is most needed.  If you have a normally greasy scalp, apply the oild mostly to your damaged ends and then as a light finishing touch as you pat it over the area where you normally part your hair.  The oil helps nourish those broken hairs we all get at our parts and helps them lay down flat.  If you have a lot of breakage on your part line, I suggest using a light hair wax to really tamp down those horrible itty bitty cowlicks!  That works for me as does changing up the area of my part line by an 8th of an inch every few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product may seem too greasy for people not used to applying oils directly to their hair.  Don&#x27;t be put off by that.  If you are product-testing a bottle, give it another try and use my method of spraying it into your palms and not at your hair.  Their spraying mechanism doesn&#x27;t disperse the oil in fine enough a mist, if you ask me.  There are bound to be spots that get ten times too much.  If you work it in with your hands, that won&#x27;t happen.  I would never srpay this directly unto my hair and most of my hair can use a goodly amount of oil!  Use your hands for best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I find this to be a great new Hair Oil product, cheaper than mot Argan Oils which used to be the \\&quot;Gold Standard\\&quot; of hair oil treatments, and the scent is far more pleasant than the new Suave Argan Oil spray called [[ASIN:B00A0IWSIO Suave Suave Professionals Moroccan Infusion Moroccan Argan Styling Oil, 3 Ounce]].  This Motions Marula Oil Therapy is also LESS THAN HALF THE PRICE of that Suave Product!  How&#x27;s that for a shocker?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS product IS the best bargain in hair oil sprays  along with [[ASIN:B007RTR9G0 CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp &amp; Hair Oil, 3 Fluid Ounce]].

Save $6 to $8 bucks and go with either Motions or Clear Scalp&#x27;s Oil products.  Clear Scalp doesn&#x27;t even use a spray, you just put some drops in your hands and apply the way I do with this product.  This is one Hair Oil I will want to have on hand always!ggest.

            <li> I wanted to try Motions Salon Haircare Marula Natural Therapy Hair and Scalp Oil on my daughter and granddaughter&#x27;s hair. While my hair is dark blonde, very fine and silky, and dad&#x27;s is  medium thickness, dark brown with some curl, theirs is completely different! (I should add that I am adopted.) One is a redhead, one is a blonde, but both have massively thick and heavy, completely straight hair. Thick to the point of never having found a hairtie that is big enough to make a single ponytail. Seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We lightly spritzed their hair with this product, after washed and air dried. It looked greasy but was rapidly absorbed. For the first time, their hair looked shiny and felt silky smooth! They were thrilled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this product would never work on my hair, it is absolutely fabulous on theirs!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had life-long problems with tousled hair, and this is a suitable product for me.  Scent isn&#x27;t overly feminine, so I have no problems using it regularly.</li>
            <li> i love this for curly thick hair.  When you spray it on, massage it into your hair to keep the dryness away.  Makes it nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> The Marula Natural Therapy Hair works wonders on my hair. I have a never-ending problem with frizz and split ends. This isn&#x27;t a miracle in a bottle, but it keeps the split ends together until a haircut, keeps the ends from splitting afterward, leaves a gorgeous shine without looking oily, and smells amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have one problem, and it happens to be a problem I have with about 90% of hair products: it irritates my scalp. I&#x27;m allergic to nearly everything. Many products with natural oils or extracts give me hives, scalp irritation, or dandruff (to be fair, most products without these ingredients cause issues, too.) This in particular causes a (thankfully) sparse, gritty type of buildup. Nothing hurts or itches, but if I go through the roots in the mirror, I&#x27;m able to see it. If I don&#x27;t use this product for a few days, it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the scalp issue, I use this product 1 - 2 times a week. This helps with the split ends, frizz, and dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to people with dry hair. If your hair is naturally oily, or if you&#x27;ve had problems with any of the ingredients in the product, I would steer clear.</li>
            <li> I have a dry scalp, so I needed something that was going to make my hair shiny and smooth and also help to protect it from the damage that it gets when I straighten it.  What I found is that this was a great idea to help me have hair that looked great.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my daughter who is African American/White mix. Her hair gets really dried out and so does her scalp. This worked well to spray on her hair between washings to give it some moisture. It&#x27;s not a perfect product, but It&#x27;s not too bad. I would say it is worth a try.</li>
            <li> This is a product I gave to a neighbor to try and her review is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to experience off and on dry scalp.  I have been looking for something that would help make my hair look more smooth and reflect the light to show more shine.  I tend to straighten it often and worry also about the damage I might do. This product helped keep my scalp from being itchy, made my hair smooth and shiny. However, I found a little worked well and when I used too much, it went from shiny to greasy. Use sparingly!</li>
            <li> Way too greasy for our taste.  I used the same hair brush I used to brush this into my daughter&#x27;s hair and had to wash my hair again quickly.  Don&#x27;t experiment with this right before some important event or you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> This is very oily and great for my supremely dry dark hair. I have really dark thick hair that gets extremely dry (mostly because I always forget to drink water, so I&#x27;m dehydrated a lot). A dab of this (I use about a quarter-size is good to bring the ends of my hair back to life, and about two quarters is good for the rest of my hair (I have long hair - it goes down to the small of my lowerback).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list is a bit more manageable and not as evil-sounding as some of the other hair products on the market, including other products from the Motions line. The place of sorbitol in it, however, is confusing. I&#x27;m not sure why it was necessary, but I am enjoying the results of the overall product so I put worrying about the ingredients a bit to the side for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I am willing to overlook their use of a sweetener in their hair product and plan on buying another bottle once I run out of this one.</li>
            <li> I have no hair but knew that my scalp needed something to lubricate it. My Daughter who has hair recommended this product and that was years ago and have to have it daily</li>
            <li> No wonder this leaves the hair shiny...it is terribly greasy.  I got my Motions Salon Haircare for hair and scalp from Amazon and was hopeful for healthier hair and scalp from using this product.  Unfortunately, I found the product too greasy and messy to use more than a few time so cannot truthfully recommend this to anyone else.  Although it may be jsut what someone else is looking for.  I do not like that slick feel to my hair from products.  I decided to use it on my dry skin and love the product on my legs and arms this winter.  [[ASIN:B001T8MN16 Motions Salon Haircare Marula Natural Therapy Hair and Scalp Oil, 8 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Motions Salon Haircare Marula Natural Therapy Hair and Scalp Oil. See the name of the product? It&#x27;s hair and scalp oil. The very first ingredient on the product is oil. I then read reviews giving this product poor ratings because it&#x27;s too oily; well gosh, whodathunkit! It&#x27;s oil, use it lightly, a very little bit goes a long, long way! Anyway, this is actually a surprisingly good hair and scalp oil. It feels like it really goes to work on the hair shafts softening up dry hair and making it more manageable and healthier looking. It has a slightly synthetic, but not at all unpleasant fragrance that doesn&#x27;t last long before fading away. Interestingly, this product is also good at helping to remove heavier petroleum based pomades from the hair. An excellent product!</li>
            <li> A lightweight oil with a salon scent that makes your hair look a little shinier than it does ordinarily. The spray bottle emits just a small amount with each push so that you&#x27;re not overwhelmed with too much product in one place. The scent is not overpowering but rather is pleasant and mild. If your scalp has naturally dry skin, one application of this each day is quite helpful.</li>
            <li> Motions Marula Natural Therapy Hair and Scalp Oil is the ultimate luxury that your hairs deserve. Very smooth hair therapy oil that works well on the calp and doesn&#x27;t irritate. Leaves hairs shiny and smooth. Recommended</li>
            <li> I after I condition my natural hair with a rinse out conditioner, I spray this on my wet hair and then sit under the hood dryer for about 30 minutes. My intention is to seal in moisture while giving my hair some more shine. I think that it does an okay job of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It doesn&#x27;t feel all greasy to me, even on wet hair. I can spray a lot on my hair, and it doesn&#x27;t run down my face or get all over the place like Palmer&#x27;s spray oil did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about the ingredients though. Marula oil is the 4th ingredient on the list. The very first one is corn oil, which I didn&#x27;t even know was used to moisturize hair.</li>
            <li> I got this for my girlfriend to use. Here is her review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, fine, formerly bleached hair. Basically, this means that the ends, from my ears down, get really dry and snarl very easily. I have been looking for some oils to help treat this, thus why I decided to try this Hair and Scalp Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I notice was there was a spray at the top of this bottle. Most of the oils that I have used have a pump which helps control where you place the oil. It was a little challenging to determine how much to use. One or two sprays doesn&#x27;t seem like enough but three to four seems like way too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this on my dry hair and found that my fine hair felt full of goo and looked like I had not washed it in a couple days. I tried it on my wet hair, thinking to lock in the moisture, and found that my hair felt full of glue while I tried to work it in. Then when my hair dried it looked like I poured regular oil all over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I won&#x27;t use this oil. I think the problem lies in my fine, bleached hair. My scalp is fine so I can&#x27;t say how this oil works for that. But my fine hair just doesn&#x27;t like this oil. It looks so greasy. Someone else that has dry scalp and maybe thicker hair could find this is the best oil for them. But I have to say that I wouldn&#x27;t be buying it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shawn Kovacich&lt;br /&gt;Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, during the morning rush, I haven&#x27;t got time to properly style my waist-length hair.  In these situations, this hair oil has proven to be incredibly handy.  A few quick spritzes - focused away from the roots, of course - down the length of my hair, and then I run my fingers through a few times to help distribute the oil a little more evenly.  That&#x27;s it!  The oil coats the hair and makes it soft.  It weighs down the frizzier hairs, so that the overall appearance is smoother.  It also dries fairly quickly, so my hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy all day.  I think that over the past few weeks, when I&#x27;ve used the oil every other day, my hair has gotten softer.  The ends definitely don&#x27;t look as prone to split ends as before, and they don&#x27;t feel as scratchy and worn out against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this isn&#x27;t the only hair product I would use - it&#x27;s absolutely useless for obtaining volume, for example, although once I&#x27;ve achieved volume with mousse and a diffuser a little oil on the tips doesn&#x27;t weigh it down - it&#x27;s a solid, decent product, and I will continue to buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> These Motions products are, I think, developed for people with a very different hair type than mine. That said, it still does work for what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It&#x27;s very oily, but it does seem to help make my hair more...pliable? Workable? Anyway, if it sounds like something you need, then I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughters long, thick, dry hair. I was hoping it was be a nice and easy final step to make her hair manageable. It smelled really nice, so I sprayed what I thought was a conservative amount. Less than I would normally use, but apparently too much, her hair was shiny, slick and greasy. Short on time I combed it back into a ponytail to &#x27;hide&#x27; the fact that her hair looked like it hadn&#x27;t been washed in a month and sent her to school. When she arrived home it was still looking a like I slicked her hair with straight petrolium jelly. Another hair wash later, I tried again with much much less product, I combed it through, which was difficult because her hair still felt dry. And lo and behold, her hair still looked unwashed and greasy. Sadly this is a total pass. Seeing as her hair type seemed ideal for this product, I&#x27;m not sure who it would work for.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my natural African American hair.  I use other Motions products and have been a fan.  For me this product worked best on freshly shampooed and conditioned natural hair rather than on dry.  When used on my dry natural hair it left a bit of an oily residue, whereas it absorbed better into my damp hair.  It does leave a nice glossy sheen that made my hair look quite healthy.  I liked the moisture it gave my scalp but it probably won&#x27;t get added to my regular routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did work really well for my son&#x27;s very short hair.</li>
            <li> This product restores natural oils to my kinky curly dry hair. It minimizes breakage when my hair is wet and dry. The oils seem to penetrate the hair shaft and not just sit on top of the hair strands creating a greasy head of hair. It feels lightweight on my hair and does not weigh it down. The oil has a pleasant fragrance, too. I plan to continue to use Marula oil because of these specifics. The cost is affordable, under $6 for 8 ounces. I only wish I could buy it in a bulk size 24 ounces.</li>
            <li> I really liked the idea of this product, but no matter how much I tried, I couldn&#x27;t get it on the scalp (where I wanted it)without getting it all over my hair as well.  The result was very greasy looking hair.  I tried several times and got better with practice, but it always looked at least a little greasy.  If application was easier, I would like this product.  It does feel good on your scalp, especially during winter months.</li>
            <li> I use this Motions oil on about a weekly basis, to give my dry scalp a light boost of moisture. Using it in this way soothes my drying scalp without weighing down my hair too terribly much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very pleasant - citrus, without being too cloyingly sweet. It&#x27;s a nice burst of pleasant, natural-smelling fragrance to help wash away the week&#x27;s environmental and physical effects. The oil itself is very light, with a thin feel to it when rubbed between the fingertips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of misting the oil directly onto my hair, for application to the hair shaft, I pump a spritz or three of oil into the palm of my hand, spread it between both hands, and lightly run my oiled palms over first the ends, then shaft, of my hair. When my scalp is feeling dry (and inevitably frustratingly itchy), I part my hair, and lightly press the pump until the lightest mist is applied to multiple spots on my scalp, then comb the oil through. After the initial application of this oil in this manner, it DOES make my hair look a bit greasy and heavy, but the oil absorbs in after a few hours. Considering that, I normally apply it at night, before I head to bed, so the bulk of the oil will get absorbed in before I head out the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is, overall, one that I&#x27;d consider buying again in the future, in light of its low cost and high volume of product, but in light of the fact that the first ingredient on the label is corn oil, I&#x27;m not so sure that Motions is being completely accurate in billing this first as Marula oil. It&#x27;s not a bad product, but if you&#x27;re looking for this to act as a fill-in for the coveted, yet pricey, Moroccan oil, I think you just might need to continue your search...</li>
            <li> Motions products are generally quite good.  This one is no exception.  This product offers good quality and really works as intended.  Give it a try.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, thinning hair, find a different product!  One light misting and my hair looks greasy.I wish I had not spent the money. I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both have dark, medium body hair but her&#x27;s is long. We found this to be a bit too oily for either of us.</li>
