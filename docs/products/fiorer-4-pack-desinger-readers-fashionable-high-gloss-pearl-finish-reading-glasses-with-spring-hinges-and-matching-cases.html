            <li> Love them. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> I love these.  Realized I needed a pair of reading glasses after getting my contact RX filled.  I had some difficulty reading things like package labels with smaller text, so figured I would give these a try.  They&#x27;re exactly what I needed and there are enough for me to keep a pair in my purse and at work.  The style and fit is great.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I really love the design on these glasses... I just wish that they shape of the lenses were a bit less of a wide rectangle. They seemed a bit wide from side to side (for my face). Nothing against the company selling these. They arrived fast and are very stylish. Just really not for me....</li>
            <li> these were perfect in everyway .....  will be needing more soon.</li>
            <li> I like the colors and style and the shape of the eye glasses. the pockets to place them when not wearing them.</li>
            <li> Now I have a cute and functional pair of reading glasses in every room!</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors and well constructed.  The price is reasonable and you can never have too many pairs of reading glasses.</li>
            <li> bought for wife she thinks they are great - enjoys the spring hinged eye pieces.  case and color made her smile</li>

            <li> sturdy and fashionable.  I buy of these types of glasses and they are pretty good.  They need to be sturdy for me!</li>
            <li> These glasses are awesome! I&#x27;ve had so many wonderful compliments on them. I&#x27;m having so much fun wearing a different pair to match every outfit. They have vertical stripes so they&#x27;re slimming (LOL)!!! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. First quality and very prompt shipping.</li>
            <li> I choose these because of the color (easy to find if misplaced) and the spring hinges.  I keep a pair of the glasses in my car, office, kitchen and purse.  The glasses are light weight, with a great fit.  I would recommend this product to friends</li>
            <li> Love these fun stylin glasses! Really fun colors that go with almost any outfit! Good quality glasses with matching cases.</li>
            <li> I got these glasses because we keep misplacing reading glasses around the house.  Plus some of our existing glasses had broken nose-pieces or hinges.  I was pleasantly impressed with the construction and stylishness of these glasses.  So far, we have had them for several months and we like wearing them and there has been no breakage.</li>
            <li> The glasses are colorful, fun and help me read fine print! Love the colors and how they fit.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Durable, light and not so serious.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased three sets of these. The first ones I loved. When they eventually broke, I bought a new set. Those broke REALLY quickly. I bought a third set, thinking maybe the second set was a fluke. Nope! The four pairs in the third set each broke after a few days of use. I&#x27;ve decided that even though I like how they look, they definitely are not worth the price. The glasses I bought at Walmart aren&#x27;t as stylish but they&#x27;re less expensive and last far longer.</li>
            <li> Love these glasses.  Very well made and sturdy.  I always get compliments on the wonderful design.  Everyone thinks they look great.</li>
