            <li>perfect size, i am going to order another set!</li>
            <li>These rollers are very good.  </li>
            <li>The clip traps weren&#x27;t very good either.</li>
            <li>The beautiful waves with no heat.</li>
            <li>These are a great size and work well.</li>
            <li>These curlers are great to sleep in.&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>Good, just wish they it was denser foam and stiffer plastic.  </li>
            <li>I thought these would make a nice surl</li>
            <li>The best truly jumbo sized foam rollers I have found so far.  </li>
            <li>Most of my hair was looked frizzy because you sleep on it.  </li>
            <li>We really appreciate this all around great dealer and recommend to all others.</li>
            <li>I ordered to packs and would like to have two more packs.</li>
            <li>a great curl to very staight</li>
            <li>These curlers are perfect to provide longer hair enough body without being too curly.  </li>
            <li>I find myself reattaching the swing arm to the roller more than I want to.</li>
            <li>They are ideal for rolling damp air before going to bed because they are soft and comfortable for sleeping.</li>
            <li>so I decided to upgrade to the large foam rollers and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>Good quality and just the right size for making pretty spiral curls.</li>
            <li>on if you want achieve smooth, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>Not the most comfortable night sleep, but if you put them in right you get that movie star huge locks of curls.</li>
            <li>They are nice, but I definitely need more of them to accomplish the style I want.</li>
            <li>These rollers are perfect for creating long lasting spirals that are healthy for my hair.</li>
            <li>Gives you beautiful curls when you use them with slightly damp hair and sleep on them.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>I really like the size of these rollers but the swing arm to secure my hair in place</li>
            <li>They were OK, but didn&#x27;t do what I wanted as far as a curl is concerned.</li>
            <li>As for items, they are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready for a photo shoot!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I think they would work best with permed or naturally curly hair and not straight hair such as mine.</li>
            <li>what a waste of money and they are so cheaply made, better off to just get velcro rollers.  </li>
            <li>The plastic stem and clasp can come apart occasionally but can be rejoined easily.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend it but those with stubborn straight hair.  </li>
            <li>and the foam is very sturdy</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s convenient, no heat damage to my hair, and I get a beautiful long lasting result for the following day.</li>
            <li>A bit frustrating when the clip separates from the curler during the rolling process, but it&#x27;s not impossible to snap it back in, and they are definitely very comfortable and easy to sleep in.  </li>
            <li>Just not the quality of the older days.</li>
            <li>Because i have straight hair i wanted to achieve some natural waves, not curls out of this by putting them on overnight.  </li>
            <li>I guess they work and all, as long as you don&#x27;t put too much hair in them, and by too much</li>
            <li>I mean a normal amount that looks okay.</li>
            <li>If you like foam rollers and not a tight curl&lt;</li>
            <li>These are cheap and difficult to use, and smell funny.</li>
            <li>You have to be careful about the amount of hair you put in the roller, because it won&#x27;t dry over night if there&#x27;s too much.</li>

            <li> So I have long (down to my midback), straight, thin textured hair and these foam rollers are too squishy, too soft and cannot hold alot of hair at once.  </li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> The foam is firm.  </li>
            <li> for some reason, the holders of other sizes are thick and sturdy and do work.  </li>
            <li> They are very comfortable but there is TERRIBLE problem with them - the plastic snap holders don&#x27;t work!  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Good quality and just the right size for making pretty spiral curls. I bought two packs and use them ALL, rolling horizontal around my head. My hair is to mid-back and has slight natural waves. These rollers are perfect for creating long lasting spirals that are healthy for my hair.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it but those with stubborn straight hair.  So I have long (down to my midback), straight, thin textured hair and these foam rollers are too squishy, too soft and cannot hold alot of hair at once.  Because i have straight hair i wanted to achieve some natural waves, not curls out of this by putting them on overnight.  The waves did come out the next day, it had dents in them because you sleep on it.  Most of my hair was looked frizzy because you sleep on it.  I recommend that you dont sleep with this on if you want achieve smooth, wavy hair.  and the foam is very sturdy, the waves come out for tighter than i want it to.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for. These are cheap and difficult to use, and smell funny. I regret not just buying all Conair rollers. These also don&#x27;t come in a reusable bag, so you&#x27;ll want to grab a plastic Ziplock to keep them in.</li>
            <li> They were OK, but didn&#x27;t do what I wanted as far as a curl is concerned.</li>
            <li> I like to sleep with my rollers in my hair for several reasons - it&#x27;s convenient, no heat damage to my hair, and I get a beautiful long lasting result for the following day. I&#x27;ve been using this brand of foam rollers for several years now only because I cannot seem to find another brand of foam rollers in this 1.5 size.  They are very comfortable but there is TERRIBLE problem with them - the plastic snap holders don&#x27;t work!  The plastic holders are flimsy and they don&#x27;t snap shut.  So... what I&#x27;ve had to do over the years is substitute the plastic holders from this set of 1.5 sized rollers with holders from a different set of rollers - that is, the 1 inch sized roller set that I have, made by the same company!  for some reason, the holders of other sizes are thick and sturdy and do work.  But not in the 1.5 roller size!  So, I would not recommend this product until the manufacturer improves the quality of the plastic roller snap holders.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even need chemicals! Put them in damp hair, sleep, and wake up to luscious curls!</li>
            <li> These rollers are very good.  They are bigger than what I can get in the stores.  If you like foam rollers and not a tight curl&lt;br /&gt;you will like these.</li>
            <li> We really appreciate this all around great dealer and recommend to all others. As for items, they are exactly what I wanted. Thankyou</li>
            <li> Good, just wish they it was denser foam and stiffer plastic.  Just not the quality of the older days.</li>
            <li> These rollers are not secure.  When trying to roll my hair, the end clip falls out.  Don&#x27;t waste your $.</li>
            <li> perfect size, i am going to order another set!</li>
            <li> they were not large at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used rollers before and hate using heat to style, so I thought these would be nice if I want to do a curly hair style.

            <li> what a waste of money and they are so cheaply made, better off to just get velcro rollers.  I thought these would make a nice surl they end up making it frizzy</li>
            <li> I guess they work and all, as long as you don&#x27;t put too much hair in them, and by too much I mean a normal amount that looks okay. The clip traps weren&#x27;t very good either. I gave them to my daughter for her dolls hair.</li>
            <li> These are a great size and work well.</li>
            <li> These curlers are great to sleep in.&lt;br /&gt;Make a great curl to very staight hair.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, will make tight curls or loose&lt;br /&gt;depending on how long you leave them in.</li>
            <li> Gives you beautiful curls when you use them with slightly damp hair and sleep on them. Not the most comfortable night sleep, but if you put them in right you get that movie star huge locks of curls. I remembered my mom using these on me for my kindergarten school pictures so I decided to upgrade to the large foam rollers and I&#x27;m so glad I did! The beautiful waves with no heat. All you need is some damp hair and a nights sleep with some hair spray and you&#x27;re ready for a photo shoot!</li>
            <li> The rollers are too &amp;#34;loose&amp;#34; to hold their place.</li>
            <li> These curlers are perfect to provide longer hair enough body without being too curly.  They are ideal for rolling damp air before going to bed because they are soft and comfortable for sleeping.</li>
            <li> I really like the size of these rollers but the swing arm to secure my hair in place is flimsy; it pops out and doesn&#x27;t always stay in place.  I find myself reattaching the swing arm to the roller more than I want to.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time. They come apart as soon as you touch them</li>
            <li> A bit frustrating when the clip separates from the curler during the rolling process, but it&#x27;s not impossible to snap it back in, and they are definitely very comfortable and easy to sleep in.  The only negative I have is that with very long hair like mine, the curler is easily &amp;#34;crushed&amp;#34; in the center, resulting in irregular curls.  I think they would work best with permed or naturally curly hair and not straight hair such as mine.</li>
            <li> The plastic stem and clasp can come apart occasionally but can be rejoined easily.  The foam is firm.  The best truly jumbo sized foam rollers I have found so far.  Only 2&amp;#34; are larger.</li>
