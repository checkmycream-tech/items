            <li>As you can see this one is not and I am very pleased with that.</li>

            <li>Nice size brush to carry in purse.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and applies lipstick on perfectly.</li>
            <li>I am used to the kind that you take the lid off and slide the brush up.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this brush because it has a really nice cover that doesn&#x27;t come off in my makeup bag.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice compact size that fits well in my purse.  </li>
            <li>Helps keep thoese powty powtees, perfectly contoured, colored and ready.</li>
            <li>I liked that the brush has a cover</li>
            <li>Sigma is kind of the brand when it comes to brushes.</li>
            <li>They apply color well and blend nicely.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, soft and good sized brush applicator, excellent feeling.</li>
            <li>Great for quick lips on the go.</li>
            <li>Quick shipment and great price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used A LOT of lip brushes in my life, and this one is the best so far!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of a very light metal, so</li>
            <li>Nice carrying case too; fits easily into my makeup bag which fits into my purse.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t disappoint :)</li>
            <li>I have found there&#x27;s more than 1/2 inch of the lipstick below the rim.</li>
            <li>I also love that</li>
            <li>Really enjoy this thing!</li>
            <li>I love this lip brush.</li>
            <li>OK  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
            <li>price is okay, but on Amazon you can find better :).</li>
            <li>I love this brush, no shedding and I like how the cover is the extender for the brush.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought two of them.</li>
            <li>This is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have been able to line my lips with the tip.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that the bristles don&#x27;t come off on my lips.  </li>
            <li>I almost gave it 3 stars because of that, but I do love this brush</li>
            <li>Love that it is covered.  </li>
            <li>I have nothing more to say.</li>
            <li>Always want more of these.  </li>
            <li>I love this lip brush&lt;</li>
            <li>Nice and secure.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this brush.</li>
            <li>I am glad to have found online.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Ever i use this brush everday smooth application very nice good quality great.price nice design I will purchase another for back up</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anyone who prefers using a lip brush as it is an in between size which is great for most lips :)</li>
            <li>She said the brush itself applies her lipstick easily and the cover-turned-handle is most convenient.</li>
            <li>The cap stays on quite snuggly, so you can easily load the brush up with your lip color, pop the top on, then toss it in your purse.</li>
            <li>I can apply my lipstick a lot smoother and more precise</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m picky about brushes, but I&#x27;ve been happy with this one since the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>It worked well, was of good quality and was just what I wanted!I would highly reccomend this product to others!</li>
            <li>Because they are &amp;#34;covered&amp;#34; and have a lid, they are super easy to loss into your makeup bag!</li>
            <li>so you can easily adjust the handle length for your convenience.</li>
            <li>so the business end slides easily into the handle.</li>
            <li>The cover makes it easy to carry in the bag along with lipstick to re-apply when needed.</li>
            <li>Lipstick applied with a brush gives a more precision application and will last longer, especially if lightly disted with lose powder.  </li>
            <li>I like this brush, it it&#x27;s easy to use to apply it to your lips.</li>
            <li>Very nice bristles as well - soft and smooth on the lips.  </li>
            <li>It makes lipstick application easy and accurate.</li>
            <li>I think the cap fits fine.</li>
            <li>The bristles are fine, close together and well attached, and tapered so that it can be used for outlining.  </li>
            <li>The brush works fine.</li>
            <li>works fine for my needs.</li>
            <li>This pencil put lipstick on smoothly and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine for the price</li>
            <li>-super!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean with a dab of alcohol on a tissue, but it&#x27;s perfectly fine to use &amp; close up without cleaning the brush if you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
            <li>Allows me to apply a light layer and rub it in for longer-lasting color.</li>
            <li>so this brush allows me to precisely color in that area as well.</li>
            <li>You can really smooth the lip color on without caking.  </li>
            <li>Brushs are easy to clean and sturdy.</li>
            <li>The secure cover is highly important to me.</li>
            <li>It provides precise application of lipstick.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>However, I stumbled upon this one and decided for how cheap it was</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>Good sized brush head (sometimes they&#x27;re too skimpy, more like lip liners rather than lipstick brushes), well-constructed overall</li>
            <li>So far so good, will defiinitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>I made the mistake of buying this right away without browsing some more...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned and have to apply lip color with a brush if I don&#x27;t want it to be too dark for my complexion.</li>
            <li>Have so many lip glosses and lip balms that I love to use every last bit and this brush fit the job!</li>
            <li>I use it whenever I want to apply my red lipstick and it is really good and precise</li>
            <li>I have other good lip brushes, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Looks cool, too.</li>
            <li>This Revlon lip brush does quite well whether I want just a bit of a stain to my lips or full out</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t use it as much as another one I bought on Amazon that is more pointed.</li>
            <li>best for fine lipstick application and blending/buffing into the lips for a perfect application especially with strong and/or dark colors or matte lipsticks that are hard to work with.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend :-)</li>
            <li>This is a good little brush, handy size, brush is right thickness, and it really saves lipstick not to mention helping shape the lip line.</li>
            <li>The brush is soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s wide, unlike most lip brushes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a relatively good brush, but maybe because it&#x27;s too soft it doesn&#x27;t really pick up much color.</li>
            <li>This is a nice quality lip brush with a cover that slides over the entire brush.</li>
            <li>If you want  your makeup to look more professional, then you need all the right tools.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s compact, has soft bristles, gives a smooth application, and the cover keeps it clean and in shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>just right and risk damaging the brush.</li>
            <li>Just the right size, angle and stiffness.</li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>Great little lip liner brush, does the job it needs to do!</li>
            <li>My former lip brush was retractable before you covered it, making it very easy to slip on the cover without having to maneuver it</li>
            <li>This little brush is  amazing and makes a huge difference on how you apply  your lipstick.</li>
            <li>I had to buy a second one because this lip brush is so handy and works really well.  </li>
            <li>It is soft and accurate.  </li>
            <li>Try powdering your lips first for a more lasting effect.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and my lipstick goes on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>Have to put on many coats for the color to finally show up on my lips.</li>
            <li>Love this brush, especially for traveling!  </li>
            <li>As soon as I open it and use it with the same lipstick, it blends the creamy lipstick into my lips nicely and lasts all day!</li>
            <li>It works, I wish the bristles were a little bit stiffer to allow it to grab more lipstick at one time, but then it probably wouldn&#x27;t be as easy to use on your lips.</li>
            <li>Everyone makes it seem like this lip brush is super amazing, but it&#x27;s actually very average.</li>
            <li>It really does distribute my lipstick, gloss, or lip balm, evenly (not at all &amp;#34;gloopy&amp;#34;) across my lips.</li>
            <li>It applies my lipstick on evenly and it&#x27;s so tiny and easy to slip in my purse.</li>
            <li>I hope she finds it easy to use and wash so that she can use it with the multiple lipsticks that came in the set.</li>
            <li>I have had this a few months now and it is my FAVORITE lip brush!</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say about this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean off and it&#x27;s so tiny that I can put it in my purse with my lipstick and apply it later on if I need to.</li>
            <li>This has worked very well to save the remainder of the tube.  </li>
            <li>I really like the design</li>
            <li>It works very well with my lip stains, application is a breeze.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>its much cheaper-yeah!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And since the bristles are so wide, the sides get caught when you&#x27;re putting the top on and end up fraying out, so I had to cut those.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap plastic that can crack, it&#x27;s some kind of metal blend so very durable.</li>
            <li>However, I think its better for touch up than draw a precise liner due to the too soft tip.&lt;br /&gt;For who wants soft lip brush, this is a must have.</li>
            <li>I just find my other one to be more fluent process.  </li>
            <li>I have full lips and this definitely works like a charm for me.</li>
            <li>I prefer my Sephora brush because it is more compact and slightly easier to put together.  </li>
            <li>Having said all of that, this is a decent makeup brush.  </li>
            <li>Your Revlons, Maybellines and Cover Girls have been around for years because they put out decent products at decent prices.  </li>
            <li>The tube is kind of weird and the brush doesn&#x27;t really fit in, but that might just be me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this lip brush.</li>
            <li>The reversible cover makes for a nice long brush, and it is large enough so that you don&#x27;t have outside bristles getting bent when closing.</li>
            <li>so I will definitely be purchasing more of these in the near future.</li>
            <li>Had a Revlon retractable brush for over 10 years, finally had to give it up as the bristles pretty much</li>
            <li>but I can definitely say that this one is just right.</li>
            <li>I needed this for a new lip gloss I had made.  </li>
            <li>if didn&#x27;t live up to the hype I would just go for the Sigma one.</li>
            <li>The brush quality seems fine, but putting the cover on and off is not fun.  </li>
            <li>But for some who enjoy their firm lip brush like Real Techniques Retractable, you may skip this one.</li>
            <li>Finally found a lip brush with a protective&lt;br /&gt;Cover, that looks like I spent more $$$,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this little brush!</li>
            <li>Very soft yet focused bristles.</li>
            <li>I have had many lip brushes in the past.  </li>
            <li>It is so soft!</li>
            <li>The brush is easy to use and feels a little bit luxurious.</li>
            <li>This little thing is extremely useful especially when your favorite lipstick is running low and lets you apply the shade evenly on your lips.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the four stars are because it isn&#x27;t very convenient when it comes to placing the cover back over the brush.</li>
            <li>It is sturdy but soft on lips.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not messy because of the cap.</li>
            <li>I purchased a lip stick set as a Birthday gift for our 14 year old neighbor/babysitter and wanted to get her a lip brush to go with it since the set did not come with one.</li>
            <li>This brush has a soft, but thick lip brush and I love it.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are really nice and firm, so you can apply a really sharp and even line of color to your lips.</li>
            <li>Had tried other brands, but the bristles kept coming off on my lips as I&#x27;m applying my lipstick, and this was while they were pretty new, not even one year.  </li>
            <li>and then I  simply forgot to buy a new one - now I am wondering what was I thinking.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to carry around without adding any extra weight to something small like a clutch.</li>
            <li>its long and steady extention handle makes me feel like an artist doing a painting while I am just putting some balm on my lips.</li>
            <li>What I love about this lip brush is the flat, thick brush.</li>
            <li>For this price, a little care is worth the effort.</li>
            <li>I have purchased other lip brushes in the past and they were very fine tipped.</li>
            <li>The product is what you&#x27;d expect for a very inexpensive and portable lip liner.&lt;br /&gt;Downside: because the bristles do not retract and because its sheath length is long, lipstick is likely to smear to the inside of the sheath.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going Red and Lush.</li>
            <li>Have not had that problem with this brush so far, and it&#x27;s been several months.</li>
            <li>They are in a thin U shape that points at the top.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to compare to because I&#x27;ve only owned 1 other lip brush years ago...</li>
            <li>a lip brush to apply lipstick (apply once, drawing the outline of your lips and filling in carefully; blot; then re-apply) not only gives a&lt;br /&gt;gorgeous mouth, but it helps your lipstick to last literally HOURS longer than just going straight from the tube.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still as firm as it was the first day.</li>
            <li>It is very compact and since it does have a cover, should not make a mess in her makeup bag.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> As you can see this one is not and I am very pleased with that.</li>

            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Nice size brush to carry in purse.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and applies lipstick on perfectly.</li>
            <li> I am used to the kind that you take the lid off and slide the brush up.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this brush because it has a really nice cover that doesn&#x27;t come off in my makeup bag.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice compact size that fits well in my purse.  </li>
            <li> Helps keep thoese powty powtees, perfectly contoured, colored and ready.</li>
            <li> I liked that the brush has a cover</li>
            <li> Sigma is kind of the brand when it comes to brushes.</li>
            <li> They apply color well and blend nicely.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, soft and good sized brush applicator, excellent feeling.</li>
            <li> Great for quick lips on the go.</li>
            <li> Quick shipment and great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used A LOT of lip brushes in my life, and this one is the best so far!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of a very light metal, so</li>
            <li> Nice carrying case too; fits easily into my makeup bag which fits into my purse.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t disappoint :)</li>
            <li> I have found there&#x27;s more than 1/2 inch of the lipstick below the rim.</li>
            <li> I also love that</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this thing!</li>
            <li> I love this lip brush.</li>
            <li> OK  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
            <li> price is okay, but on Amazon you can find better :).</li>
            <li> I love this brush, no shedding and I like how the cover is the extender for the brush.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought two of them.</li>
            <li> This is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have been able to line my lips with the tip.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that the bristles don&#x27;t come off on my lips.  </li>
            <li> I almost gave it 3 stars because of that, but I do love this brush</li>
            <li> Love that it is covered.  </li>
            <li> I have nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> Always want more of these.  </li>
            <li> I love this lip brush&lt;</li>
            <li> Nice and secure.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this brush.</li>
            <li> I am glad to have found online.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Ever i use this brush everday smooth application very nice good quality great.price nice design I will purchase another for back up</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to anyone who prefers using a lip brush as it is an in between size which is great for most lips :)</li>
            <li> She said the brush itself applies her lipstick easily and the cover-turned-handle is most convenient.</li>
            <li> The cap stays on quite snuggly, so you can easily load the brush up with your lip color, pop the top on, then toss it in your purse.</li>
            <li> I can apply my lipstick a lot smoother and more precise</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m picky about brushes, but I&#x27;ve been happy with this one since the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> It worked well, was of good quality and was just what I wanted!I would highly reccomend this product to others!</li>
            <li> Because they are &amp;#34;covered&amp;#34; and have a lid, they are super easy to loss into your makeup bag!</li>
            <li> so you can easily adjust the handle length for your convenience.</li>
            <li> so the business end slides easily into the handle.</li>
            <li> The cover makes it easy to carry in the bag along with lipstick to re-apply when needed.</li>
            <li> Lipstick applied with a brush gives a more precision application and will last longer, especially if lightly disted with lose powder.  </li>
            <li> I like this brush, it it&#x27;s easy to use to apply it to your lips.</li>
            <li> Very nice bristles as well - soft and smooth on the lips.  </li>
            <li> It makes lipstick application easy and accurate.</li>
            <li> I think the cap fits fine.</li>
            <li> The bristles are fine, close together and well attached, and tapered so that it can be used for outlining.  </li>
            <li> The brush works fine.</li>
            <li> works fine for my needs.</li>
            <li> This pencil put lipstick on smoothly and is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine for the price</li>
            <li> -super!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean with a dab of alcohol on a tissue, but it&#x27;s perfectly fine to use &amp; close up without cleaning the brush if you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
            <li> Allows me to apply a light layer and rub it in for longer-lasting color.</li>
            <li> so this brush allows me to precisely color in that area as well.</li>
            <li> You can really smooth the lip color on without caking.  </li>
            <li> Brushs are easy to clean and sturdy.</li>
            <li> The secure cover is highly important to me.</li>
            <li> It provides precise application of lipstick.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> However, I stumbled upon this one and decided for how cheap it was</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Good sized brush head (sometimes they&#x27;re too skimpy, more like lip liners rather than lipstick brushes), well-constructed overall</li>
            <li> So far so good, will defiinitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of buying this right away without browsing some more...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned and have to apply lip color with a brush if I don&#x27;t want it to be too dark for my complexion.</li>
            <li> Have so many lip glosses and lip balms that I love to use every last bit and this brush fit the job!</li>
            <li> I use it whenever I want to apply my red lipstick and it is really good and precise</li>
            <li> I have other good lip brushes, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Looks cool, too.</li>
            <li> This Revlon lip brush does quite well whether I want just a bit of a stain to my lips or full out</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t use it as much as another one I bought on Amazon that is more pointed.</li>
            <li> best for fine lipstick application and blending/buffing into the lips for a perfect application especially with strong and/or dark colors or matte lipsticks that are hard to work with.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend :-)</li>
            <li> This is a good little brush, handy size, brush is right thickness, and it really saves lipstick not to mention helping shape the lip line.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s wide, unlike most lip brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a relatively good brush, but maybe because it&#x27;s too soft it doesn&#x27;t really pick up much color.</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality lip brush with a cover that slides over the entire brush.</li>
            <li> If you want  your makeup to look more professional, then you need all the right tools.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, has soft bristles, gives a smooth application, and the cover keeps it clean and in shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> just right and risk damaging the brush.</li>
            <li> Just the right size, angle and stiffness.</li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> Great little lip liner brush, does the job it needs to do!</li>
            <li> My former lip brush was retractable before you covered it, making it very easy to slip on the cover without having to maneuver it</li>
            <li> This little brush is  amazing and makes a huge difference on how you apply  your lipstick.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a second one because this lip brush is so handy and works really well.  </li>
            <li> It is soft and accurate.  </li>
            <li> Try powdering your lips first for a more lasting effect.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and my lipstick goes on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> Have to put on many coats for the color to finally show up on my lips.</li>
            <li> Love this brush, especially for traveling!  </li>
            <li> As soon as I open it and use it with the same lipstick, it blends the creamy lipstick into my lips nicely and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> It works, I wish the bristles were a little bit stiffer to allow it to grab more lipstick at one time, but then it probably wouldn&#x27;t be as easy to use on your lips.</li>
            <li> Everyone makes it seem like this lip brush is super amazing, but it&#x27;s actually very average.</li>
            <li> It really does distribute my lipstick, gloss, or lip balm, evenly (not at all &amp;#34;gloopy&amp;#34;) across my lips.</li>
            <li> It applies my lipstick on evenly and it&#x27;s so tiny and easy to slip in my purse.</li>
            <li> I hope she finds it easy to use and wash so that she can use it with the multiple lipsticks that came in the set.</li>
            <li> I have had this a few months now and it is my FAVORITE lip brush!</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean off and it&#x27;s so tiny that I can put it in my purse with my lipstick and apply it later on if I need to.</li>
            <li> This has worked very well to save the remainder of the tube.  </li>
            <li> I really like the design</li>
            <li> It works very well with my lip stains, application is a breeze.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> its much cheaper-yeah!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> And since the bristles are so wide, the sides get caught when you&#x27;re putting the top on and end up fraying out, so I had to cut those.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap plastic that can crack, it&#x27;s some kind of metal blend so very durable.</li>
            <li> However, I think its better for touch up than draw a precise liner due to the too soft tip.&lt;br /&gt;For who wants soft lip brush, this is a must have.</li>
            <li> I just find my other one to be more fluent process.  </li>
            <li> I have full lips and this definitely works like a charm for me.</li>
            <li> I prefer my Sephora brush because it is more compact and slightly easier to put together.  </li>
            <li> Having said all of that, this is a decent makeup brush.  </li>
            <li> Your Revlons, Maybellines and Cover Girls have been around for years because they put out decent products at decent prices.  </li>
            <li> The tube is kind of weird and the brush doesn&#x27;t really fit in, but that might just be me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting this lip brush.</li>
            <li> The reversible cover makes for a nice long brush, and it is large enough so that you don&#x27;t have outside bristles getting bent when closing.</li>
            <li> so I will definitely be purchasing more of these in the near future.</li>
            <li> Had a Revlon retractable brush for over 10 years, finally had to give it up as the bristles pretty much</li>
            <li> but I can definitely say that this one is just right.</li>
            <li> I needed this for a new lip gloss I had made.  </li>
            <li> if didn&#x27;t live up to the hype I would just go for the Sigma one.</li>
            <li> The brush quality seems fine, but putting the cover on and off is not fun.  </li>
            <li> But for some who enjoy their firm lip brush like Real Techniques Retractable, you may skip this one.</li>
            <li> Finally found a lip brush with a protective&lt;br /&gt;Cover, that looks like I spent more $$$,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this little brush!</li>
            <li> Very soft yet focused bristles.</li>
            <li> I have had many lip brushes in the past.  </li>
            <li> It is so soft!</li>
            <li> The brush is easy to use and feels a little bit luxurious.</li>
            <li> This little thing is extremely useful especially when your favorite lipstick is running low and lets you apply the shade evenly on your lips.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the four stars are because it isn&#x27;t very convenient when it comes to placing the cover back over the brush.</li>
            <li> It is sturdy but soft on lips.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not messy because of the cap.</li>
            <li> I purchased a lip stick set as a Birthday gift for our 14 year old neighbor/babysitter and wanted to get her a lip brush to go with it since the set did not come with one.</li>
            <li> This brush has a soft, but thick lip brush and I love it.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are really nice and firm, so you can apply a really sharp and even line of color to your lips.</li>
            <li> Had tried other brands, but the bristles kept coming off on my lips as I&#x27;m applying my lipstick, and this was while they were pretty new, not even one year.  </li>
            <li> and then I  simply forgot to buy a new one - now I am wondering what was I thinking.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to carry around without adding any extra weight to something small like a clutch.</li>
            <li> its long and steady extention handle makes me feel like an artist doing a painting while I am just putting some balm on my lips.</li>
            <li> What I love about this lip brush is the flat, thick brush.</li>
            <li> For this price, a little care is worth the effort.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other lip brushes in the past and they were very fine tipped.</li>
            <li> The product is what you&#x27;d expect for a very inexpensive and portable lip liner.&lt;br /&gt;Downside: because the bristles do not retract and because its sheath length is long, lipstick is likely to smear to the inside of the sheath.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going Red and Lush.</li>
            <li> Have not had that problem with this brush so far, and it&#x27;s been several months.</li>
            <li> They are in a thin U shape that points at the top.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to compare to because I&#x27;ve only owned 1 other lip brush years ago...</li>
            <li> a lip brush to apply lipstick (apply once, drawing the outline of your lips and filling in carefully; blot; then re-apply) not only gives a&lt;br /&gt;gorgeous mouth, but it helps your lipstick to last literally HOURS longer than just going straight from the tube.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still as firm as it was the first day.</li>
            <li> It is very compact and since it does have a cover, should not make a mess in her makeup bag.</li>
            <li> However, I find that I can only use this on my inner lips, as the brush is too wide to fill in the outer lip area (but why would I want a brush for the inner lips and then a separate to line the outside?</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very soft yet firm enough to evenly spread my gloss/lipstick</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that you need to be careful when putting the cover back over the brush or you will potentially damage the bristles.  </li>
            <li> It is but it won&#x27;t last for long, either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily cleaned by wiping with tissue, and the cover fits tightly, so it&#x27;s unlikely to fall off.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft, but still stiff enough to add that control I need to &amp;#34;color in&amp;#34; my lips.</li>
            <li> I love the thick bristles as opposed to other &amp;#34;skinny&amp;#34; bristles I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  </li>
            <li> My former lip brush had a small tapered brush that was too soft and flexible and applying lipstick was a pain.</li>
            <li> Not long and bulky like other lip brushes,</li>
            <li> When you put it together the stick is too long.</li>
            <li> That has made it work conveniently for a few months, so far.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had it for long.</li>
            <li> The casing was a little bit of a hassle at first until I realized all I had to do was slide it all the way down over the little ridge at the bottom and BAM.</li>
            <li> When you take the cap off, you can attach it to the other end of the brush to make it long.</li>
            <li> Bristle is firm yet softer from the middle to the tip</li>
            <li> This is a lip brush, which works just as expected, arrived sooner than I expected, and is quite satisfactory.</li>
            <li> so I can apply with one swipe unlike smaller thinner brushes that need a few swipes.</li>
            <li> just what she expected</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to have to be careful with something like this.  </li>
            <li> Lip brushed can be so expensive, and I refuse to pay those high prices.  </li>
            <li> The review questions are a little odd as this doesn&#x27;t contain any color - it&#x27;s only a brush.</li>
            <li> Another thing when I introduced the brush inside the tube younhave to be very careful otherwise the bristles will bend.</li>
            <li> I bought this because a nearly new tube of lipstick had been broken inside the tube, so it couldn&#x27;t be scrolled upward.  </li>
            <li> My only negative comment is that you have to be very careful putting the cap on.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected and does not leave little brush hairs all over my lips or lipstick.  </li>
            <li> But otherwise, in terms of coverage and the feel of the brush, it&#x27;s below average.</li>
            <li> The cap fits on tight so it doesn&#x27;t come off in your purse.  </li>
            <li> I use it all the time and now it is has become a staple in my everyday makeup routine.</li>
            <li> It bristles are firm.  </li>
            <li> Firm brush that comes with a handle extender that doubles as a cover.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are firm without being harsh on your lips.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this brush so I could get all the product out of my lipstick tubes.  Works great and I have no problems with it.</li>
            <li> Perfect and does the job a great lip brush for the price.</li>
            <li> I used to have one of these years back and then I  simply forgot to buy a new one - now I am wondering what was I thinking. This little brush is  amazing and makes a huge difference on how you apply  your lipstick. If you want  your makeup to look more professional, then you need all the right tools. Simple as that!</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about this product. I use it all the time and now it is has become a staple in my everyday makeup routine. They don&#x27;t disappoint :)</li>
            <li> I am a bit disappointed in the brush and how it applies the lipstick.</li>
            <li> Everything is as described. This brush looks expensive and well made. The brush itself is 3.5&amp;#34;, extend to 7.5&amp;#34; with the cap snap on the bottom so you can easily adjust the handle length for your convenience. Bristle is firm yet softer from the middle to the tip what help its being sturdy yet stil flexible. However, I think its better for touch up than draw a precise liner due to the too soft tip.&lt;br /&gt;For who wants soft lip brush, this is a must have. But for some who enjoy their firm lip brush like Real Techniques Retractable, you may skip this one. At all, its a happy purchase for me, at this price I have a sleek brush which works well at home and awesome to carry in purse, nothing to complain ðŸ˜Š</li>
            <li> Nice size brush to carry in purse.  I&#x27;m using it to finish up tube lipstick.  I have found there&#x27;s more than 1/2 inch of the lipstick below the rim.</li>
            <li> I like this. Allows me to apply a light layer and rub it in for longer-lasting color. Also reaches the last bits of lipstick.  I have a scar on my lip so this brush allows me to precisely color in that area as well.</li>
            <li> Good sized brush head (sometimes they&#x27;re too skimpy, more like lip liners rather than lipstick brushes), well-constructed overall so the business end slides easily into the handle. Easy to clean with a dab of alcohol on a tissue, but it&#x27;s perfectly fine to use &amp; close up without cleaning the brush if you&#x27;re in a rush. Love It!</li>
            <li> I love the thick bristles as opposed to other &amp;#34;skinny&amp;#34; bristles I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  You can really smooth the lip color on without caking.  Try powdering your lips first for a more lasting effect.  Nice carrying case too; fits easily into my makeup bag which fits into my purse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect size and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. It&#x27;s easy to clean off and it&#x27;s so tiny that I can put it in my purse with my lipstick and apply it later on if I need to. The cap is the best part because I don&#x27;t have to worry about the lipstick that was on the brush smearing on to something in my purse. I can apply my lipstick a lot smoother and more precise and then I just put the cap on and toss it in my purse in case I need it later.</li>
            <li> Terrible lip brush. The hairs do not hold together</li>
            <li> Great lip brush. You get what you pay for. Great price and product</li>
            <li> Have so many lip glosses and lip balms that I love to use every last bit and this brush fit the job!</li>
            <li> Wonderful brush!  Delivers lipstick perfectly and precisely.  Unlike another reviewer, I don&#x27;t find it at all hard to re-cap this without damaging or bending the brush fibers.  Just pay attention when you put the cap back on.  It isn&#x27;t hard at all.  Perfect, perfect lip brush!  I also love that&lt;br /&gt;using a lip brush to apply lipstick (apply once, drawing the outline of your lips and filling in carefully; blot; then re-apply) not only gives a&lt;br /&gt;gorgeous mouth, but it helps your lipstick to last literally HOURS longer than just going straight from the tube.  Inexpensive, well made,&lt;br /&gt;non-shedding:  best ever!</li>
            <li> Great brush. Very soft yet focused bristles. I received it in 24 hours!!! I think the cap fits fine. Treat any brush with TLC. Unlike another brand for 3 1/2 times the price that I ordered 2 months ago and still hasn&#x27;t arrived.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used A LOT of lip brushes in my life, and this one is the best so far! Very comfortable, soft and good sized brush applicator, excellent feeling. Looks cool, too. its long and steady extention handle makes me feel like an artist doing a painting while I am just putting some balm on my lips. Really enjoy this thing!</li>
            <li> It applies my lipstick on evenly and it&#x27;s so tiny and easy to slip in my purse.</li>
            <li> So far so good, will defiinitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this lip brush. It makes lipstick application easy and accurate. The brush is soft and easy to clean. The cover makes it easy to carry in the bag along with lipstick to re-apply when needed.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas stocking gift for Sis and she is so happy with it! She said the brush itself applies her lipstick easily and the cover-turned-handle is most convenient. The price and ease of ordering was great for me.  Overall -super!</li>
            <li> This lip brush is the perfect size, easy to use and a great value.  It was just as pictured and arrived prior to schedule.Brushs are easy to clean and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Finally found a lip brush with a protective&lt;br /&gt;Cover, that looks like I spent more $$$,&lt;br /&gt;than I did. I need to order more,for myself&lt;br /&gt;And gifts to add along with either lip pots or lipsticks. Try to find them with covers&lt;br /&gt;that actually stay on. Great find!</li>
            <li> I use it whenever I want to apply my red lipstick and it is really good and precise</li>
            <li> I especially like the ease of which the brush outlines my lips. The secure cover is highly important to me.</li>
            <li> I thought this was an ordinary lip brush with bristles.  This has a foam tip.  Other reviewers mention bristles so perhaps I received the wrong item.</li>
            <li> Lipstick applied with a brush gives a more precision application and will last longer, especially if lightly disted with lose powder.  Having said all of that, this is a decent makeup brush.  The only drawback is that you need to be careful when putting the cover back over the brush or you will potentially damage the bristles.  For this price, a little care is worth the effort.</li>
            <li> The product is what you&#x27;d expect for a very inexpensive and portable lip liner.&lt;br /&gt;Downside: because the bristles do not retract and because its sheath length is long, lipstick is likely to smear to the inside of the sheath. However, the bristle hairs do not seem to fray or fall out and the shape of the head is conducive to detail lip work.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other lip brushes in the past and they were very fine tipped. As you can see this one is not and I am very pleased with that. It&#x27;s easy to clean and applies lipstick on perfectly.</li>
            <li> OK  But the length will take some getting used to.</li>
            <li> Great for quick lips on the go. Not long and bulky like other lip brushes,</li>
            <li> Your Revlons, Maybellines and Cover Girls have been around for years because they put out decent products at decent prices.  This is a good little brush, handy size, brush is right thickness, and it really saves lipstick not to mention helping shape the lip line.</li>
            <li> I like this brush, it it&#x27;s easy to use to apply it to your lips. I hate wasting the end of the tube so this is what I wanted it for. It works, I wish the bristles were a little bit stiffer to allow it to grab more lipstick at one time, but then it probably wouldn&#x27;t be as easy to use on your lips. For me, it fits my purpose so I&#x27;m okay with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because a nearly new tube of lipstick had been broken inside the tube, so it couldn&#x27;t be scrolled upward.  This has worked very well to save the remainder of the tube.  The bristles are fine, close together and well attached, and tapered so that it can be used for outlining.  It&#x27;s easily cleaned by wiping with tissue, and the cover fits tightly, so it&#x27;s unlikely to fall off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush! Have had it for years and it&#x27;s still as firm as it was the first day. I love that it&#x27;s wide, unlike most lip brushes. I have full lips and this definitely works like a charm for me.</li>
            <li> Everyone makes it seem like this lip brush is super amazing, but it&#x27;s actually very average. It&#x27;s not longer than the size of my finger. The tube is kind of weird and the brush doesn&#x27;t really fit in, but that might just be me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is okay, but on Amazon you can find better :). If you are looking for a travel convenient brush that has a wacky &amp;#34;&amp;#34;covering&amp;#34;&amp;#34; then this is perfect! But otherwise, in terms of coverage and the feel of the brush, it&#x27;s below average. I made the mistake of buying this right away without browsing some more...</li>
            <li> The only con is the lid. I am used to the kind that you take the lid off and slide the brush up. It&#x27;s no big deal though.  The brush works fine.</li>
            <li> This was just what I had been looking for. It is compact &amp; fits well into small purses &amp; even pockets.  You can load the brush so you have lipstick for touch ups without having to carry the bulky lipstick tube with you. Great item &amp; great price.</li>
            <li> This lip brush is great. Works perfectly. It&#x27;s soft and my lipstick goes on smoothly and evenly. I highly recommend getting this lip brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a relatively good brush, but maybe because it&#x27;s too soft it doesn&#x27;t really pick up much color. Have to put on many coats for the color to finally show up on my lips.</li>
            <li> This brush has a soft, but thick lip brush and I love it.  I put a liner on my lips prior to using the brush as I like the effect of the liner.  I would recommend this brush because it has a really nice cover that doesn&#x27;t come off in my makeup bag.  Try it - I promise you will like it!!</li>
            <li> I love this brush, no shedding and I like how the cover is the extender for the brush. I really like the design</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice lip brush at a good price.  Works as expected and does not leave little brush hairs all over my lips or lipstick.  Would buy again if I needed another.</li>
            <li> This is not a lip color, so the questions with which the review is prompting me do not apply.  This is a lip brush, which works just as expected, arrived sooner than I expected, and is quite satisfactory.</li>
            <li> works fine for my needs.</li>
            <li> I needed a travel sized lip brush that i could enclose when not in use to throw in my purse.  This does the job perfectly, and is pretty good for applying lip products.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush at a good price. It works very well with my lip stains, application is a breeze. Very impressed. Glad I bought two of them.</li>
            <li> I have had many lip brushes in the past.  This is definitely my favorite. It bristles are firm.  They are in a thin U shape that points at the top.  I have been able to line my lips with the tip.  My only negative comment is that you have to be very careful putting the cap on.  I have some bristles sticking out on the side that won&#x27;t straighten out.</li>
            <li> It worked well, was of good quality and was just what I wanted!I would highly reccomend this product to others!</li>
            <li> Great little lip liner brush, does the job it needs to do!</li>
            <li> It works the way it should.  I love the fact that the bristles don&#x27;t come off on my lips.  It is soft and accurate.  I haven&#x27;t found recapping to be a problem at all.  I have fully functional hands and it hasn&#x27;t been a problem.</li>
            <li> Firm brush that comes with a handle extender that doubles as a cover.  Love this brush, especially for traveling!  Brush hasn&#x27;t lost it&#x27;s shape yet, and is quite durable.</li>
            <li> What I love about this lip brush is the flat, thick brush. It really does distribute my lipstick, gloss, or lip balm, evenly (not at all &amp;#34;gloopy&amp;#34;) across my lips. The brush is soft, but still stiff enough to add that control I need to &amp;#34;color in&amp;#34; my lips. My former lip brush had a small tapered brush that was too soft and flexible and applying lipstick was a pain. This Revlon lip brush does quite well whether I want just a bit of a stain to my lips or full out I&#x27;m going Red and Lush. The cover protects the brush so that I can toss it in my drawer, make-up case, or even in my pocket. I&#x27;ve even applied a bit of lipstick to the brush, covered it, and then applied that lipstick later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the four stars are because it isn&#x27;t very convenient when it comes to placing the cover back over the brush. My former lip brush was retractable before you covered it, making it very easy to slip on the cover without having to maneuver it just right and risk damaging the brush. So this is a bit of a flaw in the design of the product. I almost gave it 3 stars because of that, but I do love this brush so four stars it is!</li>
            <li> Great lip brush.  Love that it is covered.  Very nice bristles as well - soft and smooth on the lips.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a good lip brush.</li>
            <li> This pencil put lipstick on smoothly and is easy to handle. I have nothing more to say. I completed the review.</li>
            <li> I give 4 stars because I want bigger brush hair painting.</li>
            <li> When you put it together the stick is too long. I would like a shorter stick. Another thing when I introduced the brush inside the tube younhave to be very careful otherwise the bristles will bend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s compact, has soft bristles, gives a smooth application, and the cover keeps it clean and in shape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this little brush! It is sturdy but soft on lips. It doesn&#x27;t shed any bristles. It travels well in my purse with the cap staying in place.</li>
            <li> I needed this for a new lip gloss I had made.  This is a nice compact size that fits well in my purse.  Quick shipment and great price.</li>
            <li> Helps keep thoese powty powtees, perfectly contoured, colored and ready. thanks.</li>
            <li> very nice tip; 5 stars for retractable</li>
            <li> Very happy with it. It&#x27;s great for traveling but I also like that I can put it in my makeup drawer and it&#x27;s not messy because of the cap.</li>
            <li> I personally have not used this lip brush. I purchased a lip stick set as a Birthday gift for our 14 year old neighbor/babysitter and wanted to get her a lip brush to go with it since the set did not come with one. I liked that the brush has a cover and it did get good reviews. It is very compact and since it does have a cover, should not make a mess in her makeup bag. I hope she finds it easy to use and wash so that she can use it with the multiple lipsticks that came in the set.</li>
            <li> Always want more of these.  Don&#x27;t know how I lose them.</li>
            <li> product is as advertised. It provides precise application of lipstick.  I prefer my Sephora brush because it is more compact and slightly easier to put together.  This is not at all difficult to put together...I just find my other one to be more fluent process.  This definitely works and I keep it in my purse for daily touch ups.</li>
            <li> Excellent value for the money.</li>
            <li> I love this lip brush&lt;br /&gt;It is comparable to MAC lip brush that is two part as well&lt;br /&gt;And its much cheaper-yeah!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone who prefers using a lip brush as it is an in between size which is great for most lips :)</li>
            <li> Just the right size, angle and stiffness. The reversible cover makes for a nice long brush, and it is large enough so that you don&#x27;t have outside bristles getting bent when closing. Will probably buy another.</li>
            <li> excellent lip brush, think and smooth - perfect for heavier type lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;Unbelievably fast delivery and good packaging.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to compare to because I&#x27;ve only owned 1 other lip brush years ago...but I can definitely say that this one is just right. It doesn&#x27;t shed at all, it&#x27;s very soft yet firm enough to evenly spread my gloss/lipstick and it&#x27;s easy to clean. The casing was a little bit of a hassle at first until I realized all I had to do was slide it all the way down over the little ridge at the bottom and BAM. Nice and secure. I have a lipstick palette with about 36 different colors so I will definitely be purchasing more of these in the near future. Highly recommend :-)</li>
            <li> I love it. It doesn&#x27;t bother me that it doesn&#x27;t retract, though that&#x27;s the type I used to use. Very nice bristle.</li>
            <li> This is a nice quality lip brush with a cover that slides over the entire brush. No more messes in my purse from lip brush lids that don&#x27;t stay on! Also, it&#x27;s a thick brush so I can apply with one swipe unlike smaller thinner brushes that need a few swipes.</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of these lip brushes.  They are well made, no brush hairs are left on the lip. The cap fits on tight so it doesn&#x27;t come off in your purse.  I would definitely recommend this brush.</li>
            <li> I never know that using different tools make such a big difference! I was using a clinique lip brush that came with the lip gloss until the bristle started to fall off one by one everytime I apply lipstick. So, I was looking on amazon and decided to try this one. As soon as I open it and use it with the same lipstick, it blends the creamy lipstick into my lips nicely and lasts all day! The lipstick blends and absorb into my lips. I am very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Best Bush Ever i use this brush everday smooth application very nice good quality great.price nice design I will purchase another for back up</li>
            <li> I read about this item from one of those beauty magazines and searched the stores for it but couldn&#x27;t find it.  I was very glad that Amazon carried the item and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  This little thing is extremely useful especially when your favorite lipstick is running low and lets you apply the shade evenly on your lips.  It even comes with a cover!</li>
            <li> just what she expected</li>
            <li> I love this brush. I have other good lip brushes, but this is my favorite. I am glad to have found online. It is not in my drug store.</li>
            <li> I almost shelled out $20+ on a Sigma lip brush, as we all know Sigma is kind of the brand when it comes to brushes. However, I stumbled upon this one and decided for how cheap it was I would try it and if didn&#x27;t live up to the hype I would just go for the Sigma one. I have had this a few months now and it is my FAVORITE lip brush! It has help up to washing, and everyday use! It is so soft! I know a few people complained about the cap but I have had 0 issues with it!&lt;br /&gt;This is seriously a great brush and a must have for any collection!</li>
            <li> I wanted a lip brush that could travel in my purse. I&#x27;m very fair skinned and have to apply lip color with a brush if I don&#x27;t want it to be too dark for my complexion. I&#x27;m picky about brushes, but I&#x27;ve been happy with this one since the bristles are soft. They apply color well and blend nicely.</li>
            <li> I had to buy a second one because this lip brush is so handy and works really well.  I keep one in my makeup bag and one in the bathroom cabinet.  It&#x27;s not cheap plastic that can crack, it&#x27;s some kind of metal blend so very durable.</li>
            <li> Lip brushed can be so expensive, and I refuse to pay those high prices.  I bought two of these on Amazon, and they are very nice.  Do what they are supposed to do without paying a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! I bought 3 and I&#x27;m glad I did. Because they are &amp;#34;covered&amp;#34; and have a lid, they are super easy to loss into your makeup bag! GREAT BUY!!</li>
            <li> Very nice quality and feel.  Works great for my needs.</li>
            <li> The brush is easy to use and feels a little bit luxurious. The cover on mine didn&#x27;t stay on the back of the brush to serve as a handle, so I put two tiny dots of nail polish on the detent ring. That has made it work conveniently for a few months, so far.</li>
            <li> Compact. When you take the cap off, you can attach it to the other end of the brush to make it long. Love it.</li>
            <li> Had a Revlon retractable brush for over 10 years, finally had to give it up as the bristles pretty much were almost all gone.  Had tried other brands, but the bristles kept coming off on my lips as I&#x27;m applying my lipstick, and this was while they were pretty new, not even one year.  Have not had that problem with this brush so far, and it&#x27;s been several months.</li>
            <li> Brush is good for traveling and applied lipstick. I bought two and it&#x27;s great. I always have one with me.</li>
            <li> The brush quality seems fine, but putting the cover on and off is not fun.  Actually, it&#x27;s the on part that is awkard: you have to aim it just right or you end up hitting the bristles with the edge of the cover.  I don&#x27;t want to have to be careful with something like this.  Arghh.</li>
            <li> Every lady should have one lipstick brush, at least.  This little brush allows me to get at the last vestiges of my expensive lipsticks, saving me a bunch of money because I don&#x27;t have to replenish them so often.  Also, of course, creates a perfect line, which is the purpose of these things anyway.  I love it!</li>
            <li> great lip brush! best for fine lipstick application and blending/buffing into the lips for a perfect application especially with strong and/or dark colors or matte lipsticks that are hard to work with. the cap prevents lipstick from drying out on the brush AND the lip products from getting all over everything. also allows for travel to slip into your purse, small and portable. a great value!</li>
            <li> The review questions are a little odd as this doesn&#x27;t contain any color - it&#x27;s only a brush. The bristles are really nice and firm, so you can apply a really sharp and even line of color to your lips. The cap stays on quite snuggly, so you can easily load the brush up with your lip color, pop the top on, then toss it in your purse. It&#x27;s made of a very light metal, so it&#x27;s easy to carry around without adding any extra weight to something small like a clutch.</li>
            <li> The bristles are firm without being harsh on your lips. The brush itself is compact, so it&#x27;s perfect to carry around in your purse. However, I find that I can only use this on my inner lips, as the brush is too wide to fill in the outer lip area (but why would I want a brush for the inner lips and then a separate to line the outside? I don&#x27;t.). And since the bristles are so wide, the sides get caught when you&#x27;re putting the top on and end up fraying out, so I had to cut those. It&#x27;s fine for the price but I don&#x27;t use it as much as another one I bought on Amazon that is more pointed.</li>
            <li> The brush is not holding its form but hairs are sticking sideways already and I haven&#x27;t had it for long. It&#x27;s cheap. I bought it because of the cover. I thought it would be convenient to carry around in a purse. It is but it won&#x27;t last for long, either.</li>
