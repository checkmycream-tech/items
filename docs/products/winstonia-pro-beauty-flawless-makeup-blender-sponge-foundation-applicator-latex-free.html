            <li>This one was good quality.</li>
            <li>She said it works just as good as her others that she had purchased in a department store.</li>
            <li>so of course I had to see if the knock off cheapies work just as good...</li>
            <li>Heard about this on You Tube everyone gave good reviews</li>
            <li>helps give good coverage without making the face look cakey.</li>
            <li>Very handy and gives a nice finish.</li>

            <li>It makes my makeup go on quick and flawless without streaks like a brush.  </li>

            <li>Makes for a really nice finish.</li>
            <li>You cant just wring it out nicely like the blender.</li>
            <li>I own a sponge made by Soho beauty that I purchased from Walgreens</li>
            <li>but this blender made it look smooth and covered very  nicely.</li>
            <li>Very soft and blends makeup flawlessly or</li>
            <li>It blended my foundation, concealer and cream blush flawlessly, and fixed all cakey bits.</li>
            <li>It helps best in covering my blemishes and I have adult acne.</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite tools in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li>Like most, I looked for a way to buy a blender at a cheaper price--of course being offered as an add-on made this an even better deal.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Beauty Blender and fell in love like everyone else</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s def one of my favorite sponges</li>
            <li>I got a beauty blender for my birthday from my friend and I was in love.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone :-)</li>
            <li>I love this item.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found these</li>
            <li>You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m sure amazon does too.)</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I have better make up days now because of this thing.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product and it blends my makeup better than a sponge or a makeup brush.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this sponge considering the price.</li>
            <li>Love this product .</li>
            <li>Love using a beauty blender when I am not using my foundation brush....blends the foundation so well...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite way to apply foundation and concealer.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>cheap!</li>
            <li>This beauty sponge works pretty good.</li>
            <li>From what I remember the OBB is more spongy and porous and did a good job, but I had to smooooth it out more gently.  </li>
            <li>This beauty blender is pretty good...</li>
            <li>very easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>and it is easy to use .</li>
            <li>I was pleased with how quickly this was shipped out to me.</li>
            <li>I have yet to try the beauty blender, but this is a perfect use for everyday makeup...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it is cheaply made at all</li>
            <li>It is really easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>After wetting it and letting it thoroughly soak through, I wrung it out and used it right away with my favorite foundation.</li>
            <li>+  for the original BB.  </li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure to order this blender since I heard</li>
            <li>I think I like it better than the real thing, because it&#x27;s more of a soft and fine memory foam.  </li>
            <li>I actually bought mine from TJMaxx for only $5 and it works great!</li>
            <li>it helps tremendously when it comes to applying foundation.</li>
            <li>Shipping was super quick and the two I purchased came with no complications.</li>
            <li>This product is not only easy to use but easy to clean!</li>
            <li>Leaves my foundation looking amazing and smooth...so easy to use :) a must have now for my everyday makeup routine!</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised at how nice it is - no weird smell, doesn&#x27;t fall apart -</li>
            <li>so your product won&#x27;t get too absorbed into the sponge (IMO)</li>
            <li>I do use the solid cleanser that is made by Beauty Blender, it seems to clean better than a liquid.  </li>
            <li>but I use it when wanting full coverage of a very pigmented makeup</li>
            <li>It came super fast.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what was described.</li>
            <li>I prefer a flat top brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll get bigger in size after one or two uses and it gives me a nice natural finish.</li>
            <li>So cheap and does the exact same thing as the beauty blender.</li>
            <li>It is nice and soft, more than doubles in size when wet and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>Save your money for the real deal and buy some of these cheap ones for back up in an emergency.</li>
            <li>well, I haven&#x27;t use the real beauty blender and now that I have this sponge</li>
            <li>Arrived really fast</li>
            <li>, I suggest Real Techniques sponge by the Chapman sisters of Pixiwoo.</li>
            <li>it was shipped fast</li>
            <li>that one is much softer and less....painful.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of it</li>
            <li>I was going to repurchase the beauty blender until i saw how expensive it was; I didn&#x27;t care, I loved it!</li>
            <li>I have only tried the original beauty blender (OBB)</li>
            <li>I have never used the original, but my daughter has and this is quite similar for 1/4 the cost.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that I like this one better than the other blender.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that my makeup has ever looked better!</li>
            <li>but I just like the feel of this one better than the other two.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for such a small price.</li>
            <li>But, so far, I much prefer blending concealer and foundation with a sponge to using my hand or a brush!</li>
            <li>Although, I may first try something else that I have at home that is natural.</li>
            <li>The sponge itself is hard even after application of water and does not leave as airbrushed look as the original &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; It also does not wash easily</li>
            <li>It is better than some of the more expensive sponges I have owned.</li>
            <li>would older it again...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not nearly as soft as the original</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews on this product, I had high expectations about it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Mainly to see if it gets better than this little gem.</li>
            <li>They work better if you just get them a little damp before you squeeze the H20 out.</li>
            <li>I am going to fall victim to the hype and splurge on the original BB.</li>
            <li>Before i discovered this product, I always used to use brushes to blend out my foundation which i found just exfoliated my dry spots and made it more noticable and gross.</li>
            <li>When u first buy it, it&#x27;s hard, dense, and small, but if u run it under warm water and squeeze out the excess, it gets huge and soft.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve only used my hand soap and water which really doesn&#x27;t remove much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s barely usable, but I wish I had just spent the money on the original.</li>
            <li>I am a little concerned about how much product is being absorbed into the sponge.</li>
            <li>It was much softer than a $10 eye shaped one I got from a drug store that felt like an actual kitchen sponge and broke apart.</li>
            <li>it expands, its soft and blends out your foundation just like a beatyblender would.</li>
            <li>None of them that I have tried do so far.</li>
            <li>So far I have used this product 3 times.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The texture is totally different and it&#x27;s harder to clean and get water out of it.</li>
            <li>Ive had this one for a long time, probably 8 months, its very durable,</li>
            <li>Very soft, not hard compared to other beauty sponge brands.</li>
            <li>considering I didn&#x27;t pay barely anything for it.</li>
            <li>the expensive one was so great but trying this little blender</li>
            <li>I do not own the original beauty blender, and do not intend on buying it.</li>
            <li>Hard to keep clean</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of paying full price for the real deal</li>
            <li>My problem with this one is that despite following instructions, it cracks like crazy the first time you clean it.</li>

            <li> I actually bought mine from TJMaxx for only $5 and it works great!</li>
            <li> it helps tremendously when it comes to applying foundation.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super quick and the two I purchased came with no complications.</li>
            <li> This product is not only easy to use but easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Leaves my foundation looking amazing and smooth...so easy to use :) a must have now for my everyday makeup routine!</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised at how nice it is - no weird smell, doesn&#x27;t fall apart -</li>
            <li> so your product won&#x27;t get too absorbed into the sponge (IMO)</li>
            <li> I do use the solid cleanser that is made by Beauty Blender, it seems to clean better than a liquid.  </li>
            <li> but I use it when wanting full coverage of a very pigmented makeup</li>
            <li> It came super fast.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what was described.</li>
            <li> I prefer a flat top brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll get bigger in size after one or two uses and it gives me a nice natural finish.</li>
            <li> So cheap and does the exact same thing as the beauty blender.</li>
            <li> It is nice and soft, more than doubles in size when wet and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Save your money for the real deal and buy some of these cheap ones for back up in an emergency.</li>
            <li> well, I haven&#x27;t use the real beauty blender and now that I have this sponge</li>
            <li> Arrived really fast</li>
            <li> , I suggest Real Techniques sponge by the Chapman sisters of Pixiwoo.</li>
            <li> it was shipped fast</li>
            <li> that one is much softer and less....painful.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of it</li>
            <li> I was going to repurchase the beauty blender until i saw how expensive it was; I didn&#x27;t care, I loved it!</li>
            <li> I have only tried the original beauty blender (OBB)</li>
            <li> I have never used the original, but my daughter has and this is quite similar for 1/4 the cost.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that I like this one better than the other blender.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that my makeup has ever looked better!</li>
            <li> but I just like the feel of this one better than the other two.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for such a small price.</li>
            <li> But, so far, I much prefer blending concealer and foundation with a sponge to using my hand or a brush!</li>
            <li> Although, I may first try something else that I have at home that is natural.</li>
            <li> The sponge itself is hard even after application of water and does not leave as airbrushed look as the original &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; It also does not wash easily</li>
            <li> It is better than some of the more expensive sponges I have owned.</li>
            <li> would older it again...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not nearly as soft as the original</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on this product, I had high expectations about it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Mainly to see if it gets better than this little gem.</li>
            <li> They work better if you just get them a little damp before you squeeze the H20 out.</li>
            <li> I am going to fall victim to the hype and splurge on the original BB.</li>
            <li> Before i discovered this product, I always used to use brushes to blend out my foundation which i found just exfoliated my dry spots and made it more noticable and gross.</li>
            <li> When u first buy it, it&#x27;s hard, dense, and small, but if u run it under warm water and squeeze out the excess, it gets huge and soft.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve only used my hand soap and water which really doesn&#x27;t remove much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s barely usable, but I wish I had just spent the money on the original.</li>
            <li> I am a little concerned about how much product is being absorbed into the sponge.</li>
            <li> It was much softer than a $10 eye shaped one I got from a drug store that felt like an actual kitchen sponge and broke apart.</li>
            <li> it expands, its soft and blends out your foundation just like a beatyblender would.</li>
            <li> None of them that I have tried do so far.</li>
            <li> So far I have used this product 3 times.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The texture is totally different and it&#x27;s harder to clean and get water out of it.</li>
            <li> Ive had this one for a long time, probably 8 months, its very durable,</li>
            <li> Very soft, not hard compared to other beauty sponge brands.</li>
            <li> considering I didn&#x27;t pay barely anything for it.</li>
            <li> the expensive one was so great but trying this little blender</li>
            <li> I do not own the original beauty blender, and do not intend on buying it.</li>
            <li> Hard to keep clean</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of paying full price for the real deal</li>
            <li> My problem with this one is that despite following instructions, it cracks like crazy the first time you clean it.</li>
            <li> It not only is a cute pink, but its a very durable sponge, it doesnt stain bad at all after use, and after you wash it</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the Winstonia sponge looks like I dead ringer for a &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; it is far from it.</li>
            <li> I have the original beauty sponges, but they are so expensive I decided to try this.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a little small, but to my surprise it blew up as soon as it was put under water.</li>
            <li> i suffer from terribly dry skin with patches all over.</li>
            <li> I suffer from Flaky dry skin and every time I put on foundation it makes my face look extremely dry</li>
            <li> Sadly the sponge quickly tore.</li>
            <li> It is not soft like some of the other brands I have tried</li>
            <li> and so far it works just like the other one if not better.</li>
            <li> Ive tried quite a few different faux brands of the Beauty Blender.</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, Throw away your brushes and use this ladies!!</li>
            <li> just look at some in other colors.</li>
            <li> I researched other make-up sponges and found that this was the closest to a beauty blender.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first bc</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very hard but soft sponge.</li>
            <li> But, I really needed a replacement for my expensive BB sponge after my puppy destroyed it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the BB, but if you get this sponge, count on it cracking.</li>
            <li> The fake blenders all become completely saturated.</li>
            <li> I used to use sponges that you could use a few times and then had to throw away.</li>
            <li> Will waste your money and foundation</li>
            <li> Way too stiff, I&#x27;d rather find a blender on sale</li>
            <li> but no it was so insainly small even when i ran it under water</li>
            <li> I took a leap of faith on the Winstonia Pro Sponge after going through a small fortune in official &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> waste of money!</li>
            <li> A few months later it got too dirty to use</li>
            <li> this is not a very good product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this beauty blender very skeptical because of the price however, I was surprised.</li>
            <li> Still did the job somewhat, just felt hard on the face</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m often worried that the remaining makeup on the sponge will spur bacteria growth because no matter how hard I try I just cannot get the Winstonia sponge</li>
            <li> This product really sucks even with water.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ridiculous amount on a sponge from another company..</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It was ok. Way too stiff, I&#x27;d rather find a blender on sale (Sephora has some sculptors for $7)</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on this product, I had high expectations about it. After I ran the applicator under some water I thought it would soften the sponge but it didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a very hard but soft sponge. It does a great job of blending out foundation but it doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34; feeling that the beauty blender has.</li>
            <li> I think that think it applies my makeup well, I haven&#x27;t use the real beauty blender and now that I have this sponge I&#x27;m not compelled to. Let me save my cash and continue to have great makeup application.</li>
            <li> I ordered this beauty blender very skeptical because of the price however, I was surprised. It is better than some of the more expensive sponges I have owned. Very soft and blends makeup flawlessly or either I just am awesome at putting on my make up.</li>
            <li> I actually bought mine from TJMaxx for only $5 and it works great! It was much softer than a $10 eye shaped one I got from a drug store that felt like an actual kitchen sponge and broke apart. Ive had this one for a long time, probably 8 months, its very durable, washes well, does the trick beautifuly. I am going to fall victim to the hype and splurge on the original BB. Mainly to see if it gets better than this little gem. but if youre not in the mood to drop $20 on a makeup sponge, this gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I do not own the original beauty blender, and do not intend on buying it. I really do love this sponge, it gives a nice flawless finish to your foundation. Definitely would be repurchasing this in the feature!</li>
            <li> I have the original beauty sponges, but they are so expensive I decided to try this.  It&#x27;s not nearly as soft as the original and I will go back to them.  It&#x27;s barely usable, but I wish I had just spent the money on the original.</li>
            <li> Doest cake up my foundation... I have yet to try the beauty blender, but this is a perfect use for everyday makeup...</li>
            <li> My make-up talented daughter loves this tool!!! Great price, and cute design made it a happy purchase!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would older it again...</li>
            <li> This product is not only easy to use but easy to clean! When applying make up it makes a world of difference.</li>
            <li> its just like a beatyblender. it expands, its soft and blends out your foundation just like a beatyblender would. its amazing for the price</li>
            <li> Probably one of the BEST BB dupes I have ever used</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite tools in my makeup bag. Takes all excess makeup off after applying foundation and concealer. Makes for a really nice finish. This one was good quality.</li>
            <li> Arrived really fast and my daughter says that it works great! She said it works just as good as her others that she had purchased in a department store.</li>
            <li> Like most, I looked for a way to buy a blender at a cheaper price--of course being offered as an add-on made this an even better deal.  Sadly the sponge quickly tore. Save your money</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like using a sponge applicator. I prefer a flat top brush. This is no Beauty Blender, but I also don&#x27;t think the Beauty Blender is all that and a bag of chips either. It&#x27;s just a gimmick. My problem with this one is that despite following instructions, it cracks like crazy the first time you clean it. I don&#x27;t like applying my foundation with a sponge, but for concealer, which is what I was counting on for this, I suggest Real Techniques sponge by the Chapman sisters of Pixiwoo. It&#x27;s a grea sponge with a better shape and it works great. It&#x27;s about $7. It does the job for my concealer although I still prefer a brush. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the BB, but if you get this sponge, count on it cracking. I know it&#x27;s happened to a lot of people and if you don&#x27;t see it on the reviews for this one just look at some in other colors. You&#x27;ll see that&#x27;s the case.</li>
            <li> This beauty sponge works pretty good. It&#x27;ll get bigger in size after one or two uses and it gives me a nice natural finish. For only 5 bucks I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Ive tried quite a few different faux brands of the Beauty Blender. I bought the Beauty Blender and fell in love like everyone else so of course I had to see if the knock off cheapies work just as good...They don&#x27;t. None of them that I have tried do so far.This one is no different. I&#x27;m not saying they don&#x27;t work at all but they dont work the same as The Beauty Blender so be prepared to play with it a bit to make it work for you.The texture is totally different and it&#x27;s harder to clean and get water out of it. I would not suggest ever fully submerging the phoney blenders in water before application. You cant just wring it out nicely like the blender. The fake blenders all become completely saturated. They work better if you just get them a little damp before you squeeze the H20 out. Save your money for the real deal and buy some of these cheap ones for back up in an emergency.</li>
            <li> When u first buy it, it&#x27;s hard, dense, and small, but if u run it under warm water and squeeze out the excess, it gets huge and soft. It&#x27;s an ok product, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a spot on dupe for the beauty blender though if that&#x27;s what your looking for</li>
            <li> I was pleased with how quickly this was shipped out to me. As soon as I received my package I opened it up and read the instructions on caring for the product. So far I have used this product 3 times. I get a flawless look when applying my foundation. I have sensitive skin and this is wonderful. I will definitely  be buying from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I am a little concerned about how much product is being absorbed into the sponge. But, so far, I much prefer blending concealer and foundation with a sponge to using my hand or a brush!</li>
            <li> this sponge does your makeup flawless. you will not need  to use a brush, because it would be so flawless.</li>
            <li> Great beauty sponge for an awesome price. Very soft, not hard compared to other beauty sponge brands. It&#x27;s def one of my favorite sponges</li>
            <li> i suffer from terribly dry skin with patches all over. Before i discovered this product, I always used to use brushes to blend out my foundation which i found just exfoliated my dry spots and made it more noticable and gross. I got a beauty blender for my birthday from my friend and I was in love. A few months later it got too dirty to use so i had to throw it away. I was going to repurchase the beauty blender until i saw how expensive it was; I didn&#x27;t care, I loved it! I was about to hit that order button until i discovered the winstonia pro beauty flawless makeup blender sponge and its a life saver. So cheap and does the exact same thing as the beauty blender. If you have dry skin, Throw away your brushes and use this ladies!!</li>
            <li> I used to use sponges that you could use a few times and then had to throw away. I wanted a reusable one and for the price I thought Why not? This is a great tool for blending my foundation and cream blush. All you have to do is fully saturate it and then remove the excess water and there you go! It doesn&#x27;t absorb a lot of product and blends beautifully! I would recommend to anyone :-)</li>
            <li> very easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> It is not soft like some of the other brands I have tried but I guess you get what you paid for. Still did the job somewhat, just felt hard on the face</li>
            <li> This product really sucks even with water. Heard about this on You Tube everyone gave good reviews but I dont understand why? All my foundation stayed on the sponge. Will waste your money and foundation</li>
            <li> I really love this makeup blender! I was worried it wouldnt work well, because I only paid five dollars for it...but i was reassured as soon as I used it! It not only is a cute pink, but its a very durable sponge, it doesnt stain bad at all after use, and after you wash it and it dries it returns to its original shape perfectly. I would definitively recommend this sponge to anyone who is looking for quality!</li>
            <li> The trick to this is not to squeeze out all the water so your product won&#x27;t get too absorbed into the sponge (IMO) it was shipped fast so no prob there</li>
            <li> I chose 5 stars because this product is amazing..it helps tremendously when it comes to applying foundation. I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great must have in your make up bag! Some people question if it &amp;#34;sucks up&amp;#34; all the make up when on the instructions it says specifically to submerge it in water and let the sponge soak up the water and then you squeeze all the water out. Then you use it for applying foundation on. And it applies flawlessly, just like the $25 one!</li>
            <li> I love this item. It was exactly what I ordered. It came super fast. It was exactly what was described. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> I thought it was gonna be much bigger like the beauty blender but no it was so insainly small even when i ran it under water</li>
            <li> The $18+  for the original BB.  I own a sponge made by Soho beauty that I purchased from Walgreens but they don&#x27;t sell it anymore. Nor could I find one just like the BB. I am so glad I found these and so far it works just like the other one if not better. Shipping was super quick and the two I purchased came with no complications. I will buy from this store again</li>
            <li> I consider myself to be a cosmetic maven. Let&#x27;s face it I walk into Sephora and they know me by name at this point. I took a leap of faith on the Winstonia Pro Sponge after going through a small fortune in official &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; sponges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Winstonia sponge looks like I dead ringer for a &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; it is far from it. The sponge itself is hard even after application of water and does not leave as airbrushed look as the original &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; It also does not wash easily and I&#x27;m often worried that the remaining makeup on the sponge will spur bacteria growth because no matter how hard I try I just cannot get the Winstonia sponge clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion you get what you pay for in this department so if you are looking for even, flawless, coverage and the easy cleaning just splurge and treat yourself to the &amp;#34;Beauty Blender&amp;#34; sponge this Winstonia sponge is trying to imitate. You will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> I have only tried the original beauty blender (OBB) once from a friend at a wedding.  I was skeptical of paying full price for the real deal so bought this one instead.  I think I like it better than the real thing, because it&#x27;s more of a soft and fine memory foam.  It makes my makeup go on quick and flawless without streaks like a brush.  From what I remember the OBB is more spongy and porous and did a good job, but I had to smooooth it out more gently.  I&#x27;m concerned about cleaning it.  So far, I&#x27;ve only used my hand soap and water which really doesn&#x27;t remove much.  I&#x27;m thinking about maybe buying another of this one and the OBB cleaner. Although, I may first try something else that I have at home that is natural.</li>
            <li> This is great and I will be ordering more. Pleasantly surprised at how nice it is - no weird smell, doesn&#x27;t fall apart - this is a great buy!</li>
            <li> This beauty blender is pretty good... helps give good coverage without making the face look cakey. Great price for this sponge.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend definitely love this item, all of the brushes were in great working condition, and works great with make up</li>
            <li> this is not a very good product. if you are looking for a beauty blender dupe, get the realtechniques one (ulta sells it and i&#x27;m sure amazon does too.) that one is much softer and less....painful.</li>
            <li> Exlent item i advise any one to buy these item  .it is beutiful colore and it is easy to use .</li>
            <li> I have never used the original, but my daughter has and this is quite similar for 1/4 the cost.  It is nice and soft, more than doubles in size when wet and lasts a long time.  I do use the solid cleanser that is made by Beauty Blender, it seems to clean better than a liquid.  This is a great sponge for the price, in my opinion.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The best purchase I&#x27;ve made in the makeup section!&lt;br /&gt;This is amazing with foundation and touch ups!  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure to order this blender since I heard the expensive one was so great but trying this little blender I love it.  I suffer from Flaky dry skin and every time I put on foundation it makes my face look extremely dry but this blender made it look smooth and covered very  nicely.</li>
            <li> Hard to keep clean but I use it when wanting full coverage of a very pigmented makeup&lt;br /&gt;Like Becca or RCMA</li>
            <li> I never had a beauty blender before and I wanted to try it. However I would not pay $20 for sponge especially since I&#x27;m a makeup novice. I researched other make-up sponges and found that this was the closest to a beauty blender. I tried it and thought it did an excellent job at blending my foundation/concealer. It expands when it gets wet and is soft on my skin. I would definitely recommend this sponge to beginners and experts for the price and quality that you get.</li>
            <li> I have better make up days now because of this thing. I wanted to try it and see what it was  all about an  I love it. I don&#x27;t think it is cheaply made at all, I think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for such a small price. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much out of it considering I didn&#x27;t pay barely anything for it. I was wrong. It is great at applying makeup flawlessly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and it blends my makeup better than a sponge or a makeup brush. I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from this sponge considering the price. But, I really needed a replacement for my expensive BB sponge after my puppy destroyed it. I have to say that I like this one better than the other blender. After wetting it and letting it thoroughly soak through, I wrung it out and used it right away with my favorite foundation. It blended my foundation, concealer and cream blush flawlessly, and fixed all cakey bits. I&#x27;m not sure that my makeup has ever looked better! Totally in love with this sponge! Buying a backup now.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product. It applies makeup flawlessly. Definitely recommend it. Great price for a great product. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay the expensive price for the actual beauty blender.</li>
            <li> Love this product . Very high quality, makes my makeup look like it was airbrushed on flawlessly. One of the best purchases I&#x27;ve made on Amazon. Highly recommend. A beauty must have.</li>
            <li> I love this beautyblender! I was skeptical at first bc it was cheaper but I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ridiculous amount on a sponge from another company..and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t! This works amazing! Leaves my foundation looking amazing and smooth...so easy to use :) a must have now for my everyday makeup routine!</li>
            <li> Love using a beauty blender when I am not using my foundation brush....blends the foundation so well...this is a must have product and you can&#x27;t beat the price!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried beauty blender, the sonia kashuk brand and this one. I tend to favor this one. They all will stay  and wear out around 3 months or so. I can&#x27;t explain why but I just like the feel of this one better than the other two. This is the one I will keep purchasing. It&#x27;s my favorite way to apply foundation and concealer. It helps best in covering my blemishes and I have adult acne. I suggest to anyone wanting a more flawless face to get a beauty sponge.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. It is really easy to use and clean. It has lasted way longer than it said it would.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a little small, but to my surprise it blew up as soon as it was put under water. Very handy and gives a nice finish.</li>
            <li> waste of money! cheap! doesnt work well at all. might as well spend some extra money and get the beauty blender</li>
