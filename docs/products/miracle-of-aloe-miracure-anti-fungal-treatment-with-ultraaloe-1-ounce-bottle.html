            <li> New growth will be healthy but depends on how bad the fungus is for length of time this will take.</li>
            <li> I used it on the bumps and they are gone in about 2-3 days now and are less frequent.</li>
            <li> This sounds strange, but I read in a forum that this stuff would work on the bumps.  </li>

            <li> Invest your money on other things.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> It does the job as promised</li>
            <li> This stuff works good,    and it will take away most funguss.      however,  it might cause hair loss,  im not sure of this    it was probibly the fungus that permently took away my hair on my foot,  but i had hair loss where the funguss wasent even   that bad.    i am going to test it on my leg somewhere and keep you posted. hahaha</li>
            <li> My husband had terrible fungus on his big toes, ( almost black) and after 2 bttls. of this stuff, it&#x27;s completely gone! He bought a third bttl. for maintenance, and uses it once a week or so.  After trying just about everything else, this is the product that finally worked.</li>
            <li> This product does not work on Toe Fungus.  I have very minimal while my husband&#x27;s toe was worse than mine.  We tried 2 bottles and it did nothing for either one of us.  Do not bother purchasing this product.  Going to the doctor is your best bet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product and it arrived quickly.I have used it for at least a month and i achieved great results</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while, it does not work on nail fungus, and the product shipped is different than on the picture. Invest your money on other things.</li>
            <li> This product has worked to get rid of my husband&#x27;s toe fungus. He likes the smell. The product is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Takes time but it seems to work ... Don&#x27;t give up.  New growth will be healthy but depends on how bad the fungus is for length of time this will take.</li>
            <li> Thanks its a great product. My wife love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I used this for my athletes foot and it has cured it in just a few days. It is soothing and not uncomfortable to put on doesn&#x27;t smell weird and works extremely well. if you have athlete&#x27;s foot this is the way to go üëç</li>
            <li> from working in wet ditches when I worked in construction, my feet were terrible. the embarrassment was worse though. I found this and kept at it and it IS a MIRACLE... but you do have to be consistent and the patient as the nail grows out. I also found filing side ways on the nail so the product could get in better also helped. Very happy with the product, but again, it doesn&#x27;t happen overnight by any means.</li>
            <li> I have been getting not acne, but red bumps that itch and resemble bug bites on my face, arms and legs. When you scratch them, clear fluid would drain.  The Dermatologist threw everything she had at it, but nothing worked.  It would take a few weeks for the bumps to go away only to come back elsewhere.  I had to use ice to soothe the itch /burn. This sounds strange, but I read in a forum that this stuff would work on the bumps.  I used it on the bumps and they are gone in about 2-3 days now and are less frequent. It is real oily but does not smell bad. I apply it with a cotton ball.  It is the combination of the ingredients that seems to work, as the ingredients by themselves wouldn&#x27;t touch the bumps I had.  I am glad I found it.</li>
            <li> This crap really works!    Little secret here....use it on cracked heals and super dry skin on the bottom of your feet...as a cause of that malady is very often and very likely, you guessed it, FUNGUS! This product will turn your bipeds back to human feet.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work like I expected it to.</li>
            <li> My husband had athletes foot for several years.  Two treatments of this anti fungal and he has had no further problems.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this is an affordable treatment for fungus of the toenail. it will require a prolonged period of treatment, so patience is of the essence.</li>
            <li> Its a shame but nothing really works for this condition.</li>
            <li> This product is truly a miracle.  I tried several products to fight this nail infections.  It is the only one that worked.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a few months now.  Seems to be keeping it under control. Not getting rid of it altogether but not spreading.</li>
