    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This \\&quot;rinse\\&quot; is the best I&#x27;ve seen on the market, that doesn&#x27;t cost $100, doesn&#x27;t require a stylist&#x27;s license, and does take away ANY yellowing or brassiness that sometimes occurs with either age or bleaching.  </li>
            <li>Excellent prouduct ..</li>
            <li>but two were black--not good for blond hair!  </li>
            <li>Great conditioner too.</li>
            <li>The product does help with the brassiness and is a great tone refresher.  </li>
            <li>his is a great way to aid in the upkeep of your hair.</li>
            <li>I used the fawn color, and althought I had to apply it severly times, I was happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Service was prompt, price fair and was well-packaged</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my mother in law in Canada and she was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Roux has been on the market for many decades!  </li>
            <li>She was very happy with the large bottle.</li>
            <li>Very nice product and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of synthetic, like a plastic.  </li>
            <li>this product may be from yesteryear but it outperforms most of the designer products of today.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I have used this for almost 50 years to make my gray hair a bit more silver.  </li>
            <li>This works ok.  </li>
            <li>Glad to find this here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>My Mother has been using this for many years, and none of the stores around here seem to carry it anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be ordering it here from now on.</li>
            <li>I had to do it over the bathtub to make sure it didn&#x27;t get all over the floor.  </li>
            <li>but I would probably not purchase this one again; mostly based off the messiness.  </li>
            <li>So I bought it and love it.  </li>
            <li>It was actually in better condition are using this.  </li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t smell good at all</li>
            <li>It was also a very quick delivery, way ahead of scheduled time frame.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful to tone down the gold tones in your hair.  </li>
            <li>I use this to tone my bleached hair to that really light whitish blonde Madonna made popular during her True Blue/</li>
            <li>Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t stain though the color of the product might worry you a bit.  </li>
            <li>but I have not ever found anything that stays consistently on the market that contains Violet 2 (which is what makes the bright white).  </li>
            <li>My hair was so gold, it made my face pink as I&#x27;m so fair complected.  </li>
            <li>PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS COMPLIMENTING HER ON HOW PRETTY HER HAIR COLOR IS.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wanting something more permanent I recommend going to Sally Beauty Supply and purchasing Clairol Creme Toner in White Beige and Extra-Light Platinum.  </li>
            <li>If he didn&#x27;t cut my hair so very well I would go somewhere else!  </li>
            <li>Anyway, it does work and is the real deal!  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really do much for my hair color.</li>
            <li>stars because it really works</li>
            <li>I think I paid too much for it.</li>
            <li>MY MOTHER-IN-LAW HAS BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS AND WOULD NOT USE ANY OTHER PRODUCT ON HER HAIR.  </li>
            <li>There are a zillion rinses out there, but only this one leaves hair shiny, manageable and a very pretty shade.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>The only problems I have with this is that it is temporary and comes out after one shampoo (it becomes very bothersome to apply this over and over if you wash your hair as much as I wash mine) and if you apply too much of this it starts to look violet.  </li>
            <li>and it really brings out the high lights my hair don&#x27;t look so dull any more.</li>
            <li>Use 1 1/2 ounces of the White Beige with 1/2 of the Extra Light Platinum combined with 2 ounces 20 volume creme developer.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of red pigment in my hair and my hairdresser always try to use a color blonde that is too light</li>
            <li>I have liked this product for several years and am finding it harder to find and especially in the color I use.  </li>
            <li>HER HAIR IS PURE WHITE</li>
            <li>only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it can be really drippy and therefore, get on your clothes.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a harsh smell.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s not on the market like it used to be.</li>
            <li>The permanent toner will cause damage as well as all other \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; toners and it simply isn&#x27;t worth it because of the rapid fading.</li>
            <li>Had a bad experience with color at a salon and this works great to cover up the error until it can grow out and be cut off.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wanting a true platinum result on hair bleached out to the pale yellow stage this is thing to use.  </li>
            <li>Now I have a very soft  (actual) blonde tone not topaz color!  </li>
            <li>However, I was totally suprised by how conditioned and soft this product left my hair.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product to cover grey as I let it grow out completely.  </li>

            <li> Still not sure if I am ready, but we&#x27;ll see.  </li>
            <li> but next time I will look harder for some place local to buy it.</li>
            <li> Process this mixture for 3 to 5 minutes, it doesn&#x27;t take very long to develop into that sheer, translucent silver and if you process this too long you&#x27;ll wind up with gray.  </li>
            <li> other products say they lighten hair (like sheer blonde)</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking I can hide my grey hair.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time for my hair to dry after I put it on</li>
            <li> but once it was dry it came out</li>
            <li> It works well on pale blonde to take the yellow out and give it a silvery/ashy tint.</li>
            <li> I mailed the two black back and have not received replacements or word that I have been refunded the money.  </li>
            <li> For the cost of this product, one would think it would show some result in its use, but I can see absolutely NO change with use.</li>
            <li> So, just be careful with it.</li>
            <li> So, even though I used this product in years past, it is not working for me at the present time.</li>
            <li> They make other \\&quot;Fanci</li>
            <li> I heed my friend&#x27;s advice to use it very carefully and sparingly.  </li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> less dripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was wondering about the unpleasant smell a lot of reviewers were talking about and they were right.  </li>
            <li> The color is not too intense, so your hair will not look artificial with it.</li>
            <li> For me, I have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Waste of money</li>
            <li> The thing is, this stuff is really messy.  </li>
            <li> WHO IS IN HER LATE 80&#x27;S.</li>
            <li> I decided to let my grey&#x27;s grow out a bit, just to experient since I am sick of having to dye my hair dark brown as soon as two weeks.  </li>
            <li> I was daunted by the instructions and fearful I&#x27;d have blue dye running down my shoulders if it rained</li>
            <li> Irritating</li>
            <li> I like the product but 2 of the wrong colors of rinse were sent.  </li>
            <li> About as disappointing as a purchase can get.</li>
            <li> I was very doubtful when my colorist recommended temporary color to return my salon-applied platinum color hair to its intended state after I&#x27;d accidentally dyed it orange with a drug-store purchased keratin de-frizzing product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> MY MOTHER-IN-LAW HAS BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS AND WOULD NOT USE ANY OTHER PRODUCT ON HER HAIR.  HER HAIR IS PURE WHITE NOW, THIS PRODUCT KEEPS THE WHITE FROM GETTING A YELLOW OR BLUE LIKE TINT.  PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS COMPLIMENTING HER ON HOW PRETTY HER HAIR COLOR IS.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT ON BEHALF OF MY MOTHER-IN-LAW WHO IS IN HER LATE 80&#x27;S.</li>
            <li> this product may be from yesteryear but it outperforms most of the designer products of today. Please do not discontinue.</li>
            <li> For the cost of this product, one would think it would show some result in its use, but I can see absolutely NO change with use. IOwas seeking some enhancement to silver-white hair, but I cannot see that this product makes any difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;rinse\\&quot; is the best I&#x27;ve seen on the market, that doesn&#x27;t cost $100, doesn&#x27;t require a stylist&#x27;s license, and does take away ANY yellowing or brassiness that sometimes occurs with either age or bleaching.  I use this after I&#x27;ve highlighted my hair, as a toner, just to keep any brassiness away.  As a darker blonde, I sometimes use this during the summer for a brightener with my sun-streaks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it can be really drippy and therefore, get on your clothes. So, just be careful with it. I chose to 1) cover my clothes before using this product and 2) put it in a spray bottle for maximum coverage and less dripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many other products say they lighten hair (like sheer blonde) but I have not ever found anything that stays consistently on the market that contains Violet 2 (which is what makes the bright white).  All the lemon in the world will not work this well.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really do much for my hair color. I would just get Shimmering lights if I were you.</li>
            <li> I like the product but 2 of the wrong colors of rinse were sent.  I ordered 4 bottles of White Minx. Two were white minx but two were black--not good for blond hair!  I mailed the two black back and have not received replacements or word that I have been refunded the money.  Please help!</li>
            <li> Very nice product and easy to use. I love it. It was also a very quick delivery, way ahead of scheduled time frame. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Cannot always find Fanci-Full in the local pharmacies. I have purchased as gifts for friends. This along with VO5 for silver hair ... Try it and you will get lots and lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking I can hide my grey hair. I have dark brown hair. It didn&#x27;t work on my hair.</li>
            <li> I use this to tone my bleached hair to that really light whitish blonde Madonna made popular during her True Blue/Who&#x27;s That Girl phase in the 80s.  The only problems I have with this is that it is temporary and comes out after one shampoo (it becomes very bothersome to apply this over and over if you wash your hair as much as I wash mine) and if you apply too much of this it starts to look violet.  The rinse version of this is very runny and messy so I would recommend buying the mousse.  If you&#x27;re wanting a true platinum result on hair bleached out to the pale yellow stage this is thing to use.  If you&#x27;re wanting something more permanent I recommend going to Sally Beauty Supply and purchasing Clairol Creme Toner in White Beige and Extra-Light Platinum.  Use 1 1/2 ounces of the White Beige with 1/2 of the Extra Light Platinum combined with 2 ounces 20 volume creme developer.  Process this mixture for 3 to 5 minutes, it doesn&#x27;t take very long to develop into that sheer, translucent silver and if you process this too long you&#x27;ll wind up with gray.  Although Clairol says this product is supposed to be permanent it fades out in 3 to 4 shampoos so I recommend using the Fanci-Full rinse instead.  The rinse isn&#x27;t going to cause any further damage to your already fragile bleached hair.  The permanent toner will cause damage as well as all other \\&quot;permanent\\&quot; toners and it simply isn&#x27;t worth it because of the rapid fading.</li>
            <li> Because of the medications I am on, the color did not take on my hair.  So, even though I used this product in years past, it is not working for me at the present time.</li>
            <li> I had wanted to try temporary gray on my hair to see if I want to let it grow out.  I cannot see where this product did ANYTHING.  For me, I have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> You know how people are saying it gets rid of brassy colors from bleaching. No. IT DID NOTHING to my hair not even the blonde parts of my hair. It didn&#x27;t mask a damn thing or dye. Waste of money</li>
            <li> I love it I am getting gray and it really brings out the high lights my hair don&#x27;t look so dull any more.</li>
            <li> My white hair tends to yellow &amp; this solves the problem.  Have been using this for years.  Great conditioner too.</li>
            <li> I have used this for almost 50 years to make my gray hair a bit more silver.  Excellent prouduct ..&lt;br /&gt;Patty</li>
            <li> This works ok.  I prefer the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Glad to find this here at Amazon. My Mother has been using this for many years, and none of the stores around here seem to carry it anymore. You would think a lot of women would use it, but I guess not. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be ordering it here from now on.</li>
            <li> The bottle that arrived was printed and labeled as the white dye, but actually contained purple dye. Not only that, but the purple dye didn&#x27;t even work. About as disappointing as a purchase can get.</li>
            <li> I bought the White Minx for my platinum bleached hair to help with brassiness between salon trips.  The product does help with the brassiness and is a great tone refresher.  The thing is, this stuff is really messy.  I had to do it over the bathtub to make sure it didn&#x27;t get all over the floor.  Luckily, it doesn&#x27;t stain though the color of the product might worry you a bit.  Also, when I put it in my hair it made it look darker but once it was dry it came out well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wondering about the unpleasant smell a lot of reviewers were talking about and they were right.  It really doesn&#x27;t smell good at all but it&#x27;s not a harsh smell.  It&#x27;s kind of synthetic, like a plastic.  Even after drying the smell was still in my hair, but it&#x27;s not strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four stars because it really works but I would probably not purchase this one again; mostly based off the messiness.  I think next time I&#x27;ll go with the Fanci-Full Mousse.</li>
            <li> If you want silver/white hair his is a great way to aid in the upkeep of your hair. After a shower I spray my hair with Fanci-Full White Minx and then comb it through and it takes out any brassy tint I had before. During the next shower it all rinses out!</li>
            <li> Had a bad experience with color at a salon and this works great to cover up the error until it can grow out and be cut off.</li>
            <li> I have liked this product for several years and am finding it harder to find and especially in the color I use.  Service was prompt, price fair and was well-packaged</li>
            <li> There are a zillion rinses out there, but only this one leaves hair shiny, manageable and a very pretty shade.  I bought it because two lady friends with the prettiest hair both told me they use this product - they don&#x27;t know one another.  So I bought it and love it.  I heed my friend&#x27;s advice to use it very carefully and sparingly.  A bottle has lasted me over a year - I also have short hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased the White Minx rinse and was shipped &amp;#34;Frivolous Fawn&amp;#34;. The Frivolous Fawn bottle had the White Minx label on it. Irritating and I&#x27;m out 12 bucks. Get it together.</li>
            <li> I decided to let my grey&#x27;s grow out a bit, just to experient since I am sick of having to dye my hair dark brown as soon as two weeks.  It has been about two months and I didn&#x27;t want to permanently color yet.  I tried this product to cover grey as I let it grow out completely.  Still not sure if I am ready, but we&#x27;ll see.  I have tried crayons, which are smelly and waxy and I have tried mascara&#x27;s which also get all over my clothes and pillow cases.  However, I was totally suprised by how conditioned and soft this product left my hair.  It was actually in better condition are using this.  I used the fawn color, and althought I had to apply it severly times, I was happy with the results.  I like the fact that it washes out and I don&#x27;t have to commit to the color while I can keep experimenting with letting my greys&lt;br /&gt;come it.</li>
            <li> Use it 2-3 times a week...great...</li>
            <li> I like this product. It works well on pale blonde to take the yellow out and give it a silvery/ashy tint. Washes out easily next time you shampoo hair.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in any stores or beauty shops. I used to use it years ago. I&#x27;m surprised it&#x27;s not on the market like it used to be.I think I paid too much for it.It takes a long time for my hair to dry after I put it on but I do like the color that it turns out to be...kinda platinum. It takes a lot of the brassiness and yellow out of my bleached hair.I recommend it but next time I will look harder for some place local to buy it.</li>
            <li> Roux has been on the market for many decades!  It is wonderful to tone down the gold tones in your hair.  I have a lot of red pigment in my hair and my hairdresser always try to use a color blonde that is too light and it turns topaz color.  If he didn&#x27;t cut my hair so very well I would go somewhere else!  Anyway, it does work and is the real deal!  My hair was so gold, it made my face pink as I&#x27;m so fair complected.  I can&#x27;t find it around here in stores but (thankfully) found it on Amazon!  Received it this morning and immediately washed my hair and used it......what a difference!  Now I have a very soft  (actual) blonde tone not topaz color!  Don&#x27;t settle for anything else but Roux!  They make other \\&quot;Fanci Fulls\\&quot; but they are not Roux!</li>
            <li> I was very doubtful when my colorist recommended temporary color to return my salon-applied platinum color hair to its intended state after I&#x27;d accidentally dyed it orange with a drug-store purchased keratin de-frizzing product.  BUT this Roux rinse actually works!  I was daunted by the instructions and fearful I&#x27;d have blue dye running down my shoulders if it rained but I&#x27;ve had no problem whatsoever with color transfer.  It evens out my spotty color and there is no longer evidence of the orange.  I&#x27;ll be using this every time I wash until the offending color grows out.</li>
            <li> The color is not too intense, so your hair will not look artificial with it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mother in law in Canada and she was very pleased with it. She was very happy with the large bottle.</li>
