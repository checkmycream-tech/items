            <li>Popped some of these off at work and was really impressed with the horrid stench - but be warned, it doesn&#x27;t dissipate near as fast as the box implies.</li>

            <li>love em will buy more later</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy these for your kids, but if you have a cool boss they can be a lot of fun.</li>
            <li>Would of given 5 stars if smell lasted longer but great none the less.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!</li>
            <li>I would also warn that it&#x27;s important to use good judgement with these little stinkers, using these in the workplace or formal events-</li>
            <li>best if used in a poorly ventilated area.</li>
            <li>Used it at work, used up all 12 boxes in 2 days, and then got sent home with out pay, it was so worth it</li>
            <li>These ampules brought back the good old days and huge belly laughs as well.  </li>
            <li>Lots of fun.</li>
            <li>They were a fun purchase had lots of laughs with friends.</li>
            <li>There so much fun.</li>
            <li>I have to laugh.  </li>
            <li>and it wears off pretty quick.</li>
            <li>Boy are they right about these.</li>
            <li>btw im in summer school right now</li>
            <li>, they smell great (terrible), and they are a great prank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMENDED!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Very strong egg smell with a long hang time.  </li>
            <li>I blew my whole load in one day!</li>
            <li>so if you drop it, it&#x27;s more than likely going to bust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny seeing people reactions towards their face.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>then heres the funny story.</li>
            <li>first impression...</li>
            <li>Definitely will buy more when I run close to being out.  </li>
            <li>Good for small areas, but these really aren&#x27;t that powerful.</li>
            <li>This product works really well and is consistent.</li>
            <li>Its a good thing to have for pranks and plain old fun.</li>
            <li>The entire neighborhood could easily identify what he had for breakfast as he hastily exited his boombox clunker.  </li>
            <li>the best way to use these is to put them in an empty water bottle and crush the little vial it will smell for like 20 minuets!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is really foul....</li>
            <li>We go to restaraunts at the drive thru, when the person is turned around, we will throw one in the window and it will stink the whole area.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>stepped on or dropped with real force</li>
            <li>nearly had some people puking!!!</li>
            <li>i mean really good and</li>
            <li>Gently stepping on them seems to work the best but be careful not to step too hard, you do not want this stuff on your shoes!  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;re hoping a few more weeks of this has them leaving our peaceful neighborhood.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s STILL pretty loud, so I get an object, for example a pack of M&amp;M&#x27;s, and drop it as soon as I crush it.</li>
            <li>Wow do these bombs of stink really stink.</li>
            <li>Not as potent and long lasting as I remembered from when I was young.very</li>
            <li>The odor is potent and lasts a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Kids get a big laugh</li>
            <li>Create your own applications (overcrowded concert floors, rude bar scenes, the DMV).  </li>
            <li>What can I say, these are hilarious but pretty mean.</li>
            <li>These are the same exact stink bombs we used to use in high school.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend launches these over the fence at our new meth addict neighbors and they have no idea where the stench is coming from.</li>
            <li>Pop one and sit back and enjoy the comments and facial expressions!</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t expect the smell to last long or be strong.</li>
            <li>People kept smoking outside of our building and the smoke would come in through our window on hot days.  </li>
            <li>First one out of the box had some odor but next three,nothing.</li>
            <li>I would ask for a full refund if they were more expensive .</li>
            <li>and at first i am disappointed, then proud.</li>
            <li>Teenager on neighborhood cul-de-sac played stereo so loud that all the windows in area would rattle.  </li>
            <li>busted one in Walmart, I could smell it nearly 120 feet away from where I busted it.</li>
            <li>My friend threw one of these in the class room and it stink up the whole place with in 30 second.</li>
            <li>I remembered these from when I was a kid, so I got some as an adult.</li>
            <li>We use them to simulate natural gas leaks for our CERT simulations.  </li>
            <li>But if your an adult its a necesity.</li>
            <li>It was awesome I highly recommend them for younger kids in school with teachers they hate.</li>
            <li>That one will linger all day!!!! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I am not responsible for any pranks you pull with this bottle.</li>
            <li>What I like about using these is that since I know that it is actually NOT a rotten egg, the smell doesn&#x27;t really bother me personally.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but at least them were cheap.</li>
            <li>the smell is really stron but dosnt last so long as to ruin the joke</li>
            <li>Two of these babies under the mat near the push buttons got an almost instant response.  </li>
            <li>First I broke one in my small bathroom, and ok not really that smelly, but good enough for others to hate it.</li>
            <li>So I tried the other two and broke them, its a little more powerful but this time the smell escaped my bathroom and ventured at least five feet away.</li>
            <li>I usually throw down super fast, but another way is to stick it under your shoe and crush it</li>
            <li>The small does not last long and fades away quickly.</li>

            <li> That one will linger all day!!!! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I am not responsible for any pranks you pull with this bottle.</li>
            <li> What I like about using these is that since I know that it is actually NOT a rotten egg, the smell doesn&#x27;t really bother me personally.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but at least them were cheap.</li>
            <li> the smell is really stron but dosnt last so long as to ruin the joke</li>
            <li> Two of these babies under the mat near the push buttons got an almost instant response.  </li>
            <li> First I broke one in my small bathroom, and ok not really that smelly, but good enough for others to hate it.</li>
            <li> So I tried the other two and broke them, its a little more powerful but this time the smell escaped my bathroom and ventured at least five feet away.</li>
            <li> I usually throw down super fast, but another way is to stick it under your shoe and crush it</li>
            <li> The small does not last long and fades away quickly.</li>
            <li> quickly emerged, pants down around his ankles after someone placed a few of these under the toilet seat.  </li>
            <li> Very cool but was unable too use it do to a recent apartment fire that i jest went thru</li>
            <li> A while back I used 4 of these at once in a small area and got very dizzy.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like, is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> but...it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> only bad thing about it is that it&#x27;s pretty loud when you bust it.</li>
            <li> the only thing i dont like is the glass vile which is hard to open.</li>
            <li> The shipping is fast to Philadelphia but problem is, 1 stink bomb came broken.</li>
            <li> You have to throw a few to get the smell to last over a minute or 2.</li>
            <li> definetly an aweome prankster toy, however you need to be extremly careful with these and do not get caught with them</li>
            <li> The smell is weak and takes a few then gos away fast..</li>
            <li> Please be careful with this one!</li>
            <li> Bought these in the past from another seller and they smelled big time but</li>
            <li> didnt work as well as the other brand</li>
            <li> I have used these type of stink bombs in the past , maybe a different manufacturer , but these stink bombs had virtually no smell at all .</li>
            <li> These have given me endless hours of entertainment.</li>
            <li> and they closed it down for a week investigating who did it.</li>
            <li> I had complained numerous times about the lingering odor in my office building&#x27;s elevator to no avail.  </li>
            <li> So I secretly threw stink bombs int heir vicinity to clear them out.</li>
            <li> This is not effective outside</li>
            <li> Be careful you can get yourself in trouble with these.</li>
            <li> The down side is the glass container.  </li>
            <li> Act like you are toeing your shoe and set the stink bomb down, when you walk away step on it.</li>
            <li> You have to break the vile which leaves a mess on the ground or</li>
            <li> If you just drop it on the floor, there will be sharp glass left behind.  </li>
            <li> They stink super bad.</li>
            <li> It may be small but it goes a long ways!!!!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;bomb\\&quot; consists of a little glass capsule containing a liquid.  </li>
            <li> easy to break when u want to, almost silent but definitely violent!</li>
            <li> these are so weak, Not the glass is hard to break at that you got to toss them high or slam them hard.</li>
            <li> I used to buy these all the time as a kid and caused quite a few scenes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money .</li>
            <li> I have found in the past.</li>
            <li> They smell a little worse than rotten eggs.</li>
            <li> They are in little glass vials, and the glass is thin</li>
            <li> i also popped one of these suckers in a room to test it</li>
            <li> ive used at least 10 of these in class</li>
            <li> were talking at least 20 feet away</li>
            <li> what i do is get a thick napkin and break the vile at the neck and then put the stinky solution on the napkin.</li>
            <li> Yes, it stinks, BUT... the &#x27;stinkradius&#x27; is very limited</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people say that this is a bad product and such</li>
            <li> This is not a good buy</li>
            <li> usually not a good idea.</li>
            <li> at least one of them is broken.</li>
            <li> lasts as long as a fart, and dos&#x27;nt smell that bad at all</li>
            <li> Weak stuff.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stink that bad or for very long</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> All you secretly have to do is either step on it</li>
            <li> anyway no problems with the product besides a broken one</li>
            <li> It was very bad shipping took Realy long</li>
            <li> These stink bombs definitely smell awful.  </li>
            <li> only one broke, and i now knew of their devastating power.</li>
            <li> It stinks and works well</li>

            <li> Wow do these bombs of stink really stink. I blew my whole load in one day! i put 12 of them in my own room and i couldnt sleep for days because the stench was so horrid. I want to order some more to eat so i could stink up my breath! boy do i smell horrible :)I would reccomend this product to anyone with feet.</li>
            <li> Had to break 3 in my house to get a reaction. Definitely not the room clearing power  I have found in the past.</li>
            <li> Great buy get it now. we cleared out a huge room with one of these :)</li>
            <li> This is not a good buy these are so weak, Not the glass is hard to break at that you got to toss them high or slam them hard. Not to ninja like when you can hear it. The smell is weak and takes a few then gos away fast..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MCL</li>
            <li> Very strong egg smell with a long hang time.  The down side is the glass container.  If you just drop it on the floor, there will be sharp glass left behind.  Very useful for a prank, but don&#x27;t let it backfire by someone getting hurt.  Please be careful with this one!</li>
            <li> These smell like eggs and can fill up entire buuldings in minutes. best if used in a poorly ventilated area.</li>
            <li> this product came in really good timing it was about 2 days after i ordered to start off. another thing i liked about this is that there are 36 vials so i already know it lasts for a while. i also popped one of these suckers in a room to test it and BOY DID THEY SMELL i took a whiff of it to see what kind of power it withholds. it lasted about 4 hours and i have to admit that was the one of the smelliest things i smelled in my LIFE. this product was really awesome and i recommend it for people who want to get revenge at some people</li>
            <li> Used it at work, used up all 12 boxes in 2 days, and then got sent home with out pay, it was so worth it</li>
            <li> These ampules brought back the good old days and huge belly laughs as well.  This stuff is really foul....disgusting....terrible and hilarious to boot.  I had complained numerous times about the lingering odor in my office building&#x27;s elevator to no avail.  Two of these babies under the mat near the push buttons got an almost instant response.  The office \\&quot;goof off\\&quot; always took a book to \\&quot;read\\&quot; while visiting the only restroom. quickly emerged, pants down around his ankles after someone placed a few of these under the toilet seat.  Teenager on neighborhood cul-de-sac played stereo so loud that all the windows in area would rattle.  We assumed he enjoyed some hearing defect. Well, three ampules injected between window seals with an unused ink cartridge syringe solved that problem.  The entire neighborhood could easily identify what he had for breakfast as he hastily exited his boombox clunker.  There&#x27;s more but I&#x27;m sure your imagination has already figured that out.  George Hayduke would be proud...</li>
            <li> The are awesome! They stink super bad. They smell a little worse than rotten eggs. The range in incredible.&lt;br /&gt;I busted one in Walmart, I could smell it nearly 120 feet away from where I busted it. They are in little glass vials, and the glass is thin so if you drop it, it&#x27;s more than likely going to bust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad and I have a blast! My dad is 30, I am 15. We go to restaraunts at the drive thru, when the person is turned around, we will throw one in the window and it will stink the whole area. It&#x27;s hilarious! I have a blast at these at school, at the mall , the public bathroom, just about anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate these 5/5, because they do stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing about it is that it&#x27;s pretty loud when you bust it. I usually throw down super fast, but another way is to stick it under your shoe and crush it, it&#x27;s STILL pretty loud, so I get an object, for example a pack of M&amp;M&#x27;s, and drop it as soon as I crush it. It covers up the sound perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;d hate to smell the inside of the factory that makes these!</li>
            <li> This stink bomb saved me from getting shot with a bb gun i threw it and the smell was so bad it made the the kid that was going to shoot me trowup irecomend this product.</li>
            <li> What can I say, these are hilarious but pretty mean. Be careful you can get yourself in trouble with these. I used to buy these all the time as a kid and caused quite a few scenes. I wouldn&#x27;t buy these for your kids, but if you have a cool boss they can be a lot of fun.</li>
            <li> A while back I used 4 of these at once in a small area and got very dizzy. Don&#x27;t ask.</li>
            <li> These stink bombs definitely smell awful.  Great if you have need of a very odoriferous attack.  You will need to figure out how to break them though.  Gently stepping on them seems to work the best but be careful not to step too hard, you do not want this stuff on your shoes!  I would also warn that it&#x27;s important to use good judgement with these little stinkers, using these in the workplace or formal events- usually not a good idea.</li>
            <li> People kept smoking outside of our building and the smoke would come in through our window on hot days.  So I secretly threw stink bombs int heir vicinity to clear them out.</li>
            <li> great item, very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> easy to break when u want to, almost silent but definitely violent! nearly had some people puking!!! love em will buy more later</li>
            <li> This item came like 2 days after the order was placed. The shipping is fast to Philadelphia but problem is, 1 stink bomb came broken. The product is good. I would give it a 5 star. This is not effective outside But it is indoor. My friend threw one of these in the class room and it stink up the whole place with in 30 second. It lasted for 2 hours, but the windows and fans were on.</li>
            <li> The stink bombs work great to have some fun. I use it most place were, I go Wal-Mart, Movie Theaters, and places were they give me bad service. Lots of fun. It&#x27;s funny seeing people reactions towards their face. It smells really nasty going to prank some friends. I am still thinking about popping a stink bomb in College, but don&#x27;t want to get exiled. Be sure to use with utmost discrete.</li>
            <li> Great for work, smell last for about 1 minute. SMELLS GROSS!!Love the product and you get so many for so cheap. Thank you</li>
            <li> I loove this stink bomb! i used one pack of three at school and so many people were grossed out by the smell! All you secretly have to do is either step on it (but it will get on your shoe, but just wash it off with water) or you throw it on the ground. What kinda sucked about it though was that it was kinda windy so don&#x27;t expect the smell to last long or be strong.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!</li>
            <li> These are powerful &amp; includes so many. Bought for my son as a stocking stuffer &amp; he now looks forward to playing pranks on his friends. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> Weak stuff. I remembered these from when I was a kid, so I got some as an adult. Doesn&#x27;t work very well. Look for my review on LIQUID ASS spray. That&#x27;s the stuff you want.</li>
            <li> They really stink!!! I popped one at the local Walmart, and omg the faces!!! They thought that the sewer was backing up! The only thing that I don&#x27;t like, is that the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Boy are they right about these. We use them to simulate natural gas leaks for our CERT simulations.  They get attention.</li>
            <li> Yes, it stinks, BUT... the &#x27;stinkradius&#x27; is very limited and it wears off pretty quick. They are not what they used to be... A STINKBOMB... not a stinkdud...</li>
            <li> i love these! i used these at a bar that i went to people were freaking out! the best way to use these is to put them in an empty water bottle and crush the little vial it will smell for like 20 minuets!!</li>
            <li> They were a fun purchase had lots of laughs with friends. Its a good thing to have for pranks and plain old fun.</li>
            <li> these things were great but be careful with them at school dont tell ANYONE you have them. if school superintendents find out youll end up suspended like me because &amp;#34;someone could be allergic to it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This was a great buy. Would of given 5 stars if smell lasted longer but great none the less. Made my coworker barf when I smashed one under her desk.!! Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Not as potent and long lasting as I remembered from when I was young.very weak.only recommend buying to stink a &amp;#34;small room&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stink.  Broke one outside and nothing.  NOTHING.  Shouldn&#x27;t stink bombs smell... bad?  Might as well be filled with tea.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stink that bad or for very long</li>
            <li> First one out of the box had some odor but next three,nothing. No smell at all. Bought these in the past from another seller and they smelled big time but these nada. Disappointed</li>
            <li> didnt work as well as the other brand</li>
            <li> lasts as long as a fart, and dos&#x27;nt smell that bad at all</li>
            <li> Great gag for the kids. Parents must supervise. The odor is potent and lasts a few minutes. Kids get a big laugh</li>
            <li> Very cool but was unable too use it do to a recent apartment fire that i jest went thru and it was burned</li>
            <li> My boyfriend launches these over the fence at our new meth addict neighbors and they have no idea where the stench is coming from. We&#x27;re hoping a few more weeks of this has them leaving our peaceful neighborhood. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It stinks and works well but...it doesn&#x27;t last very long. You have to throw a few to get the smell to last over a minute or 2. Best in Walmart bathrooms.</li>
            <li> This product works really well and is consistent. the only thing i dont like is the glass vile which is hard to open.You have to break the vile which leaves a mess on the ground or what i do is get a thick napkin and break the vile at the neck and then put the stinky solution on the napkin. The product itself works really good i mean really good and what i like is the smell is really stron but dosnt last so long as to ruin the joke</li>
            <li> We really enjoyed using these. The stink bombs received were actually in a different color box but that was not a problem.</li>
            <li> I threw one in a toy section at a store and from 30 feet away it smelled horrible !! dang it stinks i love these puppys</li>
            <li> The small does not last long and fades away quickly. Works better in doors. I have tried them at walmart and its hilarious. Give a shot</li>
            <li> I broke them in school and everyone got sick. It was awesome I highly recommend them for younger kids in school with teachers they hate. Act like you are toeing your shoe and set the stink bomb down, when you walk away step on it. Give it a second and wait for the reactions. Hilarious.</li>
            <li> These are the best toys ever. I&#x27;ve used them almost everywhere. At the movies cleared out a couple rows , in my parents room pissed them off , at school we had to leave the classroom i threw 6 of them in my library and they closed it down for a week investigating who did it. If your a kid you should get these stink bombs legit. But if your an adult its a necesity. There so much fun. Prank away guys</li>
            <li> definetly an aweome prankster toy, however you need to be extremly careful with these and do not get caught with them</li>
            <li> These stink bombs are the most rancid smelling thing ever!!!! today i smashed one in the bathroom at school and it smelled so horrendous  i almost puked!!! then heres the funny story. at school at the end of the day. i made sure to be one of the first people out the door and when i walked out the door i casualy dropped it on the ground  where everyone walks out of the school and walked on to my bus. and i just sat there on the bus watching everyones reaction out the window. ahahahah i was laughing my ass off!!!! the faces people made were hilarious! then two kids got on my bus and were like ohhh man it smells like ass over there!!! and i burst out laughing! funniest prank ever!!!! totaly worth the money!</li>
            <li> first impression... I open the package and DANG at least one of them is broken. a putrid smell wafts from the package  and at first i am disappointed, then proud. only one broke, and i now knew of their devastating power. btw im in summer school right now so.... ya. ive used at least 10 of these in class and my teacher is getting pissed... anyway no problems with the product besides a broken one, they smell great (terrible), and they are a great prank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMENDED!</li>
            <li> These things are awesome. They are very very very smelly and are great for pranks. Pop one and sit back and enjoy the comments and facial expressions!</li>
            <li> What is not to like about stink bombs?!  I have used these bombs for years and have had many laughs.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful and so pungent!!!</li>
            <li> Good for small areas, but these really aren&#x27;t that powerful. They don&#x27;t even smell that bad. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, but at least them were cheap.</li>
            <li> Only 1 worked out of the pack. Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> it doesnt smell at all</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;bomb\\&quot; consists of a little glass capsule containing a liquid.  Breaking the capsule (underfoot) emits a rotten egg-like smell.  What I like about using these is that since I know that it is actually NOT a rotten egg, the smell doesn&#x27;t really bother me personally.  But the uninitiated will assume it&#x27;s something foul, and seek to move away.  And it does dissipate eventually.  Create your own applications (overcrowded concert floors, rude bar scenes, the DMV).  Countless applications.  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> These are the same exact stink bombs we used to use in high school.  They packaged fine so I haven&#x27;t worried about them breaking in the box.  For me, they only work when I step on them rather than throwing them against the ground.  Beautiful rotten egg stink.  Have fun!</li>
            <li> Popped some of these off at work and was really impressed with the horrid stench - but be warned, it doesn&#x27;t dissipate near as fast as the box implies.</li>
            <li> First I broke one in my small bathroom, and ok not really that smelly, but good enough for others to hate it. So I tried the other two and broke them, its a little more powerful but this time the smell escaped my bathroom and ventured at least five feet away. My best advice is break them in a bottle like someone said and put it somewhere where it can release the smell. Like inside a heater vent!!! Anyways I plan on using this in that manner since I experienced this for myself. Not too strong but noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2/11/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something really nasty look up Nasal Nausea. That one will linger all day!!!! ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I am not responsible for any pranks you pull with this bottle. It may be small but it goes a long ways!!!!</li>
            <li> Must work well by the looks on their faces.</li>
            <li> It is perfect, quick smellin, no one knows what happened but by then it was too late. U can&#x27;t drop them and walk away they have to b stepped on or dropped with real force but u don&#x27;t want that b/c it will get on u an that is a no go</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why people say that this is a bad product and such,  I broke one in the laundry room and immediately smelled and smirked cause of a childhood memory.  I figured I&#x27;d go in the living room to get away from the smell... Nope it followed through the kitchen into the living room were talking at least 20 feet away and I can still smell it  now.  Definitely will buy more when I run close to being out.  5/5 stars</li>
            <li> It was very bad shipping took Realy long and then the products weren&#x27;t as great</li>
            <li> I have used these type of stink bombs in the past , maybe a different manufacturer , but these stink bombs had virtually no smell at all . I would ask for a full refund if they were more expensive . I guess the gag was on me . Don&#x27;t waste your money .</li>
            <li> Excellent product with fast delivery</li>
            <li> I have to laugh.  These have given me endless hours of entertainment.</li>
