            <li>I love this oil!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this is the best face oil for my toddler and weeks old infant son.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;AND it does more for more my skin than any product I&#x27;ve tried before in terms of softness and  moisture.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t get better than this.</li>
            <li>I love this oil  </li>
            <li>The skin is getting better and the itch stopped.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This way I get to moisturize while preventing sunburn, with a healthy product.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to stay in the sun for about an hour without getting burned.</li>
            <li>They have the highest ethics and the best quality of any vendors out there selling similar products.  </li>
            <li>I love it for myself too.  </li>
            <li>I love this carrot seed oil.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much softer, hydrated and happy with this oil.</li>
            <li>Another great item for my natural homemade sunscreen!</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this!It smells so clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>a strong scent and</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and continues to keep my skin from feeling itchy.  </li>
            <li>I like using a natural oil rather than a suncreen that has additional things in it that aren&#x27;t always good for the skin.  </li>
            <li>very nice and definitely nourishing and healing!</li>
            <li>Really happy with the product, having fun making my own personal blend...would totally buy it again.  </li>
            <li>It soaks in quickly, and is keeping my basal skin spots softened and at bay.  </li>
            <li>am pregnant so it helps to soothe my irritated skin sometimes .</li>
            <li>It comes in a glass bottle, it has a nice earthy scent, and the oil is a nice green color.</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit &#x27;natural&#x27; but I love it.</li>
            <li>However, I am not crazy about the smell.  </li>
            <li>It is worth its weight in gold.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different shea terra oils for my face and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I follow this basic routine twice a day: I was with unscented Dove sensitive skin soap and a silicone pad and warm water, spray my face with a little rosewater (mostly because it feels good, doesn&#x27;t do much I expect), then I use 2 pumps of carrot seed oil on my neck and face.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is organic and pure!</li>
            <li>Some info:&lt;br /&gt;Carrot seed oil may be the most underrated essential oil in aromatherapy, but there’s nothing but wellness surrounding this powerful detoxifier and skin rejuvenator.</li>
            <li>And I received the product fast!</li>
            <li>Getting ready to use it on my homemade sunblock recipe!</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t ever go back to that creamy pasty plankton killing sunscreen again! :))</li>
            <li>I bought this for the price, and what it looks like and smells like is semi rancid olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;Carrot seed oil is not green, and it smells sweet.</li>
            <li>professionally packaged and quick shipping.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t help much.</li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be very nourishing.  </li>
            <li>The oil is very soothing .I</li>
            <li>Wow this is expensive but best price for amount</li>
            <li>On top of that, the oil has a natural SPF of 38 to 40, so it can be used as a topical sunscreen.</li>
            <li>i put a high quality lotion over top because it is oily but that is to be expected because its an oil  </li>
            <li>It may not be for those who are used to chemical scents but with a little natural essential oil added to it makes a great multi purpose moisturizes and sun protector.</li>
            <li>It is green, and has a very nice herbaceous scent, which tells me it has been minimally processed.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave me looking shiny at the end of a long day.  </li>
            <li>A few drops of this makes a really nice nighttime facial moisturizer</li>
            <li>And again, it&#x27;s all natural.  </li>
            <li>it leaves my skin so soft and gives it a sunkissed glow.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my face soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>The oil is very concentrated I am going to use it  to make a sunscreen lotion, so I will comment again as soon as We come back from Vacation.</li>
            <li>I added this to my natural skincare routine and I like it.  </li>
            <li>I use this as suncreen since it naturally has spf of about 25 in it.  </li>
            <li>Its soft earthy smell initiates the stress-relieving characteristics in the oil, and when the oil is applied to the skin, epidermal cells are stimulated, which keeps wrinkles in check.</li>
            <li>It was originally purchased so I could make sunscreen (due to its natural SPF), but I&#x27;ve been using it daily along with my avocado oil and sesame oil.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The main purpose of the oil is for skin, particularly facial skin health.</li>
            <li>I have a very hard time finding skin care products that effectively moisturizes my skin (I am in my 30s and definitely need moisture these days) without triggering acne or eczema.  </li>
            <li>carrot seed oil has a natural SPF 15-20 which means no sunscreen necessary.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because carrot essential oil is supposed to be a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil to anyone with dry skin</li>
            <li>It smells very earthy, much like like wet soil after a heavy rain.</li>
            <li>It is great for any redness blotchiness, excessive dryness, random rashes</li>
            <li>If you find it too rich for your complexion try thinning it down a little with a lighter oil like shea terra&#x27;s tsamma melon seed, marula, baobab or argan - or get some jojoba oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Carrot oil is actually green - I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewer is referring to and does have a slightly sweet smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing I can say is that it does have a little bit of a strong medicinal odor, but the odor is not strong enough to stop me from buying it again</li>

            <li> I have a very hard time finding skin care products that effectively moisturizes my skin (I am in my 30s and definitely need moisture these days) without triggering acne or eczema.  I recently suffered another eczema outbreak on my neck and face.  Aside from being embarrassed to show my face in public, I was frustrated with my skin care regime and decided to adopt a K.I.S.S. approach- Keep It Simple, Stupid.  I follow this basic routine twice a day: I was with unscented Dove sensitive skin soap and a silicone pad and warm water, spray my face with a little rosewater (mostly because it feels good, doesn&#x27;t do much I expect), then I use 2 pumps of carrot seed oil on my neck and face.  My skin looks healthy, isn&#x27;t dry, and I have not experienced any reactions like dry patches, redness, acne, or eczema.  The oil smells earthy and I like it.  For me, this oil is awesome.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!  I can see and feel a difference in just a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li> I put this in my homemade lotion and face oil. Carrot seed oil is good for your skin.</li>
            <li> good product.  would buy again.  professionally packaged and quick shipping.</li>
            <li> very nice and definitely nourishing and healing!</li>
            <li> So far I love it. Even though I have oily skin the oil absorbs, moisturizes but isn&#x27;t heavy. The scent is a bit &#x27;natural&#x27; but I love it. It may not be for those who are used to chemical scents but with a little natural essential oil added to it makes a great multi purpose moisturizes and sun protector.</li>
            <li> Another great item for my natural homemade sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Nature knows best.  No chemicals.  No synthetics. No nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AND it does more for more my skin than any product I&#x27;ve tried before in terms of softness and  moisture.  It&#x27;s incredible.  I&#x27;d recommend it to any friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO carrot seed oil has a natural SPF 15-20 which means no sunscreen necessary.  And again, it&#x27;s all natural.  Can&#x27;t get better than this.</li>
            <li> Really happy with the product, having fun making my own personal blend...would totally buy it again.  And I received the product fast!</li>
            <li> Love this oil! A drop goes a long way! Getting ready to use it on my homemade sunblock recipe!</li>

            <li> I have some skin irration on my arms. I tried over-the-counter anti-itching cream. Didn&#x27;t help much. I saw results with just one application of this oil. The skin is getting better and the itch stopped.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works so well as sunscreen! Won&#x27;t ever go back to that creamy pasty plankton killing sunscreen again! :))</li>

            <li> I have been using this along with Emu Oil on my face. I love it.</li>
            <li> I added this to my natural skincare routine and I like it.  It was originally purchased so I could make sunscreen (due to its natural SPF), but I&#x27;ve been using it daily along with my avocado oil and sesame oil.  It&#x27;s a good addition to the mix.</li>
            <li> I use this as suncreen since it naturally has spf of about 25 in it.  It really works.  If I sweat or get wet I must reapply it.  I like using a natural oil rather than a suncreen that has additional things in it that aren&#x27;t always good for the skin.  This is VERY good for the skin.  This way I get to moisturize while preventing sunburn, with a healthy product.  The only time I&#x27;ll use a different suncreen is if I&#x27;m swimming or something like that.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this!It smells so clean and refreshing.Like being outdoors deep in the woods.Just got it today so I can not say how it works yet,but it SMELLS AWESOME!</li>
            <li> The carrot seed oil from Shea Organics is very good to my skin. It applies smoothly and continues to keep my skin from feeling itchy.  However, I am not crazy about the smell.  It smells to me a little like olive oil.  I camoflauge it with other lotion.</li>
            <li> Just trying this product.  It soaks in quickly, and is keeping my basal skin spots softened and at bay.  Seems to be very nourishing.  I bought it because carrot essential oil is supposed to be a natural sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! It is green, and has a very nice herbaceous scent, which tells me it has been minimally processed. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the price, and what it looks like and smells like is semi rancid olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;Carrot seed oil is not green, and it smells sweet. I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> Excellent oil excellent quality and smell.  Used in conjunction with rosehip seed oil and pomegranate</li>
            <li> Worked great as a sunscreen! I&#x27;m very fair complected and I was able to stay in the sun for about an hour without getting burned.</li>
            <li> Good Product! Smells like straw not carrots because it is carrot seed oil, not carrot oil.  Color is not orange like carrots, it is brownish-green, like the seeds.  I like that it is organic and pure!</li>
            <li> I have been buying from this company (Shea Terra Organics) for over a decade.  They have the highest ethics and the best quality of any vendors out there selling similar products.  Carrot oil is actually green - I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewer is referring to and does have a slightly sweet smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this is the best face oil for my toddler and weeks old infant son.  I love it for myself too.  It is great for any redness blotchiness, excessive dryness, random rashes etc.  It is worth its weight in gold.  If you find it too rich for your complexion try thinning it down a little with a lighter oil like shea terra&#x27;s tsamma melon seed, marula, baobab or argan - or get some jojoba oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great anti-aging oil too.</li>
            <li> I love this carrot seed oil. I use it as sunscreen mixed with other oils. It does the job beautifully. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I like the texture of the oil.  The oil is very soothing .I am pregnant so it helps to soothe my irritated skin sometimes . The only thing I can say is that it does have a little bit of a strong medicinal odor, but the odor is not strong enough to stop me from buying it again</li>
            <li> Great product for body lotions and sprays.&lt;br /&gt;Non a strong scent and that&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;The main purpose of the oil is for skin, particularly facial skin health.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different shea terra oils for my face and this is by far my favorite.  I have acne prone oily skin I use this as my primer/moisturizer before putting on mineral makeup.  It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave me looking shiny at the end of a long day.  It smells very earthy, much like like wet soil after a heavy rain.</li>
            <li> I started using this with my natural hair mixing it with other oils</li>
            <li> I was unable to use this more than once, as it cause massive, painful acne to pop out on my face.</li>
            <li> I have tried many oils that are supposed to have great healing qualities. Nothing compares to this oil. It comes in a glass bottle, it has a nice earthy scent, and the oil is a nice green color. My skin is so much softer, hydrated and happy with this oil. Some info:&lt;br /&gt;Carrot seed oil may be the most underrated essential oil in aromatherapy, but there’s nothing but wellness surrounding this powerful detoxifier and skin rejuvenator. Its soft earthy smell initiates the stress-relieving characteristics in the oil, and when the oil is applied to the skin, epidermal cells are stimulated, which keeps wrinkles in check. Carrot seed oil is known for its ability to alleviate skin problems like acne, eczema, psoriasis, ulcers, weeping sores, and boils. On top of that, the oil has a natural SPF of 38 to 40, so it can be used as a topical sunscreen. http://www.essentialoilexchange.com/blog/carrot-seed-oil-and-its-benefits-for-skin-care/</li>
            <li> I used this to mix with other oils and butters. I cant comment on what it does on it&#x27;s own, but it was a great addition to my mix.</li>
