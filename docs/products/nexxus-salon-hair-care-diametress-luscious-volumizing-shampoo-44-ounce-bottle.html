            <li>and I won&#x27;t have to buy more, anytime soon!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that clear shampoo isn&#x27;t the best for color-treated hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Diametress for a while and have not found a suitable replacement nor a better shampoo product</li>
            <li>It has a very light fragrance</li>
            <li>And ever since then, I haven&#x27;t been able to use anything else.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I have been using Diametress for many years, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Though I love this product ,I won&#x27;t be buying anymore for that reason alone</li>
            <li>It just works better for me than anyother shampoo.</li>
            <li>I used to love Diametress, but I believe the formula was changed.  </li>
            <li>I love diametress shampoo as it gives my hair body...makes it look thicker which I can use these days</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this unless I find something I like better.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>top is convenient to keep in the shower.</li>
            <li>It is extremely volumizing, it smells great and provides great body.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and the price is right on!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and it seems to make it thicker.</li>
            <li>my fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this product gives your hair volume as described.&lt;br /&gt;Pump</li>
            <li>Because the posted reviews were (apparently) overly kind to this particular shampoo, and because the price was attractive, I tried it.</li>
            <li>nowhere near as good as the original</li>
            <li>It comes out squeaky clean after every washing and perks up my hair.  </li>
            <li>Love the product and it was super cheap for what the value really is.</li>
            <li>I purchased the 44 ounce size of this shampoo at a special discount price offered by Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am writing this review because we used to be able to buy this product at a much lower price point.</li>
            <li>Have used this shampoo for years, the price is so good in bulk could not resist buying them through Amazon, which I do every time I am close to running low.</li>
            <li>I love my new Nexus Salon Hair Care  Diametress Luscious Volumizing Shampoo!</li>
            <li>I have oily fine hair and this shampoos really does boost up the volume!  </li>
            <li>I thought I needed to cut my hair because every time I used it it would get more and more tangled, would NOT brush out without tangles... until I switched back to the old shampoo I had and its been tangle free ever since!</li>
            <li>I was using Big and Sexy Hair shampoo with volume and it in no way compares to the Nexxus!</li>
            <li>This is an economical way to purchase this Nexxus product.</li>
            <li>I knew right away</li>
            <li>The new formula has the same desired effect of giving body to the hair with a better scent and much better lather.</li>
            <li>It gives my fine hair lots of volume and doesn&#x27;t dry it or makes it greasy like most shampoos do.</li>
            <li>Yes, we both like it which could quite possibly be a first in our household.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I gambled and got the really big 44 oz bottle.</li>
            <li>The bottle I just got was a new formula that I like much better than the old one.</li>
            <li>The old formula didn&#x27;t smell very good and it was rather thick.</li>
            <li>It takes so little to thoroughly clean my hair (I am used to using a lot of shampoo) and it does give my hair more body.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate having the large size bottle</li>
            <li>This has a good, sensitive  dispenser, and I may not have to track the stuff down again for two years!</li>
            <li>THanks again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was very dissapointing to get this on and the feel of it</li>
            <li>I need as much volumizing as I can get, and this really does the trick.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks much thicker than before.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really does make my semi-thin, wimpy hair feel thicker.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t it too much?</li>
            <li>correct produce and fast delivery</li>
            <li>The shampoo seems to really get my hair clean and give it extra volume.</li>
            <li>I like Pantene Pro-V full and thick shampoo better</li>
            <li>nothing more or less.</li>
            <li>There is nothing particularly volumizing about this shampoo.</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li>price is a bit high now</li>
            <li>Highly recommended it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other products and this one works for my limp, straight, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>But I just got it a few days, wish it could do more.</li>
            <li>My hair felt more coarse and dry after using it.</li>
            <li>Okay, its a little expensive for my budget, but I&#x27;ve used it for a few years now and its the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.  </li>
            <li>After I tried nexxus for the first time, I was taken back by how soft my hair was.</li>
            <li>I glad I found it, as it is hard to find</li>
            <li>thin, fine hair, this product gives me just the right amount of &amp;#34;omph&amp;#34; with no stickiness that leads to breakage.</li>
            <li>This is clear shampoo and it used to be creamy -</li>
            <li>I like it because it is a clear shampoo and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>THIS is the only thing in 30 years I&#x27;ve found that really works.  </li>
            <li>Soft hair, with no build up and not itchy.  </li>
            <li>Being using it and so far seems like it works for me.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to reorder so frequently.  </li>
            <li>bottle again, since it&#x27;s a much cheaper alternative than the smaller bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does what its supposed to do as far as volumizing is concerned.</li>
            <li>Also works well as far as controlling the oil.  </li>
            <li>but I guess it would work really well for short hair because it definitely has the protein-bonding technology or whatever it says.</li>
            <li>Last a long time, don&#x27;t really feel thickening hair</li>
            <li>Now the charge is the same as you would pay at nearly any retail market or hair salon that sells it.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair so it can be a little limp with any shampoo that contains moisturizing elements.</li>
            <li>Being thin and fine</li>
            <li>My go to shampoo for my thin fine hair.  </li>

            <li> Being thin and fine</li>
            <li> My go to shampoo for my thin fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other newer products, but I keep coming back to my old standbys.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy the 13.5 ounce bottle at Target since they sell it for a reasonable price but noticed this 44 oz bottle at 25.00</li>
            <li> Really dont wish to be double negative but something happen to this</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over 20 years, maybe over 25, and have tried numerous other brands and always come back to Diametress.</li>
            <li> NOT for long hair in my experience- beware!</li>
            <li> It has changed over the past few years, not as thick in the formula, but still better than the other brands I have tried and wasted the money on.</li>
            <li> Luscious Volumizing Shampoo 44 Ounce...and cost a lot and is not what I expected</li>
            <li> Item came as expected</li>
            <li> The small bottle is the same price at beauty stores.</li>
            <li> I went a while without it trying other shampoo&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It really does make my hair feel thicker without being sticky or difficult to rinse out.  </li>
            <li> So, I broke down and bought it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would not recommend and would recommend staying with your previous product.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of d 44oz for less than 20 $ each.</li>
            <li> Wish I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased such a large bottle.  :-(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; means, but it does not leave my hair and scalp feeling oily like the Nexus shampoo/conditioner combination product.</li>
            <li> In the past I have used Nexus products here and there</li>
            <li> As is the case with all Nexus products, this item is ordinary.</li>
            <li> I read some of the other reviews and can&#x27;t understand why they are not happy with this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it forever, but was tired of the little bottles, and tired of trying to figure out which store might be carrying it.  </li>
            <li> it is not a good shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was looking frail &amp; thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it three times and am not impressed.</li>
            <li> Scary!!</li>
            <li> Totally unfair..!!</li>

            <li> After I tried nexxus for the first time, I was taken back by how soft my hair was. And ever since then, I haven&#x27;t been able to use anything else. This product doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I always recommend nexxus.</li>
            <li> I love my new Nexus Salon Hair Care  Diametress Luscious Volumizing Shampoo! It feels great after styling your hair! Try it, you will be pleased!</li>
            <li> Last a long time, don&#x27;t really feel thickening hair</li>
            <li> I am loving this brand!  I was using Big and Sexy Hair shampoo with volume and it in no way compares to the Nexxus!</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo, ever! This is the biggest bottle of shampoo that I&#x27;ve ever bought, also. It must be something that beauty shops purchase! I love it and I won&#x27;t have to buy more, anytime soon!</li>
            <li> I have tried many other products and this one works for my limp, straight, fine hair.  It comes out squeaky clean after every washing and perks up my hair.  I did not like the companion Sublime Volume conditioner.  I use just a dab of the Humectress conditioner but I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Being thin and fine my while like, trust me, I have tried every product that says it will thicken.  THIS is the only thing in 30 years I&#x27;ve found that really works.  Been a hairdresser for 20 yrs and Diametress is the only product I use in the shampoo line and I do about 500 a day.  THanks again.</li>
            <li> I have been using Diametress for many years, and I love it.  It really does make my hair feel thicker without being sticky or difficult to rinse out.  I follow it with Nexxus&#x27; leave-in conditioner, and I also use their mousse and hair spray.  I have tried other newer products, but I keep coming back to my old standbys.  LOVE THEM!!!</li>
            <li> best shampoo for volume on the market. I&#x27;ve tried them all and nothing works as well as this product. buy it</li>
            <li> My go to shampoo for my thin fine hair.  But, I forgot to mention in my review for the conditioner, Nexxus now tests on animals. Though I love this product ,I won&#x27;t be buying anymore for that reason alone</li>
            <li> I bought the shampoo and conditioner at Walmart. I&#x27;ve used it three times and am not impressed. My hair felt more coarse and dry after using it. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I dont know if anyone else has had the same experience... This product literally makes my medium-long hair velcro to itself!! It is awful but I guess it would work really well for short hair because it definitely has the protein-bonding technology or whatever it says. I thought I needed to cut my hair because every time I used it it would get more and more tangled, would NOT brush out without tangles... until I switched back to the old shampoo I had and its been tangle free ever since! Scary!! NOT for long hair in my experience- beware!</li>
            <li> My friend suggest my this product.I bought it for my dropping hairs after bath. It did improve my conditions. My hair looks shiner after using it. But I just got it a few days, wish it could do more.</li>
            <li> Great product, does what I want in a shampoo.  I glad I found it, as it is hard to find</li>
            <li> Yes, we both like it which could quite possibly be a first in our household.  I&#x27;m not sure what &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; means, but it does not leave my hair and scalp feeling oily like the Nexus shampoo/conditioner combination product.</li>
            <li> Great, I use this pro. Over 36 years, so my husband like it too! My daughter use it too. Ya!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. It just works better for me than anyother shampoo. I have fine hair and it seems to make it thicker. Thought this was a great price.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 44 ounce size of this shampoo at a special discount price offered by Amazon. I have always used a volumizing shampoo. In the past I have used Nexus products here and there and franky I have never been impressed with Nexus quality. Nexus is a mass marketed product found everywhere. Because the posted reviews were (apparently) overly kind to this particular shampoo, and because the price was attractive, I tried it. The result ? I just printed out my Amazon return label ! There is nothing particularly volumizing about this shampoo.As is the case with all Nexus products, this item is ordinary. If you like mass merchandised products, ie; shampoos, cosmetics and such, you will find this shampoo acceptable, nothing more or less.</li>
            <li> I used to love Diametress, but I believe the formula was changed.  This is clear shampoo and it used to be creamy - I&#x27;ve heard that clear shampoo isn&#x27;t the best for color-treated hair.  Wish I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased such a large bottle.  :-(</li>
            <li> This is an economical way to purchase this Nexxus product. A good body building shampoo when used in conjunction with the Nexxus Diametress conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love diametress shampoo as it gives my hair body...makes it look thicker which I can use these days (:</li>
            <li> Soft hair, with no build up and not itchy.  Only need to buy twice a year! Packaged well. No damage.</li>
            <li> Really dont wish to be double negative but something happen to this formula.&lt;br /&gt;It was very dissapointing to get this on and the feel of it I knew right away it is not a good shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend and would recommend staying with your previous product. I went back to the nexxus Therappe Shampoo.</li>
            <li> The Nexxus Luscious Volumizing Shampoo is an excellent shampoo. It takes so little to thoroughly clean my hair (I am used to using a lot of shampoo) and it does give my hair more body. I use a Nexxus volumizing mousse afterwards and that helps with volume and with styling.</li>
            <li> good results will order again. price is a bit high now</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo for anyone like me with thinnish or wispyish hair.  I have been using it forever, but was tired of the little bottles, and tired of trying to figure out which store might be carrying it.  This has a good, sensitive  dispenser, and I may not have to track the stuff down again for two years!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product exclusively and gets great results. I am writing this review because we used to be able to buy this product at a much lower price point. Now the charge is the same as you would pay at nearly any retail market or hair salon that sells it. Bring back the deals and you will increase YOUR volume Amazon.</li>
            <li> I order Nexxus Salon Hair Care Diametress Luscious Volumizing Shampoo 44 Ounce...and cost a lot and is not what I expected</li>
            <li> This shampoo does seem to thicken (feels thicker) my fine hair.  Will continue to use it.  My hair seems to be healthier.</li>
            <li> One of the things that helps show the quality of a shampoo is the amount you need to use to do the job. This product is very good, cleans well and adds volume to your hair.</li>
            <li> Love the product and it was super cheap for what the value really is. The small bottle is the same price at beauty stores.</li>
            <li> Have been using Nexxus products for years. They have always been quality although at a cost. A 13 oz bottle can run you $13 - $15 in the stores. Here we have a 32 oz bottle for $18 !!!!  enough said!</li>
            <li> Okay, its a little expensive for my budget, but I&#x27;ve used it for a few years now and its the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair.  I need as much volumizing as I can get, and this really does the trick.  Highly recommended it.  Smells great too.  Boyfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> Very good product! I like Pantene Pro-V full and thick shampoo better but Pantene has stopped production. However, this is a close substitute and seller was excellent to deal with.</li>
            <li> This is the best volumizing shampoo I have used. I have been using it for over 20 years, maybe over 25, and have tried numerous other brands and always come back to Diametress. It has changed over the past few years, not as thick in the formula, but still better than the other brands I have tried and wasted the money on. Great price for this size!</li>
            <li> My hair looks much thicker than before. Being using it and so far seems like it works for me. My hair was looking frail &amp; thin. It still looks frail but does look like it has good volume</li>
            <li> nowhere near as good as the original</li>
            <li> Item came as expected</li>
            <li> I like it because it is a clear shampoo and doesn&#x27;t leave any greasy residue.  It has a very light fragrance and I appreciate having the large size bottle so I don&#x27;t have to reorder so frequently.  I will continue to buy this unless I find something I like better.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and the price is right on! It gives my fine hair lots of volume and doesn&#x27;t dry it or makes it greasy like most shampoos do.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. The bottle I just got was a new formula that I like much better than the old one. The old formula didn&#x27;t smell very good and it was rather thick. The new formula has the same desired effect of giving body to the hair with a better scent and much better lather. I also like that Amazon is carrying the 44 oz. bottle again, since it&#x27;s a much cheaper alternative than the smaller bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With thin, fine hair, this product gives me just the right amount of &amp;#34;omph&amp;#34; with no stickiness that leads to breakage.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really does make my semi-thin, wimpy hair feel thicker. The fragrance is understated and does not last beyond the shower.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Nexxus has made a quality product.  It does what its supposed to do as far as volumizing is concerned.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  I read some of the other reviews and can&#x27;t understand why they are not happy with this shampoo.  It is extremely volumizing, it smells great and provides great body.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. Works great.&lt;br /&gt;The only concern is it&#x27;s price. In mid 2013 I bought 3 of d 44oz for less than 20 $ each. Now I c it&#x27;s actually doubled (40$).. Isn&#x27;t it too much? Totally unfair..!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Diametress for a while and have not found a suitable replacement nor a better shampoo product so I continue to use it.  I&#x27;ve noticed some people, men or women have varying opinions so I can only speak of my results.  Try it and if you don&#x27;t like  it try something else.  I usually buy the 13.5 ounce bottle at Target since they sell it for a reasonable price but noticed this 44 oz bottle at 25.00 so I bought this because of the value per ounce price.</li>
            <li> Have used this shampoo for years, the price is so good in bulk could not resist buying them through Amazon, which I do every time I am close to running low. Smells great and does a wonderful job without having to use loads of shampoo.</li>
            <li> correct produce and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Good value.I have fine hair and this product gives your hair volume as described.&lt;br /&gt;Pump top is convenient to keep in the shower.</li>
            <li> They are not making it the same anymore...what happend, nexxus?</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!! It is a great product for a GREAT price!!</li>
            <li> I found this at Costco and was buying it regularily then they stopped selling it. I went a while without it trying other shampoo&#x27;s but they did not work as well. So, I broke down and bought it from Amazon. I have fine hair so it can be a little limp with any shampoo that contains moisturizing elements. The shampoo seems to really get my hair clean and give it extra volume.</li>
            <li> I have oily fine hair and this shampoos really does boost up the volume!  Also works well as far as controlling the oil.  I&#x27;m glad I gambled and got the really big 44 oz bottle.</li>
