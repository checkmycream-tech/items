            <li>i love it its amazing it worked exactly as it said it would convenient got here on it</li>

            <li>Lashes dont fall of and application is easy.</li>
            <li>IMHO these are more of a special occasion lash rather than an every day wear - AB</li>
            <li>These glam lashes are super neat!</li>
            <li>im super satisfied with it</li>
            <li>im super satisfied with it</li>
            <li>Used with cheap glue from wal mart.</li>
            <li>I read it&#x27;s important to wait 90 seconds before applying.</li>
            <li>People think they are real!!!  </li>
            <li>Absolutely beautiful, long and full.</li>
            <li>These were great the only reason I didn&#x27;t give them all Stars is because I have tried others (like M. A. C)  and they were a bit more real.</li>
            <li>Super light.</li>
            <li>Ardell 118&#x27;s are my absolute favorite lashes.</li>
            <li>They were fairly easy to apply, considering I am a first timer.</li>
            <li>I got a quick turnaround.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;m sure over time the buildup of glue could prevent new lashes from growing.</li>
            <li>Great look works well with the black glue - I always reorder this pack.</li>
            <li>Ardell lashes are pretty much my go to brand, they look and feel better than brands that are three or four times the price, and if you like me like that slutty porn star vibe (I do)</li>
            <li>I wanted dramatic eyes and these were perfect.</li>
            <li>very natural looking &amp; easy to apply...</li>
            <li>I love falsies in general because it ensures that my eyes will always be even.</li>
            <li>Soft band, and so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found Ardell lashes to be natural looking and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>These were exactly what i was looking for.</li>
            <li>I had to end up spending more money at the end of the day to get what I needed in time when I chose amazon and the automatic reoccurring purchase to make things easier it just because one big head ache.</li>
            <li>I love them and I wear them several times and look great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>first world</li>
            <li>They are not too over the top and add just enough to make your eyes stand out.</li>
            <li>Make sure when removing them you use jojoba oil to remove any left over glue on your eyelids and then wash well.</li>
            <li>With the right make-up they really pull a look together in my opinion.</li>
            <li>(they&#x27;re too big for any kind of natural look)but</li>
            <li>I had purchased others in the past for special occasions/pictures that didn&#x27;t seem to show up as much as i would have liked.</li>
            <li>These lashes are so long, it looks so unnatural and comical.</li>
            <li>It looks look very embellished, but not ridiculously fake.</li>
            <li>Good quality, but could have been a little more reasonably priced vs. other wholesalers</li>
            <li>I took them out of the packaging, did a dry fit on my eye, and couldn&#x27;t help but laugh - it looked like cartoon character</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t look like spiders on your eyes like some lashes do, instead they look extremely realistic...love them &amp; for this price, it&#x27;s easy to stock up!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Because I use them for stage, they got really abused.</li>
            <li>They work very well.</li>
            <li>Overall, I like them a lot and would reccomend for special occasions~</li>
            <li>Tried 3 different pairs before I found a pair that fit right, they were all different lengths.</li>
            <li>These lashes are great, very natural looking, the band is not too thick, they feel very natural, I use the Duo glue when applying the lashes and they last all day!</li>
            <li>They will give you a very glamour and still natural look.</li>
            <li>If you prefer a subtler or more tame look stick to the finer lashes ardell has to offer.</li>
            <li>Natural glamour!</li>
            <li>I love this brand and these are no different than any other ardell lashes I purchase.</li>
            <li>they are really pretty when you put mascara on them, but I needed thicker fuller lashes because my eyes are kinda big</li>
            <li>I really enjoy wearing false eyelashes... not just for special occasions, but for every day use as well.</li>
            <li>I have chronically dry eyes, and (naturally) very long eyelashes, and have always paid special attention to my lashes... using higher end mascara</li>
            <li>They look natural, they are all wrapped and new.  </li>
            <li>And easy to use a few times.</li>
            <li>very sexy and not too dramatic</li>
            <li>they are so beautiful, give your eyes such a dramatic look!</li>
            <li>They look so natural.</li>
            <li>Someone else put these on for me and had no trouble, but i did not put them on myself</li>
            <li>Does not look remotely natural</li>
            <li>but this just kept happening and wasn&#x27;t fixed in a timely fashion</li>
            <li>Still natural looking but clearly stand out</li>
            <li>when reading about the product and comparing these to others, i was believed that these are a natural look...</li>
            <li>Natural.</li>
            <li>I have used one pair for three occasions so far</li>
            <li>Only problem is I have big eyes, and the lashes do not cover the whole lid.</li>
            <li>You know how annoying it is when you complete the make up perfectly on one eye, only to screw it up on the second one.</li>
            <li>Ordered natural got something different did not like it.</li>
            <li>I normally use number 120, which are not quite as long and &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; looking as the 118, which is the only reason I rated these as 4 stars.</li>

            <li> but this just kept happening and wasn&#x27;t fixed in a timely fashion</li>
            <li> Still natural looking but clearly stand out</li>
            <li> when reading about the product and comparing these to others, i was believed that these are a natural look...</li>
            <li> Natural.</li>
            <li> I have used one pair for three occasions so far</li>
            <li> Only problem is I have big eyes, and the lashes do not cover the whole lid.</li>
            <li> You know how annoying it is when you complete the make up perfectly on one eye, only to screw it up on the second one.</li>
            <li> Ordered natural got something different did not like it.</li>
            <li> I normally use number 120, which are not quite as long and &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; looking as the 118, which is the only reason I rated these as 4 stars.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable and a dramatic length at the end on your eyes.</li>
            <li> I also do not think these are real ardell lashes as they seem to be very different in quality and shape than ones I have used in the past (perhaps factory seconds)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally very long lashes and normally the longer lashes are the same length or slightly longer - I wanted something to give me that &amp;#34;cat eye&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> They last a really long time without losing their shape.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes were too long and pushed on my glasses.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left with a small section, corner of eyelid left bare.</li>
            <li> This type is too long for me</li>
            <li> No natural</li>
            <li> Way way to long.</li>
            <li> The strip is a thin little thread which makes them really easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these until I opened the package - they are so long they are clownish and so fake looking.</li>
            <li> I use mine at least 5-6 times normally.</li>
            <li> These are pretty dramatic lashes.</li>
            <li> Very glamorous not too dramatic.</li>
            <li> They are dramatic yet still very natural looking.</li>
            <li> Looks Naturally Long !!!!!</li>
            <li> I use black eyelashes glue so that it looks like I have eyeliner on instead.</li>
            <li> Most lashes have a very thick baseline and are difficult to apply because they are so very stiff.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wedding after doing a little research.</li>
            <li> These are thin and flexible enough for my almond shaped eyes.</li>
            <li> I am tempted to wear these everyday.  </li>
            <li> if not more (depending on if I switch them up).</li>
            <li> I usually wear it for smokey eye looks.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I used the fan of a small makeup airbrush to accelerate the dying process before applying to my eyelids.</li>
            <li> I can usually keep a pair (either leave them on for 4 days,..or take them off and on for 7 days).</li>
            <li> I use black adhesive and like I said people always thin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not buy these unless it is for a Halloween costume, such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> and I wear a pair at least 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> They gave lots of length without being thick.</li>
            <li> Were much longer and fake appearing than pic!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used false eyelashes before.</li>
            <li> I purchased duo glue and applied it with a toothpick to the false lashes.</li>
            <li> These lashes give a fuller look towards the end of the eye making them look dramatic .</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t Believe how fake and unnatural these lashes look...</li>
            <li> After seminar gem the wrong product 2 times it then took 6 buisness daysbto return my money.</li>
            <li> I wear fake eyelashes every day</li>
            <li> I could not even tell I was wearing fake lashes.  </li>
            <li> These lashes were not uniform in shape and looked very fake when applied.  </li>
            <li> (I prefer Benefit&#x27;s line of mascaras), but after a while, I just got sick of the upkeep.</li>
            <li> Is very bad.</li>

            <li> Beautiful eye lashes.  They look so natural.</li>
            <li> Very light weight and easy to apply . These lashes give a fuller look towards the end of the eye making them look dramatic .</li>
            <li> These are pretty dramatic lashes. Excellent for those that want their eyes to be the centre of attention! :)</li>
            <li> Great lashes, great price, fast shipping. Would purchase these again from seller</li>
            <li> I bought these for my wedding after doing a little research. I had purchased others in the past for special occasions/pictures that didn&#x27;t seem to show up as much as i would have liked. These were exactly what i was looking for. I wanted dramatic eyes and these were perfect. If you are looking for something suttle these are probably not for you. With the right make-up they really pull a look together in my opinion. Someone else put these on for me and had no trouble, but i did not put them on myself so i can not comment on ease of use.</li>
            <li> Does not look remotely natural</li>
            <li> Great lashes !! Used with cheap glue from wal mart.</li>
            <li> These lashes are top quality and very nice looking.  So convenient to have them shipped to me in a bundle instead of waiting for them to be stocked in stores</li>
            <li> Loved these. They are nice and full. I wear these when I&#x27;m going for a glamourous look.</li>
            <li> Best deal ever!  I just ran out so i need to order more!  I get a lot of compliments when i wear these!  People think they are real!!!  In love üòç</li>
            <li> after remove the ends it is ok.</li>
            <li> Great look works well with the black glue - I always reorder this pack. I never have enough of them,</li>
            <li> I could not wear these with glasses. The eyelashes were too long and pushed on my glasses. I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t Believe how fake and unnatural these lashes look... Will never purchase these lashes again. 118 looks so fake would be ok for Halloween or costume party.</li>
            <li> Tried 3 different pairs before I found a pair that fit right, they were all different lengths. Some lash pairs had mismatched lengths.</li>
            <li> Soft band, and so easy to apply. They&#x27;re great for every eye shape! And easy to use a few times. I use mine at least 5-6 times normally.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get these until I opened the package - they are so long they are clownish and so fake looking. I have naturally very long lashes and normally the longer lashes are the same length or slightly longer - I wanted something to give me that &amp;#34;cat eye&amp;#34; look. I also do not think these are real ardell lashes as they seem to be very different in quality and shape than ones I have used in the past (perhaps factory seconds)&lt;br /&gt;Do not buy these unless it is for a Halloween costume, such a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes!  I wear mine for days at a time without taking them off with no problem.</li>
            <li> Absolutely beautiful, long and full.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes.  I find I can soak them in alcohol and peel off the glue and wear the same set over and over for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this lashes! they are so beautiful, give your eyes such a dramatic look! I cant feel them after I&#x27;ve put them on, they are weightless! I use same brand glue, works perfect! Lashes dont fall of and application is easy.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful. Ver elegant, but also obviously fake. Overall, I like them a lot and would reccomend for special occasions~</li>
            <li> After seminar gem the wrong product 2 times it then took 6 buisness daysbto return my money. I had to end up spending more money at the end of the day to get what I needed in time when I chose amazon and the automatic reoccurring purchase to make things easier it just because one big head ache. I do understand things happen but this just kept happening and wasn&#x27;t fixed in a timely fashion</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great quality. 4 pairs included.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes. I wear fake eyelashes every day and I can get about a month&#x27;s wear out of these, if not more (depending on if I switch them up). I apply them with Duo eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> I use these for stage. They are fabulous! They gave lots of length without being thick. No caterpillar eyelashes! And you can&#x27;t beat the price. I am going to start keeping them in bulk. Because I use them for stage, they got really abused. Still, I was able to use a set 2-3 times. I will make this purchase again and again.</li>
            <li> I usually wear it for smokey eye looks. Very glamorous not too dramatic. This is one of my fav lashes.</li>
            <li> I love them and I wear them several times and look great.&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Good quality, but could have been a little more reasonably priced vs. other wholesalers I deal with. Timing made me have to order through this dealer.</li>
            <li> These lashes are great, I wear them for work 5 days a week and always get complimented on them, they look natural enough that people always think they&#x27;re my own and are a great addition to my makeup. The strip is a thin little thread which makes them really easy to apply. I use black adhesive and like I said people always thin they&#x27;re my actual lashes. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy wearing false eyelashes... not just for special occasions, but for every day use as well. I have chronically dry eyes, and (naturally) very long eyelashes, and have always paid special attention to my lashes... using higher end mascara (I prefer Benefit&#x27;s line of mascaras), but after a while, I just got sick of the upkeep. I love falsies in general because it ensures that my eyes will always be even. You know how annoying it is when you complete the make up perfectly on one eye, only to screw it up on the second one. I know... first world problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found Ardell lashes to be natural looking and easy to put on. I normally use number 120, which are not quite as long and &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; looking as the 118, which is the only reason I rated these as 4 stars. IMHO these are more of a special occasion lash rather than an every day wear - AB</li>
            <li> These lashes were not uniform in shape and looked very fake when applied.  I&#x27;ve used Ardell before and they were of better quality.  Wouldn&#x27;t purchase on line again.  Sometimes you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes.  They look natural, they are all wrapped and new.  I will be purchasing more from them.  I got a quick turnaround.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be deceived by the picture. These lashes are so long, it looks so unnatural and comical. I took them out of the packaging, did a dry fit on my eye, and couldn&#x27;t help but laugh - it looked like cartoon character lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to amp up your Halloween costume, these lashes are perfect. Otherwise, if you&#x27;re looking to use them for a night out or for added lash volume, get something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are going back.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, they give a cat eye look without having to deal with the frustration of putting on eyeliner evenly.</li>
            <li> Natural glamour! These are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Looks Naturally Long !!!!! Love Love Love</li>
            <li> Were much longer and fake appearing than pic!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered natural got something different did not like it. Did not use it.</li>
            <li> I wear lashes every day because mascara runs on my face and these look great!! Still natural looking but clearly stand out</li>
            <li> when reading about the product and comparing these to others, i was believed that these are a natural look... nope... :/ but still a nice pair if going out for fun with the girls..</li>
            <li> They will give you a very glamour and still natural look.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and these are no different than any other ardell lashes I purchase. Great length and fullness.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and look very nice on. They are not too over the top and add just enough to make your eyes stand out.</li>
            <li> they are great quality lashes my customers really likethem alot.</li>
            <li> I like them they are really pretty when you put mascara on them, but I needed thicker fuller lashes because my eyes are kinda big</li>
            <li> Love the price, and love these lashes for dance performances.  Excellent for having in makeup kit and would definitely order again.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite brand of eyelashes. They work very well. I use black eyelashes glue so that it looks like I have eyeliner on instead. It looks look very embellished, but not ridiculously fake.</li>
            <li> I like these a lot. Basically, if you like what you see in the picture, then you should be happy.</li>
            <li> I recently moved to Europe and had been living a drab life of lackluster lashes, then it dawned in me to order my Ardells off amazon!  I haven&#x27;t regretted it, I always get #118 and LOVE them.  They&#x27;re here within the week and look amazing.  I 100% recommend.  I buy one of these 4-packs once a month.</li>
            <li> Look good. Natural. Only problem is I have big eyes, and the lashes do not cover the whole lid. I&#x27;m left with a small section, corner of eyelid left bare. I&#x27;ve never used false eyelashes before. They were fairly easy to apply, considering I am a first timer. I purchased duo glue and applied it with a toothpick to the false lashes. I used the fan of a small makeup airbrush to accelerate the dying process before applying to my eyelids. I read it&#x27;s important to wait 90 seconds before applying. They lasted all day and night. I read how some re-use the same lash for weeks. I don&#x27;t know how that it possible or sanitary. Make sure when removing them you use jojoba oil to remove any left over glue on your eyelids and then wash well. Otherwise, I&#x27;m sure over time the buildup of glue could prevent new lashes from growing.</li>
            <li> Beautiful look natural</li>
            <li> These are great quality lashes! This type is too long for me (they&#x27;re too big for any kind of natural look)but they do hold up well.</li>
            <li> great eyelashes, very lite, look great :-)</li>
            <li> These were great the only reason I didn&#x27;t give them all Stars is because I have tried others (like M. A. C)  and they were a bit more real.</li>
            <li> Ardell lashes are a must have product if you love falsies. They are comfortable and a dramatic length at the end on your eyes.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and look way better then Andrea still lashes. Can&#x27;t even feel them on,..I can usually keep a pair (either leave them on for 4 days,..or take them off and on for 7 days). Super light.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes fit beautifully and I love wearing them.</li>
            <li> These are some of my favorite lashes. Most lashes have a very thick baseline and are difficult to apply because they are so very stiff. These are thin and flexible enough for my almond shaped eyes. I love wearing these lashes.</li>
            <li> staple for my makeup looks. very sexy and not too dramatic</li>
            <li> The best there is is Ardell!</li>
            <li> These glam lashes are super neat! Of course if you know how to put them on correctly, best deal yet!!!</li>
            <li> I am tempted to wear these everyday.  I could not even tell I was wearing fake lashes.  I have used one pair for three occasions so far and they still look brand new - great prodcut.</li>
            <li> I saved $1.50 each for these compared to buying them at the store.  Fast deliver, excellent quality and super savings ~ what more can you ask for!  Subscribed to have these sent to me at home now.</li>
            <li> these are my favorite eyelashes...very natural looking &amp; easy to apply...they don&#x27;t look like spiders on your eyes like some lashes do, instead they look extremely realistic...love them &amp; for this price, it&#x27;s easy to stock up!</li>
            <li> My favorite lashes. :)</li>
            <li> Ardell lashes are pretty much my go to brand, they look and feel better than brands that are three or four times the price, and if you like me like that slutty porn star vibe (I do) these are the perfect lashes.  If you prefer a subtler or more tame look stick to the finer lashes ardell has to offer.</li>
            <li> Ardell 118&#x27;s are my absolute favorite lashes. They last a really long time without losing their shape. They are dramatic yet still very natural looking. I love them and order about 4-5 pair a month. That&#x27;s all I need for an entire month and I wear a pair at least 3 times a week. Love these!</li>
            <li> i love it its amazing it worked exactly as it said it would convenient got here on it im super satisfied with it love love love i love it its amazing it worked exactly as it said it would convenient got here on it im super satisfied with it love love love</li>
            <li> Perfect easy to apply...</li>
            <li> These lashes are great, very natural looking, the band is not too thick, they feel very natural, I use the Duo glue when applying the lashes and they last all day!</li>
            <li> Is very bad. No natural</li>
            <li> Way way to long. If your going on the town, these are your lashes, but they say the are &amp;#34; natural&amp;#34; looking. NOT even close</li>
