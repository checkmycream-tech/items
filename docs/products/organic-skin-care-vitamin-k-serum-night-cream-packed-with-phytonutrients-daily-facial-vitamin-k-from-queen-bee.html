            <li>I will now try even more of what they have to offer.  </li>

            <li>:) Thank you :))))))</li>

            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE THE PACKAGING AND</li>
            <li>Great product seems to really help.</li>
            <li>it is not a serum like, it more of an oil</li>
            <li>My favorite part is the smell.</li>
            <li>Nice light scent.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly, soaks into your skin and gives a nice glow.  </li>
            <li>love love love.  </li>
            <li>I really do love it.</li>
            <li>The oil would sit on top of my skin for hours.</li>
            <li>Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>has been greatly strengthening my skin, doesn&#x27;t really make irritated bumps go away</li>
            <li>Love the scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to say that both disappeared, but they haven&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>So many customers raved about the fragrance</li>
            <li>but this serum does not have an appealing fragrance at all.  </li>
            <li>Great product for sensitive skin with face veins.</li>
            <li>the smell is amazing, but the results are really extraordinary, smooth, supple skin, zero blemishes, evenness, and the lines between my eyes has softened too.  </li>
            <li>The smell is phenomenal - makes me smile every time I put it on!  </li>
            <li>They were very quick to ship tooâ€¦.plus</li>
            <li>All of these ingredients are combined to bring the ultimate fresh (best quality) vitamin pack we could conceive.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>You see results very quickly.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong ylang-ylang.  </li>
            <li>I love this Serum, its made with lots of great essential oils and seems very pure and is lovely.</li>
            <li>Just bought and started using this recently, so can&#x27;t speak to the long-term efficacy, but it smells great and makes my skin feel silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>And it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>My skin is moist, irritant free.  </li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this oil when i bought some thing else of theirs</li>
            <li>and they give you free samples.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a lil cheap</li>
            <li>I read all these fantastic reviews and bought a bottle</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic</li>
            <li>I bought this in hopes of making light spider veins go away.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>I love the way this feels on my skin, moisturizing and luxurious, and it is an oil but absorbs in right away and is not causing me any clogged pores or the like</li>
            <li>but I am confident it is moisturizing and will have good long term effects towards battling aging</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>serum is rich in A, B, C, D, E and K vitamins.</li>
            <li>Quality oils are used in this product and I loved the personal touch and a free sample that the seller added to my order.</li>
            <li>This is easily applied and quickly absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>It is a straight up oil, so serum is more accurate.</li>
            <li>This has some good amount of essential oils too.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product</li>
            <li>I think all these good reviews are fake,&amp;#34; so my expectations were low.  </li>
            <li>This works very well - probably better than anything I have used</li>
            <li>I read so many wonderful reviews and thought it would be worth the money if it would lighten my broken capillaries and help my rosacea.</li>
            <li>and I have notice how the veins are vanishing, SUPER....</li>
            <li>I love it and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>This stuff is very effective and fast acting!</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day or just once if its very hot out-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really quite strong.  </li>
            <li>but my skin absorbs the oils and leaves it fresh and dewy.  </li>
            <li>worth the price</li>
            <li>Worth a try.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Love it by trying so many other products.</li>
            <li>I use this mainly on my decolletage it helps with fine lines.</li>
            <li>First of all, it is made of all natural ingredients which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>I use this primarily on my legs where I have broken blood vessels, and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>the little sample was a nice bonus!</li>
            <li>I loved the  serum and the small samples was greet specially the  mostrizer cream</li>
            <li>Like it very much.  </li>
            <li>and I love it, but even if it might bother some it only lasts for a moment.  </li>
            <li>I use this at night (have used it just 3 times prior to the writing of this review,) and also on the neck and chest area where the most of the damage is.  </li>
            <li>When I use this serum at night the next day these veins are more pronounced.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and it causes me no ill effects whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely keep purchasing this product!</li>
            <li>I was not familiar with this product but have been very pleased with its results.</li>
            <li>It looks blurred and more like a tiny light red smudge.</li>
            <li>They give several samples of other nice products that they carry and also a thoughtful note thanking me for my purchase.  </li>
            <li>so smooth and fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I have t-zone oily skin, (large pores on nose)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has also significantly lightened my under eye dark circles, which is a HUGE bonus as that is not what I bought it for.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>During the winter months when skin is very dry it might apply better without the drawbacks.  </li>
            <li>I feel this is a quality product at a reasonable price made by people who care.</li>
            <li>Great product, helped reduce/repair/fade broken capillary mark on my face in a matter of weeks</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and this leaves your skin very moist and dewy.</li>
            <li>The pay off is that it eliminates and greatly reduces my under eye circles and broken veins.</li>
            <li>have really oily skin</li>
            <li>almost feel comfortable enough with my skin to leave the house without wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This product really does give your face a glow.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t wait to wash my face in the evening and put this on.</li>
            <li>After using this for over a month now I think it really works.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much Queen Bee.</li>
            <li>I mix it into other moisturizers to make them more liquidy.  </li>
            <li>of Borage, Carrot, Evening Primrose, Seabuckthorne Berry, Rosehip, Meadowfoam Seed oils are blended with organic Jojoba to create a stable super hydrating serum to deliver vitamins topically to the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel the price is a bit high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The texture is like a light oil that sinks into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I spend way too much money on products to find one that my( too sensitive skin) can absorb without reaction.</li>
            <li>The improvement in my skin damage on neck and chest in 3 applications is nothing short of miraculous - even my husband noticed it right off.  </li>
            <li>The serum is more of a thick oil, but has not broken me out, and I apply in the AM and PM.</li>
            <li>I have super dry skin and also rosacea.  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin VERY soft.</li>
            <li>at what it loaded with :&lt;br /&gt;Nourish your skin with flower and seed botanicals naturally infused with high dose vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;Our</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get past the overwhelming smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>The slightest ding and I will get a dark red blood spot somewhere, but after using this for awhile my skin seems to recover more quickly and bruises less.</li>
            <li>I use a little bit at night, and in the morning use a damp, warm towel to gently scrub off dead skin.</li>
            <li>would venture to say that for me, this was a huge waste of money as I perceived zero benefit from applying this.</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning, my skin looks so clear and even.  </li>
            <li>I am 49 years old.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t bothered me.  </li>
            <li>I like that it has all natural ingredients....</li>
            <li>it is completely oil based.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet as it is too early to tell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for two days and checked this morning and the largest one is nowhere near as pronounced.</li>
            <li>It has not made them completely disappear, but it has improved their appearance.  </li>
            <li>I tend to put it on my cheeks and nowhere near my mouth.</li>
            <li>I am very interested in trying other Queen Bee products now.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking this product has a lot of fake good reviews.</li>
            <li>Fine red lines faded within 4 days and the big red spot barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>but I am not very hopeful right now.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this stuff and especially so</li>
            <li>Within two weeks it had tackled 80% of my dry skin, intense itchy sensitive redness, and is decreasing capillary visibility.</li>
            <li>Do not depress the pump fully or you will come back with a puddle of oil, and it will be too much for your face.</li>
            <li>Also, cruelty free, made by a small company, organic.</li>
            <li>This really hydrates my skin when it feels dry.</li>
            <li>it goes on slightly oily but Is quickly absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li>I used it on a major bruise on my leg, and it helped to dissolve it faster.</li>
            <li>I use it alone at night and add it to my daily face moisturizer when I am feeling particularly parched in the dry environment in which I live.  </li>
            <li>I have trouble getting past the strong smell first of all.  </li>
            <li>My skin is way smoother/less red and the chicken skin like effect has greatly diminished - and this is only after 3 applications!  </li>
            <li>since it&#x27;s all natural which is a big deal to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can barely stand it.  </li>
            <li>so I was worried about applying more oil to it, but to my surprise I haven&#x27;t broken out yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I swear my skin already looks better where I have broken capillaries and around my eyes.</li>
            <li>this works Very Well for my wife&#x27;s facial spider veins &amp; dry spots.</li>
            <li>It has definitely taken the redness out of my face and left it very soft and supple.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really help with the little spider veins on my cheeks, but it leaves my skin soft and even-toned.</li>
            <li>I have one or two broken capillaries on my nose and after extensive research I was almost sure this remedy would work.</li>
            <li>I am addicted to essential oils and love almost every scent</li>
            <li>The first week of use I actually got a little flaky- barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly, my skin is soft, and the broken capillaries reduced in color.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I gave it two stars because it does smell quite nice, but that&#x27;s the extent of it.</li>

            <li> I was most impressed with the extra effort Queen Bee puts into their customer service.  </li>
            <li> I will now try even more of what they have to offer.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a vitamin K cream and wanted more oomph.  </li>
            <li> :) Thank you :))))))</li>
            <li> I have been using this mostly around my eyes for hydration and nose.  </li>
            <li> my skin got noticeable smoother and more supple looking and</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> AND I LOVE THE PACKAGING AND</li>
            <li> Great product seems to really help.</li>
            <li> it is not a serum like, it more of an oil</li>
            <li> My favorite part is the smell.</li>
            <li> Nice light scent.</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly, soaks into your skin and gives a nice glow.  </li>
            <li> love love love.  </li>
            <li> I really do love it.</li>
            <li> The oil would sit on top of my skin for hours.</li>
            <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> has been greatly strengthening my skin, doesn&#x27;t really make irritated bumps go away</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to say that both disappeared, but they haven&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> So many customers raved about the fragrance</li>
            <li> but this serum does not have an appealing fragrance at all.  </li>
            <li> Great product for sensitive skin with face veins.</li>
            <li> the smell is amazing, but the results are really extraordinary, smooth, supple skin, zero blemishes, evenness, and the lines between my eyes has softened too.  </li>
            <li> The smell is phenomenal - makes me smile every time I put it on!  </li>
            <li> They were very quick to ship tooâ€¦.plus</li>
            <li> All of these ingredients are combined to bring the ultimate fresh (best quality) vitamin pack we could conceive.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> You see results very quickly.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong ylang-ylang.  </li>
            <li> I love this Serum, its made with lots of great essential oils and seems very pure and is lovely.</li>
            <li> Just bought and started using this recently, so can&#x27;t speak to the long-term efficacy, but it smells great and makes my skin feel silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> And it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> My skin is moist, irritant free.  </li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this oil when i bought some thing else of theirs</li>
            <li> and they give you free samples.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a lil cheap</li>
            <li> I read all these fantastic reviews and bought a bottle</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of making light spider veins go away.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels on my skin, moisturizing and luxurious, and it is an oil but absorbs in right away and is not causing me any clogged pores or the like</li>
            <li> but I am confident it is moisturizing and will have good long term effects towards battling aging</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> serum is rich in A, B, C, D, E and K vitamins.</li>
            <li> Quality oils are used in this product and I loved the personal touch and a free sample that the seller added to my order.</li>
            <li> This is easily applied and quickly absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> It is a straight up oil, so serum is more accurate.</li>
            <li> This has some good amount of essential oils too.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product</li>
            <li> I think all these good reviews are fake,&amp;#34; so my expectations were low.  </li>
            <li> This works very well - probably better than anything I have used</li>
            <li> I read so many wonderful reviews and thought it would be worth the money if it would lighten my broken capillaries and help my rosacea.</li>
            <li> and I have notice how the veins are vanishing, SUPER....</li>
            <li> I love it and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very effective and fast acting!</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day or just once if its very hot out-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really quite strong.  </li>
            <li> but my skin absorbs the oils and leaves it fresh and dewy.  </li>
            <li> worth the price</li>
            <li> Worth a try.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love it by trying so many other products.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly on my decolletage it helps with fine lines.</li>
            <li> First of all, it is made of all natural ingredients which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> I use this primarily on my legs where I have broken blood vessels, and it works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> the little sample was a nice bonus!</li>
            <li> I loved the  serum and the small samples was greet specially the  mostrizer cream</li>
            <li> Like it very much.  </li>
            <li> and I love it, but even if it might bother some it only lasts for a moment.  </li>
            <li> I use this at night (have used it just 3 times prior to the writing of this review,) and also on the neck and chest area where the most of the damage is.  </li>
            <li> When I use this serum at night the next day these veins are more pronounced.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and it causes me no ill effects whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely keep purchasing this product!</li>
            <li> I was not familiar with this product but have been very pleased with its results.</li>
            <li> It looks blurred and more like a tiny light red smudge.</li>
            <li> They give several samples of other nice products that they carry and also a thoughtful note thanking me for my purchase.  </li>
            <li> so smooth and fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have t-zone oily skin, (large pores on nose)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has also significantly lightened my under eye dark circles, which is a HUGE bonus as that is not what I bought it for.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> During the winter months when skin is very dry it might apply better without the drawbacks.  </li>
            <li> I feel this is a quality product at a reasonable price made by people who care.</li>
            <li> Great product, helped reduce/repair/fade broken capillary mark on my face in a matter of weeks</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this leaves your skin very moist and dewy.</li>
            <li> The pay off is that it eliminates and greatly reduces my under eye circles and broken veins.</li>
            <li> have really oily skin</li>
            <li> almost feel comfortable enough with my skin to leave the house without wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product really does give your face a glow.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t wait to wash my face in the evening and put this on.</li>
            <li> After using this for over a month now I think it really works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much Queen Bee.</li>
            <li> I mix it into other moisturizers to make them more liquidy.  </li>
            <li> of Borage, Carrot, Evening Primrose, Seabuckthorne Berry, Rosehip, Meadowfoam Seed oils are blended with organic Jojoba to create a stable super hydrating serum to deliver vitamins topically to the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel the price is a bit high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The texture is like a light oil that sinks into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I spend way too much money on products to find one that my( too sensitive skin) can absorb without reaction.</li>
            <li> The improvement in my skin damage on neck and chest in 3 applications is nothing short of miraculous - even my husband noticed it right off.  </li>
            <li> The serum is more of a thick oil, but has not broken me out, and I apply in the AM and PM.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and also rosacea.  </li>
            <li> Makes your skin VERY soft.</li>
            <li> at what it loaded with :&lt;br /&gt;Nourish your skin with flower and seed botanicals naturally infused with high dose vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;Our</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past the overwhelming smell of this product.  </li>
            <li> The slightest ding and I will get a dark red blood spot somewhere, but after using this for awhile my skin seems to recover more quickly and bruises less.</li>
            <li> I use a little bit at night, and in the morning use a damp, warm towel to gently scrub off dead skin.</li>
            <li> would venture to say that for me, this was a huge waste of money as I perceived zero benefit from applying this.</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning, my skin looks so clear and even.  </li>
            <li> I am 49 years old.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t bothered me.  </li>
            <li> I like that it has all natural ingredients....</li>
            <li> it is completely oil based.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet as it is too early to tell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for two days and checked this morning and the largest one is nowhere near as pronounced.</li>
            <li> It has not made them completely disappear, but it has improved their appearance.  </li>
            <li> I tend to put it on my cheeks and nowhere near my mouth.</li>
            <li> I am very interested in trying other Queen Bee products now.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking this product has a lot of fake good reviews.</li>
            <li> Fine red lines faded within 4 days and the big red spot barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> but I am not very hopeful right now.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this stuff and especially so</li>
            <li> Within two weeks it had tackled 80% of my dry skin, intense itchy sensitive redness, and is decreasing capillary visibility.</li>
            <li> Do not depress the pump fully or you will come back with a puddle of oil, and it will be too much for your face.</li>
            <li> Also, cruelty free, made by a small company, organic.</li>
            <li> This really hydrates my skin when it feels dry.</li>
            <li> it goes on slightly oily but Is quickly absorbed into your skin.</li>
            <li> I used it on a major bruise on my leg, and it helped to dissolve it faster.</li>
            <li> I use it alone at night and add it to my daily face moisturizer when I am feeling particularly parched in the dry environment in which I live.  </li>
            <li> I have trouble getting past the strong smell first of all.  </li>
            <li> My skin is way smoother/less red and the chicken skin like effect has greatly diminished - and this is only after 3 applications!  </li>
            <li> since it&#x27;s all natural which is a big deal to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can barely stand it.  </li>
            <li> so I was worried about applying more oil to it, but to my surprise I haven&#x27;t broken out yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I swear my skin already looks better where I have broken capillaries and around my eyes.</li>
            <li> this works Very Well for my wife&#x27;s facial spider veins &amp; dry spots.</li>
            <li> It has definitely taken the redness out of my face and left it very soft and supple.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really help with the little spider veins on my cheeks, but it leaves my skin soft and even-toned.</li>
            <li> I have one or two broken capillaries on my nose and after extensive research I was almost sure this remedy would work.</li>
            <li> I am addicted to essential oils and love almost every scent</li>
            <li> The first week of use I actually got a little flaky- barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, my skin is soft, and the broken capillaries reduced in color.</li>
            <li> Fortunately it&#x27;s not a strong scent, but enough to make me use this very sparingly.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use the serum as long as it doesn&#x27;t cause further irritation.</li>
            <li> Secondly, there is absolutely no change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> This product was purchased with hope that it really helps diminish the appearance of broken capillaries, I had a couple treatments done in the areas around my nose that weren&#x27;t noticeable to anyone but me, my skin care specialist tried doing a number of Photo facials and even Cauterizing them several times but nothing worked?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t evident that it was broken capillary at all.</li>
            <li> a lot less red.</li>
            <li> I chucked my super expensive Sephora serum and anti-redness products for this.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels tight and moist at the same time.</li>
            <li> and it does cause my skin to develop those little white heads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now, not only on my face, but also the delicate skin on my chest.  </li>
            <li> a bit oily but really does help on broken capillaries</li>
            <li> and i was hooked after using it only a few days.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of veins and this little bottle does not last for me, but other then that it works</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Due to the consistency of this creme</li>
            <li> This has super expensive serums beat!</li>
            <li> and It does help them heal faster than they did previously.</li>
            <li> I am sold with less then a week of use.</li>
            <li> burns a little.</li>
            <li> A little too flowery for me.</li>
            <li> After just a few days of using this product my broken blood vessels look less red.  </li>
            <li> I have broken blood vessels and red blotchy skin and neck.</li>
            <li> of the tiny broken capillaries are</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically to help with thin, red veins on my nose.</li>
            <li> This serum packs a punch without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li> In a few days noticeable improvement on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Chicken skin is a condition that aged skin gets from sun damage causing it to be red and bumpy.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what&#x27;s up with that</li>
            <li> Sadly $41 and 30 days later I have no results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if it has strengthened anything yet,</li>
            <li> I had pretty bad broken capillaries on my cheeks almost like Rosacea.</li>
            <li> It has, however, corrected the less sever broken vessels.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This serum is not effective at all rather it causes itching.</li>
            <li> It is NOT a chemical or artificial smell, like a &amp;#34;fragrance,&amp;#34; it is an essential oil</li>
            <li> I just ordered the Vitamin K Serum for a few broken capillaries on my cheek.</li>
            <li> My packaging failed and the oil leaked all over the box and the other item I purchased with it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my spider veins and broken capillaries disappear.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with redness from broken capillaries on my chest.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my bruises and broken capillaries.  </li>
            <li> Poor packaging.</li>
            <li> I think it makes them worse.  </li>
            <li> I feel it has improved my skin tone, decreased my under eye circles, and taken away any blotchy areas on my skin.</li>
            <li> I got it for broken capillaries on my nose and under eye circles.  </li>
            <li> Used it twice and decided Id rather have broken capillaries than have to put up with the suffocating smell.  </li>
            <li> Expensive.</li>
            <li> My broken vessels no longer show on my face With the exception of one and its very faint compared to before.</li>
            <li> BUT the scent is unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of use, my T-zone had a bad break out.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> a bit oily but really does help on broken capillaries</li>
            <li> I bought this serum only 3 weeks ago, so my results are not viable yet.  However, the concentration of VK is good, so I expect I will see results soon.  The serum is more of a thick oil, but has not broken me out, and I apply in the AM and PM.</li>
            <li> excellent product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Did nothing for the spider veins on the face.</li>
            <li> I liked the look and feel of my skin when I used this product.  I feel the price is a bit high.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make my spider veins and broken capillaries disappear. It does make them lighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for a month now and I love it. It doesn&#x27;t really help with the little spider veins on my cheeks, but it leaves my skin soft and even-toned. I have combination skin that is acne/blackhead prone. This serum doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or break me out. The company even sent me a sample serum and a $15 gift card for future purchases!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for several years now, not only on my face, but also the delicate skin on my chest.  It is a skin care product I would not go without as the results are amazing.  My greatest praise would be for the capillary strengthening/redness reduction in my fair skin.</li>
            <li> So its just been one week I started  using this serum and my skin feels tight and moist at the same time. I do not mix this serum with any thing else when using it. Just one pump is enough but oily skin people do not over do your skin with this serum as it could break you out. This has some good amount of essential oils too. My husband loves the smell of this serum. He says I smell like fresh roses (Good for me). This bottle will go for good 3 months for sure. I will update you guys more once I have completed using this for  a good 2..3 months. QUeen bee rocks!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with redness from broken capillaries on my chest. I believe it helped and I have ordered a second bottle.  The scent is spa like and I love it, but even if it might bother some it only lasts for a moment.  The texture is like a light oil that sinks into the skin.  I was most impressed with the extra effort Queen Bee puts into their customer service.  They give several samples of other nice products that they carry and also a thoughtful note thanking me for my purchase.  That&#x27;s all it takes. I will now try even more of what they have to offer.  I feel this is a quality product at a reasonable price made by people who care.</li>
            <li> Adore the fragrance, and helps with the facial veins from Rosacea</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING. Within two weeks it had tackled 80% of my dry skin, intense itchy sensitive redness, and is decreasing capillary visibility. I have recommended it to everyone I know who has sensitive/dry/red skin problems. I use a little bit at night, and in the morning use a damp, warm towel to gently scrub off dead skin. I chucked my super expensive Sephora serum and anti-redness products for this. It as also keeping my skin glowing and supple. I&#x27;m so, so impressed with this product. And it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great product, helped reduce/repair/fade broken capillary mark on my face in a matter of weeks BUT the scent is unpleasant.  Fortunately it&#x27;s not a strong scent, but enough to make me use this very sparingly.</li>
            <li> I use this several nights a week and I&#x27;ve noticed a clearer complexion.  I love it and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Well worth the money! They were very quick to ship tooâ€¦.plus the little sample was a nice bonus! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Like it very much.  takes my lines out of my face.  Was happy to find something that does that. thanks</li>
            <li> I Love this product!  I use this twice a day.  I thought it would be too oily to wear under makeup but my skin absorbs the oils and leaves it fresh and dewy.  I tend to breakout but I have been using this for six months and I have not had one breakout!</li>
            <li> Quality oils are used in this product and I loved the personal touch and a free sample that the seller added to my order.</li>
            <li> I am 49 years old.  I have rosacea.  I have been using a vitamin K cream and wanted more oomph.  This is great.  I also use it on my bruises and broken capillaries.  I mix it into my vit K night cream.  Great results.  My skin is moist, irritant free.  It does have a nice smell.  It also does leave your skin a bit greasy.  I have sensitive skin and it hasn&#x27;t bothered me.  I will continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> I use this primarily on my legs where I have broken blood vessels, and it works beautifully.  Really great product.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this oil when i bought some thing else of theirs and i was hooked after using it only a few days. the smell is amazing, but the results are really extraordinary, smooth, supple skin, zero blemishes, evenness, and the lines between my eyes has softened too.  worth the price and they give you free samples.</li>
            <li> Just PERFECT :) Thank you :))))))</li>
            <li> I wish I took before and after photos. I used it for a month before I starting getting improvement. I have broken blood vessels and red blotchy skin and neck. I&#x27;m a lil cheap so I didn&#x27;t use it religiously on my neck, just on my face. My broken vessels no longer show on my face With the exception of one and its very faint compared to before. Makes your skin VERY soft. Smells official. All top notch ingredients and consistency if nice. I look forward to putting this on my skin at night...and in the morning. If you have red skin buy and be a lil patient. It will work.</li>
            <li> Great product will purchase again its a lil oily but great product overall smells good and it does what it says</li>
            <li> This serum smells amazing and it feels great on your skin.  When I wake up in the morning, my skin looks so clear and even.  I seem to be the only person on the beach without a leathery looking, sun damaged face!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get past the overwhelming smell of this product.  Used it twice and decided Id rather have broken capillaries than have to put up with the suffocating smell.  It&#x27;s really quite strong.  I read all these fantastic reviews and bought a bottle and I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m the only person to mention this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this mostly around my eyes for hydration and nose.  I like that it has all natural ingredients....it is completely oil based.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes yet as it is too early to tell but I am confident it is moisturizing and will have good long term effects towards battling aging</li>
            <li> smells good. feels good. burns a little. left red blotches all over my face for days after one use.Tried using  it several times over the course of a couple months.Red blotches everytime  If I could return it I would especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This serum is not effective at all rather it causes itching. I want to return it, please let me know how.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful skin care product. Smells amazing and works wonders. It has definitely taken the redness out of my face and left it very soft and supple. I use it twice a day or just once if its very hot out- I have oily skin and this leaves your skin very moist and dewy. The first week of use I actually got a little flaky- barely noticeable. No breakouts at all. After I exfoliated and continued the week- my skin got noticeable smoother and more supple looking and a lot less red. Definitely recommend for anyone!</li>
            <li> Rip off. Poor packaging. Doesn;t work. I&#x27;m thinking this product has a lot of fake good reviews.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very effective and fast acting! I have sun damage on my neck and chest and since also being fair skinned, capillary damage on my face.  I use this at night (have used it just 3 times prior to the writing of this review,) and also on the neck and chest area where the most of the damage is.  Due to the consistency of this creme (it&#x27;s a serum really), it&#x27;s best applied and night for max benefits but follow up in the day with a day moisturizer with sunscreen.  The improvement in my skin damage on neck and chest in 3 applications is nothing short of miraculous - even my husband noticed it right off.  Chicken skin is a condition that aged skin gets from sun damage causing it to be red and bumpy.  My skin is way smoother/less red and the chicken skin like effect has greatly diminished - and this is only after 3 applications!  Highly recommend this stuff and especially so since it&#x27;s all natural which is a big deal to me.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: this is not a cream but a serum and it is oily. I have t-zone oily skin, (large pores on nose) and it does cause my skin to develop those little white heads. The pay off is that it eliminates and greatly reduces my under eye circles and broken veins. I use it on my neck.  During the winter months when skin is very dry it might apply better without the drawbacks.  Overall, a good product but it is OILY.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND I LOVE THE PACKAGING AND THE DISCOUNT CARD THAT WAS INCLUDED!  I WILL DEFINITELY SHOP QUEEN BEE AGAIN!</li>
            <li> I just ordered the Vitamin K Serum for a few broken capillaries on my cheek. I&#x27;ve used it for two days and checked this morning and the largest one is nowhere near as pronounced. It looks blurred and more like a tiny light red smudge. It isn&#x27;t evident that it was broken capillary at all. I&#x27;m impressed and would be happy if this was the best result... but as I said it&#x27;s only day two. You&#x27;ve got me Queen Bee!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note: Queen Bee also sent two samples (which of course I will try) along with my order. What a nice treat.</li>
            <li> A little too flowery for me. Expensive. Didn&#x27;t see a benefit, but I didn&#x27;t apply it as often as instructed. Sorry I couldn&#x27;t be more helpful with this review.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of reviews on this product before purchasing it.  One of them said &amp;#34;this product didn&#x27;t work.  I think all these good reviews are fake,&amp;#34; so my expectations were low.  After just a few days of using this product my broken blood vessels look less red.  It has not made them completely disappear, but it has improved their appearance.  It has, however, corrected the less sever broken vessels.&lt;br /&gt;I have really oily skin so I was worried about applying more oil to it, but to my surprise I haven&#x27;t broken out yet.&lt;br /&gt;It has also significantly lightened my under eye dark circles, which is a HUGE bonus as that is not what I bought it for.&lt;br /&gt;I almost feel comfortable enough with my skin to leave the house without wearing makeup.  Almost.</li>
            <li> This is easily applied and quickly absorbed by the skin. I have been using after vein surgery and think it has helped with healing.</li>
            <li> The product is beautifully scented. I use it on my face every couple of nights and let it work overnight. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Wish I had known about this sooner.  Absorbs quickly, my skin is soft, and the broken capillaries reduced in color.</li>
            <li> This product was purchased with hope that it really helps diminish the appearance of broken capillaries, I had a couple treatments done in the areas around my nose that weren&#x27;t noticeable to anyone but me, my skin care specialist tried doing a number of Photo facials and even Cauterizing them several times but nothing worked?&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to review this product until I used it for awhile to see if it did in fact help, to my surprise it did!!&lt;br /&gt;Most of the tiny broken capillaries are gone!!!&lt;br /&gt;The serum is oily but absorbs into your skin so there isn&#x27;t any effects applying makeup or on your pillowcase..Yay!!!&lt;br /&gt;I use it am and pm as recommended, my skin is so soft and looks great, I love the smell too!!</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically to help with thin, red veins on my nose. When I use this serum at night the next day these veins are more pronounced. I think it makes them worse.  However, I have some bruising on the bridge and side of my nose from wearing sunglasses and the serum seems to help dissipate/fade the redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still looking for help. If anyone has found a successful treatment let me know. I think I will try arnica next.</li>
            <li> This really hydrates my skin when it feels dry. That hydration lasts for hours. I tend to put it on my cheeks and nowhere near my mouth. But I always taste the product in my mouth nonetheless. Not sure what&#x27;s up with that but I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Your skin would say you Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product for sensitive skin with face veins. Love it by trying so many other products.</li>
            <li> I was not familiar with this product but have been very pleased with its results. I used it on a scar and it has almost disappeared. It also works great on fine lines around the mouth area.</li>
            <li> I like the feel and smell of this oil.  Thought I would see a difference using an oil with Vit K in it, but haven&#x27;t.  I think I will just use Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work as I expect. However, I discovered that my issue is an inherited one. I will order more of this product though!</li>
            <li> Great product seems to really help.</li>
            <li> not what I excepted. it is not a serum like, it more of an oil</li>
            <li> This works very well - probably better than anything I have used</li>
            <li> I have been using this 3 nights and I swear my skin already looks better where I have broken capillaries and around my eyes. I love the way this feels on my skin, moisturizing and luxurious, and it is an oil but absorbs in right away and is not causing me any clogged pores or the like, I&#x27;d say my pores are actually smaller! My favorite part is the smell. I love it, and it is a wonderful scent (geranium, mostly) to smell as I drift off to sleep since I use this at night. It is NOT a chemical or artificial smell, like a &amp;#34;fragrance,&amp;#34; it is an essential oil and I loooove the geranium. This has super expensive serums beat! I am very interested in trying other Queen Bee products now. Also, cruelty free, made by a small company, organic. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> This product really does give your face a glow.  If you&#x27;re a lil pail and want to add some color. this works good.</li>
            <li> I bought this for use on spider veins since it contains vitamin k but it didn&#x27;t work too well for that.  It was good at making that area of my face oily which seemed beneficial?</li>
            <li> Over the years I spend way too much money on products to find one that my( too sensitive skin) can absorb without reaction. I am hoping this helps with the damage caused by Rosacea....as I am tried of using metronidazole every day which makes my skin irritated.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this is the only moisturizer that does not break my skin out! My skin looks wonderful since I started using this product. It seems to be fading my spider veins as well. Great product.</li>
            <li> This serum packs a punch without being too heavy.  I use it alone at night and add it to my daily face moisturizer when I am feeling particularly parched in the dry environment in which I live.  The smell is phenomenal - makes me smile every time I put it on!  Thank you QueenBee for keeping me hydrated!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for about 1 week but haven&#x27;t seen any improvements.</li>
            <li> Just bought and started using this recently, so can&#x27;t speak to the long-term efficacy, but it smells great and makes my skin feel silky smooth.  I mix it with my moisturizer, use it alone on my decolletage (works great there), and even use it on  my lips as an overnight moisture sealant.</li>
            <li> I use this twice daily.  It seems to help my skin and I even think it is helping my hands!  I rub my hands together after I apply it to my face and my hands and nails have improved too!  Nice light scent.</li>
            <li> My cousin has been using it for about 2 months but hasn&#x27;t seen results yet. She bought a machine to use with she said it seems to be working . If you haven&#x27;t seen any result yet with this potion, try this home use machine:  [...]</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Look at what it loaded with :&lt;br /&gt;Nourish your skin with flower and seed botanicals naturally infused with high dose vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;Our capillary strengthening Vitamin K Serum is like a big organic salad for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Oils of Borage, Carrot, Evening Primrose, Seabuckthorne Berry, Rosehip, Meadowfoam Seed oils are blended with organic Jojoba to create a stable super hydrating serum to deliver vitamins topically to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin K in liquid form is steeped with a blend of essential oils. All of these ingredients are combined to bring the ultimate fresh (best quality) vitamin pack we could conceive.&lt;br /&gt;This serum is rich in A, B, C, D, E and K vitamins. It&#x27;s an perfect antioxidant to replenish and nourish our skin and invite sweet dreams into our lives.</li>
            <li> I used this on the spider veins on my legs for 2 months and it didn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> omg, best serum i&#x27;ve ever bough, and i&#x27;m a skin care junkie.  The smell is strong ylang-ylang.  It glides on smoothly, soaks into your skin and gives a nice glow.  I use as a massage at night. love love love.  would def buy again !</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, I keep re-ordering every time I run out.  I use this mainly on my decolletage it helps with fine lines.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for the red bruises on my husbands arms and It does help them heal faster than they did previously. The smell is fantastic so I started using it on my face. My face feels so smooth and fine lines are less noticeable. I really can&#x27;t wait to wash my face in the evening and put this on. I told my sister about it and she is going to order some. I really do love it.</li>
            <li> I have super dry skin and also rosacea.  This product works great for both issues and smells good too! Thanks!</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t absorb the serum at all. The oil would sit on top of my skin for hours. After 2 weeks of use, my T-zone had a bad break out. This one is not for me. After I stopped using the serum, I gave it to my husband. He liked the smell of the serum and it seems to help lessen the redness on his cheeks. So he wanted me to bump up the star rating on this product.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin that reddens very easily. After using this for over a month now I think it really works. The slightest ding and I will get a dark red blood spot somewhere, but after using this for awhile my skin seems to recover more quickly and bruises less. It also does not break me out at all.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles. Saw some reviews that had no results and others did. Took a $40 chance. In a few days noticeable improvement on my cheeks. I had pretty bad broken capillaries on my cheeks almost like Rosacea. I was using concealer to hide it. Fine red lines faded within 4 days and the big red spot barely noticeable. No break outs. I only used on cheeks morning and night. I am sold with less then a week of use. Worth a try.</li>
            <li> Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my veins on my legs and I have notice how the veins are vanishing, SUPER....&lt;br /&gt;After I shower I put the Vitamin K Serum twice a day. I just wish they sold a bigger bottler do to I have a lot of veins and this little bottle does not last for me, but other then that it works perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much Queen Bee.</li>
            <li> I have one or two broken capillaries on my nose and after extensive research I was almost sure this remedy would work. Sadly $41 and 30 days later I have no results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would venture to say that for me, this was a huge waste of money as I perceived zero benefit from applying this. I gave it two stars because it does smell quite nice, but that&#x27;s the extent of it. Save your $41 and go get the capillary treatment from your doctor.</li>
            <li> I loved the  serum and the small samples was greet specially the  mostrizer cream</li>
            <li> I love this Serum, its made with lots of great essential oils and seems very pure and is lovely. I am trying it on varicose veins that I got after 3-pregnancies, I hope it will help reduce them!!</li>
            <li> So far, so good. I&#x27;ll have to let you all know if I get good results. One thing: this is NOT a cream. It is a straight up oil, so serum is more accurate. A little goes a long way. Do not depress the pump fully or you will come back with a puddle of oil, and it will be too much for your face. A tiny bit works for me, but I only use it on the tops of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> The vitamin K serum smells great.  Can&#x27;t say I see any great benefit.  I can&#x27;t rub any under the skin of my eyes, it irritates. I apply the serum to my neck and chin area.  I will continue to use the serum as long as it doesn&#x27;t cause further irritation.</li>
            <li> has been greatly strengthening my skin, doesn&#x27;t really make irritated bumps go away but it totally hydrates and strengthens to help battle future irritations/abrasions that lead to acne or redness.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hopes of making light spider veins go away. It didnt work. It is a good moisturiser with good ingrediesnts</li>
            <li> My packaging failed and the oil leaked all over the box and the other item I purchased with it.</li>
            <li> this works Very Well for my wife&#x27;s facial spider veins &amp; dry spots.</li>
            <li> This works on bruises. I used it on a major bruise on my leg, and it helped to dissolve it faster.</li>
            <li> Smells nice. Doesn&#x27;t do a thing. Maybe it is good for preventing spider veins - but I don&#x27;t know. It does nothing to alleviate them.</li>
            <li> It took a week for my skin to adjust to this, but after that. Wow.  It smells great (kind of like your Grandma would).  The essential oils don&#x27;t block your pores.  I mix it into other moisturizers to make them more liquidy.  Not sure if it has strengthened anything yet, but I also take a Vitamin K supplement.  Moisturizes well, calms my skin.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! First of all, it is made of all natural ingredients which is very important to me. I have extremely sensitive skin and it causes me no ill effects whatsoever. It has a light, wonderful, pleasant fragrance. Being a serum and not a lotion it goes on slightly oily but Is quickly absorbed into your skin. And best of all, In my opinion THIS PRODUCT REALLY WORKS! I feel it has improved my skin tone, decreased my under eye circles, and taken away any blotchy areas on my skin. You see results very quickly. I have never before purchased any skin product that I could say actually worked. But this one delivers as promised. I will most definitely keep purchasing this product! In my opinion it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  I got it for broken capillaries on my nose and under eye circles.  I&#x27;d love to say that both disappeared, but they haven&#x27;t.  I do believe they have diminished a bit though.</li>
            <li> I have used this now for 3 weeks. I read so many wonderful reviews and thought it would be worth the money if it would lighten my broken capillaries and help my rosacea. I have trouble getting past the strong smell first of all.  So many customers raved about the fragrance and I can barely stand it.  I am addicted to essential oils and love almost every scent but this serum does not have an appealing fragrance at all.  Secondly, there is absolutely no change in my skin.  I am very disappointed.  I will continue to use it but I am not very hopeful right now.</li>
