            <li>Best Shampoo on the market for well water and swimming !  </li>
            <li>so I thought this product would be perfect.  </li>
            <li>Best shampoo I have ever used, it gets out all the oily residue in my hair.</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Works great, smells great!</li>
            <li>My hair suffered greatly before we discovered what the problem was -- our water, instead of the shampoo/curling iron/hair dryer, which I kept thinking it was -- but once I began rinsing my hair with vinegar in the rinse water it improved greatly, and</li>
            <li>Plus, it smells really great.  </li>
            <li>I use this shampoo a couple of times a week to ensure that my hair stays great.</li>
            <li>The product worked great -</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled!</li>
            <li>Pleasant scent for the shampoo and the conditioner</li>
            <li>You can finish this bottle easy in just a month!!</li>
            <li>The shampoo smells great and it does leave my hair feeling slightly better.  </li>
            <li>It has saved me from running to the salon many times when our water softener wasn&#x27;t working great.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>and it also smells so nice and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up great, smells like an orange dreamsicle and leaves my hair full of body and shine.</li>
            <li>even more so when I began the \\&quot;no &#x27;poo\\&quot; baking soda plus vinegar regimen.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think this works any better than drugstore shampoo for the price.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Probably better with conditioner also which I havent tried.</li>
            <li>Have not found one I like better.</li>
            <li>i wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once every 3 months</li>
            <li>Nice and light can be used every day thank you</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure my issue is the water at home because when I travel it goes</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried so many.</li>
            <li>Bumble constantly delivers excellent results.</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>The packaging of the product could have been better.</li>
            <li>I picked this one because it had pretty good reviews</li>
            <li>I did use it with a Redkin hair thickener-however-I enjoyed the fragrance and the light feel of the shampoo</li>
            <li>Best $10 I&#x27;ve ever spent!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased to FINALLY find a shampoo an product line that makes my hair look and feel great.</li>
            <li>My scalp reacts to a lot of harsher shampoos because of the strong detergents used in them, but I get no reaction from this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Most of the bottles are 3/4 full because they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Just something to think about if you have fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li>I thought this might help even more to get my hair back to its awesome soft water quality, but I&#x27;m not seeing any difference.</li>
            <li>My hair feels cleaner for a longer time; really does a nice job.</li>
            <li>It has gotten to where it doesn&#x27;t even feel clean when I wash it.</li>
            <li>Wonderful shampoo for anyone with hard water</li>
            <li>do like that this is natural and smells really nice.</li>
            <li>Price is not bad either considering quality.</li>
            <li>I prefer gentle shampoo, super rich conditioner or invisible oil shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>thick consistency, great lather, great smelling shampoo &#x3D; better than expected shampoo that has good cleansing properties - removes hard water residue</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is well worth the money, I try never to be without this.</li>
            <li>I thought maybe switching to a more natural shampoo would help.</li>
            <li>It is inexpensive and works, a rare combination today.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>but so far I love</li>
            <li>I have unfilter well water &amp; my hair as never been right until I used this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Now my hair is soft &amp; feels clean!</li>
            <li>It does have a light lovely smell, and certainly hasn&#x27;t damaged my hair further.</li>
            <li>I have only used it one time, so far so good.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather well; I have to use a very large amount to get enough lather to be able to get my fingers into my hair and massage it and move it around.</li>
            <li>It really worked!</li>
            <li>Now my hair is really flakey (yuck!)</li>
            <li>I had recently colored my hair and then went on vacation, so I was washing my hair with well water that was a thousand times better than my water at home</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>This lathers up nicely but does not rinse out of hair easily with hard water, which is a problem for us.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other sulfate-free shampoos, this one leaves my hair nicely moisturized.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and also feels soft again.</li>
            <li>this shampoo leaves my hair so incredibly soft and yet clean.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, if you have well water with a high mineral content, I think it is worth the six bucks to try this stuff and see how it will do with your hair and your water.  </li>
            <li>I have high hopes for the first time in a long time,just make sure you get the right product for your problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, I have had limited success with this shampoo mostly because my particular well water does not work well with detergents.  </li>
            <li>I think this shampoo is pretty good for hard water.  </li>
            <li>If used more than twice a week, though, it starts to make my hair feel a bit dry.</li>
            <li>On top of that, our water is very soft (water hardness is not an indicator of all mineral content, but of calcium content only)</li>
            <li>I have baby fine highlighted blonde hair and well water.  </li>
            <li>I have really hard water in my area &amp; have been searching for a good hardwater shampoo for my hair for ages.</li>
            <li>Has helped my hair with hard mineral water; leaves my hair in good condition .  </li>
            <li>and it really works plus my bottle lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>After using the shampoo my hair is much shinier and has lost the orange tint.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference until winter came.  </li>
            <li>Followed by invisible oil uv hair primer spray, then styling lotion spray or balm and then layered with straight balm or texture.</li>
            <li>The shipper is VERY prompt with shipment and price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair and didn&#x27;t suds up very well.</li>
            <li>I was using the same shampoo &amp; conditioner that I used in New York &amp; had good results with, but after a couple months in Wisconsin, my scalp started to really dry out</li>
            <li>While most natural shampoos are good for the general health of my hair, they&#x27;re usually not moisturizing enough for my dried out scalp &amp; ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>Those were actually mineral buildup, because they went away right after using this shampoo!</li>
            <li>It recommends getting the professional malibu treatment at the salon first, and then using this product to keep the deposits out.</li>
            <li>It works great for my light blonde highlighted hair to keep the color true instead of dull and orange from the iron in our hard water.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this shampoo, I was amazed at how my wavy/curly hair bounced back up into its normal, voluminous state.</li>
            <li>You will love this for hard water</li>
            <li>My hair felt SO much lighter after using this shampoo (followed by a natural conditioner, though I definitely want to try the Malibu conditioner now!).</li>
            <li>I am hopeful that the continued use will completely get the color out, but if not, I will go to the salon to get the professional treatment.</li>
            <li>It is not harsh on my hair or the environment</li>
            <li>a professional blow out look and feel.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>Also, I had to use it handfull to clean my long hair and have to clean at least 2 times, sometimes 3 times to shampoo my hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really use it more than a few days in a row because it does build up on my hair, but at least the build up is not nearly as bad as it is with a regular SLS shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I normally use Clairol Shimmering Lights (purple shampoo and conditioner) to keep my blonde colored hair from turning orange in well water.  </li>
            <li>and my hair became really dull and gets tangled easily.</li>
            <li>My hair was feeling waxy and gross due to my hard water, so I looked around for awhile to find a good shampoo.  </li>
            <li>and we live on reclaimed open pit coal mine ground, so</li>
            <li>If you live where you have well water, especially hard water, this is an awesome product that removes the residue hard water leaves.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer a more simple clean smelling fragrance to artificial creamsicle smell, but it&#x27;s not very strong and you only really smell it when you&#x27;re using it in the shower, so I don&#x27;t consider that a significant negative or positive.</li>
            <li>I did notice the hard water build-up was lessening &amp; my hair was feeling more clean even after showering in our hard water so I am giving this product 4 stars, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>This is by far the only shampoo that works for me!  </li>
            <li>I had just gotten a shower head water filter which has helped with my hair quality a lot (the results of that were immediate) but since water filter doesnt completely soften the water (only lessens chlorine &amp; impurities)</li>
            <li>but didn&#x27;t really work as I expected it to.  </li>
            <li>All other products leave a residue no matter how much I rinse.</li>
            <li>Something which will not dry out my hair or reduce the hair damage and hairfall.</li>
            <li>Just not sure it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have hard water where I live and noticed my hair just taking a nose dive in body, and fullness becoming limp and breaking.</li>
            <li>Helps tremendously with hard water.</li>
            <li>Quick fix to hard water.</li>
            <li>Even the color of my hair looked better, instead of dark, dull and coated as it had looked before.</li>
            <li>it does clear your hair off of everything, but your hair become extremely dry for about a week.</li>
            <li>It is very high in manganese but low in iron, making it very difficult for any existing filtration system to remove the manganese because most filters depend on bonding the manganese to the iron in order to remove it.  </li>
            <li>I used the shampoo without getting the professional treatment, and it really lightened the orange color from a deep orange to a very pale orange.</li>

            <li> My hair was feeling waxy and gross due to my hard water, so I looked around for awhile to find a good shampoo.  </li>
            <li> and we live on reclaimed open pit coal mine ground, so</li>
            <li> If you live where you have well water, especially hard water, this is an awesome product that removes the residue hard water leaves.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer a more simple clean smelling fragrance to artificial creamsicle smell, but it&#x27;s not very strong and you only really smell it when you&#x27;re using it in the shower, so I don&#x27;t consider that a significant negative or positive.</li>
            <li> I did notice the hard water build-up was lessening &amp; my hair was feeling more clean even after showering in our hard water so I am giving this product 4 stars, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is by far the only shampoo that works for me!  </li>
            <li> I had just gotten a shower head water filter which has helped with my hair quality a lot (the results of that were immediate) but since water filter doesnt completely soften the water (only lessens chlorine &amp; impurities)</li>
            <li> but didn&#x27;t really work as I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> All other products leave a residue no matter how much I rinse.</li>
            <li> Something which will not dry out my hair or reduce the hair damage and hairfall.</li>
            <li> Just not sure it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have hard water where I live and noticed my hair just taking a nose dive in body, and fullness becoming limp and breaking.</li>
            <li> Helps tremendously with hard water.</li>
            <li> Quick fix to hard water.</li>
            <li> Even the color of my hair looked better, instead of dark, dull and coated as it had looked before.</li>
            <li> it does clear your hair off of everything, but your hair become extremely dry for about a week.</li>
            <li> It is very high in manganese but low in iron, making it very difficult for any existing filtration system to remove the manganese because most filters depend on bonding the manganese to the iron in order to remove it.  </li>
            <li> I used the shampoo without getting the professional treatment, and it really lightened the orange color from a deep orange to a very pale orange.</li>
            <li> Not dirty feeling and heavy laying flat from build up of minerals and all the other stuff in our well water.</li>
            <li> Last year I moved to the mid-west from CA and have hard (well) water for the first time.  </li>
            <li> First of all, Amazon has this product listed as \\&quot;Well Water Action\\&quot; but the product that I received is \\&quot;Hard Water Wellness.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I live with very hard, particularly iron-rich water.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not horrible, but it&#x27;s a bit artificial smelling.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything I noticed as far as extra-cleaning the hair, so maybe my water isn&#x27;t hard enough to benefit from it.</li>
            <li> Wish I could say my dry, frizzy, mineral logged hair was banished; it isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> My hair comes out slightly less brittle and tangle-prone, but it&#x27;s not super soft as I imagined either.</li>
            <li> Being disappointed with this shampoo&#x27;s performance, I started stealing my boyfriend&#x27;s suave clarifying shampoo and that in fact does make my hair incredibly soft, tangle-free, and light and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I kid you not, I have tried at least 4 different kinds of natural shampoos and 2 different kinds of shampoos that contain silicon/sulfate/harmful things in the past year.</li>
            <li> This was an improvement over the shampoo I had been using before, which left my hair stiff, tangled, weighed down, and brittle, but it&#x27;s not everything I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo when we moved from a house with very soft water into an apartment with very hard water.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;d be willing to pay the price if it were the shampoo of my dreams, but unfortunately it was not.</li>
            <li> Is a little expensive, but well worth the cost</li>
            <li> I usually get a few extra bottles for my&lt;br /&gt;private stock up.</li>
            <li> My hair was an absolute limp mess with the very hard water!</li>
            <li> I even installed shower head filter to try to make the water a little softer.</li>
            <li> It severely dried out my hair and did not help at all.</li>
            <li> Ever since I moved to Wisconsin, I&#x27;ve been having a lot of hair trouble.</li>
            <li> Nope, that only made the matters worse.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair stiff and matted if lengthy and vigorous rinsing is not done.  </li>
            <li> and I needed very little conditioner.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday along with the Malibu Hard Water Wellness conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Works in just a few days!</li>
            <li> This is a very harsh shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is very heavy with minerals, metals and all kinds of stuff.</li>
            <li> I also wash my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair with it because it is tedious to use baking soda and vinegar on her hair, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to build up and break her hair off as bad as traditional shampoo either, but we don&#x27;t wash her hair every day (while I do wash mine every day).  </li>
            <li> I have very hard water and wondered why my hair always felt limp.  </li>
            <li> I have hard water</li>
            <li> The city said the water was moderately hard.</li>
            <li> Hard on colored/highlighted hair though.</li>
            <li> I want to donate all my other mediocre hair care products</li>
            <li> With the price, that&#x27;s a serious disadvantage.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that would take the rust out of my hair from our bad pipes, instead it has left my hair so unmanageable.</li>
            <li> We have really hard water here, and this does the trick!</li>
            <li> But I was only disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> I learned to mix it with distilled water to thin it out</li>
            <li> so I am pretty disappointed :(</li>
            <li> I live in an apartment that has terrible water with no way to install a water softener.  </li>
            <li> I used to get these dandruff-like flakes on my head, which I stupidly tried to treat with dandruff shampoo and dried the heck out of my scalp.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they test on animals</li>
            <li> I used this until I cold get a water softener installed.</li>
            <li> our water is really bad.</li>
            <li> After a year of using this well water to bathe and also wash my hair, my hair feels awful.</li>
            <li> must note that our well water at home is TERRIBLE, even with a water system on it.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have only used it one time, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine highlighted blonde hair and well water.  This is by far the only shampoo that works for me!  At times when my filter needs changed or salt in the softner this shampoo feels like it may not work...I learned to mix it with distilled water to thin it out and it really works plus my bottle lasts longer.  Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that would take the rust out of my hair from our bad pipes, instead it has left my hair so unmanageable. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Every so often my hair gets kinda funky and unflattering. We have really hard water here, and this does the trick!</li>
            <li> The water at my house was leaving deposits in my hair, turning it a orange color in places. So, my stylist recommended that I get this product to try to get it out. This product is perfect. It recommends getting the professional malibu treatment at the salon first, and then using this product to keep the deposits out. I used the shampoo without getting the professional treatment, and it really lightened the orange color from a deep orange to a very pale orange. I am hopeful that the continued use will completely get the color out, but if not, I will go to the salon to get the professional treatment. I would definitely recommend this product if you have this same problem if you are a blonde. For people with color-treated hair, I would say to avoid this product because I used to dye my hair brown and used the product and it started stripping the color.</li>
            <li> Have only used it once since I got it, but was amazed at the difference it made with my hair.  It wasn&#x27;t fly-away, coarse feeling after it was washed.  Is a little expensive, but well worth the cost</li>
            <li> First of all, Amazon has this product listed as \\&quot;Well Water Action\\&quot; but the product that I received is \\&quot;Hard Water Wellness.\\&quot;  At the time, the product photo did not match the description, but I bought it anyway, and now I see that Amazon has changed the photo to match the description, so you might actually receive a different product.  Or perhaps the manufacturer has simply changed the name of the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have had limited success with this shampoo mostly because my particular well water does not work well with detergents.  It is very high in manganese but low in iron, making it very difficult for any existing filtration system to remove the manganese because most filters depend on bonding the manganese to the iron in order to remove it.  On top of that, our water is very soft (water hardness is not an indicator of all mineral content, but of calcium content only) so any type of water softening does not help me.  My hair suffered greatly before we discovered what the problem was -- our water, instead of the shampoo/curling iron/hair dryer, which I kept thinking it was -- but once I began rinsing my hair with vinegar in the rinse water it improved greatly, and even more so when I began the \\&quot;no &#x27;poo\\&quot; baking soda plus vinegar regimen.  I bought this shampoo because it is not always convenient for me to use the baking soda, and sometimes I just want to wash my hair like a \\&quot;normal\\&quot; person.  I can&#x27;t really use it more than a few days in a row because it does build up on my hair, but at least the build up is not nearly as bad as it is with a regular SLS shampoo.  I also wash my 5 year old daughter&#x27;s hair with it because it is tedious to use baking soda and vinegar on her hair, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to build up and break her hair off as bad as traditional shampoo either, but we don&#x27;t wash her hair every day (while I do wash mine every day).  Bottom line, if you have well water with a high mineral content, I think it is worth the six bucks to try this stuff and see how it will do with your hair and your water.  Plus, it smells really great.  Especially compared to vinegar.</li>
            <li> I have hard water and I don&#x27;t think this works any better than drugstore shampoo for the price.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Use it .  Noticed a big difference.</li>
            <li> I think this shampoo is pretty good for hard water.  I live in an apartment that has terrible water with no way to install a water softener.  My hair was feeling waxy and gross due to my hard water, so I looked around for awhile to find a good shampoo.  I picked this one because it had pretty good reviews and I agree with a lot of the things that have been said.  The shampoo smells great and it does leave my hair feeling slightly better.  If used more than twice a week, though, it starts to make my hair feel a bit dry. Just something to think about if you have fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Used it several times already and see no differnce in my hair so I am pretty disappointed :( I had just gotten a shower head water filter which has helped with my hair quality a lot (the results of that were immediate) but since water filter doesnt completely soften the water (only lessens chlorine &amp; impurities) I thought this might help even more to get my hair back to its awesome soft water quality, but I&#x27;m not seeing any difference. Kinda regretting this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE- after a month of use I did notice the hard water build-up was lessening &amp; my hair was feeling more clean even after showering in our hard water so I am giving this product 4 stars, would definitely recommend. Probably better with conditioner also which I havent tried.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo when we moved from a house with very soft water into an apartment with very hard water. My hair was an absolute limp mess with the very hard water! The first time I used this shampoo, I was amazed at how my wavy/curly hair bounced back up into its normal, voluminous state. Even the color of my hair looked better, instead of dark, dull and coated as it had looked before. I use this shampoo a couple of times a week to ensure that my hair stays great. This being said, this shampoo could definitely be used every day with no problems. My scalp reacts to a lot of harsher shampoos because of the strong detergents used in them, but I get no reaction from this shampoo. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Have been using for several weeks now. Wish I could say my dry, frizzy, mineral logged hair was banished; it isn&#x27;t. It does have a light lovely smell, and certainly hasn&#x27;t damaged my hair further. Just not sure it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Does what it says. But you must use the conditioner also or it will leave your hair way to porous to work with.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo.  It has saved me from running to the salon many times when our water softener wasn&#x27;t working great.  I use it everyday along with the Malibu Hard Water Wellness conditioner.  It works great for my light blonde highlighted hair to keep the color true instead of dull and orange from the iron in our hard water.  It lathers up great, smells like an orange dreamsicle and leaves my hair full of body and shine.</li>
            <li> Really great shampoo!!! My hair feels cleaner for a longer time; really does a nice job.</li>
            <li> I have really hard water in my area &amp; have been searching for a good hardwater shampoo for my hair for ages. Something which will not dry out my hair or reduce the hair damage and hairfall. I read the reviews and decided to try it. But I was only disappointed with the results. It severely dried out my hair and did not help at all. I would not recommend it. This is a very harsh shampoo.</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo my hair is much shinier and has lost the orange tint.  I plan on getting the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells great!</li>
            <li> Wonderful shampoo for anyone with hard water and it also smells so nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;It is well worth the money, I try never to be without this. I usually get a few extra bottles for my&lt;br /&gt;private stock up.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo! Have not found one I like better. Price is not bad either considering quality. I will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> it does clear your hair off of everything, but your hair become extremely dry for about a week. i wouldn&#x27;t use it more than once every 3 months</li>
            <li> Works in just a few days! My color treated hair had all turned an orangish red and within 2 days my blond highlights were visible again. Love this product!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything I noticed as far as extra-cleaning the hair, so maybe my water isn&#x27;t hard enough to benefit from it. The city said the water was moderately hard.</li>
            <li> If you live where you have well water, especially hard water, this is an awesome product that removes the residue hard water leaves.  This is especially noticeable if you have gray hair,it will get a yellow tint.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed by this shampoo!!! Ever since I moved to Wisconsin, I&#x27;ve been having a lot of hair trouble. I was using the same shampoo &amp; conditioner that I used in New York &amp; had good results with, but after a couple months in Wisconsin, my scalp started to really dry out and my hair became really dull and gets tangled easily. I thought maybe switching to a more natural shampoo would help. Nope, that only made the matters worse. While most natural shampoos are good for the general health of my hair, they&#x27;re usually not moisturizing enough for my dried out scalp &amp; ends of my hair. I kid you not, I have tried at least 4 different kinds of natural shampoos and 2 different kinds of shampoos that contain silicon/sulfate/harmful things in the past year. Most of the bottles are 3/4 full because they didn&#x27;t work. I even installed shower head filter to try to make the water a little softer. Then I tried this shampoo out of desperation. It really worked! Best $10 I&#x27;ve ever spent! My hair felt SO much lighter after using this shampoo (followed by a natural conditioner, though I definitely want to try the Malibu conditioner now!). I used to get these dandruff-like flakes on my head, which I stupidly tried to treat with dandruff shampoo and dried the heck out of my scalp. Those were actually mineral buildup, because they went away right after using this shampoo! Unlike other sulfate-free shampoos, this one leaves my hair nicely moisturized. Now I need to get a bigger bottle!!!</li>
            <li> thick consistency, great lather, great smelling shampoo &#x3D; better than expected shampoo that has good cleansing properties - removes hard water residue</li>
            <li> We have a well and we live on reclaimed open pit coal mine ground, so our water is really bad. It is very heavy with minerals, metals and all kinds of stuff. After a year of using this well water to bathe and also wash my hair, my hair feels awful. It has gotten to where it doesn&#x27;t even feel clean when I wash it. I have used clarifying shampoo and that didn&#x27;t even help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this shampoo last night and I am thrilled! My hair feels clean and also feels soft again. Not dirty feeling and heavy laying flat from build up of minerals and all the other stuff in our well water.</li>
            <li> This product is too prizy compare to it&#x27;s price + shipping fee. I don&#x27;t like it smell that reminded me kids liquid medicines. It made me headache. Also, I had to use it handfull to clean my long hair and have to clean at least 2 times, sometimes 3 times to shampoo my hair. You can finish this bottle easy in just a month!!</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell.  Has helped my hair with hard mineral water; leaves my hair in good condition .  It is not harsh on my hair or the environment</li>
            <li> Best Shampoo on the market for well water and swimming !  Nice and light can be used every day thank you</li>
            <li> Last year I moved to the mid-west from CA and have hard (well) water for the first time.  I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference until winter came.  Now my hair is really flakey (yuck!) so I thought this product would be perfect.  It didn&#x27;t help me with the flake problem.  A lot of things can cause flakes but I&#x27;m sure my issue is the water at home because when I travel it goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like that this is natural and smells really nice.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo I have ever used, it gets out all the oily residue in my hair. Helps tremendously with hard water.</li>
            <li> You will love this for hard water</li>
            <li> I tried this Malibu product and it didn&#x27;t work well for me.&lt;br /&gt;Bumble and bumble products have finally given my well water hair a professional blow out look and feel. I&#x27;m so pleased to FINALLY find a shampoo an product line that makes my hair look and feel great. I prefer gentle shampoo, super rich conditioner or invisible oil shampoo and conditioner. Followed by invisible oil uv hair primer spray, then styling lotion spray or balm and then layered with straight balm or texture. I want to donate all my other mediocre hair care products and I&#x27;ve tried so many. Bumble constantly delivers excellent results. Finally</li>
            <li> I have very hard water and wondered why my hair always felt limp.  This was recommended by a hairdresser and I&#x27;m sold on it.  It is inexpensive and works, a rare combination today.  The shipper is VERY prompt with shipment and price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I live with very hard, particularly iron-rich water. This was an improvement over the shampoo I had been using before, which left my hair stiff, tangled, weighed down, and brittle, but it&#x27;s not everything I had hoped for. It doesn&#x27;t lather well; I have to use a very large amount to get enough lather to be able to get my fingers into my hair and massage it and move it around. With the price, that&#x27;s a serious disadvantage. However, I&#x27;d be willing to pay the price if it were the shampoo of my dreams, but unfortunately it was not. My hair comes out slightly less brittle and tangle-prone, but it&#x27;s not super soft as I imagined either. Being disappointed with this shampoo&#x27;s performance, I started stealing my boyfriend&#x27;s suave clarifying shampoo and that in fact does make my hair incredibly soft, tangle-free, and light and bouncy. Unfortunately they test on animals so I&#x27;m still searching for one that gets me the same results as the suave. My next attempt will be the Ion shampoo, and if that works well I will edit this review to contain that information. Oh and the smell - it&#x27;s not horrible, but it&#x27;s a bit artificial smelling. I would prefer a more simple clean smelling fragrance to artificial creamsicle smell, but it&#x27;s not very strong and you only really smell it when you&#x27;re using it in the shower, so I don&#x27;t consider that a significant negative or positive.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle now and I still love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Pleasant scent for the shampoo and the conditioner but didn&#x27;t really work as I expected it to.  I normally use Clairol Shimmering Lights (purple shampoo and conditioner) to keep my blonde colored hair from turning orange in well water.  I was hoping to get something that would work as well as the purple shampoo yet be gentler on my hair (the purple shampoo can be drying).... but this shampoo and conditioner didn&#x27;t work for me and my hair started to turn brassy and orange and I had to go back to the purple shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;I must note that our well water at home is TERRIBLE, even with a water system on it.  I had recently colored my hair and then went on vacation, so I was washing my hair with well water that was a thousand times better than my water at home and it still started to turn color using Malibu C.&lt;br /&gt;And now to use this stuff up since I did spend money on it, I wash my hair once with the Malibu C shampoo, wash it a second time with the Clairol Shimmering Lights purple shampoo, then mix the Clairol Shimmering Lights conditioner with the Malibu C conditioner in my had and apply that and it&#x27;s going back to the color it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li> Quick fix to hard water. I used this until I cold get a water softener installed. Hard on colored/highlighted hair though.</li>
            <li> The product worked great - I have hard water where I live and noticed my hair just taking a nose dive in body, and fullness becoming limp and breaking. The packaging of the product could have been better. It was sent in a flimsy mailer and leaked all over the inside of the bag.</li>
            <li> This lathers up nicely but does not rinse out of hair easily with hard water, which is a problem for us.  It leaves hair stiff and matted if lengthy and vigorous rinsing is not done.  I will not be repurchasing this item.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo I can use with my well water.  All other products leave a residue no matter how much I rinse.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! We have well water and this helps Keeps the orange out of my hair. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once but so far I love it!I may have just found the solution to all my hair woes,my hair has body,shine and life.I did use it with a Redkin hair thickener-however-I enjoyed the fragrance and the light feel of the shampoo and I needed very little conditioner.I have high hopes for the first time in a long time,just make sure you get the right product for your problem.I mistakenly ordered 3 bottles of the Malibu Swimmers Wellness Shampoo and it did nothing,point being...I needed shampoo for well water.</li>
            <li> I tried the shampoo once. My hair was soft afterwards. I will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this product, to help neutralize my hair with color treatments she was doing.  We have sulfar and water hardness issues at times.  This shampoo helped a lot, color remained as applied and hair sheen returned.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair and didn&#x27;t suds up very well.</li>
            <li> this shampoo leaves my hair so incredibly soft and yet clean. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have unfilter well water &amp; my hair as never been right until I used this shampoo.  Now my hair is soft &amp; feels clean!</li>
    </ol>
