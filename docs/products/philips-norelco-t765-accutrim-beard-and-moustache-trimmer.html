    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The best feature is the length adjustment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the t765 for about 4 months now, and I&#x27;m very happy  with it.</li>
            <li>IT WORKS GREAT!!!!</li>
            <li>VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER / USER !!!</li>
            <li>Says that it is the best he has come across.</li>
            <li>but this trimmers were perfect and</li>
            <li>it is best for the price.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;D</li>
            <li>use this to keep my goatee trimmed and to that end, it works great.  </li>
            <li>for the blade to edge around or trim your sideburns, it&#x27;s not that great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>And the price is great.</li>
            <li>works great.  </li>
            <li>It has dual blades; and it works great in trimming and removing unwanted hairs</li>
            <li>but I always return to Philips/Norelco as the best of its kind for this appliance.</li>
            <li>Great value too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this and glad I was so wise all those years ago.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco T765 AccuTrim Beard and Moustache Trimmer is not as good as Model T990.</li>
            <li>The trimmer blade is good though, with a good adjustable height that won&#x27;t move on you when pressed against your face.</li>
            <li>Word to the wise</li>
            <li>but their sizes werent good</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the unit and the value for the price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that!</li>
            <li>I wish they made an all metal, corded model with this kind of length adjustment.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with both of them.</li>
            <li>Be sure to read all the directions about charing, I had never known many of the suggestions before.</li>
            <li>Love the built-in adjustability without changing attachment shoes.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works better than most in all areas (esp.</li>
            <li>If people with really good trimmers saw how I operated with this trimmer they&#x27;d probably laugh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one these trimmers (a T860) for more years than I can remember, well 3 or 4.  </li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and durable too!</li>
            <li>This trimmer is very easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Based on many positive reviews here on Amazon it looks like Remington has some good models.</li>
            <li>My first one had a vaccuum feature which caught most of the whiskers, and I liked that better than this one, which has no vaccuum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily adjustable</li>
            <li>Still working strong.  </li>
            <li>But, I consider it a good value because it does the job like the older model.</li>
            <li>The Product does as stated and seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very quick and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>(A huge ripoff.)    </li>
            <li>Overall, i&#x27;m happy with this one, though.</li>
            <li>Cuts so smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>The light never comes on.  </li>
            <li>maybe dropped some oil between the blades twice and brushed out the hair thrice, but it still does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>this machine gave me the perfect result i needed for the past 1 year.  </li>
            <li>They do a good job for me, and I am pretty particular about the way my beard looks.</li>
            <li>There is no separate pouch that holds cut hair so you will need to clean up after you are done.</li>
            <li>so clean it as you use it, and all is well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall a good trimmer.</li>
            <li>Even at full charge, the motor lacks power.  </li>
            <li>The rechargeable batteries, as others have noted, wore out rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>This thing, even when fully charged, will PULL the hair off your face if you trim too quickly.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in a hurry and trim quickly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, cuts even, and holds a charge for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my very first trimmer, so I didn&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li>/&gt; Kind of annoying but probably for the best, since I can get a better unit now.</li>
            <li>Take that for what it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say about 5 months worth of trimming.  </li>
            <li>Battery is fine as long as you charge it and my experience has been outstanding.</li>
            <li>and you needed to use it right away.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with power, though you do have to make sure to have a full charge before starting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only owned about 3 different, but I like this one the best so far.</li>
            <li>this is a great trimmer.the blades are strong to handle a tough beard,not like most trimmers with wimpy cutters.this is my third one of this model.</li>
            <li>Works great using daily, multiple settings, trims around ears too    </li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>To send unit end for battery replacement costs more than outright new replacement, hence the reason for the purchase of the new T765.</li>
            <li>The first one worked well, but died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Eventually my toddler dropped it one too many times, and the height adjuster doesn&#x27;t stay above 4.</li>
            <li>The short charge life means one more charger I have to take on vacation.</li>
            <li>My husband has used many of the trimmers and prefers this one only.</li>
            <li>You have to wait for the battery to charge up first before you can use it again.</li>
            <li>It trims my hair exactly the way i want it.</li>
            <li>If the t765 lasts half as long as my old trimmer, I&#x27;ll be happy!  </li>
            <li>LUCKILY I found a replacement for my old reliable and getting another one.  </li>
            <li>It is so nice to not have to keep track of a bunch of attachments, it really cuts down on the junk around the house.</li>
            <li>for anyone that wants to keep their beard neat.</li>
            <li>Even if I try to charge it for a full day, the battery won&#x27;t get charged, the unit simply gets hot to the touch.</li>
            <li>Very good battery Life,         lesser noise compared to other competitors,          Cuts evenly        Sizes to choose from        Blades work fine, even with very little maintaineance    </li>
            <li>i have tried many other trimmer</li>
            <li>I received this trimmer over 2 years ago for Christmas and it works better than any other beard trimmer I have used.  </li>
            <li>I noticed immediately how much lighter this trimmer was compared to the older model I had.</li>
            <li>The results from my second shave with this thing was a way short trim over my top lip and a much longer hair under my nose.</li>
            <li>It needs so many passes to do the job it takes longer than it used to take to shave, and the battery starts to wind down before I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>and I only used it because I was too cheap to buy a knew one, however since it stopped working completely, now I have to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>If you remove the length setter to get the closest shave possible, i.e. as a sideburn trimmer (like most electric razers come with), the blades are set so far apart that they actually pinch</li>
            <li>This model is a little smaller than my  last trimmer, it&#x27;s very light, and fits comfortably in my hand.  </li>
            <li>I finally had to replace it after it had lost too much power loss which I think is due more to the battery than the motor.  </li>
            <li>I tried to go back and trim the rest to match, but I just couldn&#x27;t seem to get the trimmer at just the right angle to get an even trim.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thinking this was all just a quirk, I bought this new model to replace the one I threw out.  </li>
            <li>I tried a new Norelco T980 trimmer to replace it.  </li>
            <li>However, this trimmer may look identical to the trimmer it replaced, it is much more light weight and holds a charge less than one half the time as the old trimmer.</li>
            <li>Firstly, the earlier model allowed you to trim your beard while it charged.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to trim my goatee which I keep pretty short.</li>
            <li>I have tried other trimmers, and I keep coming back to Norelco as being able to provide a basic trimmer that does exactly that - trims well.</li>
            <li>1 star--For an important thing like this, one can be either completely satisfied or completely un-satisfied, there can&#x27;t be anything between the two; nobody likes to spend money and time to settle for something mediocre.</li>
            <li>If you look at the picture, you don&#x27;t trim with the front edge like you do with other bear trimmers, but instead have to use the spring loaded flat top part.</li>
            <li>But I did notice right away that (a) it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long and (b) takes a while to do the job, with a lot of passes.</li>
            <li>The hair falls down, so you would need to clean up after you are done.    </li>
            <li>Go w/ the more powerful, yet expensive model.</li>
            <li>Clearly some sort of defect with the power supply/battery.</li>
            <li>Overall, it has held up really well.  </li>
            <li>My old Norelco trimmer just gave out on me, after 8 years.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really use the trimmer enough to justify it dying</li>
            <li>The blades just aren&#x27;t moving fast enough.  </li>
            <li>Had this for nearly a year and am about to throw it away and purchase a wahl, here&#x27;s why: &lt;br</li>
            <li>Thought my old one was dieing</li>
            <li>Forgot to charge the old one</li>
            <li>And now, it has completely stopped working.</li>
            <li>He is an old fashened man, and he didn&#x27;t want anything fancy.</li>
            <li>Even that would be ok for my current style, but the battery is practically dead, so every week I need to charge it all day and night just to get one use out of</li>
            <li>If you trim slowly you&#x27;re OK.  </li>
            <li>So far the only difference that I can see between the old and new are in the charger, and not the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Opening it up, I expected to see more than the single AA rechargeable battery (and a very low milliwatt rating one at that).  </li>
            <li>only downside i&#x27;ve experienced is that it tends to get clogged frequently and cutting efficency deminishes.  </li>
            <li>I set it to one of it&#x27;s 14 settings, applied normal pressure to the comb and same problem.  </li>
            <li>I like the option to change sizes(up to 9), which is very convenient, you also have a comb that moves with your face contour unlike the fixed combs seen on other models.</li>
            <li>My now-retired Panasonic shaver would go a week and a half of daily use on a single charge, and I&#x27;ll be looking for something that good after I get a few months out of this thing.</li>
            <li>I missed the first or second time like other trimmers that I have tried.</li>
            <li>The only draw back that I can see is that rechargable batteries are not user replacable, nor were they on the old T860.</li>
            <li>so you never really know how much charge is left.</li>
            <li>Appears better than average for quality but still not top quality.  </li>
            <li>Even when it is plugged in, it&#x27;s not receiving enough power to barely turn the motor.</li>
            <li>The motor continues to sound powerful but cutting capability definitely seems to have diminished.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, you might want to use this if you have a full beard, or a thick goatee, but if you want to keep it trimmed short, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li>The motor is weak, which means hair gets stuck in the blades rather than being nicely trimmed, and the battery life drops off after a few months to the point where the clippers need to be recharged after each use.</li>
            <li>Overall a decent buy for its price, if you are using it for your beard, but not worth it if you intend to use it only for your moustache...    </li>

            <li> Overall, i&#x27;m happy with this one, though.</li>
            <li> Cuts so smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li> The light never comes on.  </li>
            <li> maybe dropped some oil between the blades twice and brushed out the hair thrice, but it still does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> This is my very first trimmer, so I didn&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.</li>
            <li> /&gt; Kind of annoying but probably for the best, since I can get a better unit now.</li>

            <li> The first one worked well, but died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> and I only used it because I was too cheap to buy a knew one, however since it stopped working completely, now I have to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> If you remove the length setter to get the closest shave possible, i.e. as a sideburn trimmer (like most electric razers come with), the blades are set so far apart that they actually pinch</li>
            <li> This model is a little smaller than my  last trimmer, it&#x27;s very light, and fits comfortably in my hand.  </li>
            <li> I finally had to replace it after it had lost too much power loss which I think is due more to the battery than the motor.  </li>
            <li> I tried to go back and trim the rest to match, but I just couldn&#x27;t seem to get the trimmer at just the right angle to get an even trim.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thinking this was all just a quirk, I bought this new model to replace the one I threw out.  </li>
            <li> I tried a new Norelco T980 trimmer to replace it.  </li>
            <li> However, this trimmer may look identical to the trimmer it replaced, it is much more light weight and holds a charge less than one half the time as the old trimmer.</li>
            <li> Firstly, the earlier model allowed you to trim your beard while it charged.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to trim my goatee which I keep pretty short.</li>
            <li> I have tried other trimmers, and I keep coming back to Norelco as being able to provide a basic trimmer that does exactly that - trims well.</li>
            <li> 1 star--For an important thing like this, one can be either completely satisfied or completely un-satisfied, there can&#x27;t be anything between the two; nobody likes to spend money and time to settle for something mediocre.</li>
            <li> If you look at the picture, you don&#x27;t trim with the front edge like you do with other bear trimmers, but instead have to use the spring loaded flat top part.</li>
            <li> But I did notice right away that (a) it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long and (b) takes a while to do the job, with a lot of passes.</li>
            <li> The hair falls down, so you would need to clean up after you are done.    </li>
            <li> Go w/ the more powerful, yet expensive model.</li>
            <li> Clearly some sort of defect with the power supply/battery.</li>
            <li> Overall, it has held up really well.  </li>
            <li> My old Norelco trimmer just gave out on me, after 8 years.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really use the trimmer enough to justify it dying</li>
            <li> The blades just aren&#x27;t moving fast enough.  </li>
            <li> Had this for nearly a year and am about to throw it away and purchase a wahl, here&#x27;s why: &lt;br</li>
            <li> Thought my old one was dieing</li>
            <li> Forgot to charge the old one</li>
            <li> And now, it has completely stopped working.</li>
            <li> He is an old fashened man, and he didn&#x27;t want anything fancy.</li>
            <li> Even that would be ok for my current style, but the battery is practically dead, so every week I need to charge it all day and night just to get one use out of</li>
            <li> If you trim slowly you&#x27;re OK.  </li>
            <li> So far the only difference that I can see between the old and new are in the charger, and not the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Opening it up, I expected to see more than the single AA rechargeable battery (and a very low milliwatt rating one at that).  </li>
            <li> only downside i&#x27;ve experienced is that it tends to get clogged frequently and cutting efficency deminishes.  </li>
            <li> I set it to one of it&#x27;s 14 settings, applied normal pressure to the comb and same problem.  </li>
            <li> I like the option to change sizes(up to 9), which is very convenient, you also have a comb that moves with your face contour unlike the fixed combs seen on other models.</li>
            <li> My now-retired Panasonic shaver would go a week and a half of daily use on a single charge, and I&#x27;ll be looking for something that good after I get a few months out of this thing.</li>
            <li> I missed the first or second time like other trimmers that I have tried.</li>
            <li> The only draw back that I can see is that rechargable batteries are not user replacable, nor were they on the old T860.</li>
            <li> so you never really know how much charge is left.</li>
            <li> Appears better than average for quality but still not top quality.  </li>
            <li> Even when it is plugged in, it&#x27;s not receiving enough power to barely turn the motor.</li>
            <li> The motor continues to sound powerful but cutting capability definitely seems to have diminished.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, you might want to use this if you have a full beard, or a thick goatee, but if you want to keep it trimmed short, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> The motor is weak, which means hair gets stuck in the blades rather than being nicely trimmed, and the battery life drops off after a few months to the point where the clippers need to be recharged after each use.</li>
            <li> Overall a decent buy for its price, if you are using it for your beard, but not worth it if you intend to use it only for your moustache...    </li>
            <li> It trims unevenly, requiring multiple (and i mean more than five) passes in the same area to get the hairs somewhat the same length.</li>
            <li> The blade is so weak that it can&#x27;t be used to form the outline of the beard cleanly.</li>
            <li> B000FED5D0 Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer]] instead.</li>
            <li> My only complaint;the battery only lasts about two years,not long for a rechargable.</li>
            <li> itll last u a long time.</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t stay charged that long for one.  </li>
            <li> Also you have to be careful to apply equal pressure each time or your cut could be spotty because of the spring loaded guide.</li>
            <li> My next beard trimmer will certainly not be another one of these.</li>
            <li> I also found the new head to be very poor at keeping a unified level in my beard, something that really wasn&#x27;t a problem before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Moreover, despite Norelco/Philips being a foreign owned company the charge only works in the USA.</li>
            <li> my only other option would have been to remove the guard and free-hand the trim.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other Norelcos and had the same problem.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, I want to qualify these remarks by adding that I&#x27;ve used this trimmer heavily and have taken it with me on numerous trips.  </li>
            <li> I only use a trimmer about five months of the year and only a few times a week</li>
            <li> It trims my beard and stash effortlessly, and a single  charge lasts very long.</li>
            <li> It has a single wide-blade that is supposed to be used for both the beard and the moustache.</li>
            <li> Also the blade level adjuster is sensitive and when your trimming a rough beard its hard to keep the setting on the same number.</li>
            <li> second issue I have is with the trimmer head which they supposedly \\&quot;improved\\&quot; from the previous model.  </li>
            <li> I have to second all the writers who found this shaver to be much less than advertised.  </li>
            <li> This means it actually slows down, nearly to a stop, when trimming thick areas.</li>
            <li> (I once had to trim my beard in 30 sec.</li>
            <li> It was a total waste of</li>
            <li> If any companies are reading this you have a wide opening to take on Norelco.</li>
            <li> You only charge it once the battery is completely dead, then let it charge fully before use.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer, but it fell apart on me in a few months.</li>
            <li> The new head is this delicate flap that goes up and down as you turn the dial.  </li>
            <li> There is very little maneuverability for shaping the edges of a goatee or a moustache, the blade is just too big.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had to buy other brands</li>
            <li> Like the other users here, mine had limited battery capacity and after about 3 years was dead even after a charge.  </li>
            <li> This was no problem with the unit I had before, but it&#x27;s near impossible to get a decent trim with this thing.</li>
            <li> I never had this problem with the previous model or any other beard trimmer for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This allowed you to plug in the unit if you let the battery run down</li>
            <li> I owned the previous model (T-760)</li>
            <li> I had the previous Norelco introductory model for about two years.  </li>
            <li> Not cool.  </li>
            <li> dont waste your time and your money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need the \\&quot;side trimmer.\\&quot;  Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I spent the next couple days with a very uneven goatee.</li>
            <li> As others have pointed out Norelco has deliberately made it impossible to replace the rechargeable battery thus forcing you to replace the whole unit when the battery wears out, which it does rapidly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find one that is not outfitted with an unnecessary vacuum.</li>
            <li> Also, while trimming along my chin I seem to have tilted the thing just right to get a very short trim on one spot which looked real bad.</li>
            <li> Over the past five or six years I&#x27;ve owned two beard trimmers of this model.  </li>
            <li> Its flexible head curves around my face without missing tough spots.  </li>
            <li> I use this at least once a week to trim up.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t treat your trimmer delicately (and who does?) and throw this thing in your shaving kit or luggage</li>
            <li> However, one big disappointment, they eliminated the \\&quot;corded\\&quot; feature.  </li>
            <li> The design is bad, and the battery croaked after a few years of use(while religiously following the use/recharge guide).  </li>
            <li> I think that the negative battery reviews come from people that don&#x27;t understand how to charge a NiCad battery.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m seriously considering buying this model again if I don&#x27;t go for the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> (the only bad thing about this is it is a bit noisy compared to Norelco T765).</li>
            <li> the wide trimmer doesnt allow you to trim your mustache properly and does not cut evenly under the nose which is very annoying!!</li>
            <li> Without a narrow-blade it is very difficult to define the line of moustache because the wide blade cuts at un-intended places too. &lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer to replace another Norelco trimmer which had broken.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve broken two of these.  </li>
            <li> you just might find that you&#x27;ve broken this small piece of plastic and thus made your trimmer completely worthless.  </li>
            <li> I hate to throw stuff away without at least trying to fix it.  </li>
            <li> Also as others have said if you want a close trim, you will probably end up looking like a bad joke with plenty of skin showing.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s bad:</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re in for a painful surprise.  </li>
            <li> the skin - painful and slightly bloody.</li>
            <li> For two, it just cut horribly.  </li>
            <li> This design is just horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I&#x27;ve only owned about 3 different, but I like this one the best so far. The best feature is the length adjustment. It is so nice to not have to keep track of a bunch of attachments, it really cuts down on the junk around the house. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with power, though you do have to make sure to have a full charge before starting. Plan 8 hours ahead. I wish they made an all metal, corded model with this kind of length adjustment.</li>
            <li> the wide trimmer doesnt allow you to trim your mustache properly and does not cut evenly under the nose which is very annoying!! Also the blade level adjuster is sensitive and when your trimming a rough beard its hard to keep the setting on the same number. dont waste your time and your money.</li>
            <li> This is the second beard and moustache timmer made by Norelco that I purchased but this one only lasted 6 months. I noticed immediately how much lighter this trimmer was compared to the older model I had. It must have been because of the all plastic insides since after ONLY six months the teeth that allow the trimmer to adjust broke and I had to throw it away. Guess, I should have opted for the more expensive model........ lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer to replace another Norelco trimmer which had broken. I have been pleased with both of them. They do a good job for me, and I am pretty particular about the way my beard looks. My first one had a vaccuum feature which caught most of the whiskers, and I liked that better than this one, which has no vaccuum. Overall, i&#x27;m happy with this one, though.</li>
            <li> Still working strong.  I use this at least once a week to trim up.</li>
            <li> As others have pointed out Norelco has deliberately made it impossible to replace the rechargeable battery thus forcing you to replace the whole unit when the battery wears out, which it does rapidly. Moreover, despite Norelco/Philips being a foreign owned company the charge only works in the USA.</li>
            <li> After just one year the rechargeable battery suddenly doesn&#x27;t hold a charge. The battery is not replaceable. For my next purchase I&#x27;m staying away from Norelco.</li>
            <li> Over the past five or six years I&#x27;ve owned two beard trimmers of this model.  There are three things I want to say here.    Firstly, the earlier model allowed you to trim your beard while it charged.  The current model, however, does not allow you to do this.  So if you have zero or a low charge, then you have to plug it into the wall and wait.  You can&#x27;t just plug it in and turn the trimmer on.  This can be a pain if you travel a lot.  For example, you might reach your destination only to find that you have no charge or the charge runs out while trimming.  (I once had to trim my beard in 30 sec. spurts, which was a pain.  I had to turn the trimmer off for five minutes at a time so that it could regain a usable charge.)    Secondly, the trimmer comb (which covers the blades and allows you to adjust the length setting) is somewhat fragile.  I&#x27;ve broken two of these.  One of them broke while I tapped it against the sink.  Another one broke while I was using it against my face.  If you look on amazon, you&#x27;ll find that the trimmer comb is replaceable for $25.  (A huge ripoff.)    Lastly, I want to qualify these remarks by adding that I&#x27;ve used this trimmer heavily and have taken it with me on numerous trips.  Overall, it has held up really well.  Take that for what it&#x27;s worth.  But, all in all, I would recommend a different beard trimmer.  My next beard trimmer will certainly not be another one of these.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco trimmer just gave out on me, after 8 years.  I&#x27;ve had the t765 for about 4 months now, and I&#x27;m very happy  with it. It trims my beard and stash effortlessly, and a single  charge lasts very long. This model is a little smaller than my  last trimmer, it&#x27;s very light, and fits comfortably in my hand.  If the t765 lasts half as long as my old trimmer, I&#x27;ll be happy!  For $20.00 you can&#x27;t beat this Norelco trimmer!</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;basic\\&quot; model does the trick for my beard.  Cuts so smoothly and evenly.  Its flexible head curves around my face without missing tough spots.  Holds power well.  Be sure to read all the directions about charing, I had never known many of the suggestions before.</li>
            <li> Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  I owned the previous model (T-760) and after about a year it became unchargeable.  Looks like it&#x27;s charging, but doesn&#x27;t actually charge.  Figured it was a fluke and bought another one a year ago and wallah! Same problem.  However, this time, it doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s charging.  The light never comes on.  I guess for 17 bucks, that&#x27;s what we should expect.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco T765 AccuTrim Beard and Moustache Trimmer is not as good as Model T990.</li>
            <li> I had the previous Norelco introductory model for about two years.  The rechargeable batteries, as others have noted, wore out rather quickly.  I only use a trimmer about five months of the year and only a few times a week so I didn&#x27;t really use the trimmer enough to justify it dying so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking this was all just a quirk, I bought this new model to replace the one I threw out.  It was a total waste of money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest issue is the lack of power in the motor.  This thing, even when fully charged, will PULL the hair off your face if you trim too quickly.  The blades just aren&#x27;t moving fast enough.  If you trim slowly you&#x27;re OK.  If you&#x27;re in a hurry and trim quickly you&#x27;re in for a painful surprise.  I never had this problem with the previous model or any other beard trimmer for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second issue I have is with the trimmer head which they supposedly \\&quot;improved\\&quot; from the previous model.  The new head is this delicate flap that goes up and down as you turn the dial.  If you don&#x27;t treat your trimmer delicately (and who does?) and throw this thing in your shaving kit or luggage you just might find that you&#x27;ve broken this small piece of plastic and thus made your trimmer completely worthless.  I also found the new head to be very poor at keeping a unified level in my beard, something that really wasn&#x27;t a problem before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco has lost my business.  The next trimmer I buy will be from another company.  Based on many positive reviews here on Amazon it looks like Remington has some good models.</li>
            <li> this is a great trimmer.the blades are strong to handle a tough beard,not like most trimmers with wimpy cutters.this is my third one of this model.My only complaint;the battery only lasts about two years,not long for a rechargable.</li>
            <li> Last year my trusty Philips Norelco T765 finally gave out. I bought the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer, but it fell apart on me in a few months. So I&#x27;m back to the T765. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, it&#x27;s well-made, and it will last!</li>
            <li> Second Norelco I purchased.  The first one worked well, but died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking they were the same product, I went w/ the T765 b/c I didn&#x27;t need the \\&quot;side trimmer.\\&quot;  Waste of money.  Go w/ the more powerful, yet expensive model.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HUSBAND TO TRIM HIS BEARD AND MUSTACHE. IT WORKS GREAT!!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this trimmer for about 3 years now. The motor continues to sound powerful but cutting capability definitely seems to have diminished. I am thinking that it is owing to the fact that there is build up of hair inside of the trimmer. There is no separate pouch that holds cut hair so you will need to clean up after you are done. I use it once or twice a week and, at that rate, it needs to be charged once every 3 to 4 months or so.</li>
            <li> Purchased Model T765 because of prior experience with Model T860 by same manufacturer. Love the built-in adjustability without changing attachment shoes. So far the only difference that I can see between the old and new are in the charger, and not the trimmer. The only draw back that I can see is that rechargable batteries are not user replacable, nor were they on the old T860. I believe it&#x27;s called planned obsolesence. To send unit end for battery replacement costs more than outright new replacement, hence the reason for the purchase of the new T765.</li>
            <li> The motor is weak, which means hair gets stuck in the blades rather than being nicely trimmed, and the battery life drops off after a few months to the point where the clippers need to be recharged after each use.</li>
            <li> This has been a reliable trimmer for my beard and mustache. Eventually my toddler dropped it one too many times, and the height adjuster doesn&#x27;t stay above 4. Even that would be ok for my current style, but the battery is practically dead, so every week I need to charge it all day and night just to get one use out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m seriously considering buying this model again if I don&#x27;t go for the [[ASIN:B000FED5D0 Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer]] instead.</li>
            <li> This model performs as well as two earlier Norelco models I have owned.  However, one big disappointment, they eliminated the \\&quot;corded\\&quot; feature.  This allowed you to plug in the unit if you let the battery run down and you needed to use it right away.</li>
            <li> When i ordered this as a moustache trimmer. I was hoping it would be sleek enough to maneuver around my moustache, but it turned out to be quite bulky. I like the option to change sizes(up to 9), which is very convenient, you also have a comb that moves with your face contour unlike the fixed combs seen on other models. Overall a decent buy for its price, if you are using it for your beard, but not worth it if you intend to use it only for your moustache...    UPDATE---  7months later--    Pros: Very good battery Life,         lesser noise compared to other competitors,          Cuts evenly        Sizes to choose from        Blades work fine, even with very little maintaineance    Cons:  There is very little maneuverability for shaping the edges of a goatee or a moustache, the blade is just too big. The hair falls down, so you would need to clean up after you are done.    Conclusion: this will trim your beard and Moustache evenly, but cant be used for shaping the edges because of its size, the size is both its advantage and disadvantage.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve taken care of it...maybe dropped some oil between the blades twice and brushed out the hair thrice, but it still does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this to keep my goatee trimmed and to that end, it works great.  It&#x27;s quick, cuts even, and holds a charge for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the blade to edge around or trim your sideburns, it&#x27;s not that great.  I never use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this and glad I was so wise all those years ago.</li>
            <li> I had been searching for this model for months!  The last one I had lasted for about eight years.  The price is greaat and this trimmer works well!</li>
            <li> The Product does as stated and seems to work fine. However, this trimmer may look identical to the trimmer it replaced, it is much more light weight and holds a charge less than one half the time as the old trimmer. But, I consider it a good value because it does the job like the older model. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for like 2 years and I only used it because I was too cheap to buy a knew one, however since it stopped working completely, now I have to get a new one.  It wouldn&#x27;t stay charged that long for one.  For two, it just cut horribly.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest this product to anybody.  Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Like the other users here, mine had limited battery capacity and after about 3 years was dead even after a charge.  Opening it up, I expected to see more than the single AA rechargeable battery (and a very low milliwatt rating one at that).  The Philips replacement battery is 6 dollars plus shipping.    I replaced it with a generic AA rechargeable ($2.25) with 4 times the mw rating.  Big improvement. I hate to throw stuff away without at least trying to fix it.  This is a task anybody with a screwdriver and soldering gun can do.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for with this trimmer. There is no battery indicator so you never really know how much charge is left. You also can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged into the wall. It seems to charge and charge for ever. The trimmer blade is good though, with a good adjustable height that won&#x27;t move on you when pressed against your face. Overall a good trimmer. It&#x27;s hard to find one that is not outfitted with an unnecessary vacuum.</li>
            <li> Had this for nearly a year and am about to throw it away and purchase a wahl, here&#x27;s why: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;1.  Even at full charge, the motor lacks power.  This means it actually slows down, nearly to a stop, when trimming thick areas. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2.  It trims unevenly, requiring multiple (and i mean more than five) passes in the same area to get the hairs somewhat the same length. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;3.  If you remove the length setter to get the closest shave possible, i.e. as a sideburn trimmer (like most electric razers come with), the blades are set so far apart that they actually pinch the skin - painful and slightly bloody. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Avoid this one at all costs.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works better than most in all areas (esp. battery charge life!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only downside i&#x27;ve experienced is that it tends to get clogged frequently and cutting efficency deminishes.  so clean it as you use it, and all is well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> If people with really good trimmers saw how I operated with this trimmer they&#x27;d probably laugh. You have to go over and over and over the same spot to cut your beard with any semblance of uniformity. Also you have to be careful to apply equal pressure each time or your cut could be spotty because of the spring loaded guide. Also as others have said if you want a close trim, you will probably end up looking like a bad joke with plenty of skin showing. &lt;br /&gt; The design is bad, and the battery croaked after a few years of use(while religiously following the use/recharge guide).  &lt;br /&gt; Kind of annoying but probably for the best, since I can get a better unit now. &lt;br /&gt; When you look at the selection of 115-220 volt travel trimmers its no wonder that Norelco is producing garbage theres almost no competition. If any companies are reading this you have a wide opening to take on Norelco.</li>
            <li> I have to second all the writers who found this shaver to be much less than advertised.  It stopped taking a charge about 6 months after I purchased it.  It is truly underpowered and overpriced.  Please stay away from it.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for a T765 I&#x27;ve had several years. Thought my old one was dieing so I ordered this one. Forgot to charge the old one so now I&#x27;ve got two. Very satisfied with the unit and the value for the price. Battery is fine as long as you charge it and my experience has been outstanding. Don&#x27;t know anywhere else you can get these features at this price. VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER / USER !!!</li>
            <li> Pros: Works great using daily, multiple settings, trims around ears too    Cons: None    Recommend: Definitely</li>
            <li> This design is just horrible. I bought this to trim my goatee which I keep pretty short. This was no problem with the unit I had before, but it&#x27;s near impossible to get a decent trim with this thing. If you look at the picture, you don&#x27;t trim with the front edge like you do with other bear trimmers, but instead have to use the spring loaded flat top part. The results from my second shave with this thing was a way short trim over my top lip and a much longer hair under my nose. Also, while trimming along my chin I seem to have tilted the thing just right to get a very short trim on one spot which looked real bad. I tried to go back and trim the rest to match, but I just couldn&#x27;t seem to get the trimmer at just the right angle to get an even trim. Since I already had the thing set to 1 my only other option would have been to remove the guard and free-hand the trim. Needless to say, I spent the next couple days with a very uneven goatee. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The next problem I have with this thing is that you can&#x27;t just plug it in and use it. It has to charge before you can use it, so if a charge runs out before you are done trimming, you have to wait until it charges to finish. This is completely opposite to the way their electric razors work, where if the charge runs low while shaving, you just plug it in and continue. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall, you might want to use this if you have a full beard, or a thick goatee, but if you want to keep it trimmed short, this is not the product for you. I&#x27;m going to go buy something else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one these trimmers (a T860) for more years than I can remember, well 3 or 4.  I finally had to replace it after it had lost too much power loss which I think is due more to the battery than the motor.  I&#x27;ve had other Norelcos and had the same problem.  I tried a new Norelco T980 trimmer to replace it.  Well it has neat features but it wouldn&#x27;t stay locked on the setting so I ended up having to trim at the lowest setting.  Not cool.  After 3 weeks of that I returned it &amp; got a Panasonic All In One trimmer.  I set it to one of it&#x27;s 14 settings, applied normal pressure to the comb and same problem.  LUCKILY I found a replacement for my old reliable and getting another one.  I might buy 2!  Word to the wise, if it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for over a year now, but I&#x27;ve only had a beard intermittently during that time. I&#x27;d say about 5 months worth of trimming.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, like another user said, this thing was definitely under-powered from the start. And now, it has completely stopped working. It won&#x27;t hold a charge at all. Even when it is plugged in, it&#x27;s not receiving enough power to barely turn the motor. Even if I try to charge it for a full day, the battery won&#x27;t get charged, the unit simply gets hot to the touch. Clearly some sort of defect with the power supply/battery. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is my very first trimmer, so I didn&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. But I did notice right away that (a) it doesn&#x27;t hold a charge very long and (b) takes a while to do the job, with a lot of passes. The short charge life means one more charger I have to take on vacation. It needs so many passes to do the job it takes longer than it used to take to shave, and the battery starts to wind down before I&#x27;m done. My now-retired Panasonic shaver would go a week and a half of daily use on a single charge, and I&#x27;ll be looking for something that good after I get a few months out of this thing. I won&#x27;t buy another Norelco.</li>
            <li> I purchased Norelco AccuTrim Beard and Moustache Trimmer for my husband. He is an old fashened man, and he didn&#x27;t want anything fancy. This trimmer is very easy and comfortable to use. And the price is great.</li>
            <li> My husband has used many of the trimmers and prefers this one only. Says that it is the best he has come across. Can&#x27;t find them locally so we have to order them from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> works great.  i&#x27;ve had mine for years and this thing keeps me looking studly. how do I know?&lt;br /&gt;ask my wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;recommended for anyone that wants to keep their beard neat.</li>
            <li> I have tried other trimmers, and I keep coming back to Norelco as being able to provide a basic trimmer that does exactly that - trims well. I don&#x27;t have to spend 10 minutes going over the same spot to catch all of the hair I missed the first or second time like other trimmers that I have tried. I would have given it 5 stars, but when I held it in my hand, it feels like the material is not the highest quality (i.e.; the feel, look and weight of it were just off in my opinion).</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s bad: &lt;br /&gt;1. It has a single wide-blade that is supposed to be used for both the beard and the moustache. Without a narrow-blade it is very difficult to define the line of moustache because the wide blade cuts at un-intended places too. &lt;br /&gt;2. The blade is so weak that it can&#x27;t be used to form the outline of the beard cleanly. Hairs outside the outline of the beard can&#x27;t get a close cut. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Why 1 star--For an important thing like this, one can be either completely satisfied or completely un-satisfied, there can&#x27;t be anything between the two; nobody likes to spend money and time to settle for something mediocre. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Within a week I switched to another trimmer and I like it very much. Its Wahl Groomsman XL2, I bought it at Walmart. It has dual blades; and it works great in trimming and removing unwanted hairs (the only bad thing about this is it is a bit noisy compared to Norelco T765).</li>
            <li> Appears better than average for quality but still not top quality.  Drawback is an inability to use the shaver with the AC charging cable after the battery has died and you plug in the AC charger.  You have to wait for the battery to charge up first before you can use it again.</li>
            <li> this machine gave me the perfect result i needed for the past 1 year.  i have tried many other trimmer but their sizes werent good but this trimmers were perfect and itll last u a long time. it is best for the price.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer. It trims my hair exactly the way i want it. It&#x27;s so light and durable too! It&#x27;s also very quick and easy to clean. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it! &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I received this trimmer over 2 years ago for Christmas and it works better than any other beard trimmer I have used.  It&#x27;s easily adjustable and I find the battery to hold a charge for weeks before needing a recharge.   I think that the negative battery reviews come from people that don&#x27;t understand how to charge a NiCad battery.  You only charge it once the battery is completely dead, then let it charge fully before use.  Do this and this battery will last you 4-5 years.  I use this trimmer once a week and charge it once every 6 weeks.  It doesn&#x27;t get any better than that!</li>
            <li> The model numbers keep changing and I&#x27;ve had to buy other brands (forgot to pack it etc) but I always return to Philips/Norelco as the best of its kind for this appliance. Great value too.</li>
