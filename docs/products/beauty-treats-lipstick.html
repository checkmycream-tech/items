            <li>Now i bought this because it was a good price.</li>

            <li>I love mood lipstick!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s amazing and the color stays on for hours.</li>
            <li>I cant wait to see her face when i get her these amazing lipsticks that have been so amazing for her.</li>
            <li>Nice lipsticks.</li>
            <li>You can build up the color, which is nice.</li>
            <li>The aloe vera part is nice;  feels nice when you put it on.  </li>
            <li>It keeps her lips nice and moist and kissable.</li>
            <li>This lipstick is really nice.</li>
            <li>, I love a good deal, I&#x27;ll give it a try.&#x27;</li>
            <li>Liked having two tubes of each color.</li>
            <li>More like lipstain than lipstick, but the color is good and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>great moisturizing for your lips and the color stays on better than most lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>They liked the variety included.</li>
            <li>The lighter colors were nice and stayed on for a while.  </li>
            <li>[so I received it VERY quickly], I am loving the feel of this lipstick and</li>
            <li>I really liked them.</li>
            <li>The ladies were thrilled.</li>
            <li>I was kind of hoping there would be some variation of color depending on which lipstick you put on, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li>but this product is the absolute best out there!</li>
            <li>Although also can see that they can break off very easily.</li>
            <li>I guess they would be ok if that is your kind of color</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even tried making my own concoctions using the most stain-inducing things I know (</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE these lipsticks!</li>
            <li>Love it had a tube before and every time I used it my friends wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>Love the color changing factor.</li>
            <li>Fun noveltyipstick, gave all kinds of this away and everyone loved it.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be more hydrating since it was from aloe vera.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over a decade and need to order more.  </li>
            <li>However, since the latest flap about lead in lipstick, I have checked the tube....  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d consider them more of a tinted stain.</li>
            <li>These Aloe Vera ones work just as well when I want to take a break and need something more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I thought these would be more like lip glosses than lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I love these!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love, love LOVE them.</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>If pinkish hues are in your color wheel you will love these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually quite impressed with the staining ability of both products (Fran Wilson and Princessa).</li>
            <li>so will be able to use them all.  </li>
            <li>These fit the bill!  </li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll keep 4 and give the rest of them away as gifts :-)</li>
            <li>love them!&lt;br</li>
            <li>the tendency of staying  the color on the lips was quite impressive, which meant  stayed the same color all through the evening when I wore it in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I love these....</li>
            <li>They are more moisturizing that the Fran Wilson MoodMatcher Lipstick</li>
            <li>This is really cute mood lipstick.</li>
            <li>this is more for play or dress up, not for going out unless you&#x27;re going to an 80&#x27;s dance party.</li>
            <li>but I love the ones I have.</li>
            <li>Having been using this product for years because I love it.  </li>
            <li>the lips rather than sitting on top of the lips</li>
            <li>The lady&#x27;s love them.</li>
            <li>I have used this lipstick for many years.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love my aloe vera lipsticks and yes i recommended and change colors</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick.  </li>
            <li>I love the Aloe Vera Color Change Mood Lipstick.  </li>
            <li>but love the quanity and the shades and the cost</li>
            <li>Make-up was on the top of her Christmas &amp;#34;Santa&amp;#34; wish list.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Longlasting and lovely color</li>
            <li>There are so many of them I can stash them everywhere</li>
            <li>These really are great.</li>
            <li>one is more of a deeper purple shade.</li>
            <li>They do an ok job of lip moisture.</li>
            <li>The best thing about them is they last longer than most lip colors I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying the lipstick</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>This feels more like chapstick or lip balm than lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Mood Lipsticks purchased from Sally&#x27;s that were much better.</li>
            <li>That being said though I still would recommend them as like a party favor gift or some thing :)</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>and she is very excited and pleased about them as well.</li>
            <li>Super cute :) works well!</li>
            <li>Super cute!</li>
            <li>, it gave me a rash on my cheek, when my jerky friend gave me a kiss.(i have sensative skin)oh and the Colors are sililar and pretty bright,so if you don&#x27;t want bright don&#x27;t layer it.</li>
            <li>The price makes it 10x better, and oh lets not forget the quick and punctual delivery!</li>
            <li>I love layering the colors for an even more unique look.</li>
            <li>I love these - they go on smooth - aloe</li>
            <li>FAST DELIVERY PRODUCT NOT AS GOOD AS OTHERS.</li>
            <li>Super cute and goes on super nice as well.</li>
            <li>The colors are light and bright, which would be perfect for a young girl who&#x27;s starting to explore and play with makeup.</li>
            <li>I tried to refrigerate them to harden them but they melted again very quickly after i removed them.</li>
            <li>Easy on the lips.</li>
            <li>And it does come off easily with a dab of napkins or smear with anything that my lips touches.  </li>
            <li>Good and vibrant</li>
            <li>/&gt;they look so pretty and kind of natural&lt;</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend, they are at a cheap price and have a great value.</li>
            <li>fun but not practical - great for young girls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they have a smooth feel</li>
            <li>cannot believe how cheap these were.</li>
            <li>I tried on my lipstick and it was smooth, creamy and it stays on through the night ....</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on smooth and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thoroughly enjoy them</li>
            <li>The plastic tubes are cheap, but they do work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So cheap, how couldn&#x27;t I?</li>
            <li>It was cheap, but now I know why.</li>
            <li>Amazing, very lubricating and arrived as promised.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>(they would make great little presents for kids AND adults), and a STEAL for 12 really fun lipsticks for under $7!!!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure one will be the right shade.</li>
            <li>The color stays on very well, when the glossiness fades away the color stays!!!</li>
            <li>I was soo excited my item came in 24hrs</li>
            <li>The stain is more light than bright, and lasts longer than I expected.</li>
            <li>These would be fun for girls of every age to try!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m actually going to buy more so that I have extras to gift to my loved ones, put around the house, my car, my purse and maybe even give to my 4-year-old daughter for fun...</li>
            <li>more pigmented than I thought, still very wearable colors!</li>
            <li>my lips were bright pink.my favorite are the light purple orange and dark purple.unfortunately</li>
            <li>They may not stay bright all day, but you still have color after lunch well into the afternoon, and if you are like me, I only put on lipstick maybe twice a day</li>
            <li>This product is not only color changing (depending on your body temp) but the Aloe is good for your lips.</li>
            <li>Good Price but the only con was it was a 12pc ...</li>
            <li>These lipsticks are insanely cool.</li>
            <li>Good product, but only received 6pcs and not as pictured here.</li>
            <li>They feel really moist on your skin, and don&#x27;t cake like most lipsticks</li>
            <li>I still think these were fun and totally worth $7 for 12 lipsticks!</li>
            <li>It last for many many hours.</li>
            <li>The product was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>They are all very soft and leave your lips feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li>cases are simple plastic casings but the flowers on the tube are very cute.</li>
            <li>They are good in the fact that they moisturize and stain my lips for a long time.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>They last many years!</li>
            <li>in all, for less than $7 and free shipping, this is still a good value and is a novelty.</li>
            <li>This lipstick is so very moist and smooth.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product if you want bright pink lipstick.</li>
            <li>bright pink.</li>
            <li>I like these for light use and moisturizing, for daytime around the house, when I don&#x27;t wear much makeup.</li>
            <li>It is amazing at the various shades we are finding.</li>
            <li>Nice for a present or to keep it for you.</li>
            <li>so I have to put a top layer of Baby Soft Lips over it</li>
            <li>A lot of fun to play around with.</li>
            <li>I bought these just for fun to give to my sisters, and laugh about guessing the &amp;#34;mood&amp;#34; we were in based on the lipstick.</li>
            <li>When they came a day early :)) i put one on and looked it looked flea,so i was mad.but</li>
            <li>My mom and her friends laugh at me because they had &amp;#34;Mood Lipsticks&amp;#34; when they were my age</li>
            <li>/&gt;Green: AWW YAS.</li>
            <li>The colors and tube design are fun.</li>
            <li>I find this lipstick fun</li>
            <li>They are good if I wear one and then apply a real lipstick over it so if my actual lipstick fades, my lips will be stained from this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think Fran Wilson&#x27;s brand would be any different to be honest.  </li>
            <li>Fun to have mystery colors</li>
            <li>It wasnt worth my money at all</li>
            <li>I thought this lipstick will come in it&#x27;s own individual color.</li>
            <li>Not heavy or sticky; fragrance free and taste free.</li>
            <li>The blue and purple tubes have a somewhat purplish/blue tint that might come in handy for Halloween, or if you are going for a bruised-lip look.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item thinking i was colorful lipstick and its not.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re just fun colors of chapsticks that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>this review was helpful!be even give to my 4-year-old daughter for fun...</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Could not say enough nice things about the product.</li>
            <li>I love the formula, the smell, and the texture, but as far as color changing no.</li>
            <li>They are really fun.</li>
            <li>I just love pink lipstick and these are just so much fun!!</li>
            <li>:0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magenta ...[sigh] bright pink!</li>
            <li>I am a lover of mood lip stick because you don&#x27;t have to search for the right shade its always right.</li>
            <li>and then it disappears right away.  </li>
            <li>so the mood lipstick is the right color all the time for you.</li>
            <li>If you do not look good in hot pink lipstick then this is not the right product for you.</li>
            <li>was thrilled about it, but what I was even more thrilled about (and the reason for such a good review) is that I have literally spent years and an obscene amount of money looking for a lip color that would last as long as this stuff does.</li>
            <li>They give off beautiful, rosy pink colors and moisturize better than my other lipsticks/lipbalms.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing as well as fun with pretty flowery lipstick cases!</li>
            <li>Better be sure you get a color applied correctly or you&#x27;ll have trouble removing the color.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this lipstick to anyone, it is more than worth the money.</li>
            <li>:) It&#x27;s a great deal for the price even though the lipsticks are a little dry and not as moist as I thought they would be.</li>
            <li>Just like 30 years ago, the real mc coy!</li>
            <li>I would love to know of one that actually stayed on.  </li>
            <li>Colors mostly the same.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You might be interested to know that these are lip staining lipsticks ...</li>
            <li>They were of equal strength in their staining ability (i.e., one did not stain any better than the other).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So glad I did because this feels like a lip balm with enhanced lasting color.  </li>
            <li>Mostly, the colors all turn out to be almost the same color</li>
            <li>Its exactly as I pictured it</li>
            <li>, I dont recommend this product I wish I can get my money back or get better lipsticks</li>
            <li>The others vary from pretty pinks to corals.</li>
            <li>I ended up tossing 4 because of this, and tossed 4 more because of the blue color of the lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and moist, but I actually gave most of them to my young niece.</li>
            <li>My first experiment with a mood lipstick was in 1980-something ...</li>
            <li>(1) It seemed a bit more sheer in coverage.</li>
            <li>- I used (sandalwood) soap and water (as hot as I could stand it), then scrubbed with fingers and fingernails until it all came off.</li>
            <li>- I used (sandalwood) soap and water (as hot as I could stand it), then scrubbed with fingers and fingernails until it all came off.</li>
            <li>they last for a long time on your lips feel great</li>
            <li>I love this lipstick, it stays on better than the expensive brands, I was just glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Also cause i though it was going to be almost exactly the color of the lipstick until i read the details which was my fault</li>
            <li>It stays forever first</li>
            <li>most of the colors were the same.  </li>
            <li>This lipstick works with your body chemistry and on me turns a nice shade of pink.  </li>
            <li>Thia 12 pc set is great and will last me a long time</li>
            <li>one of them on me is a really pretty shade of coral like persimmon color</li>
            <li>pretty color</li>
            <li>Fast postage to Oz!</li>
            <li>At first I thought this was a bust.</li>
            <li>I should have stuck with the original, [[ASIN:B001LR3NSC MOODmatcher Lipstick]], which has vibrant colors and real staying power, and not cheaped out on these.</li>
            <li>A person with more yellow pigment or someone who tans easily may have a totally different experience.</li>
            <li>I wear different colors on different days according to my mood which is almost always good.  </li>
            <li>The blue one is a darker purple - pink on me, pretty bright but fun.</li>
            <li>well first off most of the lipsticks are pink</li>
            <li>Fairly moisturizing and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Also color changes are more subtle in some and more vibrant in others.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it seems that no matter what color you put on, it all turns into bright pink.</li>
            <li>The real \\&quot;mood\\&quot; lipstain.  </li>
            <li>All the colors end up being a shade of pink or pinkish purple :)</li>
            <li>and they really do stain</li>
            <li>I really like every color.  </li>
            <li>i got it fast in the mail.</li>
            <li>Lipsticks very waxy.</li>
            <li>so well I bought a pack for my  mom who really loves it.</li>
            <li>There are some really &amp;#34;offensively pink&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I hope this may help some of the fairer-skinned ladies make a reasonably informed choice of whether these lipsticks will \\&quot;work\\&quot; for you, or not. :</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t (yet) rate their moisturizing qualities, (if any), since I have not yet really worn them on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t (yet) rate their moisturizing qualities, (if any), since I have not yet really worn them on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it really conditions on it</li>
            <li>I really like them</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really listen to anyone about color,</li>
            <li>yes they are mostly shades of pink,</li>
            <li>colors that show up are a light red color.</li>
            <li>but on the other hand the color is ok</li>
            <li>pure food coloring, highly concentrated kool aid mix, etc.)</li>
            <li>Such a great pink color!!!!</li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s ok its very pink</li>
            <li>I really like how I get an extra lipstick for each color, that is cool.</li>
            <li>They are all some variation of pink red and purple, no real diversity,and they dont change colors, as far as i can see, but they are great quality for the price and quantity, and the colors are really cool to see which one is which</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s purple and a hot ping but makes my lips soft</li>
            <li>ALSO, it is true that there is relatively NO difference in the colors as they show up after application--</li>
            <li>Would&#x27;ve liked blues and purples too, but after reading the other reviews, it looks like most people expected the same thing.</li>
            <li>blue became a bluish hot-pink which was a little too bright for my taste -</li>
            <li>I might use this as lip gloss under my lipstick, I&#x27;m not really into bright pink.</li>
            <li>Since there were so many, I split half of them with a friend</li>
            <li>It more or less dyes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never left such a nonsensical review before, that&#x27;s how much I love</li>
            <li>They are soft and moist but too many pink colors.</li>
            <li>Well, since I was only doing a quick colour test on my hand, I used hand moisturizer before swiping them.  </li>
            <li>Well, since I was only doing a quick colour test on my hand, I used hand moisturizer before swiping them.  </li>
            <li>The color of the lipstick was not as vibrant as it was described to be.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>yet so they are decently sturdy but I wouldn&#x27;t stress test them.</li>
            <li>The price was super low</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pretty, going from a sheer pale pink to very a very bright hot pink.</li>
            <li>I can say, however, the pink I&#x27;m strutting is bright and really does seem to go with MY skin tone, more than any other straight pink-colored lipstick I&#x27;ve tried before...</li>
            <li>Your lips look really natural as if it is the real color of your lips.  </li>
            <li>they are just normal, i use them just for have my lips moisturized.</li>
            <li>(IT&#x27;S JUST LIKE THE  GREEN MOOD LIPSTICK OF THE 70&#x27;s just more shades to choose from)</li>
            <li>Overall these lipsticks were so fun</li>
            <li>Once caution though, pretty much all the lipsticks end up being some variant of hot pink.</li>
            <li>No matter what color  you apply, the result is basically the same light hot pink.</li>
            <li>and i can&#x27;t live without it...</li>
            <li>I was also expecting more of a range on the colors, it&#x27;s always the same pink on me.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re drying lipsticks that come in the most hideous shades of pink, red, and purple imaginable.</li>
            <li>i will by more.be aware the colour last forever</li>
            <li>but I would have liked a red orange another color besides ONLY pink</li>
            <li>probably the color I first tried back in the &#x27;80s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish it changed many other colors besides only shades</li>
            <li>You can really have fun with them because every one is a different color on different people, they even change on me depending on weather.</li>
            <li>It kind of made my lips a little dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for years, much better than any lipstick as regular lipstick wears off only has that color, but mood liptick lasts all day long and is activated by your body temperature</li>
            <li>The light pink turned a dark pink (most unflattering).  </li>
            <li>They are silky, and smooth, and they stay for such a long time!!  </li>
            <li>doest change colour(( Blue one looks like dead person((( others are just great, very long lasting lipsticks and soften lips, aloe vera works!!!</li>
            <li>I love mood lipstick and its hard to find.</li>
            <li>It definitely does not come off as easy as other lipsticks, and you won&#x27;t leave stains on mugs, cheeks, etc.</li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;ve only had them for 3 months, I&#x27;m hard pressed to believe I&#x27;ll stop loving these when I&#x27;m no longer 20.</li>
            <li>back it turned light pink</li>
            <li>i really like this lip sticks i put on the blue</li>
            <li>So do you know or can you direct me to where I can find the information?</li>
            <li>What does my natural lip color even look like?</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Party favors for 12 year old birthday party.</li>
            <li>All of them are &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; colors and not as natural as I had hoped</li>
            <li>it is sattin then completely matte</li>
            <li>Leaves your lips feeling soft.  </li>
            <li>We needed unusual colored lipstick, and this is marketed as such.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this for a 12 year old girl in a home for abused women and children whose name was on a christmas Tree Angel list.  </li>
            <li>The colors definitely change rather nicely to varying shades of pink and red per different color.</li>
            <li>all the colors are the same pale rose tint on my entire family of girls lips.</li>
            <li>Not exactly like I expected, but it is ok.</li>
            <li>It is the least striking of the colors, and therefore I wear bare it to professional things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Purple: More subtle purple-pink&lt;br /&gt;Blue</li>
            <li>Pretty pink shades.</li>
            <li>It turned hot pink upon application!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried only the one colour, (blue or green?), and it turned my lips bright pink, which lasted for HOURS!</li>
            <li>is a really pretty color pink</li>
            <li>have found that detailed product descriptions, and reviews, with a general idea of \\&quot;anticipated\\&quot; colour outcomes were few and far between; so, using my web-cam, I snapped a photo of my mood lipsticks&#x27; colours swiped on the back of my light-skinned hand.  </li>
            <li>The ones I used to have would be too dark unless I blotted my lips right after applying the color.</li>
            <li>The one I use least because it makes my lips look the natural shade of a light complected child&#x27;s lips...</li>
            <li>light pink morphed into a deeper shade of pink than the magenta&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i got this for my daughter to see her have fun with color changing lipstick, but she soon found out that the only color it turns is pink.</li>
            <li>I had to use eye makeup remover 3 different times and rub like heck to get the lipstick off, and then I had to use a green 3M scouring pad and soap to lightly scrub the stain off my arm.</li>
            <li>it is very moisturizing but the colors did not come out as vivid as other mood lipsticks I have used.</li>
            <li>Originally I came to Amazon looking for Fran Wilson MOODmatcher lipstick, and I did find it here for close to 6.00 for 1 Green lipstick - and it only had a rating of 3.5 stars.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a flight attendant and the cabin air is very dry.</li>
            <li>each started off as a very light shade that varied from purple-ish pink to red-ish pink, but over time they all devolved into a darker pigmented rosy pink color.</li>
            <li>The colors last all day and my lips stay soft all day.</li>
            <li>They barely show up.</li>
            <li>No Green or Blue lipstick here...</li>
            <li>All of the lipsticks changed to the same shade of hot pink.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for colorful lipstick please dont waste your money on this item smh.</li>
            <li>Overall good product just a shady a shady seller.</li>
            <li>because I mean come on, it was cheap and the colors are great!&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>Long lasting color and for me the color is always right and it doesn&#x27;t make your lips feel dry like the so called 24 hour lipsticks.</li>
            <li>only thing I&#x27;d have to say is that the color I have now is a bit too pink for me, but I just ordered the whole line</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised, as my expectations were low.</li>
            <li>I used to use Barry M&#x27;s Touch of Magic (still love it), but I noticed it dried my lips out like crazy after long periods of use.  </li>
            <li>soft - color lasts a long time</li>
            <li>really  I think will be different color as we see but it wasnt same pink color all of them ;0</li>
            <li>As you will see the first 3 (green, purple, and blue) are distinctly different.</li>
            <li>The color is very long lasting, and yes, does keep lips soft, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear, like gloss, then changes to pink.  </li>

            <li> I cant wait to see her face when i get her these amazing lipsticks that have been so amazing for her.</li>
            <li> Nice lipsticks.</li>
            <li> You can build up the color, which is nice.</li>
            <li> The aloe vera part is nice;  feels nice when you put it on.  </li>
            <li> It keeps her lips nice and moist and kissable.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is really nice.</li>
            <li> , I love a good deal, I&#x27;ll give it a try.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Liked having two tubes of each color.</li>
            <li> More like lipstain than lipstick, but the color is good and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> great moisturizing for your lips and the color stays on better than most lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I liked it</li>
            <li> They liked the variety included.</li>
            <li> The lighter colors were nice and stayed on for a while.  </li>
            <li> [so I received it VERY quickly], I am loving the feel of this lipstick and</li>
            <li> I really liked them.</li>
            <li> The ladies were thrilled.</li>
            <li> I was kind of hoping there would be some variation of color depending on which lipstick you put on, but that wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> but this product is the absolute best out there!</li>
            <li> Although also can see that they can break off very easily.</li>
            <li> I guess they would be ok if that is your kind of color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even tried making my own concoctions using the most stain-inducing things I know (</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these lipsticks!</li>
            <li> Love it had a tube before and every time I used it my friends wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> Love the color changing factor.</li>
            <li> Fun noveltyipstick, gave all kinds of this away and everyone loved it.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be more hydrating since it was from aloe vera.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a decade and need to order more.  </li>
            <li> However, since the latest flap about lead in lipstick, I have checked the tube....  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d consider them more of a tinted stain.</li>
            <li> These Aloe Vera ones work just as well when I want to take a break and need something more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be more like lip glosses than lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I love these!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love, love LOVE them.</li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> If pinkish hues are in your color wheel you will love these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually quite impressed with the staining ability of both products (Fran Wilson and Princessa).</li>
            <li> so will be able to use them all.  </li>
            <li> These fit the bill!  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll keep 4 and give the rest of them away as gifts :-)</li>
            <li> love them!&lt;br</li>
            <li> the tendency of staying  the color on the lips was quite impressive, which meant  stayed the same color all through the evening when I wore it in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I love these....</li>
            <li> They are more moisturizing that the Fran Wilson MoodMatcher Lipstick</li>
            <li> This is really cute mood lipstick.</li>
            <li> this is more for play or dress up, not for going out unless you&#x27;re going to an 80&#x27;s dance party.</li>
            <li> but I love the ones I have.</li>
            <li> Having been using this product for years because I love it.  </li>
            <li> the lips rather than sitting on top of the lips</li>
            <li> The lady&#x27;s love them.</li>
            <li> I have used this lipstick for many years.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I love my aloe vera lipsticks and yes i recommended and change colors</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick.  </li>
            <li> I love the Aloe Vera Color Change Mood Lipstick.  </li>
            <li> but love the quanity and the shades and the cost</li>
            <li> Make-up was on the top of her Christmas &amp;#34;Santa&amp;#34; wish list.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Longlasting and lovely color</li>
            <li> There are so many of them I can stash them everywhere</li>
            <li> These really are great.</li>
            <li> one is more of a deeper purple shade.</li>
            <li> They do an ok job of lip moisture.</li>
            <li> The best thing about them is they last longer than most lip colors I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the lipstick</li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> This feels more like chapstick or lip balm than lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Mood Lipsticks purchased from Sally&#x27;s that were much better.</li>
            <li> That being said though I still would recommend them as like a party favor gift or some thing :)</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> and she is very excited and pleased about them as well.</li>
            <li> Super cute :) works well!</li>
            <li> Super cute!</li>
            <li> , it gave me a rash on my cheek, when my jerky friend gave me a kiss.(i have sensative skin)oh and the Colors are sililar and pretty bright,so if you don&#x27;t want bright don&#x27;t layer it.</li>
            <li> The price makes it 10x better, and oh lets not forget the quick and punctual delivery!</li>
            <li> I love layering the colors for an even more unique look.</li>
            <li> I love these - they go on smooth - aloe</li>
            <li> FAST DELIVERY PRODUCT NOT AS GOOD AS OTHERS.</li>
            <li> Super cute and goes on super nice as well.</li>
            <li> The colors are light and bright, which would be perfect for a young girl who&#x27;s starting to explore and play with makeup.</li>
            <li> I tried to refrigerate them to harden them but they melted again very quickly after i removed them.</li>
            <li> Easy on the lips.</li>
            <li> And it does come off easily with a dab of napkins or smear with anything that my lips touches.  </li>
            <li> Good and vibrant</li>
            <li> /&gt;they look so pretty and kind of natural&lt;</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend, they are at a cheap price and have a great value.</li>
            <li> fun but not practical - great for young girls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;they have a smooth feel</li>
            <li> cannot believe how cheap these were.</li>
            <li> I tried on my lipstick and it was smooth, creamy and it stays on through the night ....</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on smooth and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thoroughly enjoy them</li>
            <li> The plastic tubes are cheap, but they do work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So cheap, how couldn&#x27;t I?</li>
            <li> It was cheap, but now I know why.</li>
            <li> Amazing, very lubricating and arrived as promised.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> (they would make great little presents for kids AND adults), and a STEAL for 12 really fun lipsticks for under $7!!!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure one will be the right shade.</li>
            <li> The color stays on very well, when the glossiness fades away the color stays!!!</li>
            <li> I was soo excited my item came in 24hrs</li>
            <li> The stain is more light than bright, and lasts longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> These would be fun for girls of every age to try!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m actually going to buy more so that I have extras to gift to my loved ones, put around the house, my car, my purse and maybe even give to my 4-year-old daughter for fun...</li>
            <li> more pigmented than I thought, still very wearable colors!</li>
            <li> my lips were bright pink.my favorite are the light purple orange and dark purple.unfortunately</li>
            <li> They may not stay bright all day, but you still have color after lunch well into the afternoon, and if you are like me, I only put on lipstick maybe twice a day</li>
            <li> This product is not only color changing (depending on your body temp) but the Aloe is good for your lips.</li>
            <li> Good Price but the only con was it was a 12pc ...</li>
            <li> These lipsticks are insanely cool.</li>
            <li> Good product, but only received 6pcs and not as pictured here.</li>
            <li> They feel really moist on your skin, and don&#x27;t cake like most lipsticks</li>
            <li> I still think these were fun and totally worth $7 for 12 lipsticks!</li>
            <li> It last for many many hours.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> They are all very soft and leave your lips feeling very smooth.</li>
            <li> cases are simple plastic casings but the flowers on the tube are very cute.</li>
            <li> They are good in the fact that they moisturize and stain my lips for a long time.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> They last many years!</li>
            <li> in all, for less than $7 and free shipping, this is still a good value and is a novelty.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is so very moist and smooth.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product if you want bright pink lipstick.</li>
            <li> bright pink.</li>
            <li> I like these for light use and moisturizing, for daytime around the house, when I don&#x27;t wear much makeup.</li>
            <li> It is amazing at the various shades we are finding.</li>
            <li> Nice for a present or to keep it for you.</li>
            <li> so I have to put a top layer of Baby Soft Lips over it</li>
            <li> A lot of fun to play around with.</li>
            <li> I bought these just for fun to give to my sisters, and laugh about guessing the &amp;#34;mood&amp;#34; we were in based on the lipstick.</li>
            <li> When they came a day early :)) i put one on and looked it looked flea,so i was mad.but</li>
            <li> My mom and her friends laugh at me because they had &amp;#34;Mood Lipsticks&amp;#34; when they were my age</li>
            <li> /&gt;Green: AWW YAS.</li>
            <li> The colors and tube design are fun.</li>
            <li> I find this lipstick fun</li>
            <li> They are good if I wear one and then apply a real lipstick over it so if my actual lipstick fades, my lips will be stained from this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think Fran Wilson&#x27;s brand would be any different to be honest.  </li>
            <li> Fun to have mystery colors</li>
            <li> It wasnt worth my money at all</li>
            <li> I thought this lipstick will come in it&#x27;s own individual color.</li>
            <li> Not heavy or sticky; fragrance free and taste free.</li>
            <li> The blue and purple tubes have a somewhat purplish/blue tint that might come in handy for Halloween, or if you are going for a bruised-lip look.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item thinking i was colorful lipstick and its not.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re just fun colors of chapsticks that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> this review was helpful!be even give to my 4-year-old daughter for fun...</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Could not say enough nice things about the product.</li>
            <li> I love the formula, the smell, and the texture, but as far as color changing no.</li>
            <li> They are really fun.</li>
            <li> I just love pink lipstick and these are just so much fun!!</li>
            <li> :0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magenta ...[sigh] bright pink!</li>
            <li> I am a lover of mood lip stick because you don&#x27;t have to search for the right shade its always right.</li>
            <li> and then it disappears right away.  </li>
            <li> so the mood lipstick is the right color all the time for you.</li>
            <li> If you do not look good in hot pink lipstick then this is not the right product for you.</li>
            <li> was thrilled about it, but what I was even more thrilled about (and the reason for such a good review) is that I have literally spent years and an obscene amount of money looking for a lip color that would last as long as this stuff does.</li>
            <li> They give off beautiful, rosy pink colors and moisturize better than my other lipsticks/lipbalms.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing as well as fun with pretty flowery lipstick cases!</li>
            <li> Better be sure you get a color applied correctly or you&#x27;ll have trouble removing the color.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this lipstick to anyone, it is more than worth the money.</li>
            <li> :) It&#x27;s a great deal for the price even though the lipsticks are a little dry and not as moist as I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> Just like 30 years ago, the real mc coy!</li>
            <li> I would love to know of one that actually stayed on.  </li>
            <li> Colors mostly the same.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You might be interested to know that these are lip staining lipsticks ...</li>
            <li> They were of equal strength in their staining ability (i.e., one did not stain any better than the other).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So glad I did because this feels like a lip balm with enhanced lasting color.  </li>
            <li> Mostly, the colors all turn out to be almost the same color</li>
            <li> Its exactly as I pictured it</li>
            <li> , I dont recommend this product I wish I can get my money back or get better lipsticks</li>
            <li> The others vary from pretty pinks to corals.</li>
            <li> I ended up tossing 4 because of this, and tossed 4 more because of the blue color of the lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and moist, but I actually gave most of them to my young niece.</li>
            <li> My first experiment with a mood lipstick was in 1980-something ...</li>
            <li> (1) It seemed a bit more sheer in coverage.</li>
            <li> - I used (sandalwood) soap and water (as hot as I could stand it), then scrubbed with fingers and fingernails until it all came off.</li>
            <li> - I used (sandalwood) soap and water (as hot as I could stand it), then scrubbed with fingers and fingernails until it all came off.</li>
            <li> they last for a long time on your lips feel great</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick, it stays on better than the expensive brands, I was just glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Also cause i though it was going to be almost exactly the color of the lipstick until i read the details which was my fault</li>
            <li> It stays forever first</li>
            <li> most of the colors were the same.  </li>
            <li> This lipstick works with your body chemistry and on me turns a nice shade of pink.  </li>
            <li> Thia 12 pc set is great and will last me a long time</li>
            <li> one of them on me is a really pretty shade of coral like persimmon color</li>
            <li> pretty color</li>
            <li> Fast postage to Oz!</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was a bust.</li>
            <li> I should have stuck with the original, [[ASIN:B001LR3NSC MOODmatcher Lipstick]], which has vibrant colors and real staying power, and not cheaped out on these.</li>
            <li> A person with more yellow pigment or someone who tans easily may have a totally different experience.</li>
            <li> I wear different colors on different days according to my mood which is almost always good.  </li>
            <li> The blue one is a darker purple - pink on me, pretty bright but fun.</li>
            <li> well first off most of the lipsticks are pink</li>
            <li> Fairly moisturizing and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Also color changes are more subtle in some and more vibrant in others.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it seems that no matter what color you put on, it all turns into bright pink.</li>
            <li> The real \\&quot;mood\\&quot; lipstain.  </li>
            <li> All the colors end up being a shade of pink or pinkish purple :)</li>
            <li> and they really do stain</li>
            <li> I really like every color.  </li>
            <li> i got it fast in the mail.</li>
            <li> Lipsticks very waxy.</li>
            <li> so well I bought a pack for my  mom who really loves it.</li>
            <li> There are some really &amp;#34;offensively pink&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I hope this may help some of the fairer-skinned ladies make a reasonably informed choice of whether these lipsticks will \\&quot;work\\&quot; for you, or not. :</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t (yet) rate their moisturizing qualities, (if any), since I have not yet really worn them on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t (yet) rate their moisturizing qualities, (if any), since I have not yet really worn them on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it really conditions on it</li>
            <li> I really like them</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really listen to anyone about color,</li>
            <li> yes they are mostly shades of pink,</li>
            <li> colors that show up are a light red color.</li>
            <li> but on the other hand the color is ok</li>
            <li> pure food coloring, highly concentrated kool aid mix, etc.)</li>
            <li> Such a great pink color!!!!</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s ok its very pink</li>
            <li> I really like how I get an extra lipstick for each color, that is cool.</li>
            <li> They are all some variation of pink red and purple, no real diversity,and they dont change colors, as far as i can see, but they are great quality for the price and quantity, and the colors are really cool to see which one is which</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s purple and a hot ping but makes my lips soft</li>
            <li> ALSO, it is true that there is relatively NO difference in the colors as they show up after application--</li>
            <li> Would&#x27;ve liked blues and purples too, but after reading the other reviews, it looks like most people expected the same thing.</li>
            <li> blue became a bluish hot-pink which was a little too bright for my taste -</li>
            <li> I might use this as lip gloss under my lipstick, I&#x27;m not really into bright pink.</li>
            <li> Since there were so many, I split half of them with a friend</li>
            <li> It more or less dyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never left such a nonsensical review before, that&#x27;s how much I love</li>
            <li> They are soft and moist but too many pink colors.</li>
            <li> Well, since I was only doing a quick colour test on my hand, I used hand moisturizer before swiping them.  </li>
            <li> Well, since I was only doing a quick colour test on my hand, I used hand moisturizer before swiping them.  </li>
            <li> The color of the lipstick was not as vibrant as it was described to be.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> yet so they are decently sturdy but I wouldn&#x27;t stress test them.</li>
            <li> The price was super low</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> The colors are very pretty, going from a sheer pale pink to very a very bright hot pink.</li>
            <li> I can say, however, the pink I&#x27;m strutting is bright and really does seem to go with MY skin tone, more than any other straight pink-colored lipstick I&#x27;ve tried before...</li>
            <li> Your lips look really natural as if it is the real color of your lips.  </li>
            <li> they are just normal, i use them just for have my lips moisturized.</li>
            <li> (IT&#x27;S JUST LIKE THE  GREEN MOOD LIPSTICK OF THE 70&#x27;s just more shades to choose from)</li>
            <li> Overall these lipsticks were so fun</li>
            <li> Once caution though, pretty much all the lipsticks end up being some variant of hot pink.</li>
            <li> No matter what color  you apply, the result is basically the same light hot pink.</li>
            <li> and i can&#x27;t live without it...</li>
            <li> I was also expecting more of a range on the colors, it&#x27;s always the same pink on me.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re drying lipsticks that come in the most hideous shades of pink, red, and purple imaginable.</li>
            <li> i will by more.be aware the colour last forever</li>
            <li> but I would have liked a red orange another color besides ONLY pink</li>
            <li> probably the color I first tried back in the &#x27;80s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish it changed many other colors besides only shades</li>
            <li> You can really have fun with them because every one is a different color on different people, they even change on me depending on weather.</li>
            <li> It kind of made my lips a little dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, much better than any lipstick as regular lipstick wears off only has that color, but mood liptick lasts all day long and is activated by your body temperature</li>
            <li> The light pink turned a dark pink (most unflattering).  </li>
            <li> They are silky, and smooth, and they stay for such a long time!!  </li>
            <li> doest change colour(( Blue one looks like dead person((( others are just great, very long lasting lipsticks and soften lips, aloe vera works!!!</li>
            <li> I love mood lipstick and its hard to find.</li>
            <li> It definitely does not come off as easy as other lipsticks, and you won&#x27;t leave stains on mugs, cheeks, etc.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;ve only had them for 3 months, I&#x27;m hard pressed to believe I&#x27;ll stop loving these when I&#x27;m no longer 20.</li>
            <li> back it turned light pink</li>
            <li> i really like this lip sticks i put on the blue</li>
            <li> So do you know or can you direct me to where I can find the information?</li>
            <li> What does my natural lip color even look like?</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Party favors for 12 year old birthday party.</li>
            <li> All of them are &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; colors and not as natural as I had hoped</li>
            <li> it is sattin then completely matte</li>
            <li> Leaves your lips feeling soft.  </li>
            <li> We needed unusual colored lipstick, and this is marketed as such.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for a 12 year old girl in a home for abused women and children whose name was on a christmas Tree Angel list.  </li>
            <li> The colors definitely change rather nicely to varying shades of pink and red per different color.</li>
            <li> all the colors are the same pale rose tint on my entire family of girls lips.</li>
            <li> Not exactly like I expected, but it is ok.</li>
            <li> It is the least striking of the colors, and therefore I wear bare it to professional things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Purple: More subtle purple-pink&lt;br /&gt;Blue</li>
            <li> Pretty pink shades.</li>
            <li> It turned hot pink upon application!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried only the one colour, (blue or green?), and it turned my lips bright pink, which lasted for HOURS!</li>
            <li> is a really pretty color pink</li>
            <li> have found that detailed product descriptions, and reviews, with a general idea of \\&quot;anticipated\\&quot; colour outcomes were few and far between; so, using my web-cam, I snapped a photo of my mood lipsticks&#x27; colours swiped on the back of my light-skinned hand.  </li>
            <li> The ones I used to have would be too dark unless I blotted my lips right after applying the color.</li>
            <li> The one I use least because it makes my lips look the natural shade of a light complected child&#x27;s lips...</li>
            <li> light pink morphed into a deeper shade of pink than the magenta&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i got this for my daughter to see her have fun with color changing lipstick, but she soon found out that the only color it turns is pink.</li>
            <li> I had to use eye makeup remover 3 different times and rub like heck to get the lipstick off, and then I had to use a green 3M scouring pad and soap to lightly scrub the stain off my arm.</li>
            <li> it is very moisturizing but the colors did not come out as vivid as other mood lipsticks I have used.</li>
            <li> Originally I came to Amazon looking for Fran Wilson MOODmatcher lipstick, and I did find it here for close to 6.00 for 1 Green lipstick - and it only had a rating of 3.5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a flight attendant and the cabin air is very dry.</li>
            <li> each started off as a very light shade that varied from purple-ish pink to red-ish pink, but over time they all devolved into a darker pigmented rosy pink color.</li>
            <li> The colors last all day and my lips stay soft all day.</li>
            <li> They barely show up.</li>
            <li> No Green or Blue lipstick here...</li>
            <li> All of the lipsticks changed to the same shade of hot pink.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for colorful lipstick please dont waste your money on this item smh.</li>
            <li> Overall good product just a shady a shady seller.</li>
            <li> because I mean come on, it was cheap and the colors are great!&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> Long lasting color and for me the color is always right and it doesn&#x27;t make your lips feel dry like the so called 24 hour lipsticks.</li>
            <li> only thing I&#x27;d have to say is that the color I have now is a bit too pink for me, but I just ordered the whole line</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised, as my expectations were low.</li>
            <li> I used to use Barry M&#x27;s Touch of Magic (still love it), but I noticed it dried my lips out like crazy after long periods of use.  </li>
            <li> soft - color lasts a long time</li>
            <li> really  I think will be different color as we see but it wasnt same pink color all of them ;0</li>
            <li> As you will see the first 3 (green, purple, and blue) are distinctly different.</li>
            <li> The color is very long lasting, and yes, does keep lips soft, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear, like gloss, then changes to pink.  </li>
            <li> I know people who have reviewed this product say that all of them are the same shade of ugly pink, but they are all different shapes of red, and since they adjust to your ph all the sades look good on you.</li>
            <li> they last long time , the color will last for hours, defenitly will buy again</li>
            <li> they were too fragile not to use them long enough.</li>
            <li> green turned into a rather pretty, rosy pink - I think I could handle that once in a while.</li>
            <li> However, the color lasts a while and it doesn&#x27;t have the usual icky lipstick feel that most lipsticks  have.</li>
            <li> If it s too pink for a particular outfit, I mix it w other lil tints.  </li>
            <li> I often use it under strong red lipsticks when I want to make the red less extreme&lt;br /&gt;Orange: The least pink of all, this one is coral (?)</li>
            <li> I have only worn these twice, and my lips are softer than they have been in a long time.</li>
            <li> i but this always for my mom its all she will use it last long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe</li>
            <li> Finally, a lipstick that lasts a long time on your lips.  </li>
            <li> long lasting , colors lips all day and tint till morning use it under my lipstick.</li>
            <li> but just doesn&#x27;t last as long as said.</li>
            <li> All the colors are basically the same and don&#x27;t wear for long.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wear them under lipsticks that don&#x27;t last very long and didn&#x27;t want to pay $20 for six Fran Wilson ones.  </li>
            <li> Very long lasting.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my lips moisturized and is very long lasting!</li>
            <li> However, the last 3 (pink, orange, and yellow), are almost identical.</li>
            <li> The blue and purple turned bluish pink, with the purple darker than the blue.  </li>
            <li> While some mood lipsticks are only pink, these are different for each color.</li>
            <li> The colors are really not that different, FOR ME, but that may be totally different for another buyer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The colors all produce a different shade of pink with some of the colors producing a red tone.  </li>
            <li> have very PINK skin as I am a natural strawberry blonde, so I&#x27;m no surprised my shades are all pink.</li>
            <li> The lipstick part had come loose in several tubes and was stuck to the cap.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these babies at a little store by my house thinking it was clear aloe vera lip gloss.</li>
            <li> They are all same color pink.</li>
            <li> I had some others for years and the color would hold/ stay on for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The lipsticks only color is pink, the same shade of pink for me.</li>
            <li> but they compliment my makeup all day long, haters.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only wear it when I want to punch people in the face with pink, which is a lot of the time&lt;br</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t stay on as long.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the colors  going from pink to orange and red.</li>
            <li> The only correctly colored lipstick is the pink.</li>
            <li> all of them are the same shade of pink</li>
            <li> People are always amazed at how long my lipstick stays on.</li>
            <li> but it takes a long time to where off and lots of effort to get off</li>
            <li> In the first picture below, you will see that I have compared Fran Wilson green, with the Princessa green.</li>
            <li> are a shade of pink and they are long lasting.  </li>
            <li> Three of the six love aloe vera color change mood lipstick were broken when they were delivered in my mail box (the pink, purple and green one).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though I see reviews complaining the colours are similar, I see an extreme difference on my lips</li>
            <li> they did not last as other mood lipsticks that i had.</li>
            <li> Save your money unless you want to look like an 80&#x27;s punk singer with dry, cracked lips.</li>
            <li> This Lipstick takes me back to the late 80&#x27;s &amp; early 90&#x27;s .</li>
            <li> Pink was not really my thing back then ...</li>
            <li> and you only have to apply it a few times during the entire day.</li>
            <li> I have dry lips year round and have exhausted all the available chap sticks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also a heavy tea and coffee drinker and this stuff barely leaves a trace on my  mugs!</li>
            <li> was so low hard to believe I would get the quanity and quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li> Do know these are a lip-stain and not a normal lipstick...</li>
            <li> , the yellow looks pink, the purple looks pink, and the orange looks pink.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They haven&#x27;t dried my lips out all day that I&#x27;ve been wearing it unlike some other more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Will last longer that typical lipstick because it is a pigment rather than a color.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t use the dark colors yet, only the pink one.</li>
            <li> the orange lipstick was a little different than the others ...</li>
            <li> I have tried other mood lipsticks for their staying power but they all made my lips so dry.  </li>
            <li> Dark color (ex.purple) give you a dark red hue while the lighter colors (ex.pink) will give you a lighter hue.</li>
            <li> There is always at least one of these lipsticks on my person,and even if I am having a no-makeup day, I still use one for the moisturizing action alone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Light Pink:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purple: Baby pink.</li>
            <li> Plus it turns that color when it gets wet.</li>
            <li> It stays pink for hours.</li>
            <li> They all resemble a shade of purple, or pink.</li>
            <li> I like pink shades of lipstick and everyone of these lipsticks</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> the colors vary in pink tones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They  were  not the ones that I expected.</li>
            <li> When I found this rainbow package (as opposed to only the green option) I HAD to try it-</li>
            <li> Instead I get pink in all of the lipsticks. &#x3D;</li>
            <li> All changed to a pink color.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with these they barely show</li>
            <li> They hydrate your lips with aloe vera and as you apply them, each leaves a varying stain of pink on the lips.</li>
            <li> I knew they were all going to end up being pink.</li>
            <li> the pink color is</li>
            <li> my lips they are ALL displaying on my lips as pink.</li>
            <li> - I look at it this way: I just got 12 pink lipsticks for under $7.</li>
            <li> if pink.</li>
            <li> The colors all changed to pink.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Each shade always turns to a pink on me.  </li>
            <li> They are all shades of pink/magenta/orangey pink.</li>
            <li> Was so curious I had to try a couple out</li>
            <li> The green looks pink, the blue looks purple</li>
            <li> They actually give very little color at all</li>
            <li> It changed on each person due to their body chemistry</li>
            <li> so I got to have the other 6 to myself.</li>
            <li> I will go to shop for other colors at SALLY&#x27;S.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I saw all six of these colours on sale for about $6, (NOT on Amazon), and thought I would give the other colours the benefit of the doubt for that price.  </li>
            <li> Besides, I like to wear something a bit different, (from my usual neutral/natural lipstick colours), once in a while.</li>
            <li> dark purple turned into a purplish, pink - not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, if varying shades of pink cheer you up, these \\&quot;mood-y pinks\\&quot; might be just the pick-me-up for you! :0)ometimes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, if varying shades of pink cheer you up, these \\&quot;mood-y pinks\\&quot; might be just the pick-me-up for you! :0)</li>
            <li> and I woke up with pink lips!</li>
            <li> i sometimes put it on over other lipsticks since they are not as moist.</li>
            <li> Will not order this again because every single one when I put on is pink!!!</li>
            <li> It is certainly an acceptable alternative to expensive lip color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toad</li>
            <li> : I feel this is the in-between of the purple and dark purple shade.</li>
            <li> My favorites are the pink, purple, and green sticks.  </li>
            <li> I even like them because I can apply them as a base and then put another color on top</li>
            <li> They were  so soft that turned out broken one by one whenever I tried to wear on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;However,</li>
            <li> Only drawback is they are made in China, but I do like them and they are way less expensive than regular lipstick.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no mood for this lipstick, it&#x27;s not a good item to purchase if you want all the actually colors for the lipstick like myself.</li>
            <li> My little one had a blast guessing what color her lips may turn.</li>
            <li> My mom has been using this ever since i was a little girl i thought she was bonkers for using this but</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this lipstick has not been &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; as some reviews from 2013 say, so I wonder if the product has been updated since then or there was a bad batch at some point, because these definitely feel soft on my lips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She had been using a green colored one, which was almost gone.  </li>
            <li> wear these colors everyday.</li>
            <li> Repeat: EVERYDAY.</li>
            <li> I wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> Then I noticed the 12 pack of mood changing aloe lipsticks from Princessa and noticed that it included 2 green lipsticks and the cost was 6.00 and change for all 12, and it had a 4 star rating,  so</li>
            <li> waste of my money</li>
            <li> I do not want to waste my time returning them to Amazon.</li>
            <li> had read that, because the colours are long-lasting, sometimes they are difficult to remove (completely).  </li>
            <li> they are difficult to remove (completely).  </li>
            <li> They are all in green tubes.</li>
            <li> and it was a waste of their money</li>
            <li> This was a waste of my money if I could I would rate this product a zero.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like we did.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been rolling around in my purse and hasn&#x27;t fallen open or broken</li>
            <li> But after a few seconds the color started to show up and got darker</li>
            <li> till one day her favorite store discontinued BUT ALAS!!!!</li>
            <li> There is very little noticable difference between colors.</li>
            <li> It can be used as a lipliner under lipstick, but usually just this and lip gloss is all I wear.</li>
            <li> Bought these thinking they were like the mood lipsticks of the past.</li>
            <li> I mean, how is that a waste of money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> saw other reviewers say they were mad because they all came out pink</li>
            <li> Hardly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;the reason for the 4 is cuz a few of them were broken (not for gifts)</li>
            <li> I mean anything.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I am disappointed that every shade turns pink, although they vary in intensity.  </li>
            <li> The Colorado last longer than anything else ive used and it doesn&#x27;t do all the nasty things like get crusty or dry your lips out.</li>
            <li> I am a lipstick fanatic!  </li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed with this product because all the lipsticks look the same on me...</li>
            <li> Duh!</li>
            <li> All the lipstick are the same color :(</li>
            <li> I am a but disappointed that they all end up being the same color.</li>
            <li> Each stick showed up an ugly pink.</li>
            <li> Two of of them came broken</li>
            <li> all of them were broken after trials on each time.</li>
            <li> I tired every color on my arm-</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality is rather poor, though.</li>
            <li> Product was broken up upon arrival</li>
            <li> am a little disappointed with my order.&lt;br /&gt;Mary</li>
            <li> This was an experiment and it failed.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this lipstick.</li>
            <li> the color is ugly and they are easily broken.</li>
            <li> Waste of money very disappointed.</li>
            <li> - my daughter thought her dad was crazy when she saw the colors until she used them</li>
            <li> This lipstick isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> this stains your lips really bad</li>
            <li> The bad news?</li>
            <li> I always put on a color, though sometimes it is beneath a lipstick or lipgloss and is being used as a base to alter the end result color of my lip makeup.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this for my mother-in-law who is 94.  She had been using a green colored one, which was almost gone.  Being there are 12, I gave her a couple, I kept a couple, and I have been giving others to friends.</li>
            <li> Love it had a tube before and every time I used it my friends wanted to try it. It changed on each person due to their body chemistry it&#x27;s amazing and the color stays on for hours. Great product.</li>
            <li> They are all same color pink.</li>
            <li> Nice lipsticks. Love the color changing factor. I definitely would recommended. Also color changes are more subtle in some and more vibrant in others. Dark color (ex.purple) give you a dark red hue while the lighter colors (ex.pink) will give you a lighter hue. Will last longer that typical lipstick because it is a pigment rather than a color. Nice for a present or to keep it for you. Your choice.</li>
            <li> Great mood lipstick,  great price.  Fun noveltyipstick, gave all kinds of this away and everyone loved it.</li>
            <li> This lipstick isn&#x27;t bad. I was expecting it to be more hydrating since it was from aloe vera. It kind of made my lips a little dry so I have to put a top layer of Baby Soft Lips over it (that stuff is awesome). I was also expecting more of a range on the colors, it&#x27;s always the same pink on me. However, the color lasts a while and it doesn&#x27;t have the usual icky lipstick feel that most lipsticks  have. Overall I like it considering it is so inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This is the only lipstick I use!!</li>
            <li> A lot of fun to play around with. There is very little noticable difference between colors. There were like a glossy lip stain that when the glossiness wore off the color remained through several mealtimes.</li>
            <li> The real \\&quot;mood\\&quot; lipstain.  Can&#x27;t buy it anywhere but online, so this is it!!  Just like 30 years ago, the real mc coy!</li>
            <li> i really like this lip sticks i put on the blue it went to a blue color it depends on how your mood is boy oh boy love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Super cute and goes on super nice as well. Leaves my lips feeling refreshed. The price makes it 10x better, and oh lets not forget the quick and punctual delivery!</li>
            <li> I love it I bouts hy it a while back it turned light pink but now it&#x27;s purple and a hot ping but makes my lips soft</li>
            <li> the colors are great but the lipstick themselves melted and broke after using them once or twice. I tried to refrigerate them to harden them but they melted again very quickly after i removed them.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a decade and need to order more.  However, since the latest flap about lead in lipstick, I have checked the tube....  Ooooops.... made in CHINA.  So do you know or can you direct me to where I can find the information?</li>
            <li> These are great novelty lipsticks! I&#x27;d consider them more of a tinted stain. You can build up the color, which is nice. I bought these just for fun to give to my sisters, and laugh about guessing the &amp;#34;mood&amp;#34; we were in based on the lipstick. The colors are light and bright, which would be perfect for a young girl who&#x27;s starting to explore and play with makeup. I know my 12-year-old self would think these were the coolest lipsticks ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color will last all day, but my lips tend to chap when I wear these lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Love these! My favorites are the pink, purple, and green sticks.  They give off beautiful, rosy pink colors and moisturize better than my other lipsticks/lipbalms.  I used to use Barry M&#x27;s Touch of Magic (still love it), but I noticed it dried my lips out like crazy after long periods of use.  These Aloe Vera ones work just as well when I want to take a break and need something more moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Love it, love it!!!</li>
            <li> These are amazing! The colors are very pretty, going from a sheer pale pink to very a very bright hot pink. Since there were so many, I split half of them with a friend and she is very excited and pleased about them as well. I have dry lips year round and have exhausted all the available chap sticks. I have only worn these twice, and my lips are softer than they have been in a long time. I definitely recommend, they are at a cheap price and have a great value.</li>
            <li> I thought these would be more like lip glosses than lipsticks. They&#x27;re drying lipsticks that come in the most hideous shades of pink, red, and purple imaginable. Save your money unless you want to look like an 80&#x27;s punk singer with dry, cracked lips.</li>
            <li> Although generous at 12 pieces, I wouldn&#x27;t get these again because the COLOR DOES NOT HOLD.  I had some others for years and the color would hold/ stay on for a long time.  The aloe vera part is nice;  feels nice when you put it on.  I gave it a 2 star because I thought the MOOD lipstick was designed to be long-wearing.  ALSO, it is true that there is relatively NO difference in the colors as they show up after application--all pink-ish.  I would love to know of one that actually stayed on.  I guess I will go to a drugstore where I could return it.</li>
            <li> The lipsticks only color is pink, the same shade of pink for me. There&#x27;s no mood for this lipstick, it&#x27;s not a good item to purchase if you want all the actually colors for the lipstick like myself.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love them!!! The darker the tube (like the purple and blue) the darker your lips will be....and the color stays on for hours!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these!!!</li>
            <li> I love these!&lt;br /&gt;i will definitely buy them again!&lt;br /&gt;they look so pretty and kind of natural&lt;br /&gt;they have a smooth feel&lt;br /&gt;the reason for the 4 is cuz a few of them were broken (not for gifts)</li>
            <li> Super cute! All the colors end up being a shade of pink or pinkish purple :)</li>
            <li> The lipstick shocked me, but in a good way.I read sweatleafs review and bought them.When they came a day early :)) i put one on and looked it looked flea,so i was mad.but i came back and my lips were bright pink.my favorite are the light purple orange and dark purple.unfortunately my dog ate two of may favorite.so when i can affford to,i will by more.be aware the colour last forever so don&#x27;t put it anywhere else but your lips, it gave me a rash on my cheek, when my jerky friend gave me a kiss.(i have sensative skin)oh and the Colors are sililar and pretty bright,so if you don&#x27;t want bright don&#x27;t layer it.The Colorado last longer than anything else ive used and it doesn&#x27;t do all the nasty things like get crusty or dry your lips out.Its great i definately recamend it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I have always been a fan of mood lipstick. Thank you for taking out the guess work over trying find which color lipstick matches which outfit. They all do!</li>
            <li> I read a bunch of reviews about these lipsticks before buying but I was still unsure what to expect...but these are GREAT! I love, love LOVE them. I&#x27;ve never left such a nonsensical review before, that&#x27;s how much I love them.&lt;br /&gt;I wear these colors everyday. Repeat: EVERYDAY. I always put on a color, though sometimes it is beneath a lipstick or lipgloss and is being used as a base to alter the end result color of my lip makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Man oh man do these colors LAST. There is always at least one of these lipsticks on my person,and even if I am having a no-makeup day, I still use one for the moisturizing action alone. What does my natural lip color even look like? I don&#x27;t know anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe how cheap these were. My mom and her friends laugh at me because they had &amp;#34;Mood Lipsticks&amp;#34; when they were my age but they compliment my makeup all day long, haters.&lt;br /&gt;Though I see reviews complaining the colours are similar, I see an extreme difference on my lips and so I will categorize them here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light Pink: The Pinkest of pinks. I only wear it when I want to punch people in the face with pink, which is a lot of the time&lt;br /&gt;Purple: Baby pink. The one I use least because it makes my lips look the natural shade of a light complected child&#x27;s lips...maybe good for doll makeup&lt;br /&gt;Dark Purple: More subtle purple-pink&lt;br /&gt;Blue: I feel this is the in-between of the purple and dark purple shade. I often use it under strong red lipsticks when I want to make the red less extreme&lt;br /&gt;Orange: The least pink of all, this one is coral (?) coloured because it keeps orange undertones.&lt;br /&gt;Green: AWW YAS. My favorite. It is the least striking of the colors, and therefore I wear bare it to professional things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short: Wow. These are great. I don&#x27;t know why something so great went out of style. Though I&#x27;ve only had them for 3 months, I&#x27;m hard pressed to believe I&#x27;ll stop loving these when I&#x27;m no longer 20. Buy them!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> i got this for my daughter to see her have fun with color changing lipstick, but she soon found out that the only color it turns is pink.Plus it turns that color when it gets wet.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my finance and she apsolutely loves it! It keeps her lips nice and moist and kissable. Will be telling her girlfriends about these.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is so very moist and smooth. I wear it everyday. The colors and tube design are fun. I sent a couple of tubes to friends as a gift!</li>
            <li> this stains your lips really bad and I will not recommend this but on the other hand the color is ok</li>
            <li> I bought the big package as I use several different colors.  Then I have plenty left over for grandchildren.  Easy on the lips.</li>
            <li> I wish they included the color red.</li>
            <li> It does stay on.  If it s too pink for a particular outfit, I mix it w other lil tints.  I love it.  The price factor is perfect!</li>
            <li> Super cute :) works well!</li>
            <li> This lipstick is really nice.I thought that it will change colors but it doesn&#x27;t. It stays pink for hours.I recommend this product if you want bright pink lipstick.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT!! FAST DELIVERY PRODUCT NOT AS GOOD AS OTHERS.</li>
            <li> Not exactly like I expected, but it is ok. Colors mostly the same.</li>
            <li> it arrives on time. and receive the product as it is! good job guys! keep up the good work!! i recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> well first off most of the lipsticks are pink they do stay though all day but I would have liked a red orange another color besides ONLY pink that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m Rating  it a three star...</li>
            <li> Originally I came to Amazon looking for Fran Wilson MOODmatcher lipstick, and I did find it here for close to 6.00 for 1 Green lipstick - and it only had a rating of 3.5 stars. Then I noticed the 12 pack of mood changing aloe lipsticks from Princessa and noticed that it included 2 green lipsticks and the cost was 6.00 and change for all 12, and it had a 4 star rating,  so I thought &#x27;what the heck, I love a good deal, I&#x27;ll give it a try.&#x27; Well this is what I have discovered ... In the first picture below, you will see that I have compared Fran Wilson green, with the Princessa green. My personal preference (for my skin tone), is the Fran Wilson. In the next picture you will see that I applied all 6 colors to my arm. I did about 10 strokes of each color and I left them on my arm for about 10 minutes before taking the picture. As you will see the first 3 (green, purple, and blue) are distinctly different. However, the last 3 (pink, orange, and yellow), are almost identical. If pinkish hues are in your color wheel you will love these. I even like them because I can apply them as a base and then put another color on top and it will change the look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might be interested to know that these are lip staining lipsticks ... and they really do stain/last. I had to use eye makeup remover 3 different times and rub like heck to get the lipstick off, and then I had to use a green 3M scouring pad and soap to lightly scrub the stain off my arm. I&#x27;m actually quite impressed with the staining ability of both products (Fran Wilson and Princessa). They were of equal strength in their staining ability (i.e., one did not stain any better than the other).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusion: this is a very good product. It feels nice on the lips, has not taste or anything, and it is surely a great price. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> they are just normal, i use them just for have my lips moisturized.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s ok its very pink, I didn&#x27;t use the dark colors yet, only the pink one. I guess I&#x27;m gonna give it to my daughter.</li>
            <li> This product is not only color changing (depending on your body temp) but the Aloe is good for your lips. Long lasting color and for me the color is always right and it doesn&#x27;t make your lips feel dry like the so called 24 hour lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Awesome lipstick!!!!! Sooooo in luv with all of em!!!!!</li>
            <li> i got this as a Christmas gift request. the colors all look similar to one another. They all resemble a shade of purple, or pink. It applies with a moisture. Doesn&#x27;t crack or peel later in the day.</li>
            <li> Color stays all day. Pretty pink shades. It can be used as a lipliner under lipstick, but usually just this and lip gloss is all I wear. (IT&#x27;S JUST LIKE THE  GREEN MOOD LIPSTICK OF THE 70&#x27;s just more shades to choose from)</li>
            <li> I have tried other mood lipsticks for their staying power but they all made my lips so dry.  Having Aloe Vera as an ingredient convinced mw to give this a try.  So glad I did because this feels like a lip balm with enhanced lasting color.  Mostly, the colors all turn out to be almost the same color so will be able to use them all.  Liked having two tubes of each color.</li>
            <li> I am a lipstick fanatic!  These fit the bill!  I love all 12 of the tubes and am very happy that I get 6 colors, 2 of each!  Have yet to try all of them.  Very Happy! Very satisfied!  Feels good on my lips!  Makes my lips feel moisturized!  You&#x27;ll like these I hope too!</li>
            <li> I really like every color.  I like pink shades of lipstick and everyone of these lipsticks are a shade of pink and they are long lasting.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I like these as they stay on the  lips longer. I bought 2 sets and I gave some to friends</li>
            <li> Its exactly as I pictured it</li>
            <li> I find this lipstick fun</li>
            <li> This Lipstick takes me back to the late 80&#x27;s &amp; early 90&#x27;s . I was soo excited my item came in 24hrs and when I recieved the packaged I was like a kid on Christmas Day !!!! I tried on my lipstick and it was smooth, creamy and it stays on through the night .... Perfect !!!! Good Price but the only con was it was a 12pc ... I guess I&#x27;ll keep 4 and give the rest of them away as gifts :-)</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> they last long time , the color will last for hours, defenitly will buy again i got it fast in the mail. than you .</li>
            <li> Does not reach even this request to my house.</li>
            <li> Its mood change lipstick...fun but not practical - great for young girls.</li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed with this product because all the lipsticks look the same on me... bright pink. They are good in the fact that they moisturize and stain my lips for a long time. They are good if I wear one and then apply a real lipstick over it so if my actual lipstick fades, my lips will be stained from this product.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I am disappointed that every shade turns pink, although they vary in intensity.  The light pink turned a dark pink (most unflattering).  The blue and purple turned bluish pink, with the purple darker than the blue.  I wanted to wear them under lipsticks that don&#x27;t last very long and didn&#x27;t want to pay $20 for six Fran Wilson ones.  I don&#x27;t think Fran Wilson&#x27;s brand would be any different to be honest.  Maybe I will try the brown on the Fran Wilson website but the shipping is so expensive, more than twice what the lipstick costs.  This was an experiment and it failed.  I should have listened to the reviews.  Boo hoo!</li>
            <li> The good news? You get 12 of these so you can share them with your friends. The bad news? They&#x27;re all the same color. No matter what color  you apply, the result is basically the same light hot pink. They don&#x27;t last any longer than colored chapstick. I should have stuck with the original, [[ASIN:B001LR3NSC MOODmatcher Lipstick]], which has vibrant colors and real staying power, and not cheaped out on these.</li>
            <li> Two of of them came broken but that&#x27;s because of the heat here, I think they melted. I&#x27;m not going to blame the company though because I mean come on, it was cheap and the colors are great!&lt;br /&gt;All the colors vary in pink tones.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on smooth and bright.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love them!&lt;br /&gt;(Wearing the purple)</li>
            <li> Party favors for 12 year old birthday party. They were a hit.</li>
            <li> More like lipstain than lipstick, but the color is good and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> They  were  not the ones that I expected. They were  so soft that turned out broken one by one whenever I tried to wear on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;However, the tendency of staying  the color on the lips was quite impressive, which meant  stayed the same color all through the evening when I wore it in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;But they were too fragile not to use them long enough. all of them were broken after trials on each time.</li>
            <li> Will not order this again because every single one when I put on is pink!!! It does not change color No matter what mood you are in. But it does moisture your lips.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly enjoy them</li>
            <li> I love these....great moisturizing for your lips and the color stays on better than most lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I read about these &amp;#34;henna&amp;#34; lipsticks online. When I found this rainbow package (as opposed to only the green option) I HAD to try it- you get 12 lipsticks, two of each color. I bought this for Bachelorette party gift baskets (6) so I got to have the other 6 to myself. I tired every color on my arm- each started off as a very light shade that varied from purple-ish pink to red-ish pink, but over time they all devolved into a darker pigmented rosy pink color. (This is just my experience, I did the same thing to my friend and she has slightly different colors- supposedly they react differently on every individual.) The best part about these lipsicks is that they act sort of as a stain. The color stays on very well, when the glossiness fades away the color stays!!! Overall these lipsticks were so fun (they would make great little presents for kids AND adults), and a STEAL for 12 really fun lipsticks for under $7!!! I will definitely buy these again!</li>
            <li> Fun to have mystery colors - my daughter thought her dad was crazy when she saw the colors until she used them and they showed up differently</li>
            <li> I am a lover of mood lip stick because you don&#x27;t have to search for the right shade its always right.</li>
            <li> It wasnt worth my money at all I received them july 30 and four of the lipsticks were damage,  I had to melt the lipstick  and than freeze, I dont recommend this product I wish I can get my money back or get better lipsticks</li>
            <li> Arrived melted(all of them). Lipsticks very waxy.</li>
            <li> I thought this lipstick will come in it&#x27;s own individual color. Instead I get pink in all of the lipsticks. &#x3D;.&#x3D; waste of my money</li>
            <li> These do not give long-lasting color like the types I have used over the years.  They actually give very little color at all and then it disappears right away.  The ones I used to have would be too dark unless I blotted my lips right after applying the color.</li>
            <li> This is the second time a get it. Excelent</li>
            <li> They are all different colors and even change whether it is cold outside or warm. They are more moisturizing that the Fran Wilson MoodMatcher Lipstick but they don&#x27;t stay on as long. All of them are &amp;#34;bright&amp;#34; colors and not as natural as I had hoped but they are just great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years, much better than any lipstick as regular lipstick wears off only has that color, but mood liptick lasts all day long and is activated by your body temperature so the mood lipstick is the right color all the time for you. I liked it so well I bought a pack for my  mom who really loves it. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Very long lasting.All changed to a pink color.</li>
            <li> A+ my daughter loves it</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE these lipsticks! Not heavy or sticky; fragrance free and taste free. The colors last all day and my lips stay soft all day. I love layering the colors for an even more unique look.</li>
            <li> Three of the six love aloe vera color change mood lipstick were broken when they were delivered in my mail box (the pink, purple and green one). They are soft and moist but too many pink colors. I was expecting the colors  going from pink to orange and red. They stay on well but not 12 hours. I do not want to waste my time returning them to Amazon. I will go to shop for other colors at SALLY&#x27;S.&lt;br /&gt;I am a little disappointed with my order.&lt;br /&gt;Mary Jo Luu</li>
            <li> got for my mother she loves them</li>
            <li> This is really cute mood lipstick. My little one had a blast guessing what color her lips may turn. There are some really &amp;#34;offensively pink&amp;#34; colors in there, so beware--this is more for play or dress up, not for going out unless you&#x27;re going to an 80&#x27;s dance party.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my wife and she loves them, thank.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied with these they barely show</li>
            <li> All of the lipsticks changed to the same shade of hot pink. I guess they would be ok if that is your kind of color but it is not for me.</li>
            <li> I have not tried all of the lipsticks yet but I love the ones I have. The colors are great and I love the way they look on me.</li>
            <li> I like these for light use and moisturizing, for daytime around the house, when I don&#x27;t wear much makeup.</li>
            <li> While some mood lipsticks are only pink, these are different for each color. The blue and purple tubes have a somewhat purplish/blue tint that might come in handy for Halloween, or if you are going for a bruised-lip look. The others vary from pretty pinks to corals. The stain is more light than bright, and lasts longer than I expected. You get 2 of each color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality is rather poor, though. The lipstick part had come loose in several tubes and was stuck to the cap. I ended up tossing 4 because of this, and tossed 4 more because of the blue color of the lipsticks. The plastic tubes are cheap, but they do work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for less than $7 and free shipping, this is still a good value and is a novelty.</li>
            <li> My mom has been using this ever since i was a little girl i thought she was bonkers for using this but never once has it even fsiled her. It was always the perfect shade NEVER wore off and lasted the entire day...till one day her favorite store discontinued BUT ALAS!!!! Here it is. I cant wait to see her face when i get her these amazing lipsticks that have been so amazing for her. Such a great pink color!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these babies at a little store by my house thinking it was clear aloe vera lip gloss. Boy was I wrong. It turned hot pink upon application!&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled about it, but what I was even more thrilled about (and the reason for such a good review) is that I have literally spent years and an obscene amount of money looking for a lip color that would last as long as this stuff does. I&#x27;ve even tried making my own concoctions using the most stain-inducing things I know (pure food coloring, highly concentrated kool aid mix, etc.) to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I&#x27;d have to say is that the color I have now is a bit too pink for me, but I just ordered the whole line so I&#x27;m sure one will be the right shade. So cheap, how couldn&#x27;t I? I&#x27;m tempted to buy a dozen of these in fear that they&#x27;ll stop making it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll report back.</li>
            <li> All the grandaughters were impressed with this package and wanted to try them out right  away.  They liked the variety included.</li>
            <li> My loves her Aloe Vera Lipstick and all of the assorted colors!</li>
            <li> Having been using this product for years because I love it.  It more or less dyes the lips rather than sitting on top of the lips so it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> The darker colors never changed to anything like lasting lip color.  The lighter colors were nice and stayed on for a while.  Comfortable and moist, but I actually gave most of them to my young niece.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item thinking i was colorful lipstick and its not. Each stick showed up an ugly pink. If you are looking for colorful lipstick please dont waste your money on this item smh.</li>
            <li> The green looks pink, the blue looks purple, the yellow looks pink, the purple looks pink, and the orange looks pink. The only correctly colored lipstick is the pink. They barely show up. It was cheap, but now I know why. I suggest looking for another set of lipstick.</li>
            <li> I have been using these lipsticks for 15+ years and won&#x27;t use anything else.  they are the best!  I would recommend to anyone wanting lip stain....I give my sisters some every year when I place an order.</li>
            <li> they are not the color of the lipstick all of them are the same shade of pink</li>
            <li> My lips hydrate alright with these, but they&#x27;re the same color on my lips no matter which one I tried.  And it does come off easily with a dab of napkins or smear with anything that my lips touches.  They&#x27;re just fun colors of chapsticks that&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> i but this always for my mom its all she will use it last long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera Color Change Mood Lipstick Assorted Lipsticks 12pc</li>
            <li> These lipsticks are insanely cool. They hydrate your lips with aloe vera and as you apply them, each leaves a varying stain of pink on the lips. It definitely does not come off as easy as other lipsticks, and you won&#x27;t leave stains on mugs, cheeks, etc. These would be fun for girls of every age to try!</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this lipstick for years &amp; finally found it...love it!!!</li>
            <li> Used as give a-ways at a bridal shower. The lady&#x27;s love them. It is amazing at the various shades we are finding. They are a great conversation piece. Do know these are a lip-stain and not a normal lipstick... so the color is lasting.</li>
            <li> I have used this lipstick for many years. People are always amazed at how long my lipstick stays on. Wouldn&#x27;t wear anything else.</li>
            <li> My first experiment with a mood lipstick was in 1980-something ...I tried only the one colour, (blue or green?), and it turned my lips bright pink, which lasted for HOURS! Pink was not really my thing back then ...STILL isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I saw all six of these colours on sale for about $6, (NOT on Amazon), and thought I would give the other colours the benefit of the doubt for that price.  Besides, I like to wear something a bit different, (from my usual neutral/natural lipstick colours), once in a while. Now, I think I have most shades of \\&quot;wearable\\&quot; pinks covered for quite a while! Lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have found that detailed product descriptions, and reviews, with a general idea of \\&quot;anticipated\\&quot; colour outcomes were few and far between; so, using my web-cam, I snapped a photo of my mood lipsticks&#x27; colours swiped on the back of my light-skinned hand.  I hope this may help some of the fairer-skinned ladies make a reasonably informed choice of whether these lipsticks will \\&quot;work\\&quot; for you, or not. :0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blue became a bluish hot-pink which was a little too bright for my taste - probably the color I first tried back in the &#x27;80s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The green turned into a rather pretty, rosy pink - I think I could handle that once in a while. :0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magenta ...[sigh] bright pink! Duh! Lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The light pink morphed into a deeper shade of pink than the magenta&#x27;s!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dark purple turned into a purplish, pink - not bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps it was just me, but ...the orange lipstick was a little different than the others ...(1) It seemed a bit more sheer in coverage. (2) It was a sort of coral-peachy-pink. (3) The outer edges of the \\&quot;colour-swipe\\&quot; were brightish-pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m \\&quot;on the fence\\&quot; as to whether to try \\&quot;Fran Wilson Mood Pearl Lipstick\\&quot; in Brown ...I may be \\&quot;pinked-out\\&quot; for a while ...and a tad scared it will turn into an unflattering shade of red (on me)! Eek!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had read that, because the colours are long-lasting, sometimes they are difficult to remove (completely).  One of the recommended remedies for that was to use lip balm before applying the lipstick.  Well, since I was only doing a quick colour test on my hand, I used hand moisturizer before swiping them.  That worked well - I used (sandalwood) soap and water (as hot as I could stand it), then scrubbed with fingers and fingernails until it all came off. There&#x27;s not a trace left! (Yay! No pink-tinged hand!) :0D Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t use bath linens I care about to wash these off, since they would likely stain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t (yet) rate their moisturizing qualities, (if any), since I have not yet really worn them on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if varying shades of pink cheer you up, these \\&quot;mood-y pinks\\&quot; might be just the pick-me-up for you! :0)ometimes they are difficult to remove (completely).

            <li> the color is ugly and they are easily broken.</li>
            <li> I knew they were all going to end up being pink. I just add another color on too and it ends up being perfect.  It last for many many hours. Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Good product, but only received 6pcs and not as pictured here. They are all in green tubes. Overall good product just a shady a shady seller.</li>
            <li> they last for a long time on your lips feel great it really conditions on it is a really pretty color pink I really like them</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars because it was under $7, is part of Amazon Prime [so I received it VERY quickly], I am loving the feel of this lipstick and the pink color is just CUTE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the colors:&lt;br /&gt;For my lips they are ALL displaying on my lips as pink. Nothing has turned to any shade of red, just a very similar, not -that-different-from-each-other-pink. I can say, however, the pink I&#x27;m strutting is bright and really does seem to go with MY skin tone, more than any other straight pink-colored lipstick I&#x27;ve tried before...so for that I give it an A+! That leads me to believe these do indeed work according to one&#x27;s personal body chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I tried any on my lips I did as another reviewer did and tested the colors on my arm. The colors are really not that different, FOR ME, but that may be totally different for another buyer.&lt;br /&gt;I have very PINK skin as I am a natural strawberry blonde, so I&#x27;m no surprised my shades are all pink. A person with more yellow pigment or someone who tans easily may have a totally different experience. Maybe not. I still think these were fun and totally worth $7 for 12 lipsticks! I mean, how is that a waste of money?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw other reviewers say they were mad because they all came out pink and it was a waste of their money - I look at it this way: I just got 12 pink lipsticks for under $7. If you end up not liking them for yourself give them away as a gift. Giving a gift is never a waste!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this lipstick has not been &amp;#34;drying&amp;#34; as some reviews from 2013 say, so I wonder if the product has been updated since then or there was a bad batch at some point, because these definitely feel soft on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color DOES LAST! I was so impressed! I put some on at bedtime just to test it out and I woke up with pink lips! It was AWESOME!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m actually going to buy more so that I have extras to gift to my loved ones, put around the house, my car, my purse and maybe even give to my 4-year-old daughter for fun... maybe :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review was helpful!be even give to my 4-year-old daughter for fun... maybe :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review was helpful!</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this product.  The colors all produce a different shade of pink with some of the colors producing a red tone.  I noticed that when you put several coats on the brighter/darker the color will turn out.  They feel really moist on your skin, and don&#x27;t cake like most lipsticks so they feel really good on your lips.  Your lips look really natural as if it is the real color of your lips.  Finally, a lipstick that lasts a long time on your lips.  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick, it stays on better than the expensive brands, I was just glad to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really liked them. I know people who have reviewed this product say that all of them are the same shade of ugly pink, but they are all different shapes of red, and since they adjust to your ph all the sades look good on you. They are all very soft and leave your lips feeling very smooth. Something else that I like is that they don&#x27;t stain your lips, yet they last for almost all day. I would definitely buy them again.</li>
            <li> Now i bought this because it was a good price.Also cause i though it was going to be almost exactly the color of the lipstick until i read the details which was my fault i admit.So now i have 12 pack lipstick that are shine glossy.Although also can see that they can break off very easily.I don&#x27;t recommend this product.Unless you can return these with a refund.I don&#x27;t know what to do with them.</li>
            <li> It stays forever first it is sattin then completely matte</li>
            <li> So far so good. I wish it changed many other colors besides only shades if pink. I really like how I get an extra lipstick for each color, that is cool.</li>
            <li> I have been using these lipsticks for years. Only need to buy them once every 10 years or so and always worry I won&#x27;t find them again. I am SOOOOO happy I have located them here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors get darker based on your body heat and they stay on for hours. Better be sure you get a color applied correctly or you&#x27;ll have trouble removing the color.</li>
            <li> I love my aloe vera lipsticks and yes i recommended and change colors</li>
            <li> long lasting , colors lips all day and tint till morning use it under my lipstick.</li>
            <li> I love mood lipstick! It&#x27;s feels good on the lips and you only have to apply it a few times during the entire day.</li>
            <li> My daughter hates lipstick (the way it feels), but loves this!! She says it doesn&#x27;t feel like lipstick and likes the way it changes color.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful! more pigmented than I thought, still very wearable colors! definitely recommend</li>
            <li> The colors all changed to pink. Not what I expected. Would&#x27;ve liked blues and purples too, but after reading the other reviews, it looks like most people expected the same thing.</li>
            <li> All of the colors are the same i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this lipstick. This was a waste of my money if I could I would rate this product a zero.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these! My grandmother used to wear these all the time but I never knew where she got them from or how to find them. Thankfully the internet has all the answers. This lipstick practically lasts all day. I might have to re-apply it once but that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;m also a heavy tea and coffee drinker and this stuff barely leaves a trace on my  mugs! I would definitely recommend this lipstick to anyone, it is more than worth the money. Once caution though, pretty much all the lipsticks end up being some variant of hot pink. If you do not look good in hot pink lipstick then this is not the right product for you.</li>
            <li> most of the colors were the same.  they did not last as other mood lipsticks that i had. i have had mood lipstick and it lasted forever.</li>
            <li> Been buying this for me and my friend for years.  It makes my lips feel moist.  i sometimes put it on over other lipsticks since they are not as moist.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick.  You get 6 shades, 2 of each.  Each shade always turns to a pink on me.  You can put on after breakfast and there is still color left at noon time.  Leaves your lips feeling soft.  Could not say enough nice things about the product.</li>
            <li> doest change colour(( Blue one looks like dead person((( others are just great, very long lasting lipsticks and soften lips, aloe vera works!!!</li>
            <li> I like the aloe it is very moisturizing but the colors did not come out as vivid as other mood lipsticks I have used.</li>
            <li> Lipstick?  Hardly.  We needed unusual colored lipstick, and this is marketed as such.  But once it arrived we could see that despite the \\&quot;colors\\&quot; in the package, it doesn&#x27;t apply as the colors you see.  It goes on clear, like gloss, then changes to pink.  No Green or Blue lipstick here... just garbage.  Don&#x27;t waste your money like we did. Wish we could rate this as a big fat \\&quot;zero.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> They are great quality! I love the formula, the smell, and the texture, but as far as color changing no. They are all some variation of pink red and purple, no real diversity,and they dont change colors, as far as i can see, but they are great quality for the price and quantity, and the colors are really cool to see which one is which</li>
            <li> I love the Aloe Vera Color Change Mood Lipstick.  It covers properly and does not smear.  I wear different colors on different days according to my mood which is almost always good.  It is certainly an acceptable alternative to expensive lip color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toad</li>
            <li> I have been using this lipstick for years.  I used to buy all the fancy stuff and would get it home and then not like it.  This lipstick works with your body chemistry and on me turns a nice shade of pink.  This is all I buy but cannot find it in the stores.  I bought several packs because I used them as favors at a recent event I hosted.  The ladies were thrilled.</li>
            <li> Amazing, very lubricating and arrived as promised.  Thank you will buy from you again.</li>
            <li> I love mood lipstick and its hard to find. Thia 12 pc set is great and will last me a long time and he price is better than I could get in any store!!!!</li>
            <li> I have had something similar- but love the quanity and the shades and the cost was so low hard to believe I would get the quanity and quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a 12 year old girl in a home for abused women and children whose name was on a christmas Tree Angel list.  I bought the lipsticks to go with the Shany Make-Up kit.  Make-up was on the top of her Christmas &amp;#34;Santa&amp;#34; wish list.  I hope she liked them both!</li>
            <li> Love it I use it daily and I am very happy with it.  I am very happy i bought this</li>
            <li> The Lipstick is a good product, just not what I was expecting. The color is very long lasting, and yes, does keep lips soft, which is a plus. The only thing is that it seems that no matter what color you put on, it all turns into bright pink.I was kind of hoping there would be some variation of color depending on which lipstick you put on, but that wasn&#x27;t the case. I might use this as lip gloss under my lipstick, I&#x27;m not really into bright pink.</li>
            <li> Longlasting and lovely color</li>
            <li> Great colors :) It&#x27;s a great deal for the price even though the lipsticks are a little dry and not as moist as I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> Product was broken up upon arrival</li>
            <li> I have had these lipsticks before...They last many years! Only drawback is they are made in China, but I do like them and they are way less expensive than regular lipstick. They are sort of a cross between lipstick and lip gloss. There are so many of them I can stash them everywhere I might want one...I would give them the highest rating but I do not &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; material items. These really are great.</li>
            <li> Fairly moisturizing and long lasting. The product was shipped quickly. And the colours are very nice! Overall, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised, as my expectations were low.</li>
            <li> All the lipstick are the same color :(</li>
            <li> I love these - they go on smooth - aloe keeps the lips soft - color lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I bought these to try with several friends. They are really fun. Don&#x27;t really listen to anyone about color, yes they are mostly shades of pink, one of them on me is a really pretty shade of coral like persimmon color one is more of a deeper purple shade. You can really have fun with them because every one is a different color on different people, they even change on me depending on weather. They do an ok job of lip moisture. The best thing about them is they last longer than most lip colors I have ever tried. They may not stay bright all day, but you still have color after lunch well into the afternoon, and if you are like me, I only put on lipstick maybe twice a day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this lipstick. I&#x27;m a flight attendant and the cabin air is very dry. This product keeps my lips moisturized and is very long lasting! I&#x27;ve tried various lip stains/long lasting lip sticks but this product is the absolute best out there!</li>
            <li> pretty color but just doesn&#x27;t last as long as said.</li>
            <li> The color of the lipstick was not as vibrant as it was described to be.&lt;br /&gt;Only colors that show up are a light red color. Not mood changing at all.</li>
            <li> Does not change colors all the colors are the same pale rose tint on my entire family of girls lips. I would not recommend this product at all. Waste of money very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the lipstick</li>
            <li> I try to always have some on hand.</li>
            <li> This is the  best lipstick, I ever use! and i can&#x27;t live without it...</li>
            <li> I got these as a gift after debating over getting them for myself. I&#x27;ve been wearing the blue one all day and I just love it. They are all shades of pink/magenta/orangey pink. I just love pink lipstick and these are just so much fun!! The blue one is a darker purple - pink on me, pretty bright but fun. So if you aren&#x27;t big on pinks this may not be the set for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They haven&#x27;t dried my lips out all day that I&#x27;ve been wearing it unlike some other more expensive brands. This feels more like chapstick or lip balm than lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cases are simple plastic casings but the flowers on the tube are very cute. It&#x27;s been rolling around in my purse and hasn&#x27;t fallen open or broken yet so they are decently sturdy but I wouldn&#x27;t stress test them.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. All the colors are basically the same and don&#x27;t wear for long. I&#x27;ve had Mood Lipsticks purchased from Sally&#x27;s that were much better.</li>
            <li> Good for cheaper lipstick. The colors definitely change rather nicely to varying shades of pink and red per different color.</li>
            <li> Bought these thinking they were like the mood lipsticks of the past. Either they have changed or I have!  The colors just don&#x27;t do anything for me. I mean anything. The price was super low so it&#x27;s not a big deal</li>
            <li> really  I think will be different color as we see but it wasnt same pink color all of them ;0</li>
            <li> I remember these from the 70&#x27;s when I was a preteen. I bought 2 sets for gifts for my granddaughters. Was so curious I had to try a couple out and I lovedl them!  So I broke up the packages and kept several for myself. Very moisturizing as well as fun with pretty flowery lipstick cases!</li>
            <li> Great thankyou. Fast postage to Oz!</li>
            <li> I am a but disappointed that they all end up being the same color. I figured the ones with the same color tube would be the same color but I felt that the rest should show different colors. That being said though I still would recommend them as like a party favor gift or some thing :)</li>
            <li> Good and vibrant but it takes a long time to where off and lots of effort to get off</li>
            <li> At first I thought this was a bust. But after a few seconds the color started to show up and got darker and I loved them!  They are silky, and smooth, and they stay for such a long time!!  I love them.</li>
