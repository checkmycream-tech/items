            <li>I wish they made one shade lighter than this one, then I&#x27;d be super happy.</li>

            <li>This is more like a hair product container.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this makeup.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this excellent product.</li>
            <li>I would give five stars if there were more color choices.</li>
            <li>so I thought I would love this too.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I have gotten SO many compliments on my skin after I started using this product.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty good foundation</li>
            <li>A more accurate label would be &#x27;tanned caucasian.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I used to have to put on a ton of concealer for my under-eye circles, but now I put a layer of this on my face and just a little bit of concealer, followed by a mineral powder, and it&#x27;s perfect all day.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the pressed powder, hydration lotion and mineral spray</li>
            <li>I hope they tweak for light, oily skin.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the feel of clean when I wear it.  </li>
            <li>Considering I want a clean healthy makeup, this one is reasonably priced and works well.</li>
            <li>I am also very allergic to so many products</li>
            <li>It was super oily.</li>
            <li>Your skin will drink it in and you will feel fresh when you wear it.  </li>
            <li>However, the lightest shade is too dark for my fair skin and it makes me look super oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older with fine wrinkles and lines and this makeup gives a moist youthful look to my skin.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m not super fair) and it gives me a bit of a sun</li>
            <li>I should note that I am 66 with very light, blotchy skin with numerous scars from skin cancers, age marks, freckles, etc.</li>
            <li>I have had several comments on how healthy my skin looks.</li>
            <li>First found this at Sprouts, and this price compares to their 25% off sale.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first bottle at Whole Foods, but I don&#x27;t have one close to me now.</li>
            <li>as I grew up in the  southern California sun before sun screen was available.</li>
            <li>My face was really shiny</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and lasts a long time (I wear it every day and a bottle lasted me 4 months).</li>
            <li>I often am complemented on my skin by complete strangers, so I think that is an indication that it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t look dry or caked.</li>
            <li>Compared to the more matte foundations out there, this is slightly oily -</li>
            <li>If I have a long day I use a little mineral finishing powder to give a staying power and make it through the day looking good.  </li>
            <li>I really like that this product is natural, and I like how it feels.</li>
            <li>What this is, is natural.  </li>
            <li>I am using natural products without names I cannot pronounce.  </li>
            <li>Also check out AfterGlow Natural Cosmetics online.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been on RXs including Accutane since then and have tried lots of natural remedies as well.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and gives my skin just enough coverage without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li>It really is my favorite, but the neutral color is a slight shade too dark.</li>
            <li>:)  Slight oiliness does not bother me, but I can&#x27;t judge coverage because it is just too dark for</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure I would wear it alone due to the shiny factor, but again with a mineral powder on top</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Considering I want a clean healthy makeup, this one is reasonably priced and works well. This is my third purchase of the same thing so I guess that in itself is a great vote.</li>
            <li> i have alot of scars..this make up covers NOTHING....just oil plastered on my face for no reason at all..sorry but will not be using again.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation.  It goes on smooth and gives my skin just enough coverage without being too heavy.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like it is caked on at all.  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Veey nice moisture product without a greasy feel but still has good coverage</li>
            <li> I love this foundation and have been using it for a while then my health food store stopped carrying makeup all together. I was relieved when I found it here so added it to my subscriptions to get it regularly. It goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t look dry or caked. I hate the dry look many people go for, that makes lines stand out more. This makeup gives a nice sheen to my skin. I&#x27;m older with fine wrinkles and lines and this makeup gives a moist youthful look to my skin. I&#x27;m not trying to hide anything, just even my skin tone, and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation and the glow it gives me. I am also very allergic to so many products and I do not react to this one. It really is my favorite, but the neutral color is a slight shade too dark. I have white skin with some color it in it (I&#x27;m not super fair) and it gives me a bit of a sun kissed look. I wish they made one shade lighter than this one, then I&#x27;d be super happy. I can&#x27;t seem to find one either at the store nor online. If I&#x27;m not seeing a lighter shade than this by mistake, let me know! It&#x27;s not as sheer as they claim it to be... it will sun kiss fairer skin.</li>
            <li> great makeup I have ordered this before and really like it.</li>
            <li> What this is, is natural.  Your skin will drink it in and you will feel fresh when you wear it.  It is a pretty good foundation but it does wear off or absorb into the skin.  I enjoy the feel of clean when I wear it.  If I have a long day I use a little mineral finishing powder to give a staying power and make it through the day looking good.  I have had several comments on how healthy my skin looks.</li>
            <li> This is more like a hair product container. The opening is way too big, Product gushes out and makes a mess.  I agree with another reviewer that the &#x27;neutral&#x27; shade is too dark. A more accurate label would be &#x27;tanned caucasian.&#x27; :)  Slight oiliness does not bother me, but I can&#x27;t judge coverage because it is just too dark for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the problem is the color names. Which is supposed to be lighter - neutral or medium?  If medium is actually the lighter shade, I may try to exchange. If neutral is the lightest shade you make.... why???</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this makeup. I use it as my only makeup over my moisturizer, to just even out my skin tones. It is slightly darker than the skin on my face, but only a little and definitely does not look like I am wearing any makeup. I often am complemented on my skin by complete strangers, so I think that is an indication that it works pretty well. I should note that I am 66 with very light, blotchy skin with numerous scars from skin cancers, age marks, freckles, etc. as I grew up in the  southern California sun before sun screen was available.</li>
            <li> Very easy coverage, lightweight, and doesn&#x27;t feel like you have anything on your skin.  I am using natural products without names I cannot pronounce.  First found this at Sprouts, and this price compares to their 25% off sale.  Also check out AfterGlow Natural Cosmetics online.</li>
            <li> Compared to the more matte foundations out there, this is slightly oily - but I like it in the winter and there are no animal products in it so it meets that requirement for me to use a cosmetic.</li>
            <li> I bought my first bottle at Whole Foods, but I don&#x27;t have one close to me now. I really like that this product is natural, and I like how it feels. Its nice for evening out the skin, but it doesn&#x27;t work so well covering up blemishes.</li>
            <li> This color is darker than the warm.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this excellent product. I would give five stars if there were more color choices.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the pressed powder, hydration lotion and mineral spray so I thought I would love this too. Wrong! It was super oily. My face was really shiny and I felt like it never soaked in. I returned it:(</li>
            <li> I love this product. I used to have to put on a ton of concealer for my under-eye circles, but now I put a layer of this on my face and just a little bit of concealer, followed by a mineral powder, and it&#x27;s perfect all day. It creates an even skin tone without looking thick and cakey, which is exactly what I wanted. I have gotten SO many compliments on my skin after I started using this product. It goes on easily and lasts a long time (I wear it every day and a bottle lasted me 4 months). I&#x27;m not sure I would wear it alone due to the shiny factor, but again with a mineral powder on top it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction (itchy skin, teary eyes)</li>
            <li> Love this product! Very nice finish. Great for those with allergies.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve battled horrible acne since I was 12. I&#x27;ve been on RXs including Accutane since then and have tried lots of natural remedies as well. This is the one and only foundation I&#x27;ve ever tried that doesn&#x27;t make me break out! However, the lightest shade is too dark for my fair skin and it makes me look super oily. I hope they tweak for light, oily skin.</li>
            <li> Do not buy if you have oil prone skin. It makes my face look like a grease pit within an hour. Very disappointing!</li>
