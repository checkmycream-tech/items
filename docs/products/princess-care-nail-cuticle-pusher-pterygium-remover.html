            <li>Never have I had such en excellent cuticle pusher as this one.  </li>
            <li>require a whole lot of pressure;workl great</li>
            <li>its ok i used it my cuticle to pick up</li>
            <li>Use this tool carefully; it does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>The tool is stainless steel for durability and ease of cleaning, with a knurled pattern on the handle for good grip.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use them as designed and what I use it for is perfect, strong and sharp.</li>
            <li>High quality which was surprising for the price.  </li>

            <li>Princess Care Solo SS Nail Cuticle Pusher Pterygium Remover 12 works well in pushing my cuticles back and and keeping underneath my nails nice and clean.</li>
            <li>Great little tool.</li>
            <li>Does a nice job of pushing back the cuticle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I expect.</li>
            <li>It is so sharp it completely takes your cuticles back perfectly.</li>
            <li>The pointed end is quite sharp along the flat edge (like a knife edge), and is wonderful for cleaning under nails and scraping the back of nails to get them really clean.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>Makes quick work of pushing back cuticles</li>
            <li>(my old one was part plastic in the middle), but it&#x27;s close enough to what I have been looking for and, for years, have never been able to find.  </li>
            <li>It is broader than any other that I have seen, so that it is easier to make a smoothly rounded cuticle without damage to the cuticle than the narrower tools.  </li>
            <li>Tapered to an almost sharp wedge at the end, it scrapes the nail free of residual cuticle without the necessity of cuticle remover.  </li>
            <li>it left my nails looking very clean, as if I just spent $30 on a Manicurist to do the job.</li>
            <li>Be aware that both ends are pretty sharp, so don&#x27;t leave it laying around for pets, kids, unsuspecting husbands to get a hold of!</li>
            <li>It does a great job on my cuticles which grow like crazy.</li>
            <li>The nail scraper end of the item I received was very rounded and NOT tapered enough to reach under the nail.  </li>
            <li>I did order another one and it was a good as the first, but when I ordered once again the tool I received has a blunt cuticle pusher, and an overly sharp nail cleaning end that is thin enough that was bent.</li>
            <li>Apparently the quality varies.</li>
            <li>With one end, you can clean under your nails without anything stabbing you and the other side is effective at pushing back your cuticles.  </li>
            <li>and I broke the other end trying to get the cellophane wrapper off a new bar of soap</li>

            <li> Hard to find &amp; I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product. My mom had one and i couldnt find it in any store. This was it!!. It is so sharp it completely takes your cuticles back perfectly. Nothing cheap about this one. Im thinking of buying a couple back ups in case i cant find it again.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job of pushing back the cuticle.&lt;br /&gt;Opposite end good for cleaning under the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially sent the wrong item.&lt;br /&gt;Quick to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent customer service.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> It is Just what I wanted. Good quality, just ideal. And at a very good price. Thank you very much.</li>

            <li> Never have I had such en excellent cuticle pusher as this one.

            <li> It is way too sharp. It takes part of the nail with it every time you scrape over it. You&#x27;d think it was your cuticle that it is taking off, but it is also taking the nail.</li>
            <li> looks good have not used yet</li>
            <li> Actually, what persuaded me to buy this tool was an adverse comment about the tool being &amp;#34;too sharp.&amp;#34;  That&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.  It&#x27;s not exactly like the one I had for years before the blade got dull and I broke the other end trying to get the cellophane wrapper off a new bar of soap (my old one was part plastic in the middle), but it&#x27;s close enough to what I have been looking for and, for years, have never been able to find.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  It does a great job on my cuticles which grow like crazy.</li>

            <li> Great little tool. I don&#x27;t use them as designed and what I use it for is perfect, strong and sharp.</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically to be a nail scraper.  The nail scraper as shown in the picture would be fine.  The item I received however was not as pictured.  The nail scraper end of the item I received was very rounded and NOT tapered enough to reach under the nail.  It is worthless</li>
            <li> I saw this in a nail salon.  I am happy to have found one for myself.  Thanks.  Barb Taylor&lt;br /&gt;I do not like these demands for words!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expect.</li>
            <li> I have looked for something to use for cleaning my nails.  It seems I can get them dirty with absolutely no effort on my part.  I have tried all sort of things, all the obvious ones, small pocket knives, the slanted end of tweezers, just about anything because my dirty nails really bother me.  The pointed end of this tool works the best of anything I have tried, so for that purpose it is a true 5 star.</li>
            <li> If you do at home manicures, you&#x27;ll want this tool! Be aware that both ends are pretty sharp, so don&#x27;t leave it laying around for pets, kids, unsuspecting husbands to get a hold of!</li>
            <li> Works well for fingers and toes.  Makes quick work of pushing back cuticles</li>
            <li> Princess Care Solo SS Nail Cuticle Pusher Pterygium Remover 12 works well in pushing my cuticles back and and keeping underneath my nails nice and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched for years for a tool like this. The quality is excellent, like a surgical instrument.  The pointed end is quite sharp along the flat edge (like a knife edge), and is wonderful for cleaning under nails and scraping the back of nails to get them really clean. The cuticle pusher also has a sharp edge.  Use this tool carefully; it does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> Best pusher I&#x27;ve found yet. Recommended.</li>
