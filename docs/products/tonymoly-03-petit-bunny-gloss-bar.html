            <li>Love these cute bunny glosses!</li>
            <li>Very cute and adorable ^\\\\^ very light taste and smell though</li>
            <li>The color pay off is nice and the tubes are super cute!</li>
            <li>What I love most about it is that it&#x27;s not sticky.</li>
            <li>I love the color and texture.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I still love it.</li>
            <li>This is like a cute berry color that isn&#x27;t obnoxious.</li>
            <li>The top broke after a while.</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy more from this company and product line.</li>
            <li>I love tony moly.</li>
            <li>It is just too cute to pass</li>
            <li>I would say that you can get 30 min to an hour (or more) of wear out of this (if you aren&#x27;t drinking or eating).</li>
            <li>and I must say that the cuteness makes me love it even more.</li>
            <li>Lovely scent as well .</li>
            <li>but the more you use it the stronger it gets.</li>
            <li>I would say I do love it</li>
            <li>This is an ok product</li>
            <li>SUPER CUTE product!</li>
            <li>I have very dry lips, but this was perfect with a bit of lip balm underneath.</li>
            <li>I think this product is super cute</li>
            <li>Super cute packaging .</li>
            <li>Can fit a lot of skin tones and make up styles.</li>
            <li>Is a great sheer color.</li>
            <li>Such cute product designs and the product itself is good quality.</li>
            <li>I really liked this lip balm it goes on smooth and has a very soft tint of color.  </li>
            <li>A pretty much convincing argument.</li>
            <li>This bunny winks and makes me smile EVERYTIME!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>Nice smooth gloss that adds a natural looking tint of colour.</li>
            <li>the flavor is really sweet and fruity.</li>
            <li>When it comes to pigmentation, you do have to go over it 2-3 times to get the full color.</li>
            <li>In time for the holidays&amp;#62;.&amp;#60;  Super soft and smooth to apply, it feels great on my lips and it gives it a natural glow &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>Adorable little lip balm with a beautiful, vibrant magenta color!</li>
            <li>i actually expected a bit bigger but the size is ok with me, still a great product for the price ( its about 6 inches, from top of the bunny ear to the bottom)</li>
            <li>Its a bit darker than I thought it would be, but other than that great.</li>
            <li>Color does wear off quickly, though.</li>
            <li>Lasts a while, doesnt dry out your lips, smells and tastes good.</li>
            <li>i Bought #3 and its a nice shade of hot pink :)</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and very wears very comfortable on the lips.</li>
            <li>Is more of a lipstick than a lipgloss (in my opinion :) shipping super fast received it days earlier than stated time.</li>
            <li>I also got a cute little face primer pouch from Ã©tude house (I thought it was a nice touch)</li>
            <li>Also i had to really press the product to my lips to get the color(my lips are naturally a light pinky brown).</li>
            <li>It applies just like a chapstick with a bright pink tint.</li>
            <li>It came TWO weeks earlier than expected which made me so happy!</li>
            <li>, it is a lil smaller than I thought but still a nice amount of product.</li>
            <li>It glides on like a tinted lip balm only the color pops more.</li>
            <li>Not too sticky, more like a sheer chapstick with tint.</li>
            <li>It was okay just a regular gloss.</li>
            <li>im going to buy more different colors too</li>
            <li>I truly want the whole set!  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>My teenage nieces love these.</li>
            <li>but these are adorable really moisturizing too and leave a nice color behind</li>
            <li>Applies like any lip balm, but the narrow size makes it easy to apply precisely, as opposed to slathering a large Chapstick on your lips.</li>
            <li>The little bunny is really cute and fun.</li>
            <li>Just FYI, the Juicy Apple is much more pink than I imagined</li>
            <li>so i didnt really matter.</li>
            <li>This came much faster</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really moisturize my lips</li>
            <li>The color also showed up nicely since my lips are a bit of a dark color, while still looking very natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t last a long time, but still a good product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a super cute stick of lip gloss that adds a tiny hint of color to your lips and makes them smell like green apple, without flavor!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely one of my favorites now.</li>
            <li>The color is nice,gives a cute red lip, but it does leave my lips dry</li>
            <li>And I think the size is just right personally.</li>
            <li>( I&#x27;m a sucker for cute packaging) and will definitely be returning to buy more of these bunny gloss bars in different colors.</li>
            <li>Juicy apple is a pinkie pink and tastes sweet.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really moisturize your lips, but it also does not dry them out.</li>
            <li>The color stays put much longer than American tinted balms, too!</li>
            <li>I initially bought it just for the packaging, really.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is like a tinted lip balm that provides a natural, tinted look on the lips with a glossy finish.</li>
            <li>Came early too ^^</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and makes my lips feel nice, but the color actually looks quite bad on me.</li>
            <li>(I got the hot pink one) .</li>
            <li>the only thing i don&#x27;t like is how much product i actually got for the price of about 9 dollars.</li>
            <li>but you can only apply 1 if you want it to be more subtle.</li>
            <li>50 year olds have bunnies hidden in their clutches ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because the coating was fresh</li>
            <li>What I received was hot pink going to barbie pink.</li>

            <li> so be careful to not loose it</li>
            <li> It was just staring back at me from my screen just saying &#x27;I&#x27;m pink.</li>
            <li> Arrived so much earlier than I expected!</li>
            <li> However, the lip gloss cost is not much</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s a little too pink for my skin tone.</li>
            <li> took a little while</li>
            <li> After about 5 min after applying I ate some Little Caesars pizza (with dip) and it still stayed on my lips.</li>
            <li> My lips are small in size by quite full and it&#x27;s just awkward to apply like taking a mini toothbrush and scrubbing the floors weird comparison</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really small</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just to lazy to get it</li>
            <li> I admit that I am a sucker of packaging and TONYMOLY knows just how to do it.</li>
            <li> I wanted the angry faced one</li>

            <li> Great chapstick love the the color !</li>
            <li> This is a really nice gloss.  I love the color and texture.</li>
            <li> Steal. Dont buy. Never give my money back. Fraud</li>
            <li> Too too cute!  I love it.</li>
            <li> Arrived so much earlier than I expected! Love this product!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and makes my lips feel nice, but the color actually looks quite bad on me. Not knocking the product, I just look like s*** when I wear it. I guess it&#x27;s a little too pink for my skin tone. I have an olive skin tone I guess.</li>
            <li> Great cover and so beautiful. Can fit a lot of skin tones and make up styles.</li>
            <li> It smells so good! Its a bit darker than I thought it would be, but other than that great. Color does wear off quickly, though.</li>
            <li> The color is nice,gives a cute red lip, but it does leave my lips dry so i need to use a lip balm</li>
            <li> So cute! it just came in today took a little while but these are adorable really moisturizing too and leave a nice color behind and I love the seller they give lot&#x27;s of samples!</li>
            <li> Good product, leaves your lips the perfect amount of tinted and glossy! It doesn&#x27;t really moisturize your lips, but it also does not dry them out. It can hold your lips over if you do need chapstick and don&#x27;t have any. I think this product is super cute ( I&#x27;m a sucker for cute packaging) and will definitely be returning to buy more of these bunny gloss bars in different colors.</li>
            <li> I wanted the angry faced one but I decided to get the apple for the flavor. Don&#x27;t do what I did. Just get the color/face of rabbit you want. Mine had no flavor or smell, but it did do its job. As promised its a very nice gloss bar. I still love it.</li>
            <li> Love these glosses! Feel fantastic and look great! Not too sticky, more like a sheer chapstick with tint. Love!</li>
            <li> This is like a cute berry color that isn&#x27;t obnoxious. It took about 2-3 coats to fully get it on but you can only apply 1 if you want it to be more subtle. After about 5 min after applying I ate some Little Caesars pizza (with dip) and it still stayed on my lips. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because the coating was fresh but that&#x27;s pretty impressive.</li>
            <li> The top broke after a while. But I really liked the color. (I got the hot pink one) . Pigment is nice, would buy again.</li>
            <li> I only received 1 lip gloss instead of 2. However, the lip gloss cost is not much so i didnt really matter.</li>
            <li> Perfect. perfect color perfect texture and the flavor is really sweet and fruity. I love it and will buy more from this company and product line.</li>
            <li> I got suckered in by the packaging. It was just staring back at me from my screen just saying &#x27;I&#x27;m pink. I&#x27;m a bunny. I&#x27;ve got ears.&#x27; A pretty much convincing argument. The product it self was a disappointment, the color is nice sheer pinky red, it moistened my lips but it wears off after an hour or so. The application is what bothers me. My lips are small in size by quite full and it&#x27;s just awkward to apply like taking a mini toothbrush and scrubbing the floors weird comparison but that&#x27;s how i felt. Also i had to really press the product to my lips to get the color(my lips are naturally a light pinky brown). So bunny to you i salute you and say touche.</li>
            <li> Adorable little lip balm with a beautiful, vibrant magenta color! Applies like any lip balm, but the narrow size makes it easy to apply precisely, as opposed to slathering a large Chapstick on your lips. The color stays put much longer than American tinted balms, too! A must-have!</li>
            <li> It was okay just a regular gloss.</li>
            <li> I admit that I am a sucker of packaging and TONYMOLY knows just how to do it. I have hundreds of lip products from glosses to balms, to butters to lipsticks so I wanted to try this out. I bought #3 Juicy Apple and was expecting reddish-pink. What I received was hot pink going to barbie pink. I have medium tone skin and the product does not go too well with my complexion. When it comes to pigmentation, you do have to go over it 2-3 times to get the full color. I like it but I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> SUPER CUTE product! It came TWO weeks earlier than expected which made me so happy! In time for the holidays&amp;#62;.&amp;#60;  Super soft and smooth to apply, it feels great on my lips and it gives it a natural glow &amp;#60;3 i Bought #3 and its a nice shade of hot pink :) great product *im going to buy more different colors too* i actually expected a bit bigger but the size is ok with me, still a great product for the price ( its about 6 inches, from top of the bunny ear to the bottom)</li>
            <li> Tony Moly cuteness.  This bunny winks and makes me smile EVERYTIME!  Juicy apple is a pinkie pink and tastes sweet.  I truly want the whole set!  50 year olds have bunnies hidden in their clutches ;)</li>
            <li> I love tony moly. Such cute product designs and the product itself is good quality. It applies just like a chapstick with a bright pink tint. Lasts a while, doesnt dry out your lips, smells and tastes good. Perfect to use when you do not want to wear lipstick but still want a tint. This color doesn&#x27;t look the greatest on me compared to Juicy Apple but still good.</li>
            <li> I initially bought it just for the packaging, really. It is just too cute to pass up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is like a tinted lip balm that provides a natural, tinted look on the lips with a glossy finish. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it is sheer or pigmented, but it is pigmented enough for the actual color to show. It is very moisturizing and very wears very comfortable on the lips. I would say that you can get 30 min to an hour (or more) of wear out of this (if you aren&#x27;t drinking or eating).</li>
            <li> I love South Korean beauty products and Tonymoly is one of my favorites! I have 5 of the gloss bars and I want to get the rest! The color is very nice and it smells good too! The little bunny is really cute and fun. This would make a great fun gift for anyone who likes lip gloss or makeup!  This came much faster then I was expecting so that is always good! Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased the juicy peach and this juicy apple and I must say that the cuteness makes me love it even more. The color looks so good on the lips and it&#x27;s for a good price too! It&#x27;s definitely moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t last a long time, but still a good product.</li>
            <li> Super cute packaging . Nice smooth gloss that adds a natural looking tint of colour. Lovely scent as well .</li>
            <li> This is a very cute lip stick it looks like the picture and im very happy with my purchase &#x3D;D the color of the lip stick is a very pretty color very happy with my purchase. &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips, but this was perfect with a bit of lip balm underneath. The color also showed up nicely since my lips are a bit of a dark color, while still looking very natural.</li>
            <li> Very cute and adorable ^\\\\^ very light taste and smell though but the more you use it the stronger it gets. Is more of a lipstick than a lipgloss (in my opinion :) shipping super fast received it days earlier than stated time. Ooh! I also got a cute little face primer pouch from Ã©tude house (I thought it was a nice touch) but it&#x27;s really small so be careful to not loose it 0w0 ( I lost mine but I&#x27;m pretty sure I know where it is I&#x27;m just to lazy to get it ;) but I&#x27;ll try out the primer and if I like it enough I&#x27;ll comment/ buy it ^~^</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a super cute stick of lip gloss that adds a tiny hint of color to your lips and makes them smell like green apple, without flavor!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely one of my favorites now.</li>
            <li> Just adorable! Great color and cute packaging is the cherry on top.</li>
            <li> This came with another item from the same seller! I would say I do love it, it is a lil smaller than I thought but still a nice amount of product. Smells nice. It didn&#x27;t really moisturize my lips but it didn&#x27;t suck the moisture out either. Is a great sheer color. Delivered well. Came early too ^^ And sooo cute!</li>
            <li> It smells really good and it&#x27;s so cutee, the only thing i don&#x27;t like is how much product i actually got for the price of about 9 dollars.</li>
            <li> I really liked this lip balm it goes on smooth and has a very soft tint of color.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Love these cute bunny glosses! The color pay off is nice and the tubes are super cute! I also love the way they smell!</li>
            <li> Looks good on, tastes good on your lips, and smells good! Every thing that I was looking for! I think it is great!</li>
            <li> This is an ok product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adorable and a beautiful color! And I think the size is just right personally.</li>
            <li> My teenage nieces love these.</li>
