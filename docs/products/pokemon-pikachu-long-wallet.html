            <li>I love Pikachu</li>
            <li>I adore and obesse over Pikachu more than anything i love collecting Pikachu stuff whatever it may be if you love Pikachu</li>
            <li>IF YOU LOVE POKEMON PIKACHU guys</li>
            <li>It would be better</li>
            <li>I love pikachu but some of the design started peeling</li>
            <li>I love my wallet</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thank you! :)</li>
            <li>But still over all cute.</li>
            <li>and I know shes going to love it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really a cute wallet and looks even better in person</li>
            <li>pikachu is still my fav and im 20 :)</li>

            <li>it was adorable</li>
            <li>I love the wallet, just wish it was made better.</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments because it looks absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li>It is a cute wallet.</li>
            <li>so surely nobody should expect to pay 10 bucks for a 100 dollar quality wallet.</li>
            <li>Its cute for the gamer girl.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cute! :)</li>
            <li>The red letters on it aren&#x27;t so great but still very cute.</li>
            <li>I love how you can store your most used credit/debit/license cards comfortably along with a couple bills.</li>
            <li>My favorite wallet in the world the material on the card pockets is kinda cheap but the wallet it sooooo cute</li>
            <li>glad it is available...</li>
            <li>She loved it so much.</li>
            <li>It is super cute, but I do wish it came with more pockets</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every cent I spend! :3</li>
            <li>Other than that this is perfect.</li>
            <li>great product my wife loves anything pikachu and i cant wait for her to open this for christmas : )</li>
            <li>so if I unzip it all the way, the zipper comes off the track and out of the wallet.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that (which is easy to avoid)</li>
            <li>She hasn&#x27;t had any criticisms of it, but I did notice that the ID sleeve doesn&#x27;t have a hole cut in it to allow for easy removal.</li>
            <li>Super cute</li>
            <li>This is a super cute wallet.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been a huge problem yet though.</li>
            <li>the track/zipper itself is made of an extremely light weight and cheap metal....</li>
            <li>Overall great though</li>
            <li>A few marks but wonderful!</li>
            <li>It looked cheap and ripped when I put my cards in.</li>
            <li>However, it is a bit cheaply made...</li>
            <li>So when we got it she was really excited and</li>
            <li>This would be perfect for a young child who is just learning to keep up with money and budget, or someone who is very deeply involved in the pokemon fan culture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly not the best wallet ever made, but then again, it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cute, arrived early, so glad I have it.</li>
            <li>but if you treat it right it should be fine.</li>
            <li>Every day someone tells me how much the love it.</li>
            <li>but overall she loved it</li>
            <li>if you love him soooo much like I do, then I know you should get this wallet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just absolutely the best wallet because its cute but the card holders are too deep and the glue isn&#x27;t as strong but other than those two flaws</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>I love it bought it because I love Pikachu only problem</li>
            <li>The yellow fades very quickly, but it&#x27;s still just as cute.</li>
            <li>The magnet is strong, and with all my gift cards it keeps it nice and closed.</li>
            <li>sure enough where the cards go on the side of it is a huge tear so now</li>
            <li>Worth the price afterall.</li>
            <li>But it is Pokémon, so that is all that matters - right?</li>
            <li>The color and detail of Pikachu were just right according to her.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s made out of some type of satiny plastic product on the outside, so i don&#x27;t have to worry about spills because it&#x27;s extremely easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Super fast.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve only had it a month and so far so good.</li>
            <li>it came too me very neat and very pretty so GET</li>
            <li>SOOO the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>im giving this one start is my first one came ripped.</li>
            <li>This was one of my first wallets and it came just as shown.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it was just mine, but the zipper pocket ripped the first day I got it.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for...</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t pleased with that due that it is such a cute item.</li>
            <li>I honestly only store quarters in the pouch, because you can&#x27;t put too much in it or it won&#x27;t clip as easily.</li>
            <li>I got this wallet for my fiancee because she really likes Pikachu and her wallet was falling apart.</li>
            <li>The wallet isn&#x27;t put together very well.</li>
            <li>so so much</li>
            <li>She really likes it.  </li>
            <li>I really do like this wallet.</li>
            <li>She absolutely freaked.</li>
            <li>ready ripping but still using it &amp;#62;:D</li>
            <li>and then I have an excuse to buy a new one :)</li>
            <li>But other than that I love it</li>
            <li>I love Pikachu and got this wallet because of it and since my other one was falling apart.</li>
            <li>since I ordered it 4 months ago, switched back to my original wallet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice but it won&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li>But, this will be a super cute wallet for at least a couple months</li>
            <li>(There is complete lack of color in Pikachu&#x27;s cheeks which is most noticeable on the interior illustrations, but the color is outside the lines on the outside images-these errors were consistent both times I have bought this wallet)  </li>
            <li>But then you open it up and Pikachu on the inside of the wallet is part white like he wasn&#x27;t colored all the way.. which we found wierd but thought ok thats whatever. .</li>
            <li>The card pockets are super deep and sometimes i get things stuck but</li>
            <li>I love the outside of the item, I just wish that the card holders weren&#x27;t so deep.</li>
            <li>I really love it, but I have to double up cards in their slots because there are only 5 card slots.</li>
            <li>The snap to close is good quality and seems heavy duty and built to last.</li>
            <li>, so I bought this despite the slightly high price ($19.94 with shipping.</li>
            <li>but I feel there should be a little more for all the cards and cash and everything that goes in a wallet.</li>
            <li>This wallet is really cute, but I don&#x27;t think I would use it for everyday use.</li>
            <li>The walllet looks like it wont last long and is more for looks.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t had much better luck with other wallets in the same price range though, so it&#x27;s worth it for the price, especially if you&#x27;re a lifetime Pikachu fan as I am.</li>
            <li>other than that it&#x27;s super rad!</li>
            <li>The liner design is different in some of the wallets and the slightest tug will rip it right</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s brand new and had no defects or anything.</li>
            <li>As a huge Pokemon fan, I had my eye on buying one of these FOREVER and finally caved in and ended up buying one for myself as a birthday present.</li>
            <li>but I think it feel I little cheap made</li>
            <li>A very fun gift for all the little Pokémon fans out there.</li>
            <li>Came in a month early....</li>
            <li>I really like this wallet, though, it is definitely just for looks.</li>
            <li>Then she gets all her cards and stuff from her old wallet and transfers them..</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t fill it completely or it won&#x27;t close</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 16 year old girl</li>
            <li>only problem is that the change pouch and its zipper weren&#x27;t sewn very well</li>
            <li>The second ripped within two days of using it.i was very disapointed.</li>
            <li>The wallet has a soft vinyl feel to it and gets lots of compliments.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very durable as the change pocket zipper came off the tracks on first use and</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like the pictures, shipped in faster than I expected.</li>
            <li>only downside is it looks a little cheap</li>
            <li>The change purse part broke very quickly, but it still technically works, even though it ripped (under very little pressure, there wasn&#x27;t even any change in it</li>
            <li>After a while the red cheeks of pikachu starts to wear off but can be fixed.</li>
            <li>I sewed the ends of the zipper into the sides, you can barely notice the stitching...</li>
            <li>Now, not even a month later the zipper completely came off of the wallet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it will hold up for years, but for a young lady it should last if taken care of.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s kind of difficult to get them out.</li>
            <li>Love the Pokemon wallet, but the zipper was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li>However it started tearing after the first few uses</li>
            <li>Also, the interior coin area is a very cheap material, (almost a thin plastic) that I do not expect to last very long at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really cute but the problems are that the card slots are too big and I have trouble taking my cards out and the coin pouch is really small and only holds some change.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thank you! :)</li>

            <li> it was adorable</li>
            <li> I love the wallet, just wish it was made better.</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments because it looks absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li> It is a cute wallet.</li>
            <li> so surely nobody should expect to pay 10 bucks for a 100 dollar quality wallet.</li>
            <li> Its cute for the gamer girl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cute! :)</li>
            <li> The red letters on it aren&#x27;t so great but still very cute.</li>
            <li> I love how you can store your most used credit/debit/license cards comfortably along with a couple bills.</li>
            <li> My favorite wallet in the world the material on the card pockets is kinda cheap but the wallet it sooooo cute</li>
            <li> glad it is available...</li>
            <li> She loved it so much.</li>
            <li> It is super cute, but I do wish it came with more pockets</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth every cent I spend! :3</li>
            <li> Other than that this is perfect.</li>
            <li> great product my wife loves anything pikachu and i cant wait for her to open this for christmas : )</li>
            <li> so if I unzip it all the way, the zipper comes off the track and out of the wallet.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that (which is easy to avoid)</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t had any criticisms of it, but I did notice that the ID sleeve doesn&#x27;t have a hole cut in it to allow for easy removal.</li>
            <li> Super cute</li>
            <li> This is a super cute wallet.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been a huge problem yet though.</li>
            <li> the track/zipper itself is made of an extremely light weight and cheap metal....</li>
            <li> Overall great though</li>
            <li> A few marks but wonderful!</li>
            <li> It looked cheap and ripped when I put my cards in.</li>
            <li> However, it is a bit cheaply made...</li>
            <li> So when we got it she was really excited and</li>
            <li> This would be perfect for a young child who is just learning to keep up with money and budget, or someone who is very deeply involved in the pokemon fan culture.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not the best wallet ever made, but then again, it&#x27;s very affordable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cute, arrived early, so glad I have it.</li>
            <li> but if you treat it right it should be fine.</li>
            <li> Every day someone tells me how much the love it.</li>
            <li> but overall she loved it</li>
            <li> if you love him soooo much like I do, then I know you should get this wallet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just absolutely the best wallet because its cute but the card holders are too deep and the glue isn&#x27;t as strong but other than those two flaws</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I love it bought it because I love Pikachu only problem</li>
            <li> The yellow fades very quickly, but it&#x27;s still just as cute.</li>
            <li> The magnet is strong, and with all my gift cards it keeps it nice and closed.</li>
            <li> sure enough where the cards go on the side of it is a huge tear so now</li>
            <li> Worth the price afterall.</li>
            <li> But it is Pokémon, so that is all that matters - right?</li>
            <li> The color and detail of Pikachu were just right according to her.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s made out of some type of satiny plastic product on the outside, so i don&#x27;t have to worry about spills because it&#x27;s extremely easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Super fast.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve only had it a month and so far so good.</li>
            <li> it came too me very neat and very pretty so GET</li>
            <li> SOOO the shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> im giving this one start is my first one came ripped.</li>
            <li> This was one of my first wallets and it came just as shown.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just mine, but the zipper pocket ripped the first day I got it.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for...</li>
            <li> WOW!!!!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t pleased with that due that it is such a cute item.</li>
            <li> I honestly only store quarters in the pouch, because you can&#x27;t put too much in it or it won&#x27;t clip as easily.</li>
            <li> I got this wallet for my fiancee because she really likes Pikachu and her wallet was falling apart.</li>
            <li> The wallet isn&#x27;t put together very well.</li>
            <li> so so much</li>
            <li> She really likes it.  </li>
            <li> I really do like this wallet.</li>
            <li> She absolutely freaked.</li>
            <li> ready ripping but still using it &amp;#62;:D</li>
            <li> and then I have an excuse to buy a new one :)</li>
            <li> But other than that I love it</li>
            <li> I love Pikachu and got this wallet because of it and since my other one was falling apart.</li>
            <li> since I ordered it 4 months ago, switched back to my original wallet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice but it won&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> But, this will be a super cute wallet for at least a couple months</li>
            <li> (There is complete lack of color in Pikachu&#x27;s cheeks which is most noticeable on the interior illustrations, but the color is outside the lines on the outside images-these errors were consistent both times I have bought this wallet)  </li>
            <li> But then you open it up and Pikachu on the inside of the wallet is part white like he wasn&#x27;t colored all the way.. which we found wierd but thought ok thats whatever. .</li>
            <li> The card pockets are super deep and sometimes i get things stuck but</li>
            <li> I love the outside of the item, I just wish that the card holders weren&#x27;t so deep.</li>
            <li> I really love it, but I have to double up cards in their slots because there are only 5 card slots.</li>
            <li> The snap to close is good quality and seems heavy duty and built to last.</li>
            <li> , so I bought this despite the slightly high price ($19.94 with shipping.</li>
            <li> but I feel there should be a little more for all the cards and cash and everything that goes in a wallet.</li>
            <li> This wallet is really cute, but I don&#x27;t think I would use it for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The walllet looks like it wont last long and is more for looks.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t had much better luck with other wallets in the same price range though, so it&#x27;s worth it for the price, especially if you&#x27;re a lifetime Pikachu fan as I am.</li>
            <li> other than that it&#x27;s super rad!</li>
            <li> The liner design is different in some of the wallets and the slightest tug will rip it right</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s brand new and had no defects or anything.</li>
            <li> As a huge Pokemon fan, I had my eye on buying one of these FOREVER and finally caved in and ended up buying one for myself as a birthday present.</li>
            <li> but I think it feel I little cheap made</li>
            <li> A very fun gift for all the little Pokémon fans out there.</li>
            <li> Came in a month early....</li>
            <li> I really like this wallet, though, it is definitely just for looks.</li>
            <li> Then she gets all her cards and stuff from her old wallet and transfers them..</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t fill it completely or it won&#x27;t close</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 16 year old girl</li>
            <li> only problem is that the change pouch and its zipper weren&#x27;t sewn very well</li>
            <li> The second ripped within two days of using it.i was very disapointed.</li>
            <li> The wallet has a soft vinyl feel to it and gets lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very durable as the change pocket zipper came off the tracks on first use and</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the pictures, shipped in faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> only downside is it looks a little cheap</li>
            <li> The change purse part broke very quickly, but it still technically works, even though it ripped (under very little pressure, there wasn&#x27;t even any change in it</li>
            <li> After a while the red cheeks of pikachu starts to wear off but can be fixed.</li>
            <li> I sewed the ends of the zipper into the sides, you can barely notice the stitching...</li>
            <li> Now, not even a month later the zipper completely came off of the wallet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will hold up for years, but for a young lady it should last if taken care of.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s kind of difficult to get them out.</li>
            <li> Love the Pokemon wallet, but the zipper was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> However it started tearing after the first few uses</li>
            <li> Also, the interior coin area is a very cheap material, (almost a thin plastic) that I do not expect to last very long at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute but the problems are that the card slots are too big and I have trouble taking my cards out and the coin pouch is really small and only holds some change.</li>
            <li> a normal sized credit card can slide down and get lost.</li>
            <li> I like long wallets with double dividers and a change pocket!</li>
            <li> It is not as flexible as it could be, so it probably won&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Arrived much earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Whatever material it is made of, attracts dirt extremely quick on the edges and folds, that dirt is then unable to be cleaned off and will remain on the wallet and look similar to a smudge of graphite from a pencil.</li>
            <li> her cards  can fall out when the wallet is open, she still uses the wallet because she really likes it, but is disappointed it ripped on the first day.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little too deep.</li>
            <li> The material is flimsy, the pockets make it hard to get the cards out, and the Pikachu faces are missing some coloring or red circles completely.</li>
            <li> Also not a whole lot of card space.</li>
            <li> Item arrived when expected.</li>
            <li> Have noticed that it definitely isn&#x27;t meant to hold a lot; with a few gift cards, cash and coins in it the snap had difficulty closing.</li>
            <li> I do still like this wallet a lot, due to</li>
            <li> Purchased for teen daughter who was past elated to receive for her birthday.  </li>
            <li> A note we paid close attention to from other reviews.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed y the quality but its cute</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard getting my cards out the pockets because they are too deep</li>
            <li> As I was switching to this wallet I was unzipping the inside to store a few loose coins, and the fabric ripped!</li>
            <li> The inside liner behind the card slots came out completely after pulling my cards out.</li>
            <li> It had some little dark spot on it.</li>
            <li> Did hold up for a little while until it started to fall apart.</li>
            <li> The coin purse fabric is a little flimsy, but for the price and look</li>
            <li> the change pouch tore at the seam within a few weeks of having it.</li>
            <li> Hands down!!</li>
            <li> This is a very dull yellow not bright as pictured.  </li>
            <li> The lining is a little delicate</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s plenty of pockets but the change pocket is in a weird, hard to reach little pocket inside of a larger pocket.</li>
            <li> Usually my wallets end up broke  by 5 months</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m unbelievably upset, but I guess you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> no more carryiny money in hand.</li>
            <li> It seems not authentic.  </li>
            <li> Only thing that was bad was that the paint peeled off a little on the edges other then that its just the way it says it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not a very good product.</li>
            <li> I had a really hard time getting it out.</li>
            <li> only thing that was disappointing was the side pockets where you put your credit cards in are not sealed correctly so your cards can sometimes slide all the way to the bottom of the wallet.</li>
            <li> Buy this and skip the expensive leather designer wallets.  </li>
            <li> This wallet was a disappointment..</li>
            <li> and I had to practically ruin the inside of my wallet to get them out. :(</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Item as listed.  Very satisfied!  Will order from this seller again!!</li>
            <li> Came in a month early....looks so great I love it so much in very good condition I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Everyone needs to have this.  Pikachu is a bright point whenever you have to get money.  Buy this and skip the expensive leather designer wallets.  This one brings smiles.</li>
            <li> The most magical wallet to exist. Every day someone tells me how much the love it. The lining is a little delicate but if you treat it right it should be fine.</li>
            <li> Going through a bit of a Pikachu obbession and I needed a wallet anyways, so I bought this despite the slightly high price ($19.94 with shipping. 20 bucks for a plastic wallet.) buttt, it&#x27;s Pikachu. I love how you can store your most used credit/debit/license cards comfortably along with a couple bills. I honestly only store quarters in the pouch, because you can&#x27;t put too much in it or it won&#x27;t clip as easily. Also, it&#x27;s made out of some type of satiny plastic product on the outside, so i don&#x27;t have to worry about spills because it&#x27;s extremely easy to clean. BUT, it is still the cutest wallet out there and has multiple uses. I love it. Worth the price afterall.</li>
            <li> great product my wife loves anything pikachu and i cant wait for her to open this for christmas : )</li>
            <li> The pikachu wallet is so cute! It matches my pikachu necklace nicely. The quality is great and if your a pokemon fan then this is a must have!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product, it is adorable. The yellow fades very quickly, but it&#x27;s still just as cute. The change purse part broke very quickly, but it still technically works, even though it ripped (under very little pressure, there wasn&#x27;t even any change in it, I was just unzipping it to PUT change in). Honestly, even with it&#x27;s flaws it is still my favorite wallet I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! I&#x27;ve had it for a year and it&#x27;s still in perfect condition. Everytime I go to the store people point it out. It&#x27;s super cute! :)</li>
            <li> I really like this wallet, though, it is definitely just for looks. I&#x27;ve bought this item TWICE from two different sellers, and yes, overall- it is VERY, VERY, cheaply made. However, for the price and shipping...you get what you pay for. To give finer detail of it&#x27;s quality- It&#x27;s not very durable as the change pocket zipper came off the tracks on first use and the track/zipper itself is made of an extremely light weight and cheap metal....possibly aluminum. The inside liner behind the card slots came out completely after pulling my cards out. Whatever material it is made of, attracts dirt extremely quick on the edges and folds, that dirt is then unable to be cleaned off and will remain on the wallet and look similar to a smudge of graphite from a pencil. Several spots on the wallet are improperly colored or colored outside of the lines. (There is complete lack of color in Pikachu&#x27;s cheeks which is most noticeable on the interior illustrations, but the color is outside the lines on the outside images-these errors were consistent both times I have bought this wallet)  The liner design is different in some of the wallets and the slightest tug will rip it right out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I do still like this wallet a lot, due to it&#x27;s novelty. I carry two wallets now.</li>
            <li> I bought it for myself and I love it. The red letters on it aren&#x27;t so great but still very cute. I would recommend it for anyone that knows someone that loves cute wallets and Pokemon!</li>
            <li> I got this wallet for my fiancee because she really likes Pikachu and her wallet was falling apart. So when we got it she was really excited and at first it looked great! But then you open it up and Pikachu on the inside of the wallet is part white like he wasn&#x27;t colored all the way.. which we found wierd but thought ok thats whatever. . Then she gets all her cards and stuff from her old wallet and transfers them.. on the 8th card she tells me the wallet ripped.. and sure enough where the cards go on the side of it is a huge tear so now her cards  can fall out when the wallet is open, she still uses the wallet because she really likes it, but is disappointed it ripped on the first day. The hole hasn&#x27;t causes many issues as of yet. . But is still concerning because all of her cards can fall through it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really cute but the problems are that the card slots are too big and I have trouble taking my cards out and the coin pouch is really small and only holds some change. But other than that I love it and I don&#x27;t regret buying it ❤</li>
            <li> Gave this to my niece for Christmas and she freaked out with happiness! She loved it so much. A very fun gift for all the little Pokémon fans out there.</li>
            <li> The wallet was absolutely amazing . Its adorable and nothing was wrong with it in any way . I was completely satisfied .</li>
            <li> Great wallet. Only thing that was bad was that the paint peeled off a little on the edges other then that its just the way it says it is.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved it but I think it feel I little cheap made but overall she loved it so I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> Did hold up for a little while until it started to fall apart. Wasn&#x27;t pleased with that due that it is such a cute item.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Has many compartments and is adorable. I&#x27;ve had it about a month and it is still in good shape. A great buy!</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick. It came sooner than I thought it would. Usually my wallets end up broke  by 5 months but this one is sturdy and holds a lot of stuff. You can&#x27;t fill it completely or it won&#x27;t close</li>
            <li> Zipper in pocket came defective, that&#x27;s what I get for buying made in China!!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS DAMN WALLET!!!! This is my momma&#x27;s account. I&#x27;m a 16 year old girl and I just UGGGHHH I love this wallet. The shipping came faster than the estimated delivery date. It just came today on Thursday, June 26, 2014 and the estimated Delivery date was July 9 - July 25, 2014. SOOO the shipping was very fast. I order it on June 11, 2014 and I got it like 15 days VERY FAST SHIPPING FROM A PACKAGE FROM CHINA!!! Super fast. When I got it .. I just fell in love with it. I just love it. If you a big Pikachu fan and if you love him soooo much like I do, then I know you should get this wallet. I sooooooo recommend this wallet!!  AHHHHH I LOVE IT! 😍💕💙</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, the wallet is super cute, got it for my girlfriend and she loves it and uses it daily</li>
            <li> The wallet isn&#x27;t put together very well. The zippered pocket on the inside isn&#x27;t attached to the sides of the wallet and the zipper doesn&#x27;t stay on its tracks. It&#x27;s just not a very good product.</li>
            <li> This wallet deserves all stars it is cute, not to big and perfect for anyone looking for a gift.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is it looks a little cheap but hey wallets aren&#x27;t going to last forever.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely will recommend.</li>
            <li> Too Perfect~! I get compliments all the time on how cute it is. The magnet is strong, and with all my gift cards it keeps it nice and closed. The card pockets are super deep and sometimes i get things stuck but other than that it&#x27;s super rad! I still have it.</li>
            <li> but only thing is that the pocket broke well the rest is in good shape :D</li>
            <li> The zipper fell off and the seam ripped in just one day of using it. Very disappointed. Wish it would have stayed together.</li>
            <li> I love this wallet. Its super cute and great for holding a lot of cards. It even has a change pouch,&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that the change pouch and its zipper weren&#x27;t sewn very well so if I unzip it all the way, the zipper comes off the track and out of the wallet.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that (which is easy to avoid) it is a good wallet ^-^</li>
            <li> This wallet was a disappointment.. It came apart after only two weeks of use</li>
            <li> Superrrrr cute canr wait to go out and show it off :) i love pikachu and i love collecting pika stuff</li>
            <li> I loved this wallet and so did everyone whom seen it. Reason im giving this one start is my first one came ripped. Went through amazon got it replaced. The second ripped within two days of using it.i was very disapointed. Wallet looks great but very cheapie made.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!! I love Pikachu so so so much it&#x27;s so awesome I adore and obesse over Pikachu more than anything i love collecting Pikachu stuff whatever it may be if you love Pikachu you should get this it came too me very neat and very pretty so GET THIS IF YOU LOVE POKEMON PIKACHU guys it&#x27;s worth every cent I spend! :3</li>
            <li> Great wallet. Super cute and there&#x27;s plenty of pockets but the change pocket is in a weird, hard to reach little pocket inside of a larger pocket. Also not a whole lot of card space. There&#x27;s a lot of space but I feel there should be a little more for all the cards and cash and everything that goes in a wallet. Otherwise, perfect though!</li>
            <li> I love the outside of the item, I just wish that the card holders weren&#x27;t so deep. The top card holder reaches all the way to the bottom of the wallet so I am unable to use it.</li>
            <li> I like long wallets with double dividers and a change pocket! I really love it, but I have to double up cards in their slots because there are only 5 card slots. It would be better id it lit up ;) really is nearly perfect</li>
            <li> She really likes it.  It is not as flexible as it could be, so it probably won&#x27;t last very long.  But it is Pokémon, so that is all that matters - right?</li>
            <li> got this for my sister and she loves it, people always ask her where she got it too, very good buy for someone who likes Pokemon</li>
            <li> Item arrived when expected. Matches photos and descriptions.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my 11y.o daughter who loves Pokemon. Honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t mind one of my own. Great transaction, great product!</li>
            <li> Best buy here on amazon! This was one of my first wallets and it came just as shown. After a while the red cheeks of pikachu starts to wear off but can be fixed. I recommend this wallet to anyone and everyone!</li>
            <li> This wallet is really cute, but I don&#x27;t think I would use it for everyday use. I took it to Vegas for EDC and when they asked for my ID I had a really hard time getting it out. Also, my credit and debit cards kept getting stuck and I had to practically ruin the inside of my wallet to get them out. :(</li>
            <li> I love pikachu but some of the design started peeling but I would definately buy this again!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cute, arrived early, so glad I have it. The coin purse fabric is a little flimsy, but for the price and look I think it&#x27;s a good trade. I sewed the ends of the zipper into the sides, you can barely notice the stitching...now I don&#x27;t have problems with it. Lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> Wallet looked used when received but serves it&#x27;s purpose</li>
            <li> This is absolutely a necessary buy!! Best wallet ever!! Hands down!! been getting props on it no stop!!!  Great product &amp; made well ;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I gave this as a surprise present to my GF, and she loves it! It&#x27;s certainly not the best wallet ever made, but then again, it&#x27;s very affordable. She hasn&#x27;t had any criticisms of it, but I did notice that the ID sleeve doesn&#x27;t have a hole cut in it to allow for easy removal. Overall great though</li>
            <li> Purchased for teen daughter who was past elated to receive for her birthday.  We&#x27;ve only had it a month and so far so good. The color and detail of Pikachu were just right according to her.  Have noticed that it definitely isn&#x27;t meant to hold a lot; with a few gift cards, cash and coins in it the snap had difficulty closing. A note we paid close attention to from other reviews. However, when snap closes it does hold. Hopeful wallet holds out.</li>
            <li> I love my wallet it&#x27;s perfect. It&#x27;s brand new and had no defects or anything. No shipping damage or flaws. Great price and fast shipping. Everything was perfect. Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> As a huge Pokemon fan, I had my eye on buying one of these FOREVER and finally caved in and ended up buying one for myself as a birthday present. Upon opening the package, I took immediate notice that this product was VERY, VERY, VERY cheaply made. But still over all cute. As I was switching to this wallet I was unzipping the inside to store a few loose coins, and the fabric ripped! I looked over this. Now, not even a month later the zipper completely came off of the wallet. I&#x27;m unbelievably upset, but I guess you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Bought this wallet for my bestfriend for her birthday and I know shes going to love it ^.~ it&#x27;s really a cute wallet and looks even better in person</li>
            <li> Used. A few marks but wonderful!</li>
            <li> Wallet is adorable and looks and feels of good quality. great for pokemon fans!</li>
            <li> My favorite wallet in the world the material on the card pockets is kinda cheap but the wallet it sooooo cute I get so many compliments on how adorable it is lol pikachu is still my fav and im 20 :)</li>
            <li> It looked cheap and ripped when I put my cards in.</li>
            <li> I love Pikachu and got this wallet because of it and since my other one was falling apart. However it started tearing after the first few uses and I have had to invesst time into repairing it. The card pockets are also deep, like your credit cards would get lost in it. Other than that this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I really do like this wallet. It has plenty of compartments for your cards and cash, and I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on it while shopping. However, it is a bit cheaply made...the change pouch tore at the seam within a few weeks of having it. Also sometimes the cards get stuck in the slots and it&#x27;s kind of difficult to get them out. I really haven&#x27;t had much better luck with other wallets in the same price range though, so it&#x27;s worth it for the price, especially if you&#x27;re a lifetime Pikachu fan as I am.</li>
            <li> Arrived much earlier than expected. This is a super cute wallet. It has plenty of room. I would like to note that the card slots are a bit TOO big. a normal sized credit card can slide down and get lost. Also, the interior coin area is a very cheap material, (almost a thin plastic) that I do not expect to last very long at all.But, this will be a super cute wallet for at least a couple months and then I have an excuse to buy a new one :)</li>
            <li> I very happy with the product and the service, and it was delivered when promised.</li>
            <li> Great quality! Fast shipping! My girlfriend loved it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just get it is cute and handy :)</li>
            <li> I am a girl who likes things that are a bit stronger. The walllet looks like it wont last long and is more for looks. It is super cute, but I do wish it came with more pockets</li>
            <li> it was adorable an the material made for it  is good. Good for putting my money in and some cards.</li>
            <li> I really liked this wallet! its adorable! only thing that was disappointing was the side pockets where you put your credit cards in are not sealed correctly so your cards can sometimes slide all the way to the bottom of the wallet. It hasn&#x27;t been a huge problem yet though.</li>
            <li> Verry well put together, perfect for the poke fanatic girl.if you have anyone that loves pokemon like my daughter, its a perfect gift.</li>
            <li> Cute! i like the way it looks because it does not look like everything they sell in the stores,</li>
            <li> If you like pikachus and need a place to hold your money then look no farther, this is the perfect wallet for you. There are pikachus on every side of the wallet and in all different poses. The snap to close is good quality and seems heavy duty and built to last. The wallet has a soft vinyl feel to it and gets lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> Very cute, but cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;Also, my cards constantly get stuck in the pockets where they&#x27;re meant to be kept.&lt;br /&gt;But, the cuteness makes up for it I suppose lol I&#x27;ve had many compliments on my wallet :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the cutest wallet I own, I love it! Brings back child hood memories every time I see it. I totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> Super cute holds lots of cards cash and change love it!!</li>
            <li> its a good size wallet but the plastic on the inside and the zipper broke away so I cannot keep change in it and the credit card holders also ripped away  got it for chirstmas it lasted me about a month</li>
            <li> The price was perfect and my daughter loved it...glad it is available...no more carryiny money in hand. Thank you tons</li>
            <li> Got this as a present for my friend when I saw it. She absolutely freaked. Squealed, hugged, kissed. There&#x27;s a picture of me somewhere showcasing a girl&#x27;s wallet on the internet.</li>
            <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s a good and absolutely CUTE wallet. I have, since I ordered it 4 months ago, switched back to my original wallet. I don&#x27;t like that my cards keep getting stuck inside the card slots. They&#x27;re a little too deep. This would be perfect for a young child who is just learning to keep up with money and budget, or someone who is very deeply involved in the pokemon fan culture.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like the pictures, shipped in faster than I expected. It had some little dark spot on it. However very happy with my wallet anyways</li>
            <li> A little disappointed y the quality but its cute</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, very nice.</li>
            <li> This is a very dull yellow not bright as pictured.  I would not recommend purchasing this product.  It seems not authentic.  My granddaughter probably won&#x27;t care.  LOL</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece and she loved it!</li>
            <li> Love the Pokemon wallet, but the zipper was broken when I received it. But oh well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was just mine, but the zipper pocket ripped the first day I got it. I love the wallet, just wish it was made better. I&#x27;m sending it back.</li>
            <li> I love it bought it because I love Pikachu only problem it&#x27;s hard getting my cards out the pockets because they are too deep and they get stuck in the folds</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just absolutely the best wallet because its cute but the card holders are too deep and the glue isn&#x27;t as strong but other than those two flaws it is a nice wallet and has nice coin pouch and a strong magnet to hold it all in place</li>
            <li> As much as I would like to say this wallet is perfect, it has many flaws. The material is flimsy, the pockets make it hard to get the cards out, and the Pikachu faces are missing some coloring or red circles completely. It&#x27;s nice but it won&#x27;t last too long. I&#x27;ll have to find a replacement soon. Still, I&#x27;ve gotten tons of compliments because it looks absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for...it made the perfect gift for my friend:) She  and I loved it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a gift. It is a cute wallet. I was worried bc of some comments, but I honestly don&#x27;t see a problem with it. You do get what you pay for so surely nobody should expect to pay 10 bucks for a 100 dollar quality wallet. If you do then that&#x27;s your mistake. Its cute for the gamer girl. I don&#x27;t think it will hold up for years, but for a young lady it should last if taken care of.</li>
            <li> ready ripping but still using it &amp;#62;:D</li>
