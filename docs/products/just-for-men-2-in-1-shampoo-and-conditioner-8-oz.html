    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is an excellent shampoo for all men.  </li>
            <li>Just For Men&amp;#34; (2 in 1)  Shampoo/Conditioner was the perfect companion to &amp;#34;Just For Men&amp;#34; (Hair Coloring and conditioning)</li>
            <li>This is an excellent shampoo.</li>
            <li>We think this is a great shampoo for mens color treated hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an excellent product no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>good product considering me being allergic to this kind of stuff, and it does maintain the color of your hair.</li>
            <li>You can even call me a lying bonehead that cost you more money, if it pleases, as well.  :p</li>
            <li>nice to have a shampoo that&#x27;s not too harse of colored hair, just wish</li>
            <li>So why did the Just For Men company, cancel this wonderful product back in 2009?</li>
            <li>, glad I found it here</li>
            <li>How many bottles do you get for $25.00?  </li>
            <li>Great for those with colored hair or natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Hair feels clean and is easy to style.</li>
            <li>since it was 4 times the cost of original price when available</li>
            <li>There were some concerns over this purchase and all my questions were responded to quickly and with professionalism.</li>
            <li>I finally found the shampoo that I liked to use with the Just For Men hair coloring products and they discontinue it.  </li>
            <li>Cleans and has just a right amount of conditioner.</li>
            <li>Good shampoo, no longer made by manufacturer, but one would need to have Alzheimer&#x27;s to pay $40 for what used to sell for less than $5.</li>
            <li>I found that this product cleans your hair, keeps the color, has a fresh scent, and conditions the hair so that the hair has more body and luster than other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>There is no other shampoo that stays with your original color/conditioning like &amp;#34;Just For Men&amp;#34; (2 in 1)</li>
            <li>And  I REALLY like the product.</li>
            <li>Allows color to last longer and look more natural.  </li>
            <li>The product was not any superior to other similar products but the price was very unreasonable.</li>
            <li>This is not a miracle product by any means, but I prefer the simple shampooing - which I&#x27;d daily perform anyway - to the more frequent dye usage, which is somewhat tedious on the best days.  </li>
            <li>It makes no sense to me.&amp;#34; They should know how many men still buy the existing product that’s still out there, and put it back out on the market as soon as possible!</li>
            <li>Since purchasing this product in August, I have found that the 3 1/2 weeks of color (in my experience), provided by the Just For Men hair dye, gets an extra week to ten days of strong hues before greying toward normal.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t leave hair very soft</li>
            <li>Recommended by both my barber and a young fellow in a drugstore.  </li>
            <li>My husband uses the hair color and this shampoo is not harsh on it and the color lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>I have searched high and low online and can&#x27;t find it anywhere.  </li>

            <li> This is an excellent shampoo for all men.  Cleans and has just a right amount of conditioner. Hair feels clean and is easy to style.Only need to lather and rinse once. Doesn&#x27;t smell like women&#x27;s shampoo.  Great for those with colored hair or natural hair.  Recommended by both my barber and a young fellow in a drugstore.  Very poorly promoted by the company whose main target is men who color their hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before while using the color product.  I found that this product cleans your hair, keeps the color, has a fresh scent, and conditions the hair so that the hair has more body and luster than other shampoos.  I have found only a few places that still carry the product.</li>
            <li> Shampoo works as advertised.  Does not strip color.  Enhances color.  Allows color to last longer and look more natural.  Very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Just For Men&amp;#34; (2 in 1)  Shampoo/Conditioner was the perfect companion to &amp;#34;Just For Men&amp;#34; (Hair Coloring and conditioning) There is no other shampoo that stays with your original color/conditioning like &amp;#34;Just For Men&amp;#34; (2 in 1) So why did the Just For Men company, cancel this wonderful product back in 2009?

The only other company I have found to do things like this is Sony. If it isn’t broke do not fix it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an excellent product no longer available in stores. And  I REALLY like the product. However I feel it&#x27;s waaaaaaaaaaay overpriced !!!</li>
            <li> Since purchasing this product in August, I have found that the 3 1/2 weeks of color (in my experience), provided by the Just For Men hair dye, gets an extra week to ten days of strong hues before greying toward normal.

            <li> We think this is a great shampoo for mens color treated hair.  My husband uses the hair color and this shampoo is not harsh on it and the color lasts longer.  Impossible to find this in the store, glad I found it here</li>
            <li> The product was not any superior to other similar products but the price was very unreasonable. At this price I will buy Infusion Colorologie</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shampoo. Unfortunately, it is very hard to find an expensive to boot...Just for men should not discontinue this product.....</li>
            <li> There were some concerns over this purchase and all my questions were responded to quickly and with professionalism. The items purchased arrived on time. I would definitely deal with this vendor again.</li>
            <li> good product considering me being allergic to this kind of stuff, and it does maintain the color of your hair.</li>
            <li> How many bottles do you get for $25.00?  Five?  Six?  Doesn&#x27;t say.  I previously purchased at Walgreens for $4 or $5 each.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo, no longer made by manufacturer, but one would need to have Alzheimer&#x27;s to pay $40 for what used to sell for less than $5.</li>
            <li> too expensive for just 1 bottle.  since it was 4 times the cost of original price when available I thought there might be 4 bottles&lt;br /&gt;wouldnt purchase again</li>
            <li> I finally found the shampoo that I liked to use with the Just For Men hair coloring products and they discontinue it.  Why?  I have searched high and low online and can&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I&#x27;m in the USA and I did find it in Australia but I&#x27;m not going to pay the outrageous shipping charge to order shampoo.  Curses to you JFM for cancelling this product!!</li>
            <li> nice to have a shampoo that&#x27;s not too harse of colored hair, just wish&lt;br /&gt;it would help with dandruff control also.  doesn&#x27;t leave hair very soft</li>
