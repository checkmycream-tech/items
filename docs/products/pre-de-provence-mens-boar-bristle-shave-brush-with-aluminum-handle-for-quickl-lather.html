            <li>Paired with a Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Razor, I experienced the closest shave ever.  </li>

            <li>Lather is good, and I will order this again when it&#x27;s used up.</li>
            <li>I suppose but about as good as any shaving soap</li>
            <li>Soaked the brush for 10 minutes in the bowl, then swirled it on the soap for a good 90 seconds.</li>
            <li>He said it is a thirsty soap and has a good lather.</li>
            <li>I tested it with a cartridge razor and it works just as good.  </li>
            <li>Excellent lather and fantastic slickness.</li>
            <li>It is a triple milled soap from France and makes good lather.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll get a brush and see how good that does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband loved his stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>Truly loved by my fiance.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use cologne because the smell is so good.</li>
            <li>Softens the beard and smells good too.  </li>
            <li>My face fells really good after the shave.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>Very pleasant fragrance, lathers quickly and foams very nicely (with my Badger hair brush).  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best performing soap I&#x27;ve ever used, or the best scent, but it is a solid performer and a good value.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to many great shaves with this one.</li>
            <li>Provides great lather and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read sage and rosemary as descriptions, but to me, it smelled kind of like a good bath soap ought to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice scent and good shave.  </li>
            <li>It makes a wonderful lather, with a light floral scent that is surprisingly refreshing.</li>
            <li>This soap can take a lot more water than you might think, and the additional water helps the soap produce a rich lather that is one of the best I have used to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent, while pleasant, isn&#x27;t my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It has a lovely light floral kind of scent that is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product, whip shave soap with pleasant, soft aroma.</li>
            <li>price / performance / smell just make it an amazing product.</li>
            <li>but the Trufitt&amp;hill is an amazing shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Amazon does a great job letting me know if a GM Starter will fit my car, if the ink I want fits my printer.</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance</li>
            <li>tried this soap on a whim looks nice, fancy name, it&#x27;s from France</li>
            <li>Nice tin container for travel.  </li>
            <li>and while your at it add the matching shea butter ASB as it is wonderful as well and compliments the great scent of this soap while further moisturizing your skin.</li>
            <li>It is nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>The blade glides effortlessly and give me a nice shave</li>
            <li>Nice scent, smooth, leaves skin feelin great.</li>
            <li>face feels nice and moisturized after shaving, probably an effect of the shea butter.</li>
            <li>nice lather.</li>
            <li>I have to mix it with another shave gel although it foams quite nicely .</li>
            <li>Smell, comes in a nice tin, leaves my skin feeling softer than Praso.  </li>
            <li>Just what you need for a nice shave.</li>
            <li>Love it -- lathers well and smells good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is mild and not overpowering, the lather is perfect for shaving, and the tin is fine for storage and use (no need to take it out to drop it into another container).</li>
            <li>Nonetheless the scent is very mild and many find it great.  </li>
            <li>I found no issues getting a good lather easily.</li>
            <li>It does not clog up my razor while shaving and rinses off my face and brush very easily.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very light, Pine-ish kind of.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought the badger brush and this combo gets a nice lather and the scent is mild but pleasant.</li>
            <li>and I was really surprised how wonderful it was.</li>
            <li>It is a great product for those of us who enjoy a warm comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>This is one of the most moisturizing soaps I own.</li>
            <li>If you like a smooth razor shave, I would recommend this shaving soap with a good boar hair shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Nice screw top aluminum container.  </li>
            <li>However, while the packaging is nice, I do not get an enjoyable shave.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>it is my first time to try a shaving soup and it was perfect for me the smooth the density the creaming and the smell</li>
            <li>and I get a very clean, nice shave.</li>
            <li>It can fit in the palm of your hand and has a wider opening than a cup and it heats up soaking in warm water and keeps the lather warm.)</li>
            <li>To me a good shaving soap should meet three criteria: lather up quickly with a brush, have a silky smooth lather, and smell good.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic, has a nice clean scent that is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li>Rinses off cleanly and has great moisturizing properties that leave your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very light</li>
            <li>The scent is very light upon applying.  </li>
            <li>Scent isn&#x27;t overpowering which is very important to me.</li>
            <li>It also lathers very quickly and smells nice.</li>
            <li>Upon first opening the tin you are greeted with a fresh herbal scent that is very pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure glad I heeded all of your recommendations and ordered this shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Not a horrible soap, but i&#x27;ve seen so many more that were better, so save your money.</li>
            <li>I have been using this shaving soap for many years.  </li>
            <li>I used this soap mostly when traveling since it has a screw top</li>
            <li>It lathers up ok.  </li>
            <li>I matched it against my favorite and it came up obviously second best in terms of lubrication, whisker pull and closeness of shave.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t think i will find a better one</li>
            <li>I love this shaving soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m on sold on it :)</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t ask for a better shave soap.</li>
            <li>It is kind to the skin, stands up a beard very well and smells good.  </li>
            <li>This is still my favorite shave soap/cream I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>and I have a dozen or so soaps and creams I rotate out when I do shave but even after 2 years this is still the soap I reach for the most.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing about it is the smell.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, I will rely on the Amazon community to let me know if they have a favorite shea butter soap that fits my muy</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>What I like about Pre de Provence better.  </li>
            <li>What I like about Praso better.  </li>
            <li>, I get a great shave with it very close and no weepers.  </li>
            <li>Probably my favorite shaving soap.</li>
            <li>Any one of these is sure to please.</li>
            <li>product has many rave reviews, but to me it is just an OK soap.</li>
            <li>and I love the aroma.</li>
            <li>Works so much better than shave creme.</li>
            <li>I like this soap (I love the after shave balm)</li>
            <li>Pre de Provence ranks right up there with the best, and I have really been enjoying my shaves with this soap.</li>
            <li>so it must be good right?  </li>
            <li>We love the nice clean scent too.</li>
            <li>First thing you&#x27;ll notice is that it has a very nice smell, fairly strong, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Pre de Provence shaving soap has an aroma that&#x27;s clean and kind of soapy.  </li>
            <li>Lathers up very easy and has a light scent.</li>
            <li>Then I move to a ceramic bowl pre-heated with water where I quickly work up a beautiful lather that stays hot in the bowl.</li>
            <li>This soap provides a good lather and a good shave, my skin feels soft and smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>First the good news.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good</li>
            <li>The Pre de Provence soap is not cheap but it is good, very good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my original tin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many soaps that are just way to strong a smell.</li>
            <li>It comes in a nice tin, lathers well, and provides a smooth, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Works great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It lubricates effectively and rinses quickly leaving my skin feeling healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li>This builds up a nice lather quickly, smells nice, and doesnt have an overly powerful or lingering smell.</li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasant but does not linger long and will not interfere with any aftershave you might want to use afterward.  </li>
            <li>This soap lathers up very nicely on my badger brush with soft water.  </li>
            <li>Just a dab of the stuff creates a rich and satisfying foam.</li>
            <li>Think of a SIGNIFICANTLY toned-down Arko with slightly more of an herbal tone.</li>
            <li>It is a generously sized soap in an excellent tin which will be used for other soaps once this is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Equally great for those experienced and new to double edge shaving.</li>
            <li>; a better description would be soapy &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li>The lather is easy to create.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lathering is easy if you start with a dryer brush.</li>
            <li>This Shave soap is a great buy, especially if you are looking for a soap with a light scent, good lathering, and is will last you for a good number of</li>
            <li>Easy to load and lather.</li>
            <li>Lathers easily.</li>
            <li>No an easy trick for a guy in his sixties.</li>
            <li>It lathers fairly easily, but the lather isn&#x27;t all that moisturizing</li>
            <li>The scent is strong but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>The scent is still just as strong as the day I bought it</li>
            <li>It also reminds me strongly of something my grandfather used to use.</li>
            <li>This is a classic product for good reason.</li>
            <li>It is a fairly strong scented soap, but not to the point of being cloying or obtrusive.  </li>
            <li>Price wise, it&#x27;s a decent value for a quality product.  </li>
            <li>Shea butter&#x27;s amazing skin care and healing properties were first harnessed thousands of years ago.</li>
            <li>AoS Sandlewood while I liked it at first</li>
            <li>This shave soap requires very little for a nice lather, so it a very good value.  </li>
            <li>It lathers up real nice, is not too strongly scented, and creates a nice slick layer allowing the razor to glide.  </li>
            <li>I used distilled water and my Fine Silvertip Badger brush for lathering.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it works out fine factoring in the time.</li>
            <li>And the tin itself is really cheap and dents easily</li>
            <li>Makes fine lather.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to get a creamy and smooth lather with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He says that it makes a great lather and does not dry his face.</li>
            <li>This soap has quickly become one of my favorites!</li>
            <li>This is a large puck of soap, over five ounces, and the tin is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>It was a nice lather in terms of not drying out your skin, however it lost much of it&#x27;s consistency soon after applying it to my face.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>This was after it was properly lathered and applied as an experienced soap shaver would.</li>
            <li>it was fantastic i was shaving with cremes and gels products</li>
            <li>Light scent of Soap.  </li>
            <li>I have to say I enjoy this soap.</li>
            <li>The scent, as I&#x27;ve said, is light.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s light and airy.</li>
            <li>Also, this product doesn&#x27;t make my skin tighten up like I&#x27;d been sunburned like some of the cheap stuff has.</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous shave soap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap for several months now, and it does the job great.  </li>
            <li>Great product overall.</li>
            <li>Works best with a double edge or straight edge razor.  </li>
            <li>Makes a great lather and has a subtle, but pleasant smell that will not make you smell like your grandfather.</li>
            <li>this soap is just plain amazing !!!!</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s animal friendly (if that&#x27;s important to you);</li>
            <li>The lather builds quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Builds lather quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Lathers easily and rinses quickly.</li>
            <li>Scent is pretty good as well -- some reviews described it as &amp;#34;soapy,&amp;#34; but I didn&#x27;t find that to really be the case.</li>
            <li>I worked my lather from the tin it comes in, took my well-soaked boar bristle brush and only had to swirl it 5-6 times to get sufficient lather to make three shaving passes comfortably ( If you use a shaving cup trying whipping up the soap in it to get an even better lather).I really enjoyed using this soap and would gladly order it again.</li>
            <li>It smells very fresh and clean in the tin.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very fresh, clean, and botanical with a sweetness akin to bananas.  </li>
            <li>I use this to shave my legs, and it has a very clean and pleasant smell that is not feminine or masculine really, it just smells clean.  </li>
            <li>I have no problems lathering this soap -- it practically throws itself onto my brush -- and it provides an excellent, slick shave with plenty of cushion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have not noticed any drop off in the quality of the lather even with my original tin.</li>
            <li>** Original Review</li>
            <li>Easy to lather and a clean and fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>It works into a good lather and the razor slides real easy and slick on my face (using a Gillette Fusion).</li>
            <li>Very nice fragrance, a calm sage/herb scent that I keep coming back to.</li>
            <li>and I still love this stuff just as much as the day I wrote the original review.</li>
            <li>Pre de Provence will definatly find it&#x27;s way into my regular rotation along side my beloved Tabac and TOBS.</li>
            <li>find that once you&#x27;ve got a good lather with this soap, it will provide enough lubrication to allow your razor to glide across your skin.</li>
            <li>But again it wasn&#x27;t an issue for me because while the lather wasn&#x27;t as good, the actual shave was.</li>
            <li>It creates mounds of luxurious creamy lather with a light fresh smell with just a minimum of effort.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a quality shave soap for a good price</li>
            <li>He said it leaves his skin soft and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>it still should last you a good while.  </li>
            <li>It has a light fragrance to it that is pleasant but not powerful, and leaves my skin feeling smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li>This soap lathers easily and provides a very close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>Not only is it a delicious smelling soap, but also it&#x27;s incredibly easy to load and lather, performs beautifully with regards to glide and cushion, and leaves my face feeling supple and smooth...not dry and tight as some soaps can.  </li>
            <li>It protects as well as any I&#x27;ve tried, lathers great, and smells good (a lot of soaps fall down on this last one).  </li>
            <li>If you like mild or unscented soaps, you may want to pass on this one.</li>
            <li>Mild scent.</li>
            <li>This is my second favorite (MWF is my favorite).  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this shave soap, and I will definitely buy this again in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gave me a very comfortable shave with a new [[ASIN:B001QY8QXM Astra SP blade]], and no irritation of a problem area on my neck.</li>
            <li>My first experience with a French shaving soap has been a pleasant one.  </li>
            <li>I used this on my honeymoon in Jamaica and since it was very hot and humid, I had no issues.  </li>
            <li>nice subtle kind of herbal aroma, not too strong.</li>
            <li>It works better than my normal can shaving cream with my DE razor.</li>
            <li>So happy to find it on line for less without driving 100 miles to purchase it.</li>
            <li>The soap is easy on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave much residue on the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s stainless and cleans easy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why this has so many good reviews???</li>
            <li>They were right, the smell is incredible, and although long lasting, very mild.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering but strong enough to make enjoyable.</li>
            <li>It produces a thick lather easily and shaves great.  </li>
            <li>It is way to large to fit into my [[ASIN:B000FIH8XO Edwin Jagger Rn46</li>
            <li>They have a Green Tea style that is equally great.</li>
            <li>The post-shave experience is lightly moisturizing and leaves your face feeling very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried a ton of shave soaps and this one wins on all counts.</li>
            <li>Makes a nice later and my razor glides across my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using Taylor of Old Bond Street -- which is really more of a cream than a soap -- for years.  </li>
            <li>so definitely this will be my ideal shaving soup because i will try several</li>
            <li>It was pretty cool that my face wasn&#x27;t irritated after shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my favorite shaving soap / cream I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>You simply won&#x27;t get that kind of performance with a shaving soap.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s absolutely worth giving it a shot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is worth noting that this soap is about 25 percent shea butter.  </li>
            <li>Not too strong and it provide good slick protection on your face.</li>
            <li>Most of us have 10-15 different soaps (admit that you really enjoy trying other soaps as well).This soap smells great, produces a good lather, and gives you a slick shave.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of other soaps and none are as good as this one.</li>
            <li>It will be right at home.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced the shea butter is really doing anything special, but the soap doesn&#x27;t disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice thick lather that is very stable and gives a really nice amount of slickness and protection.</li>
            <li>Great scent - very green.</li>
            <li>Rich, thick lather, pleasant scent</li>
            <li>exactly that right size is a plus for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Real nice triple milled hard shaving soap!</li>
            <li>Not only was it a close, smooth shave, but it was extremely comfortable.  </li>
            <li>slick on the skin, razor cushioning is great, after i&#x27;m done, i wipe with a towel, and the skin is perfectly soft as well as smooth.</li>
            <li>Very Very close to Martin De Candre.</li>
            <li>I shimmied it out of the tin box and into my shaving bowl and was excited to try a new soap.</li>
            <li>and this was the first time I have ever used a product like this.  </li>
            <li>I thought that I hadn&#x27;t used enough soap the first day so put a lot more on my shave brush the day after</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had MANY different shaving creams and was looking into trying soaps for a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>and it provides a solid safe shave.  </li>
            <li>First of all, you can&#x27;t even get the soap out of the tin.</li>
            <li>AoS and Trufitt&amp;hill are shaving creams and simply just lather more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s expensive but not the best out there</li>
            <li>In my 79 years I have tried many shaving soaps (I just like the process of soaping up instead of squirting something from a pressurized can) and will search no more; I doubt that a better produce exists.  </li>
            <li>I have used about 20 different soaps and this one stays in my top 5 rotation.</li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling soft and smooth for hours after your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is light and unobtrusive, my brush loaded quickly on the puck, and an &amp;uuml;berlather in a bowl with just a tiny bit of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It took me a little experimentation on how to create a lather with it, but if you have experience creating a good lather with soaps I expect that you won&#x27;t have much difficulty with this</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll just stick with my old standby - Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat - still the best even if it is a tough one to lather.</li>
            <li>Not in the it smells like an old man sense, but it just has a wonderfully clean smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy this since I love Pre de Provence bar soap.</li>
            <li>The scent is subtle of a floral nature and makes the shave experience more enjoyable from a smell perspective.</li>
            <li>Most shaving creams and soaps dry out my face, but not this one.</li>
            <li>Will last me a year of twice a week use easily.</li>
            <li>It lathers quickly (I lather directly on face).</li>
            <li>It has a very classic soap scent, sorta like the soap your grandparents used to use.</li>
            <li>(btw if you like to whip your lather don&#x27;t use a shaving cup, it&#x27;s small and you can&#x27;t really get a good whip.</li>
            <li>The puck is quite large and should last a good long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of the high end shave soaps from Mike&#x27;s Natural, Tabac, MWF, and Taylor&#x27;s of Old Bond.</li>
            <li>Because the can is so large I wouldn&#x27;t use it for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For the same price there are dozens of artisans that serve the wet shaving community that make superior soaps from higher quality ingredients.</li>
            <li>Smell is nice and subtle and rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>Lathers up extremely quickly into a nice thick foam.</li>
            <li>By the end of my second lather my face is super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve used enough different brands of shave soap to be able to identify quickly those that are my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; favorites.  </li>
            <li>This is a very moisturizing soap.</li>
            <li>Yes, Truefitt &amp; Hill are pricey but in life you absolutely will get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Light grit, which must be tiny fragrance beads.</li>
            <li>The price for this soap is also very competitive.  </li>
            <li>I want to start this review by saying that I bought this product because I really like the aftershave.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make much foam</li>
            <li>Thanks much</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves the smell of it on me.</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as a cream.</li>
            <li>For the price I would recommend for fist time buyers or for anyone really.</li>
            <li>Has also lasted much longer than anything comparable in container size.</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shea butter moisturizes well and left my face smooth without the need for alum or alcohol-based aftershave splash.</li>
            <li>My brother in law isn&#x27;t much for it...</li>
            <li>soap works very well for me.</li>
            <li>It is difficult for me to describe scents in a meaningful way, everyone has their own preferences.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth it and based on how much I&#x27;ve used so far there must be</li>
            <li>Pleasant subtle scent.  </li>
            <li>scent of the soap is almost non existent, and is akin to plain old bar soap, but in a good way.</li>
            <li>First, let me state that I am brand new to shaving soap</li>
            <li>ONLY complaint is that I wish the walls of the tin were about 1/2 an inch higher so that I didn&#x27;t lose much of the lather I&#x27;d whipped up over the sides, lol.</li>
            <li>This lathers very well and smell decent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good soap with an above average price</li>
            <li>This is a very long lasting hard soap with a very light pleasant spring smell.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not the most moisturizing soap if you have dry or sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Really slick lather that let&#x27;s your blade glide nicely.  </li>
            <li>I used to have to moisturize after a shave with coconut oil as I have pretty sensitive skin, but after using this a couple of times it&#x27;s become an option.  </li>
            <li>soap comes packaged fine in a tin box, fitted a bit loose but didn&#x27;t rattle around during use.</li>
            <li>The scent seemed outstanding at first, but high tones of a peppery smell became more apparant (hard to describe)</li>
            <li>Had purchased previously while traveling and was pleased to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Use less, better thicker lather.</li>
            <li>Decent value</li>
            <li>lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap will give you a decent creamy protective lather.  </li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t over powering and it makes a decent lather.</li>
            <li>I definitely plan on buying more when I run out of my current one.</li>
            <li>Used with various double edged razors, mostly differen 1950&#x27;s and 60</li>
            <li>you think that the price is high, don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Some people referred to the high cost of this soap but you are getting 5.25 ounces of a high-quality product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Upon opening the tin, you get a blast of very herby, sharp scented soap, but upon lathering, this turns into a smooth, floral scent that lingers.</li>
            <li>The lather doesn&#x27;t dry on the face and rinses off clean.</li>
            <li>(I was expecting something slightly more heavy duty).</li>
            <li>Each time I shave, I get an irritating shave without good glide.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lather is nice and thick.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new and don&#x27;t want to spend too much, I&#x27;d recommend trying any of the Taylor of Old Bond Street shave creams.</li>
            <li>soap lathers up quickly and has what I can only describe as an adult scent to it.</li>
            <li>You need a very small bit of the soap to make an impressive amount of shave foam, but you have to really whip it up and add a water to the foam mixture slowly.  </li>
            <li>As I finished shaving the left side of my face, it had to be reapplied by the time I reached the right.</li>
            <li>This product: lathers up easily, no swirling and swirling the brush to get enough lather for a smooth shave; gives me a smooth shave with no irritation, and my skin is very sensitive; will last a long time, after using the mug for over a month it appears to be as full of soap as when I first opened it.  </li>
            <li>I find the scent to be very different, and did not have any problems whipping up a great lather even though the soap was very hard.</li>
            <li>It took me only a couple of tries to get used to how much water to use and so on, and now I can easily get a nice, thick lather from it.  </li>
            <li>The history of shea as a precious commodity can be traced back to Ancient Egypt, where shea butter was and continues to be used to protect the hair and skin against the fierce sun and the hot dry winds of African deserts and savannah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is breathed new life into my shave.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband to try with my new DE razor.</li>
            <li>It lathers very easily for a hard soap.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and subtle.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li>Just used this for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>Instead, I&#x27;ve come to enjoy it over my previous cream&#x27;s lemon-lime scent because it isn&#x27;t overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They both shave exactly the same as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many vegan soaps that claim to be as good as tallow based soaps only to be disappointed in either their performance, how they leave my face feeling when I&#x27;m done, or both.  </li>
            <li>Great lather from a pretty hard soap -- this thing will last until two years after I&#x27;m dead.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s shaving experience with a certain product is different.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to feel ok about paying the price.</li>
            <li>EXTREMELY sensitive skin and razo burn is a reguiar occurence when shaving.  </li>
            <li>Firm soap cake with light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wet-shaving on and off since the early eighties</li>
            <li>and i have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is my first shaving soap, after a long spell of using shaving creams.</li>
            <li>Get a cheap boar bristle brush, buy this shave soap, and just see what you&#x27;ve been missing.</li>
            <li>Most wet shavers agree that tallow/lanolin based soaps are definitely the holy grail when it comes to overall performance.  </li>
            <li>But I was pleasantly surprised with PdP.  </li>
            <li>According to Wikipedia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accounts from as early as Cleopatra&#x27;s Egypt speak of caravan bearing clay jars of valuable shea butter for cosmetic use.</li>
            <li>The funeral beds of early kings were carved in wood of shea trees.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of a floral bouquet, is not overpowering, and surprising -- I expected, when I initially smelled it, that I would not enjoy it.</li>
            <li>this is a hard soap I would strongly recommend that you use more water if you aren&#x27;t getting the slick performance you are expecting.</li>
            <li>The lather is pretty good, a little weak</li>
            <li>The scent reminds me a lot of Thymes \\&quot;Frasier Fir\\&quot; soap collection.&lt;br /&gt;Lather is rich and thick without too much work in the lather bowl.  </li>
            <li>This soap is larger than most I have used in the past and it comes in a can with a screw on lid, perhaps that&#x27;s what raises the cost.  </li>
            <li>only reason that I didn&#x27;t rate this higher is that the scent of the soap doesn&#x27;t seem to last into lathering.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, it was really easy to lather up, worked extremely well during the shave, and didn&#x27;t dry my face out.  </li>
            <li>Slick and comfortable 100 out of 10</li>
            <li>The lather was created quite quickly but it was very fluffy, not thick and luxurious at all.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with a silver tip badger brush soaked in hot water for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After having used this for a few months, I need to go back and completely re-write my original review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried 3 other shave soaps in the last few weeks -- I have a year&#x27;s worth left - expensive experiment -- and I like this the best.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had far better experience with products costing less than half of what I paid for this.</li>
            <li>By the way, a fellow wet shaver who is French said that the name refers to a meadow in the Provence area of France, hence the distinct floral aroma.</li>
            <li>The price may seem steep compared to drug store soaps, but remember that this is a larger puck than say, Van Der Hagen and will last much longer.</li>
            <li>I use a safety razor and sometimes a straight razor to shave now, my entire shave routine is different, and I have tried literally dozens of shave creams/soaps.</li>
            <li>So far, Pre de Provence is the clear winner over several others that were acceptable and one that was not.</li>
            <li>The shea butter leaves the skin exceptionally soft (especially for sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>I just wet the brush and swirl it around a few times on the top of the soap</li>
            <li>A nice hard milled soap like this will last several months, at least, so for the price this is a very economical choice, as well.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way either face or bowl lathered and easily appx.</li>
            <li>I am fairly new to wet shaving and have bought several different kinds of shaving soap, nine to be exact.  </li>
            <li>While at first I found the lather this soap produces to be sub-par compared to the dozens of other soaps I have used, recent usage has completely changed my mind.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the soap lathers nicely and all, but I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Cleans up easily and leaves a soft face behind.  </li>
            <li>The lather will be really thick and does really well with your brush being very wet to provide a good amount of slick and lather.</li>
            <li>The soap loads rapidly on your brush and quickly works into a slick, protective lather.  </li>
            <li>Not a single nick or weeper anywhere.</li>
            <li>The puck is a generous 5.25 oz, and it&#x27;s a typical hard milled French soap, so even if you soak your pucks in warm water</li>
            <li>I have experimented with several different shaving soaps including Van Der Hagen, Proraso, Taylor of Old Bond Street, and Baxter.  </li>
            <li>(Does not dry me out)  </li>
            <li>It contains shea butter along with other essential plant oils that really do the trick.  </li>
            <li>I loaded the brush for about 1 minute after soaking the puck in hot water for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I expected I&#x27;d end up trying it, finding it difficult to create a good lather, and go back to using my creams.</li>
            <li>I generally face lather soaps with a boar brush and a few swirls on the soap cake and you ready to go.</li>
            <li>Although over 10 dollars, the puck is big at 5.25 ounces, double most other soaps, and erodes slowly.</li>
            <li>After about 10 slow swirls face lathering is quick and fills the brush for multiple passes.</li>
            <li>My test of a soap is how much alcohol burn my face feels after splashing my aftershave and this soap conditions well and leaves me with no or little burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Rich thick lather yet very moisturizing and slick.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I put it up there with some of the best I have used.</li>
            <li> and I would say this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li> The best part is the post-shave feel.  </li>
            <li> It makes for a very pleasant shaving experience.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very pleasant and not overpowering.</li>

            <li> Smells good though!</li>
            <li> He loved it!  </li>
            <li> Paired with a Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Razor, I experienced the closest shave ever.  </li>
            <li> Since this has a sort of flowery/citrus aroma I found that using a Lavender, Lilac or citrus-smelling after shave lotions works great; I get a lot of compliments on the way it smells.  </li>
            <li> smells great.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>

            <li> Smells great but not overpowering and the tin is good for travel.</li>
            <li> This is the best shave soap I&#x27;ve tried - better than Proraso or RazoRock.</li>
            <li> Comes in it&#x27;s own tin FTW!</li>
            <li> Man it makes nice lather!  </li>
            <li> Pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Functions well with good lather and pleasant fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, great lather..</li>
            <li> Great shaving soap, smells really nice.</li>
            <li> This soap is a superior product after you get used to the use of it</li>
            <li> Lather is good, and I will order this again when it&#x27;s used up.</li>
            <li> I suppose but about as good as any shaving soap</li>
            <li> Soaked the brush for 10 minutes in the bowl, then swirled it on the soap for a good 90 seconds.</li>
            <li> He said it is a thirsty soap and has a good lather.</li>
            <li> I tested it with a cartridge razor and it works just as good.  </li>
            <li> Excellent lather and fantastic slickness.</li>
            <li> It is a triple milled soap from France and makes good lather.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll get a brush and see how good that does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband loved his stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> Truly loved by my fiance.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use cologne because the smell is so good.</li>
            <li> Softens the beard and smells good too.  </li>
            <li> My face fells really good after the shave.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  </li>
            <li> Very pleasant fragrance, lathers quickly and foams very nicely (with my Badger hair brush).  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best performing soap I&#x27;ve ever used, or the best scent, but it is a solid performer and a good value.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to many great shaves with this one.</li>
            <li> Provides great lather and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read sage and rosemary as descriptions, but to me, it smelled kind of like a good bath soap ought to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice scent and good shave.  </li>
            <li> It makes a wonderful lather, with a light floral scent that is surprisingly refreshing.</li>
            <li> This soap can take a lot more water than you might think, and the additional water helps the soap produce a rich lather that is one of the best I have used to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent, while pleasant, isn&#x27;t my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It has a lovely light floral kind of scent that is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, whip shave soap with pleasant, soft aroma.</li>
            <li> price / performance / smell just make it an amazing product.</li>
            <li> but the Trufitt&amp;hill is an amazing shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Amazon does a great job letting me know if a GM Starter will fit my car, if the ink I want fits my printer.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance</li>
            <li> tried this soap on a whim looks nice, fancy name, it&#x27;s from France</li>
            <li> Nice tin container for travel.  </li>
            <li> and while your at it add the matching shea butter ASB as it is wonderful as well and compliments the great scent of this soap while further moisturizing your skin.</li>
            <li> It is nicely packaged.  </li>
            <li> Nice scent.</li>
            <li> The blade glides effortlessly and give me a nice shave</li>
            <li> Nice scent, smooth, leaves skin feelin great.</li>
            <li> face feels nice and moisturized after shaving, probably an effect of the shea butter.</li>
            <li> nice lather.</li>
            <li> I have to mix it with another shave gel although it foams quite nicely .</li>
            <li> Smell, comes in a nice tin, leaves my skin feeling softer than Praso.  </li>
            <li> Just what you need for a nice shave.</li>
            <li> Love it -- lathers well and smells good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is mild and not overpowering, the lather is perfect for shaving, and the tin is fine for storage and use (no need to take it out to drop it into another container).</li>
            <li> Nonetheless the scent is very mild and many find it great.  </li>
            <li> I found no issues getting a good lather easily.</li>
            <li> It does not clog up my razor while shaving and rinses off my face and brush very easily.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very light, Pine-ish kind of.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the badger brush and this combo gets a nice lather and the scent is mild but pleasant.</li>
            <li> and I was really surprised how wonderful it was.</li>
            <li> It is a great product for those of us who enjoy a warm comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> This is one of the most moisturizing soaps I own.</li>
            <li> If you like a smooth razor shave, I would recommend this shaving soap with a good boar hair shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Nice screw top aluminum container.  </li>
            <li> However, while the packaging is nice, I do not get an enjoyable shave.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> it is my first time to try a shaving soup and it was perfect for me the smooth the density the creaming and the smell</li>
            <li> and I get a very clean, nice shave.</li>
            <li> It can fit in the palm of your hand and has a wider opening than a cup and it heats up soaking in warm water and keeps the lather warm.)</li>
            <li> To me a good shaving soap should meet three criteria: lather up quickly with a brush, have a silky smooth lather, and smell good.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic, has a nice clean scent that is quite pleasant.</li>
            <li> Rinses off cleanly and has great moisturizing properties that leave your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very light</li>
            <li> The scent is very light upon applying.  </li>
            <li> Scent isn&#x27;t overpowering which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> It also lathers very quickly and smells nice.</li>
            <li> Upon first opening the tin you are greeted with a fresh herbal scent that is very pleasant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure glad I heeded all of your recommendations and ordered this shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Not a horrible soap, but i&#x27;ve seen so many more that were better, so save your money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaving soap for many years.  </li>
            <li> I used this soap mostly when traveling since it has a screw top</li>
            <li> It lathers up ok.  </li>
            <li> I matched it against my favorite and it came up obviously second best in terms of lubrication, whisker pull and closeness of shave.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t think i will find a better one</li>
            <li> I love this shaving soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m on sold on it :)</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t ask for a better shave soap.</li>
            <li> It is kind to the skin, stands up a beard very well and smells good.  </li>
            <li> This is still my favorite shave soap/cream I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> and I have a dozen or so soaps and creams I rotate out when I do shave but even after 2 years this is still the soap I reach for the most.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing about it is the smell.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, I will rely on the Amazon community to let me know if they have a favorite shea butter soap that fits my muy</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> What I like about Pre de Provence better.  </li>
            <li> What I like about Praso better.  </li>
            <li> , I get a great shave with it very close and no weepers.  </li>
            <li> Probably my favorite shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Any one of these is sure to please.</li>
            <li> product has many rave reviews, but to me it is just an OK soap.</li>
            <li> and I love the aroma.</li>
            <li> Works so much better than shave creme.</li>
            <li> I like this soap (I love the after shave balm)</li>
            <li> Pre de Provence ranks right up there with the best, and I have really been enjoying my shaves with this soap.</li>
            <li> so it must be good right?  </li>
            <li> We love the nice clean scent too.</li>
            <li> First thing you&#x27;ll notice is that it has a very nice smell, fairly strong, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Pre de Provence shaving soap has an aroma that&#x27;s clean and kind of soapy.  </li>
            <li> Lathers up very easy and has a light scent.</li>
            <li> Then I move to a ceramic bowl pre-heated with water where I quickly work up a beautiful lather that stays hot in the bowl.</li>
            <li> This soap provides a good lather and a good shave, my skin feels soft and smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li> First the good news.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good</li>
            <li> The Pre de Provence soap is not cheap but it is good, very good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my original tin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many soaps that are just way to strong a smell.</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice tin, lathers well, and provides a smooth, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Works great for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> It lubricates effectively and rinses quickly leaving my skin feeling healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> This builds up a nice lather quickly, smells nice, and doesnt have an overly powerful or lingering smell.</li>
            <li> The scent is very pleasant but does not linger long and will not interfere with any aftershave you might want to use afterward.  </li>
            <li> This soap lathers up very nicely on my badger brush with soft water.  </li>
            <li> Just a dab of the stuff creates a rich and satisfying foam.</li>
            <li> Think of a SIGNIFICANTLY toned-down Arko with slightly more of an herbal tone.</li>
            <li> It is a generously sized soap in an excellent tin which will be used for other soaps once this is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Equally great for those experienced and new to double edge shaving.</li>
            <li> ; a better description would be soapy &amp; clean.  </li>
            <li> The lather is easy to create.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lathering is easy if you start with a dryer brush.</li>
            <li> This Shave soap is a great buy, especially if you are looking for a soap with a light scent, good lathering, and is will last you for a good number of</li>
            <li> Easy to load and lather.</li>
            <li> Lathers easily.</li>
            <li> No an easy trick for a guy in his sixties.</li>
            <li> It lathers fairly easily, but the lather isn&#x27;t all that moisturizing</li>
            <li> The scent is strong but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> The scent is still just as strong as the day I bought it</li>
            <li> It also reminds me strongly of something my grandfather used to use.</li>
            <li> This is a classic product for good reason.</li>
            <li> It is a fairly strong scented soap, but not to the point of being cloying or obtrusive.  </li>
            <li> Price wise, it&#x27;s a decent value for a quality product.  </li>
            <li> Shea butter&#x27;s amazing skin care and healing properties were first harnessed thousands of years ago.</li>
            <li> AoS Sandlewood while I liked it at first</li>
            <li> This shave soap requires very little for a nice lather, so it a very good value.  </li>
            <li> It lathers up real nice, is not too strongly scented, and creates a nice slick layer allowing the razor to glide.  </li>
            <li> I used distilled water and my Fine Silvertip Badger brush for lathering.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it works out fine factoring in the time.</li>
            <li> And the tin itself is really cheap and dents easily</li>
            <li> Makes fine lather.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to get a creamy and smooth lather with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He says that it makes a great lather and does not dry his face.</li>
            <li> This soap has quickly become one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> This is a large puck of soap, over five ounces, and the tin is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> It was a nice lather in terms of not drying out your skin, however it lost much of it&#x27;s consistency soon after applying it to my face.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> This was after it was properly lathered and applied as an experienced soap shaver would.</li>
            <li> it was fantastic i was shaving with cremes and gels products</li>
            <li> Light scent of Soap.  </li>
            <li> I have to say I enjoy this soap.</li>
            <li> The scent, as I&#x27;ve said, is light.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s light and airy.</li>
            <li> Also, this product doesn&#x27;t make my skin tighten up like I&#x27;d been sunburned like some of the cheap stuff has.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous shave soap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for several months now, and it does the job great.  </li>
            <li> Great product overall.</li>
            <li> Works best with a double edge or straight edge razor.  </li>
            <li> Makes a great lather and has a subtle, but pleasant smell that will not make you smell like your grandfather.</li>
            <li> this soap is just plain amazing !!!!</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s animal friendly (if that&#x27;s important to you);</li>
            <li> The lather builds quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Builds lather quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Lathers easily and rinses quickly.</li>
            <li> Scent is pretty good as well -- some reviews described it as &amp;#34;soapy,&amp;#34; but I didn&#x27;t find that to really be the case.</li>
            <li> I worked my lather from the tin it comes in, took my well-soaked boar bristle brush and only had to swirl it 5-6 times to get sufficient lather to make three shaving passes comfortably ( If you use a shaving cup trying whipping up the soap in it to get an even better lather).I really enjoyed using this soap and would gladly order it again.</li>
            <li> It smells very fresh and clean in the tin.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very fresh, clean, and botanical with a sweetness akin to bananas.  </li>
            <li> I use this to shave my legs, and it has a very clean and pleasant smell that is not feminine or masculine really, it just smells clean.  </li>
            <li> I have no problems lathering this soap -- it practically throws itself onto my brush -- and it provides an excellent, slick shave with plenty of cushion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have not noticed any drop off in the quality of the lather even with my original tin.</li>
            <li> ** Original Review</li>
            <li> Easy to lather and a clean and fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> It works into a good lather and the razor slides real easy and slick on my face (using a Gillette Fusion).</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance, a calm sage/herb scent that I keep coming back to.</li>
            <li> and I still love this stuff just as much as the day I wrote the original review.</li>
            <li> Pre de Provence will definatly find it&#x27;s way into my regular rotation along side my beloved Tabac and TOBS.</li>
            <li> find that once you&#x27;ve got a good lather with this soap, it will provide enough lubrication to allow your razor to glide across your skin.</li>
            <li> But again it wasn&#x27;t an issue for me because while the lather wasn&#x27;t as good, the actual shave was.</li>
            <li> It creates mounds of luxurious creamy lather with a light fresh smell with just a minimum of effort.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a quality shave soap for a good price</li>
            <li> He said it leaves his skin soft and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> it still should last you a good while.  </li>
            <li> It has a light fragrance to it that is pleasant but not powerful, and leaves my skin feeling smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li> This soap lathers easily and provides a very close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li> Not only is it a delicious smelling soap, but also it&#x27;s incredibly easy to load and lather, performs beautifully with regards to glide and cushion, and leaves my face feeling supple and smooth...not dry and tight as some soaps can.  </li>
            <li> It protects as well as any I&#x27;ve tried, lathers great, and smells good (a lot of soaps fall down on this last one).  </li>
            <li> If you like mild or unscented soaps, you may want to pass on this one.</li>
            <li> Mild scent.</li>
            <li> This is my second favorite (MWF is my favorite).  </li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this shave soap, and I will definitely buy this again in the future.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gave me a very comfortable shave with a new [[ASIN:B001QY8QXM Astra SP blade]], and no irritation of a problem area on my neck.</li>
            <li> My first experience with a French shaving soap has been a pleasant one.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my honeymoon in Jamaica and since it was very hot and humid, I had no issues.  </li>
            <li> nice subtle kind of herbal aroma, not too strong.</li>
            <li> It works better than my normal can shaving cream with my DE razor.</li>
            <li> So happy to find it on line for less without driving 100 miles to purchase it.</li>
            <li> The soap is easy on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave much residue on the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s stainless and cleans easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this has so many good reviews???</li>
            <li> They were right, the smell is incredible, and although long lasting, very mild.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering but strong enough to make enjoyable.</li>
            <li> It produces a thick lather easily and shaves great.  </li>
            <li> It is way to large to fit into my [[ASIN:B000FIH8XO Edwin Jagger Rn46</li>
            <li> They have a Green Tea style that is equally great.</li>
            <li> The post-shave experience is lightly moisturizing and leaves your face feeling very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried a ton of shave soaps and this one wins on all counts.</li>
            <li> Makes a nice later and my razor glides across my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Taylor of Old Bond Street -- which is really more of a cream than a soap -- for years.  </li>
            <li> so definitely this will be my ideal shaving soup because i will try several</li>
            <li> It was pretty cool that my face wasn&#x27;t irritated after shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my favorite shaving soap / cream I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> You simply won&#x27;t get that kind of performance with a shaving soap.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s absolutely worth giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is worth noting that this soap is about 25 percent shea butter.  </li>
            <li> Not too strong and it provide good slick protection on your face.</li>
            <li> Most of us have 10-15 different soaps (admit that you really enjoy trying other soaps as well).This soap smells great, produces a good lather, and gives you a slick shave.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of other soaps and none are as good as this one.</li>
            <li> It will be right at home.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced the shea butter is really doing anything special, but the soap doesn&#x27;t disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice thick lather that is very stable and gives a really nice amount of slickness and protection.</li>
            <li> Great scent - very green.</li>
            <li> Rich, thick lather, pleasant scent</li>
            <li> exactly that right size is a plus for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Real nice triple milled hard shaving soap!</li>
            <li> Not only was it a close, smooth shave, but it was extremely comfortable.  </li>
            <li> slick on the skin, razor cushioning is great, after i&#x27;m done, i wipe with a towel, and the skin is perfectly soft as well as smooth.</li>
            <li> Very Very close to Martin De Candre.</li>
            <li> I shimmied it out of the tin box and into my shaving bowl and was excited to try a new soap.</li>
            <li> and this was the first time I have ever used a product like this.  </li>
            <li> I thought that I hadn&#x27;t used enough soap the first day so put a lot more on my shave brush the day after</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had MANY different shaving creams and was looking into trying soaps for a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> and it provides a solid safe shave.  </li>
            <li> First of all, you can&#x27;t even get the soap out of the tin.</li>
            <li> AoS and Trufitt&amp;hill are shaving creams and simply just lather more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but not the best out there</li>
            <li> In my 79 years I have tried many shaving soaps (I just like the process of soaping up instead of squirting something from a pressurized can) and will search no more; I doubt that a better produce exists.  </li>
            <li> I have used about 20 different soaps and this one stays in my top 5 rotation.</li>
            <li> pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling soft and smooth for hours after your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is light and unobtrusive, my brush loaded quickly on the puck, and an &amp;uuml;berlather in a bowl with just a tiny bit of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It took me a little experimentation on how to create a lather with it, but if you have experience creating a good lather with soaps I expect that you won&#x27;t have much difficulty with this</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll just stick with my old standby - Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat - still the best even if it is a tough one to lather.</li>
            <li> Not in the it smells like an old man sense, but it just has a wonderfully clean smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy this since I love Pre de Provence bar soap.</li>
            <li> The scent is subtle of a floral nature and makes the shave experience more enjoyable from a smell perspective.</li>
            <li> Most shaving creams and soaps dry out my face, but not this one.</li>
            <li> Will last me a year of twice a week use easily.</li>
            <li> It lathers quickly (I lather directly on face).</li>
            <li> It has a very classic soap scent, sorta like the soap your grandparents used to use.</li>
            <li> (btw if you like to whip your lather don&#x27;t use a shaving cup, it&#x27;s small and you can&#x27;t really get a good whip.</li>
            <li> The puck is quite large and should last a good long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of the high end shave soaps from Mike&#x27;s Natural, Tabac, MWF, and Taylor&#x27;s of Old Bond.</li>
            <li> Because the can is so large I wouldn&#x27;t use it for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For the same price there are dozens of artisans that serve the wet shaving community that make superior soaps from higher quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> Smell is nice and subtle and rinses clean.  </li>
            <li> Lathers up extremely quickly into a nice thick foam.</li>
            <li> By the end of my second lather my face is super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve used enough different brands of shave soap to be able to identify quickly those that are my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; favorites.  </li>
            <li> This is a very moisturizing soap.</li>
            <li> Yes, Truefitt &amp; Hill are pricey but in life you absolutely will get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Light grit, which must be tiny fragrance beads.</li>
            <li> The price for this soap is also very competitive.  </li>
            <li> I want to start this review by saying that I bought this product because I really like the aftershave.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make much foam</li>
            <li> Thanks much</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves the smell of it on me.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as a cream.</li>
            <li> For the price I would recommend for fist time buyers or for anyone really.</li>
            <li> Has also lasted much longer than anything comparable in container size.</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shea butter moisturizes well and left my face smooth without the need for alum or alcohol-based aftershave splash.</li>
            <li> My brother in law isn&#x27;t much for it...</li>
            <li> soap works very well for me.</li>
            <li> It is difficult for me to describe scents in a meaningful way, everyone has their own preferences.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth it and based on how much I&#x27;ve used so far there must be</li>
            <li> Pleasant subtle scent.  </li>
            <li> scent of the soap is almost non existent, and is akin to plain old bar soap, but in a good way.</li>
            <li> First, let me state that I am brand new to shaving soap</li>
            <li> ONLY complaint is that I wish the walls of the tin were about 1/2 an inch higher so that I didn&#x27;t lose much of the lather I&#x27;d whipped up over the sides, lol.</li>
            <li> This lathers very well and smell decent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good soap with an above average price</li>
            <li> This is a very long lasting hard soap with a very light pleasant spring smell.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not the most moisturizing soap if you have dry or sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Really slick lather that let&#x27;s your blade glide nicely.  </li>
            <li> I used to have to moisturize after a shave with coconut oil as I have pretty sensitive skin, but after using this a couple of times it&#x27;s become an option.  </li>
            <li> soap comes packaged fine in a tin box, fitted a bit loose but didn&#x27;t rattle around during use.</li>
            <li> The scent seemed outstanding at first, but high tones of a peppery smell became more apparant (hard to describe)</li>
            <li> Had purchased previously while traveling and was pleased to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Use less, better thicker lather.</li>
            <li> Decent value</li>
            <li> lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap will give you a decent creamy protective lather.  </li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t over powering and it makes a decent lather.</li>
            <li> I definitely plan on buying more when I run out of my current one.</li>
            <li> Used with various double edged razors, mostly differen 1950&#x27;s and 60</li>
            <li> you think that the price is high, don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Some people referred to the high cost of this soap but you are getting 5.25 ounces of a high-quality product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Upon opening the tin, you get a blast of very herby, sharp scented soap, but upon lathering, this turns into a smooth, floral scent that lingers.</li>
            <li> The lather doesn&#x27;t dry on the face and rinses off clean.</li>
            <li> (I was expecting something slightly more heavy duty).</li>
            <li> Each time I shave, I get an irritating shave without good glide.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The lather is nice and thick.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new and don&#x27;t want to spend too much, I&#x27;d recommend trying any of the Taylor of Old Bond Street shave creams.</li>
            <li> soap lathers up quickly and has what I can only describe as an adult scent to it.</li>
            <li> You need a very small bit of the soap to make an impressive amount of shave foam, but you have to really whip it up and add a water to the foam mixture slowly.  </li>
            <li> As I finished shaving the left side of my face, it had to be reapplied by the time I reached the right.</li>
            <li> This product: lathers up easily, no swirling and swirling the brush to get enough lather for a smooth shave; gives me a smooth shave with no irritation, and my skin is very sensitive; will last a long time, after using the mug for over a month it appears to be as full of soap as when I first opened it.  </li>
            <li> I find the scent to be very different, and did not have any problems whipping up a great lather even though the soap was very hard.</li>
            <li> It took me only a couple of tries to get used to how much water to use and so on, and now I can easily get a nice, thick lather from it.  </li>
            <li> The history of shea as a precious commodity can be traced back to Ancient Egypt, where shea butter was and continues to be used to protect the hair and skin against the fierce sun and the hot dry winds of African deserts and savannah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is breathed new life into my shave.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to try with my new DE razor.</li>
            <li> It lathers very easily for a hard soap.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and subtle.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling very soft.  </li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> Instead, I&#x27;ve come to enjoy it over my previous cream&#x27;s lemon-lime scent because it isn&#x27;t overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They both shave exactly the same as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many vegan soaps that claim to be as good as tallow based soaps only to be disappointed in either their performance, how they leave my face feeling when I&#x27;m done, or both.  </li>
            <li> Great lather from a pretty hard soap -- this thing will last until two years after I&#x27;m dead.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s shaving experience with a certain product is different.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to feel ok about paying the price.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY sensitive skin and razo burn is a reguiar occurence when shaving.  </li>
            <li> Firm soap cake with light fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet-shaving on and off since the early eighties</li>
            <li> and i have a sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is my first shaving soap, after a long spell of using shaving creams.</li>
            <li> Get a cheap boar bristle brush, buy this shave soap, and just see what you&#x27;ve been missing.</li>
            <li> Most wet shavers agree that tallow/lanolin based soaps are definitely the holy grail when it comes to overall performance.  </li>
            <li> But I was pleasantly surprised with PdP.  </li>
            <li> According to Wikipedia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accounts from as early as Cleopatra&#x27;s Egypt speak of caravan bearing clay jars of valuable shea butter for cosmetic use.</li>
            <li> The funeral beds of early kings were carved in wood of shea trees.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of a floral bouquet, is not overpowering, and surprising -- I expected, when I initially smelled it, that I would not enjoy it.</li>
            <li> this is a hard soap I would strongly recommend that you use more water if you aren&#x27;t getting the slick performance you are expecting.</li>
            <li> The lather is pretty good, a little weak</li>
            <li> The scent reminds me a lot of Thymes \\&quot;Frasier Fir\\&quot; soap collection.&lt;br /&gt;Lather is rich and thick without too much work in the lather bowl.  </li>
            <li> This soap is larger than most I have used in the past and it comes in a can with a screw on lid, perhaps that&#x27;s what raises the cost.  </li>
            <li> only reason that I didn&#x27;t rate this higher is that the scent of the soap doesn&#x27;t seem to last into lathering.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, it was really easy to lather up, worked extremely well during the shave, and didn&#x27;t dry my face out.  </li>
            <li> Slick and comfortable 100 out of 10</li>
            <li> The lather was created quite quickly but it was very fluffy, not thick and luxurious at all.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with a silver tip badger brush soaked in hot water for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After having used this for a few months, I need to go back and completely re-write my original review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 other shave soaps in the last few weeks -- I have a year&#x27;s worth left - expensive experiment -- and I like this the best.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had far better experience with products costing less than half of what I paid for this.</li>
            <li> By the way, a fellow wet shaver who is French said that the name refers to a meadow in the Provence area of France, hence the distinct floral aroma.</li>
            <li> The price may seem steep compared to drug store soaps, but remember that this is a larger puck than say, Van Der Hagen and will last much longer.</li>
            <li> I use a safety razor and sometimes a straight razor to shave now, my entire shave routine is different, and I have tried literally dozens of shave creams/soaps.</li>
            <li> So far, Pre de Provence is the clear winner over several others that were acceptable and one that was not.</li>
            <li> The shea butter leaves the skin exceptionally soft (especially for sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I just wet the brush and swirl it around a few times on the top of the soap</li>
            <li> A nice hard milled soap like this will last several months, at least, so for the price this is a very economical choice, as well.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way either face or bowl lathered and easily appx.</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to wet shaving and have bought several different kinds of shaving soap, nine to be exact.  </li>
            <li> While at first I found the lather this soap produces to be sub-par compared to the dozens of other soaps I have used, recent usage has completely changed my mind.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the soap lathers nicely and all, but I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Cleans up easily and leaves a soft face behind.  </li>
            <li> The lather will be really thick and does really well with your brush being very wet to provide a good amount of slick and lather.</li>
            <li> The soap loads rapidly on your brush and quickly works into a slick, protective lather.  </li>
            <li> Not a single nick or weeper anywhere.</li>
            <li> The puck is a generous 5.25 oz, and it&#x27;s a typical hard milled French soap, so even if you soak your pucks in warm water</li>
            <li> I have experimented with several different shaving soaps including Van Der Hagen, Proraso, Taylor of Old Bond Street, and Baxter.  </li>
            <li> (Does not dry me out)  </li>
            <li> It contains shea butter along with other essential plant oils that really do the trick.  </li>
            <li> I loaded the brush for about 1 minute after soaking the puck in hot water for a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I expected I&#x27;d end up trying it, finding it difficult to create a good lather, and go back to using my creams.</li>
            <li> I generally face lather soaps with a boar brush and a few swirls on the soap cake and you ready to go.</li>
            <li> Although over 10 dollars, the puck is big at 5.25 ounces, double most other soaps, and erodes slowly.</li>
            <li> After about 10 slow swirls face lathering is quick and fills the brush for multiple passes.</li>
            <li> My test of a soap is how much alcohol burn my face feels after splashing my aftershave and this soap conditions well and leaves me with no or little burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rich thick lather yet very moisturizing and slick.</li>
            <li> Transfers warmth from hot tap water (some soaps are too heavy or thick to transfer heat from hot tap water).  </li>
            <li> This is a very hard, long-lasting, clean smelling soap.</li>
            <li> it sure lasts a long time so though it is expensive</li>
            <li> , it is a very compact soap, I&#x27;ve been using in now for a couple of months, and you can see very little gone from the can.  </li>
            <li> But when I used this back in the U.S., it went back to being on the dry side.  </li>
            <li> If you are presently using a shaving foam from can, note that these products contain chemicals, such as alcohol, which actually dry the skin.  </li>
            <li> It has a very sharp, clean, citrusy scent that some people love and some hate.</li>
            <li> Once you break past the outer layer of soap the lather becomes much richer with each use.</li>

            <li> I currently use a Merkur 180 long handle&lt;br /&gt;along with Feather blades and now Pre de Provence soap completes the puzzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks to write this review because I am new to using a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been using shaving brush soaps for very long, and have been trying several, but I think I can stop for now with this one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a veteran DE shaver and have tried quite a few shaving soaps including Italian, French, Spanish and British products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve attempted to use a large amount of product to build my lather in a bowl with my brush, but I&#x27;ve never able to get the creamy consistency I get with other products (I have about 7 others from various brands).</li>
            <li> I was able to work up a thick and very slick lather.</li>
            <li> The soap is forgiving as far as the correct soap/water ratio, but experimenting a little pays dividends.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars but the only con I have is that the lather does not last as long as other shaving soaps I have used, RazoRock or Proraso.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using this product about 10 times over the past month with various product - water ratio, with very little success.</li>
            <li> 3-4 whirls is enough soap to complete 3 passes with at least a 4th pass of lather left over if you need to do some touch ups.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll purchase again, but it may be a long time.  </li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying this out but sadly was let down after the first application.</li>
            <li> No more nicks, even with a new blade.</li>
            <li> This one tin last me what must have been 2 years of every other day shaving.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 1/3 to 1/2 of the price of the other two and gives me the same performance with a smell I prefer to either.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and each tin lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> This product is to dry</li>
            <li> The shea butter moisturizes well and doesn&#x27;t leave my face too dry.</li>
            <li> The only real positive would be that this soap is less expensive than my favorites, Edwin Jagger, D.R. Harris and Geo Trumper&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Traditional Black Porcelain Shaving Soap Bowl</li>
            <li> The lather is slick, cushioning, and fairly long lasting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few times to date.  </li>
            <li> Too wet</li>
            <li> When I apply it to my prepped face, it&#x27;s always thin, no matter how much product I put on.</li>
            <li> I was curious about shave soaps which is why I started the experiment.  </li>
            <li> A must for any wet shavers collection.</li>
            <li> I work the surface of the soap for a minute with the wet brush to get it all soapy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just such a big, thick, heavy scent that I grow tired of it if I use it very often.</li>
            <li> That being said, I will never go back to ordinary shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> it way seem like a lot of $$ compared to the cans of shave soap, but he shaves his face every other day and 1 tin lasts about 8-10 months.</li>
            <li> The reason I ordered this was the description of the smell other reviewers gave it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try heavier than usual use &amp; see, but this one can might normally last me a year?!?&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Price was half that than other sites.</li>
            <li> It was s little slick but made the razor skip a lot requiring me to go over those areas which caused further irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of daily use it looks like hardly any soap has been used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to pinpoint, but it&#x27;s definitely a fresher scent.</li>
            <li> IMHO this soap is not economical because I have soaps that do what this one does for a quarter of the price.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it smelled very flowery/perfume (I don&#x27;t know about you</li>

            <li> My only complaint is that the mouth of the tin is narrow (about 3&amp;#34; across) which may be a problem for some when it comes to loading and lathering based on brush size (hence 4/5 stars), but it wouldn&#x27;t stop me from purchasing it again.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Nice fragrance, great lather..</li>
            <li> Great shaving soap, smells really nice.</li>
            <li> First, let me state that I am brand new to shaving soap and this was the first time I have ever used a product like this.  That being said, I will never go back to ordinary shaving cream.  I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin and razo burn is a reguiar occurence when shaving.  Well, not with this soap.  Paired with a Gillette Fusion Pro Glide Razor, I experienced the closest shave ever.  Not only was it a close, smooth shave, but it was extremely comfortable.  ZERO razor burn!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think that the price is high, don&#x27;t.  Yes, $13 may be a chunk of money to spend on a shaving product, but this tin will last a LONG time.  I used a liberal amount of lather and didn&#x27;t even make a dent into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself and your face a favor and buy this.  You will not regret it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure glad I heeded all of your recommendations and ordered this shaving soap. Most of us have 10-15 different soaps (admit that you really enjoy trying other soaps as well).This soap smells great, produces a good lather, and gives you a slick shave.  I find the scent to be very different, and did not have any problems whipping up a great lather even though the soap was very hard. I worked my lather from the tin it comes in, took my well-soaked boar bristle brush and only had to swirl it 5-6 times to get sufficient lather to make three shaving passes comfortably ( If you use a shaving cup trying whipping up the soap in it to get an even better lather).I really enjoyed using this soap and would gladly order it again. Since this has a sort of flowery/citrus aroma I found that using a Lavender, Lilac or citrus-smelling after shave lotions works great; I get a lot of compliments on the way it smells.  By the way, a fellow wet shaver who is French said that the name refers to a meadow in the Provence area of France, hence the distinct floral aroma. Some people referred to the high cost of this soap but you are getting 5.25 ounces of a high-quality product.  Give it a shot.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use this and a shave cream. This soap is a superior product after you get used to the use of it</li>
            <li> This shave soap requires very little for a nice lather, so it a very good value.  Nice fragrance</li>
            <li> Bought it in August, still using it in December and it&#x27;s gone down perhaps 1/4&amp;#34;. At this rate I will be using this one tin a year (I shave 4-7 days a week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is mild and not overpowering, the lather is perfect for shaving, and the tin is fine for storage and use (no need to take it out to drop it into another container).</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying this out but sadly was let down after the first application. It was a nice lather in terms of not drying out your skin, however it lost much of it&#x27;s consistency soon after applying it to my face. I thought that I hadn&#x27;t used enough soap the first day so put a lot more on my shave brush the day after and still the same problem. As I finished shaving the left side of my face, it had to be reapplied by the time I reached the right. Not a horrible soap, but i&#x27;ve seen so many more that were better, so save your money.</li>
            <li> This is a very moisturizing soap. Most shaving creams and soaps dry out my face, but not this one. It also lathers very quickly and smells nice.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic.  To me a good shaving soap should meet three criteria: lather up quickly with a brush, have a silky smooth lather, and smell good.  This soap meets all three.  I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of other soaps and none are as good as this one.</li>
            <li> The Best I have ever used. Long Lasting. Pleasant scent. Just a dab of the stuff creates a rich and satisfying foam.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant fragrance, lathers quickly and foams very nicely (with my Badger hair brush).  To date,  this is the nicest shaving soap I&#x27;ve used so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ONLY complaint is that I wish the walls of the tin were about 1/2 an inch higher so that I didn&#x27;t lose much of the lather I&#x27;d whipped up over the sides, lol.</li>
            <li> My husband, 79 and a lifetime non-electric shaver, says this is without a doubt the best shave soap he&#x27;s ever used -</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly in perfect condition.  I&#x27;ve used it twice, so in that regard this may be premature.  However, I&#x27;ve used enough different brands of shave soap to be able to identify quickly those that are my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; favorites.  This will not make the cut.  Fragrance unremarkable, rather medicinal.  Lather acceptable, but not great, same for the quality of shave.  The only real positive would be that this soap is less expensive than my favorites, Edwin Jagger, D.R. Harris and Geo Trumper&#x27;s.  Decent value but won&#x27;t order again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using for a while, I&#x27;m upgrading to 4 stars.  Disregard the comment about \\&quot;medicinal\\&quot; fragrance; a better description would be soapy &amp; clean.  Lather is good, and I will order this again when it&#x27;s used up.</li>
            <li> I have to say this soap is amazing! I used distilled water and my Fine Silvertip Badger brush for lathering. I loaded the brush for about 1 minute after soaking the puck in hot water for a few minutes.  While adding water slowly to my lather bowl I was able to work up a thick and very slick lather. I am totally impressed with this soap. I don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to buy this since I love Pre de Provence bar soap.</li>
            <li> I tried a ton of shave soaps and this one wins on all counts. Although over 10 dollars, the puck is big at 5.25 ounces, double most other soaps, and erodes slowly. Smells great but not overpowering and the tin is good for travel.</li>
            <li> This is a very long lasting hard soap with a very light pleasant spring smell. The lather is easy to create. I&#x27;m looking forward to many great shaves with this one.</li>
            <li> smells great. very thick lather. it sure lasts a long time so though it is expensive&lt;br /&gt;it works out fine factoring in the time.</li>
            <li> I bought this to accompany my fist safety razor experience. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it with except for canned cream and I was really surprised how wonderful it was. I bought the badger brush and this combo gets a nice lather and the scent is mild but pleasant. I&#x27;ll never go back to canned creams after this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaving soap for many years.  It is a great product for those of us who enjoy a warm comfortable shave.  It is not Vicki using this product!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet shaving/double edged safety razor shaving for a year.  I&#x27;ve had MANY different shaving creams and was looking into trying soaps for a closer shave.  I used this soap mostly when traveling since it has a screw top lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap will give you a decent creamy protective lather.  But it&#x27;s not the most moisturizing soap if you have dry or sensitive skin.  I used this on my honeymoon in Jamaica and since it was very hot and humid, I had no issues.  But when I used this back in the U.S., it went back to being on the dry side.  Maybe use this in conjunction with a pre-shave oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given up using shaving soap.  I now only will exclusively use Truefitt &amp; Hill shaving creams and balms as they are the luxury line for the discerning gentleman who doesn&#x27;t have time to waste on bad shaving products.  Yes, Truefitt &amp; Hill are pricey but in life you absolutely will get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Provides great lather and I love the smell. Price was half that than other sites.</li>
            <li> This soap provides a good lather and a good shave, my skin feels soft and smooth afterwards.  The fragrance is very light it&#x27;s almost undetectable.  IMHO this soap is not economical because I have soaps that do what this one does for a quarter of the price.  This soap is larger than most I have used in the past and it comes in a can with a screw on lid, perhaps that&#x27;s what raises the cost.  Because the can is so large I wouldn&#x27;t use it for travel.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this soap on a whim looks nice, fancy name, it&#x27;s from France so it must be good right?  It&#x27;s a good soap with an above average price</li>
            <li> Firm soap cake with light fragrance.  Transfers warmth from hot tap water (some soaps are too heavy or thick to transfer heat from hot tap water).  Nice tin container for travel.  Light grit, which must be tiny fragrance beads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wet-shaving on and off since the early eighties and I&#x27;ve used a lot of soaps and creams. I finally got around to trying this one and I&#x27;m sorry I waited so long. This is a large puck of soap, over five ounces, and the tin is a nice touch. The scent is strong but not overpowering. I like it. It is difficult for me to describe scents in a meaningful way, everyone has their own preferences. If you like mild or unscented soaps, you may want to pass on this one. If you like a scent that stands out, then this is for you. But how does it shave? The lather builds quickly and easily. I generally face lather soaps with a boar brush and a few swirls on the soap cake and you ready to go. The soap is forgiving as far as the correct soap/water ratio, but experimenting a little pays dividends. The lather is slick, cushioning, and fairly long lasting. It is also quite moisturizing and shouldn&#x27;t leave your face feeling dried out. The price may seem steep compared to drug store soaps, but remember that this is a larger puck than say, Van Der Hagen and will last much longer. Pre de Provence will definatly find it&#x27;s way into my regular rotation along side my beloved Tabac and TOBS. It will be right at home.</li>
            <li> Tin arrived damaged and I sent it back; could not give it to someone as a gift. Smells good though!</li>
            <li> It lathers up ok.  I load the brush in the can, then refine it in a shaving dish.  The lather is pretty good, a little weak I suppose but about as good as any shaving soap and it provides a solid safe shave.  The scent seemed outstanding at first, but high tones of a peppery smell became more apparant (hard to describe) and so I&#x27;ve now stopped using it.  Nonetheless the scent is very mild and many find it great.  For $12 to $14 it&#x27;s well worth it and based on how much I&#x27;ve used so far there must be about 400 shaves in that container.</li>
            <li> just as described.  A great value!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a veteran DE shaver and have tried quite a few shaving soaps including Italian, French, Spanish and British products. I bought Pre de Provence soap after reading glowing reviews on my shave forum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap comes packaged fine in a tin box, fitted a bit loose but didn&#x27;t rattle around during use. The smell is very light, Pine-ish kind of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used an Omega boar brush with this soap. Soaked the brush for 10 minutes in the bowl, then swirled it on the soap for a good 90 seconds. Then proceeded to lather in the bowl. The lather was created quite quickly but it was very fluffy, not thick and luxurious at all. The soap irritated my skin a bit. It was s little slick but made the razor skip a lot requiring me to go over those areas which caused further irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing performance from a somewhat over-hyped soap. I&#x27;ve had far better experience with products costing less than half of what I paid for this. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers up very nicely on my badger brush with soft water.  The scent reminds me a lot of Thymes \\&quot;Frasier Fir\\&quot; soap collection.&lt;br /&gt;Lather is rich and thick without too much work in the lather bowl.  This is one of the most moisturizing soaps I own.</li>
            <li> I have experimented with several different shaving soaps including Van Der Hagen, Proraso, Taylor of Old Bond Street, and Baxter.  Pre de Provence ranks right up there with the best, and I have really been enjoying my shaves with this soap. It comes in a nice tin, lathers well, and provides a smooth, comfortable shave.  It does not clog up my razor while shaving and rinses off my face and brush very easily.  The scent is very pleasant but does not linger long and will not interfere with any aftershave you might want to use afterward.  The price for this soap is also very competitive.  It makes for a very pleasant shaving experience.  Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> Way overrated. The scent was innocuous but the product itself did not provide the glide, cushioning or closeness I was hoping for. I matched it against my favorite and it came up obviously second best in terms of lubrication, whisker pull and closeness of shave. This was after it was properly lathered and applied as an experienced soap shaver would. I guess I&#x27;ll just stick with my old standby - Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat - still the best even if it is a tough one to lather.</li>
            <li> Pre de Provence shaving soap has an aroma that&#x27;s clean and kind of soapy.  I&#x27;ve read sage and rosemary as descriptions, but to me, it smelled kind of like a good bath soap ought to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it was really easy to lather up, worked extremely well during the shave, and didn&#x27;t dry my face out.  Great all around!</li>
            <li> Makes a nice later and my razor glides across my face. If you like a smooth razor shave, I would recommend this shaving soap with a good boar hair shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend. He loves it! He said it is a thirsty soap and has a good lather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using Taylor of Old Bond Street -- which is really more of a cream than a soap -- for years.  Because the Pre de Provence balm is so well regarded, I thought I&#x27;d give this soap a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lather is excellent, and the soap leaves virtually no smell.  There&#x27;s an adjustment coming from the Taylor creme;  soap lather doesn&#x27;t coat your face under the razor quite the way cream does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I&#x27;m going to stick with soap instead of creme, this is the one.  It protects as well as any I&#x27;ve tried, lathers great, and smells good (a lot of soaps fall down on this last one).  I&#x27;m not convinced the shea butter is really doing anything special, but the soap doesn&#x27;t disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and having a tin exactly that right size is a plus for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Sidenote:  my wife &amp; I have one Amazon account, and this is the husband writing.)</li>
            <li> Great product. Builds lather quickly and easily. Mild scent. I&#x27;ve been using the Pre de Provence for several years. It&#x27;s my go to shaving soap. Equally great for those experienced and new to double edge shaving.</li>
            <li> Gotta have the Shea Butter in it. Sometime I add about 5 drops of Argan Oil. They have a Green Tea style that is equally great.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and good shave.  A quality soap.</li>
            <li> My first experience with a French shaving soap has been a pleasant one.  The puck is quite large and should last a good long time.  The scent, while pleasant, isn&#x27;t my favorite.  I do, however, recommend this soap over the no. 63 scent that is also made by Pre.  They both shave exactly the same as far as I can tell.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best performing soap I&#x27;ve ever used, or the best scent, but it is a solid performer and a good value.  I&#x27;ll purchase again, but it may be a long time.  Will last me a year of twice a week use easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used a few times to date.  It smells very fresh and clean in the tin.  The scent is very light upon applying.  Where I think this soap excels is the protection and moisturizing effects for your skin.  The lather is very slick.  The slickest I&#x27;ve used!  It provides a great layer of protection.  It leaves your face feeling very soft.  I found no issues getting a good lather easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of the high end shave soaps from Mike&#x27;s Natural, Tabac, MWF, and Taylor&#x27;s of Old Bond. This soap performs just as great as them.  The smell is girlfriend approved and the Shea butter leaves your face feeling moisturized. My test of a soap is how much alcohol burn my face feels after splashing my aftershave and this soap conditions well and leaves me with no or little burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lathering is easy if you start with a dryer brush. Too wet and it gets too sudsy to form up. After about 10 slow swirls face lathering is quick and fills the brush for multiple passes. The lather doesn&#x27;t dry on the face and rinses off clean.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. If you are a mug and brush shaver then this will work well for you. Lathers easily and rinses quickly. The smell is very pleasant and not overpowering. Highly recommended. I have been using it for years and each tin lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> No complaints about this luxurious shaving soap.  It lathers up real nice, is not too strongly scented, and creates a nice slick layer allowing the razor to glide.  Works best with a double edge or straight edge razor.  I tested it with a cartridge razor and it works just as good.  Rinses off cleanly and has great moisturizing properties that leave your skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the best shave soap I&#x27;ve tried - better than Proraso or RazoRock. Excellent lather and fantastic slickness. No more nicks, even with a new blade. The only downside is the scent - it just smells like soap.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the soap lathers nicely and all, but I just don&#x27;t like it. First of all, you can&#x27;t even get the soap out of the tin. If you have a shaving brush I guess it doesn&#x27;t matter, but I had to chip it out and use flakes to actually get lather. And the tin itself is really cheap and dents easily (I was expecting something slightly more heavy duty). So I guess I&#x27;m just going back to conditioner as my shaving cream.</li>
            <li> this soap is just plain amazing !!!! Rich thick lather yet very moisturizing and slick. The scent is subtle of a floral nature and makes the shave experience more enjoyable from a smell perspective. A little goes a long way either face or bowl lathered and easily appx. 3-4 whirls is enough soap to complete 3 passes with at least a 4th pass of lather left over if you need to do some touch ups. I have relatively hard water and have no problems creating a lather..... not much more to say than hit the add to cart button and while your at it add the matching shea butter ASB as it is wonderful as well and compliments the great scent of this soap while further moisturizing your skin. bith thumbs up on this one guys.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, with great lather and skin softening properties.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great for sensitive skin! He loves this stuff...it way seem like a lot of $$ compared to the cans of shave soap, but he shaves his face every other day and 1 tin lasts about 8-10 months.</li>
            <li> Pleasant subtle scent.  Nice screw top aluminum container.  Makes fine lather.  I like to rotate between different shave soaps during the week.  This is part of my regular rotation.  French origin gives a bit of exclusivity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  One can will last a year and that&#x27;s with daily shaving.  I use the Ambroley badger shaving brush and I&#x27;ve never had any issues.</li>
            <li> I have used dozens of shaving soaps.  This soap can run with the big boys.  Easy to lather and a clean and fresh scent.  Really slick lather that let&#x27;s your blade glide nicely.  Cleans up easily and leaves a soft face behind.  This puck should last 3-4 months of daily usage.</li>
            <li> I want to start this review by saying that I bought this product because I really like the aftershave. The smell is fantastic, has a nice clean scent that is quite pleasant. However, while the packaging is nice, I do not get an enjoyable shave. I use I use Astra Blades, EJ DE89 safety razor, and Semogue boar brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve attempted to use a large amount of product to build my lather in a bowl with my brush, but I&#x27;ve never able to get the creamy consistency I get with other products (I have about 7 others from various brands). When I apply it to my prepped face, it&#x27;s always thin, no matter how much product I put on. I&#x27;ve tried using this product about 10 times over the past month with various product - water ratio, with very little success. Each time I shave, I get an irritating shave without good glide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I do not recommend this product. If you&#x27;re new and don&#x27;t want to spend too much, I&#x27;d recommend trying any of the Taylor of Old Bond Street shave creams. It is so easy to get a creamy and smooth lather with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But take my review with a grain of salt. Everyone&#x27;s shaving experience with a certain product is different. YMMV</li>
            <li> Lathers up very easy and has a light scent. Gives a great shave and skin feels great afterward. For the price its hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Works well, smells great. Made from Palm oil... I never thought to check. Very sad about it.</li>
            <li> This Shave soap is a great buy, especially if you are looking for a soap with a light scent, good lathering, and is will last you for a good number of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of the soap is almost non existent, and is akin to plain old bar soap, but in a good way. The soap is easy on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave much residue on the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tin it comes in is an added bonus as well, great for travel and won&#x27;t rust with time.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product I recommend</li>
            <li> it is my first time to try a shaving soup and it was perfect for me the smooth the density the creaming and the smell it was fantastic i was shaving with cremes and gels products and i have a sensitive skin but after this product i realized i have been wrong all the time so definitely this will be my ideal shaving soup because i will try several but i don&#x27;t think i will find a better one</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make much foam but it does work alright for shaving.</li>
            <li> Great lather, stickiness,  after shave feel. Light scent of Soap.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am fairly new to wet shaving and have bought several different kinds of shaving soap, nine to be exact.  This is my second favorite (MWF is my favorite).  It is a triple milled soap from France and makes good lather.  It is nicely packaged.  It is a joy to shave with.</li>
            <li> I waited a few weeks to write this review because I am new to using a safety razor. I found this soap to have a subtle smell which for me was a must. It lathers quickly (I lather directly on face). After 3 weeks of daily use it looks like hardly any soap has been used. Should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this shaving soap. Rich, thick lather, pleasant scent, that&#x27;s not overpowering. It shaves wonderfully and leaves your face moisturized and feeling great.</li>
            <li> Great scent - very green. Not overpowering but strong enough to make enjoyable. Easy to load and lather. Very slick and no dissipation.</li>
            <li> Lathers easily. Nice scent. I would give it 5 stars but the only con I have is that the lather does not last as long as other shaving soaps I have used, RazoRock or Proraso.</li>
            <li> I have to say I enjoy this soap. It works into a good lather and the razor slides real easy and slick on my face (using a Gillette Fusion). I didn&#x27;t have a brush so had to cut the biscuit in half to get it out of the tin to rub into a lather. I think I&#x27;ll get a brush and see how good that does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always used aftershave lotion when shaving with Gillette Foamy or Barbasol, but didn&#x27;t have to use any lotion with this soap. It was pretty cool that my face wasn&#x27;t irritated after shaving. I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m on sold on it :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, whip shave soap with pleasant, soft aroma. Shipped promptly and in excellent packaging. Thanks much</li>
            <li> This shaving soap lives up to all the hype.  The blade glides effortlessly and give me a nice shave and my skin feels great after.</li>
            <li> The reason I ordered this was the description of the smell other reviewers gave it. They were right, the smell is incredible, and although long lasting, very mild. I will buy this again. It lathers very easily for a hard soap.</li>
            <li> This one tin last me what must have been 2 years of every other day shaving.  Makes great shaving cream, smells great.....couldn&#x27;t ask for a better shave soap.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, smooth, leaves skin feelin great. Comes in it&#x27;s own tin FTW! Oh, and great price. What&#x27;s there not to like? This great soap has earned a spot in my shave soap rotation.</li>
            <li> This soap has quickly become one of my favorites! It has a very sharp, clean, citrusy scent that some people love and some hate. I have no problems lathering this soap -- it practically throws itself onto my brush -- and it provides an excellent, slick shave with plenty of cushion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face feels nice and moisturized after shaving, probably an effect of the shea butter. A nice hard milled soap like this will last several months, at least, so for the price this is a very economical choice, as well.</li>

            <li> This is my first shaving soap, after a long spell of using shaving creams. I expected I&#x27;d end up trying it, finding it difficult to create a good lather, and go back to using my creams. Instead, I&#x27;ve been using this every day since I received it. It makes a wonderful lather, with a light floral scent that is surprisingly refreshing. It took me a little experimentation on how to create a lather with it, but if you have experience creating a good lather with soaps I expect that you won&#x27;t have much difficulty with this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that once you&#x27;ve got a good lather with this soap, it will provide enough lubrication to allow your razor to glide across your skin. The scent, as I&#x27;ve said, is light. It reminds me of a floral bouquet, is not overpowering, and surprising -- I expected, when I initially smelled it, that I would not enjoy it. Instead, I&#x27;ve come to enjoy it over my previous cream&#x27;s lemon-lime scent because it isn&#x27;t overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;d like to wake up and feel refreshed, or go to bed relaxed, you can&#x27;t go wrong by ending your bathroom routine by shaving with this soap.</li>
            <li> very good! I would return to buy</li>
            <li> excellent soap!!! nice subtle kind of herbal aroma, not too strong. nice lather. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Great lather from a pretty hard soap -- this thing will last until two years after I&#x27;m dead. Scent is pretty good as well -- some reviews described it as &amp;#34;soapy,&amp;#34; but I didn&#x27;t find that to really be the case. It&#x27;s hard for me to pinpoint, but it&#x27;s definitely a fresher scent. Think of a SIGNIFICANTLY toned-down Arko with slightly more of an herbal tone. Really great soap. One of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Very Very close to Martin De Candre. This lathers very well and smell decent. Like soap. Not too strong and it provide good slick protection on your face. The lather is nice and thick.</li>
            <li> My husband loved his stocking stuffer. He says that it makes a great lather and does not dry his face.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent product.  It is kind to the skin, stands up a beard very well and smells good.  It also lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is the charge for shipping.  It was well beyond what it should have cost but because I bought it&lt;br /&gt;one click I had no idea I was being hosed on the shipping.  I would not buy from them again.</li>
            <li> Truly loved by my fiance.He has always enjoys this brand and only purchases it. So happy to find it on line for less without driving 100 miles to purchase it.</li>
            <li> ***** UPDATED AUG&#x27; 2015 ******&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over two years later and I still love this stuff just as much as the day I wrote the original review. A lot of things have changed in the 2+ years I&#x27;ve been using it: I use a safety razor and sometimes a straight razor to shave now, my entire shave routine is different, and I have tried literally dozens of shave creams/soaps. But some things have stayed the same throughout. This is still my favorite shave soap/cream I&#x27;ve ever tried. I&#x27;m still on my original tin! No I&#x27;m not a daily shaver and I have a dozen or so soaps and creams I rotate out when I do shave but even after 2 years this is still the soap I reach for the most. The scent is still just as strong as the day I bought it and I have not noticed any drop off in the quality of the lather even with my original tin. If you are on the fence about purchasing it, just do it. Get a cheap boar bristle brush, buy this shave soap, and just see what you&#x27;ve been missing. You will not be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***** Original Review Below *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite shaving soap / cream I&#x27;ve used so far. I personally have or had (before finishing) AoS Sandlewood and Unscented, Trufitt&amp;hill Unscented and Almond, countless numbers of canned shaving cream, and of course Pre de Provence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do I like Pre de Provence the best? It&#x27;s price / performance / smell just make it an amazing product. My favorite thing about it is the smell. It just smells like what you would think shaving cream would smell like. It also reminds me strongly of something my grandfather used to use. Not in the it smells like an old man sense, but it just has a wonderfully clean smell. My wife and I are in our late 20s and she absolutely loves the smell of it on me. Compared to AoS and Trufitt&amp;hill I personally prefer the smell of this. AoS Sandlewood while I liked it at first it&#x27;s just such a big, thick, heavy scent that I grow tired of it if I use it very often. Trufitt&amp;hill Almond smells great and I have nothing bad to say about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The performance is what you would except from shaving soap. Remember this is not a shaving cream so it doesn&#x27;t lather as much as a cream. However for me its not a problem at all. I just wet the brush and swirl it around a few times on the top of the soap and it provides enough to lather my entire face twice. My razor (a Mach 3) glides on my face without hanging up and I get a very clean, nice shave. By the end of my second lather my face is super smooth and soft. I bought the soap with the aftershave and have always used them together so I can&#x27;t speak for by itself, however I can tell you that the smell lingers on my face without being overpowering and lasts for hours. Whenever I use Pre de Provence I don&#x27;t use cologne because the smell is so good. AoS and Trufitt&amp;hill are shaving creams and simply just lather more. You can whip them almost into a meringue especially with a lather bowl (btw if you like to whip your lather don&#x27;t use a shaving cup, it&#x27;s small and you can&#x27;t really get a good whip. I personally use an animal food bowl. It&#x27;s stainless and cleans easy. It can fit in the palm of your hand and has a wider opening than a cup and it heats up soaking in warm water and keeps the lather warm.) You simply won&#x27;t get that kind of performance with a shaving soap. But again it wasn&#x27;t an issue for me because while the lather wasn&#x27;t as good, the actual shave was. And the finish was great with all 3 of these. Also I find my shaves are faster with Pre de Provence because I don&#x27;t have to whip it and can just go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price. This is where Pre de Provence simply blows them away. It&#x27;s 1/3 to 1/2 of the price of the other two and gives me the same performance with a smell I prefer to either. It&#x27;s great. Nothing else to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to go back and do it again I would simply skip the Art of Shaving stuff. It&#x27;s expensive but not the best out there so it&#x27;s hard to feel ok about paying the price. I&#x27;d buy thisfor my scented and I would use the Trufitt&amp;hill for my Unscented. This isn&#x27;t the place for it but the Trufitt&amp;hill is an amazing shaving cream. The one things would recommend would be to buy Pre de Provence along with the after shave. For the price it&#x27;s absolutely worth giving it a shot.</li>
            <li> This product is to dry I have to mix it with another shave gel although it foams quite nicely .</li>
            <li> This was my 2nd purchase of this product, the one tin will last me over a year of daily shaving.  Works perfectly for my sensitive skin.  Would recommend it to anyone shaving with a blade.</li>
            <li> As second shave soap it out performed my last one by a lot! The scent isn&#x27;t over powering and it makes a decent lather. For the price I would recommend for fist time buyers or for anyone really.</li>
            <li> In my 79 years I have tried many shaving soaps (I just like the process of soaping up instead of squirting something from a pressurized can) and will search no more; I doubt that a better produce exists.  This product: lathers up easily, no swirling and swirling the brush to get enough lather for a smooth shave; gives me a smooth shave with no irritation, and my skin is very sensitive; will last a long time, after using the mug for over a month it appears to be as full of soap as when I first opened it.  Shaving with this soap is so pleasurable that I am using it throughout the summer, when I usually switch to a mentholated gel just for the coolness.</li>
            <li> Great shaving soap, use a boar brush for best lather.</li>
            <li> First the good news. The quality of this shave soap is just what I had in mind. It creates mounds of luxurious creamy lather with a light fresh smell with just a minimum of effort. It lubricates effectively and rinses quickly leaving my skin feeling healthy and smooth. No an easy trick for a guy in his sixties. This would be my first choise of shave soup except for one annoying issue. It is way to large to fit into my [[ASIN:B000FIH8XO Edwin Jagger Rn46 Traditional Black Porcelain Shaving Soap Bowl With Handle, Black]]. I had to take a peeler and shave it down to even think about squeesing it into my mug. Amazon does a great job letting me know if a GM Starter will fit my car, if the ink I want fits my printer. Hopefully they will someday let me know if the soap I want to buy from them fits the mug I already bought from them. Meanwhile, I will rely on the Amazon community to let me know if they have a favorite shea butter soap that fits my muy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 3 other shave soaps in the last few weeks -- I have a year&#x27;s worth left - expensive experiment -- and I like this the best.  Functions well with good lather and pleasant fragrance.  I&#x27;ve been using shave cream from various quality vendors for the last several years.  I was curious about shave soaps which is why I started the experiment.  So far, Pre de Provence is the clear winner over several others that were acceptable and one that was not.</li>
            <li> great lather. great smell. great product. I would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a quality shave soap for a good price</li>
            <li> This soap is simply awesome!  Lathers well even with my hard water and is very slick.  Smell is nice and subtle and rinses clean.  This is a classic product for good reason.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for son, who loves product and is stationed in the Middle East.  Had purchased previously while traveling and was pleased to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Started with Proraso and then tried a couple different TOBS. This stuff is breathed new life into my shave.  Scent isn&#x27;t overpowering which is very important to me. The lather is just thick enough but it&#x27;s light and airy. No cuts with it, ever. I used to have to moisturize after a shave with coconut oil as I have pretty sensitive skin, but after using this a couple of times it&#x27;s become an option.  Has also lasted much longer than anything comparable in container size. It won&#x27;t hurt to try.</li>
            <li> Those of us who have re-discovered double-edge shaving after years of the expensive&lt;br /&gt;nightmare of techno-gizmos that don&#x27;t shave for beans are always looking for the perfect&lt;br /&gt;hat-trick combination of shaver, blades and soap. I currently use a Merkur 180 long handle&lt;br /&gt;along with Feather blades and now Pre de Provence soap completes the puzzle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap lathers up quickly and has what I can only describe as an adult scent to it. I now&lt;br /&gt;look forward to my morning ritual and cannot imagine using a different soap again.</li>
            <li> I still use a shaving cup and brush and this is the BEST shaving soap I have ever used.  Softens the beard and smells good too.  I always have a spare in the house.</li>
            <li> I shimmied it out of the tin box and into my shaving bowl and was excited to try a new soap. Unfortunately it smelled very flowery/perfume (I don&#x27;t know about you but I don&#x27;t like to go to work smelling like flowers) &amp; it dries up your skin worse than a regular bar of hand soap. So I decided to put it in the shower for my girlfriend to use as regular soap but she threw it in the trash! She said it dried up her skin too. I&#x27;m not sure why this has so many good reviews??? Perhaps I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving soap. I put it up there with some of the best I have used. It has a lovely light floral kind of scent that is very pleasant. The performance is very good. It has a nice thick lather that is very stable and gives a really nice amount of slickness and protection. I have used about 20 different soaps and this one stays in my top 5 rotation. A must for any wet shavers collection.</li>
            <li> Great shaving soap. Doesn&#x27;t lather to the extent that some others do, like Mitchell&#x27;s Wool Fat or Martin de Candre, but this stuff is slick as all get out. The shea butter moisturizes well and doesn&#x27;t leave my face too dry. Very nice fragrance, a calm sage/herb scent that I keep coming back to.</li>
            <li> Great shave soap. It has a very classic soap scent, sorta like the soap your grandparents used to use. However, it wont make you smell &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; and it lathers great. The lather will be really thick and does really well with your brush being very wet to provide a good amount of slick and lather.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to try with my new DE razor. Unfortunately he was not interested in trying either. So i&#x27;m using it and I love it. It works better than my normal can shaving cream with my DE razor. I definitely plan on buying more when I run out of my current one.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. He said it leaves his skin soft and lathers nicely. We love the nice clean scent too. He likes it just as much as the expensive stuff at Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li> What I like about Pre de Provence better.  Smell, comes in a nice tin, leaves my skin feeling softer than Praso.  What I like about Praso better.  Tingly feeling,  Use less, better thicker lather.</li>
            <li> It is like a trip to France. Does not clog my razor.</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time last night. The scent is light and unobtrusive, my brush loaded quickly on the puck, and an &amp;uuml;berlather in a bowl with just a tiny bit of [[ASIN:B002L03N74 CO Bigelow Premium Menthol Shave Cream with Eucalyptus Oil - 5.2 oz]] came up into thick peaks very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gave me a very comfortable shave with a new [[ASIN:B001QY8QXM Astra SP blade]], and no irritation of a problem area on my neck. Not a single nick or weeper anywhere. The shea butter moisturizes well and left my face smooth without the need for alum or alcohol-based aftershave splash. I did, however, follow up with [[ASIN:B001BR97A0 Thayer Cucumber Witch Hazel with Aloe Vera 12 oz]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great bath soaps (I use [[ASIN:B000IQSTV8 Pre De Provence Green Tea Soap]] and it&#x27;s the best soap I&#x27;ve yet used), and now a great shave soap. I&#x27;m convinced of the quality of Pre de Provence.</li>
            <li> Man it makes nice lather!  Smells pretty good, I get a great shave with it very close and no weepers.  My face fells really good after the shave. (Does not dry me out)  the price is the only downside I can see.</li>
            <li> I have tried many vegan soaps that claim to be as good as tallow based soaps only to be disappointed in either their performance, how they leave my face feeling when I&#x27;m done, or both.  Most wet shavers agree that tallow/lanolin based soaps are definitely the holy grail when it comes to overall performance.  However, there is a price: they can be notoriously difficult to lather, especially based on water hardness.  But I was pleasantly surprised with PdP.  Not only is it a delicious smelling soap, but also it&#x27;s incredibly easy to load and lather, performs beautifully with regards to glide and cushion, and leaves my face feeling supple and smooth...not dry and tight as some soaps can.  It contains shea butter along with other essential plant oils that really do the trick.  The scent is very fresh, clean, and botanical with a sweetness akin to bananas.  It is a fairly strong scented soap, but not to the point of being cloying or obtrusive.  The puck is a generous 5.25 oz, and it&#x27;s a typical hard milled French soap, so even if you soak your pucks in warm water it still should last you a good while.  My only complaint is that the mouth of the tin is narrow (about 3&amp;#34; across) which may be a problem for some when it comes to loading and lathering based on brush size (hence 4/5 stars), but it wouldn&#x27;t stop me from purchasing it again.  Price wise, it&#x27;s a decent value for a quality product.  And it&#x27;s animal friendly (if that&#x27;s important to you); definitely another plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking to pull the trigger on it I would definitely say without hesitation, got for it!</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite shaving soap. Slick and comfortable 100 out of 10</li>
            <li> Real nice triple milled hard shaving soap!</li>
            <li> Best way to shave, great for travel as it is not a &amp;#34;liquid&amp;#34; so you can pack in luggage.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers easily and provides a very close, comfortable shave.  As it is a very hard soap, I recommend a rather stiff brush; boar bristle seems to work pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is worth noting that this soap is about 25 percent shea butter.  According to Wikipedia:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accounts from as early as Cleopatra&#x27;s Egypt speak of caravan bearing clay jars of valuable shea butter for cosmetic use. The funeral beds of early kings were carved in wood of shea trees. Shea butter&#x27;s amazing skin care and healing properties were first harnessed thousands of years ago. The history of shea as a precious commodity can be traced back to Ancient Egypt, where shea butter was and continues to be used to protect the hair and skin against the fierce sun and the hot dry winds of African deserts and savannah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is incredibly moisturizing.  If you are presently using a shaving foam from can, note that these products contain chemicals, such as alcohol, which actually dry the skin.  Treat yourself to a tin of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I alternate between Pre de Provenance, Mitchell’s Wool Fat Soap, and Geo. F. Trumper’s creams.  Any one of these is sure to please.</li>
            <li> EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;After having used this for a few months, I need to go back and completely re-write my original review. While at first I found the lather this soap produces to be sub-par compared to the dozens of other soaps I have used, recent usage has completely changed my mind. Once you break past the outer layer of soap the lather becomes much richer with each use. The lather you produce is slick and thick providing a lot of protection for your face while shaving. The post-shave experience is lightly moisturizing and leaves your face feeling very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this is a hard soap I would strongly recommend that you use more water if you aren&#x27;t getting the slick performance you are expecting. This soap can take a lot more water than you might think, and the additional water helps the soap produce a rich lather that is one of the best I have used to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;This product has many rave reviews, but to me it is just an OK soap. It lathers fairly easily, but the lather isn&#x27;t all that moisturizing and I found it lacking in slickness and cushion. For the same price there are dozens of artisans that serve the wet shaving community that make superior soaps from higher quality ingredients.</li>
            <li> Lathers up extremely quickly into a nice thick foam. Very good cushioning effect and I love the aroma. I&#x27;ve tried many soaps that are just way to strong a smell. This is milder but very pleasant. I&#x27;ll definitely order this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been using shaving brush soaps for very long, and have been trying several, but I think I can stop for now with this one.  First thing you&#x27;ll notice is that it has a very nice smell, fairly strong, but not overpowering.  My brother in law isn&#x27;t much for it... it&#x27;s not feminine at all, yet complex &amp; not harsh.&lt;br /&gt;Next, it is a very compact soap, I&#x27;ve been using in now for a couple of months, and you can see very little gone from the can.  I&#x27;m going to try heavier than usual use &amp; see, but this one can might normally last me a year?!?&lt;br /&gt;Very slick on the skin, razor cushioning is great, after i&#x27;m done, i wipe with a towel, and the skin is perfectly soft as well as smooth. Also, this product doesn&#x27;t make my skin tighten up like I&#x27;d been sunburned like some of the cheap stuff has.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  This builds up a nice lather quickly, smells nice, and doesnt have an overly powerful or lingering smell. Just what you need for a nice shave.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous shave soap.  I use this to shave my legs, and it has a very clean and pleasant smell that is not feminine or masculine really, it just smells clean.  I make a lather with my badger brush and an additional bowl. You need a very small bit of the soap to make an impressive amount of shave foam, but you have to really whip it up and add a water to the foam mixture slowly.  I am very impressed with this shave soap, and I will definitely buy this again in the future.</li>
            <li> Works so much better than shave creme. Lasts a long time. Smells great. Works great for legs, face and underarms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for several months now, and it does the job great.  It took me only a couple of tries to get used to how much water to use and so on, and now I can easily get a nice, thick lather from it.  The scent is nice and subtle.  No complaints here.</li>
            <li> I like this soap (I love the after shave balm) I have been using it for 20 years. It leathers well for me even in hard water, but does not lay down the oil enriched shaving cushion that I like. By the way I use 8 different creams and soaps in my shaving routine rotation.</li>
            <li> This is a very hard, long-lasting, clean smelling soap. Upon opening the tin, you get a blast of very herby, sharp scented soap, but upon lathering, this turns into a smooth, floral scent that lingers. The shea butter leaves the skin exceptionally soft (especially for sensitive skin). The lather is very thick and creamy. This is my daily shaving soap.</li>
            <li> Love it -- lathers well and smells good.</li>
            <li> The Pre de Provence soap is not cheap but it is good, very good. It is a generously sized soap in an excellent tin which will be used for other soaps once this is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap works very well for me. Used with various double edged razors, mostly differen 1950&#x27;s and 60&lt;br /&gt;s model TTO Gillette Double Edge Razors (adjustable Fat Boys and non-adjustable) and Astra blades I get less razor burns and cuts with this soap than with my soaps from the Colonel. The results are about the same as with my Proraso creams. Very nice shaving soap. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with a silver tip badger brush soaked in hot water for a few minutes. I work the surface of the soap for a minute with the wet brush to get it all soapy. Then I move to a ceramic bowl pre-heated with water where I quickly work up a beautiful lather that stays hot in the bowl.</li>
            <li> Makes a great lather and has a subtle, but pleasant smell that will not make you smell like your grandfather. I may or may not have caught my wife using this to shave her legs. Would not recommend using as a thickening agent in gravy.</li>
            <li> Bought as a birthday gift!  He loved it!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of different shave soaps and I would say this is one of the best.  It produces a thick lather easily and shaves great.  It has a light fragrance to it that is pleasant but not powerful, and leaves my skin feeling smooth as silk.  Highly recommend.  I even bought another for my wife to shave her legs with.</li>
            <li> Upon first opening the tin you are greeted with a fresh herbal scent that is very pleasant.  The soap loads rapidly on your brush and quickly works into a slick, protective lather.  The best part is the post-shave feel.  It leaves your face feeling soft and smooth for hours after your shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason that I didn&#x27;t rate this higher is that the scent of the soap doesn&#x27;t seem to last into lathering.  Great product overall.</li>
