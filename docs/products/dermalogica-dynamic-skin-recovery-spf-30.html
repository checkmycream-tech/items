            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Well and a few other dermalogica products.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I can tell a difference in my complexion since starting the AgeSmart facial regimen.  Smells wonderful and my friends say my face glows.</li>
            <li> finally! this is me saying that it&#x27;s the best stuff out there only for ME, i dunno about you, i tried many things and this stuff is expensive for a reason...it doesn&#x27;t dry out or shine with grease to your skin....it&#x27;s 50 bucks for 1.7 ounces on their site, and this is supposed to be like 150 bucks on their site....this is a steal!!!</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive so my esthetician turned me on to this.  It&#x27;s amazing and I have been using it for a couple of years now.</li>
            <li> Love the 30 SPF.  A little goes a long way.  I have used it for years and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Great for my sensitive skin.  I like the high spf combined with the quality moisturizer.  Use it with ultrasensitive calming serum.  No makeup necessary, gives your face a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Good light weight moisturizer for face, neck and de collage. Non greasy and quickly absorbed, added bonus of sunscreen. Would recommend, particularly for sensitive skins.</li>
            <li> I do not believe this item is new.  It was not sealed and it was not in a box.  I am returning it and am very disappointed with this order.</li>
            <li> Nearly perfect. Rich, but not too rich. It&#x27;s SPF30 but it doesn&#x27;t take 5 minutes to rub it in. A lovely, natural scent and a very fair price. A+</li>
            <li> large bottle, so slightly concerned that might not be able to finish it before expiry date. otherwise pleased with the item.</li>
            <li> When I sweat it goes into my eyes and makes them burn.  I don&#x27;t have that problem with Elta MD Clear.</li>
            <li> I have similar case to the those who gave purchase 1 star. The bottle is not in Dermalogica box and not sealed. The bottle looks old. I kinda regret not return it to Amazon. I have used it for more than 2 weeks. I have not seen any noticeable results.</li>
            <li> One of the few sunblocks that doesn&#x27;t make me break out. It&#x27;s less drying that most, but still drying, but I doubt that I&#x27;ll ever find a sunblock that isn&#x27;t, it seems to be the nature of the product. Amazon had the best price I could find, especially since my previous source stopped carrying the entire Dermalogica line for some odd reason.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this product before &amp; it came in original pkg. The larger one does not, it is simply taped with a typed label on it. I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was authentic product until I smelled it &amp; tried it.  Still have concerns, but I&#x27;m using it. Great deal, twice the size of 1.7 oz &amp; fast shipping. Just wish it came in a Dermacologica box...</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer with SPF30. Takes a few minutes to completely be absorbed but is light and does not cause any breakouts. This is important as I have very sensitive dry skin.  It also has a very slight cool tingle when first applied which I also like. Good sun protection. I have been using for over a year.</li>
            <li> Smooth on the skin, absorbers easily . It is part of my daily morning routine. It goes well with make up. I wish it would be less expensive. I will have to try others to protect my budget.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, my wife loves this. Well and a few other dermalogica products.</li>
            <li> Nice. But feel different from what the pump has...?? I have used the pump one before and think this is different in texture and quality. Would be good if some users of this professional pack can talk about this.</li>
            <li> I love the Dynamic Skin Recovery lotion.  I use it every morning!  It it light, soaks in quickly, and does not leave a greasy or shiny appearance afterwards.  Highly recommend! I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years now, and believe it has really helped to stop the apperance of wrinkles and aging on my face and neck.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I am using this product for more then a year. Great product good price, shipped immediatlly and arrived on time</li>
            <li> I prefer tinted COTZ face sunscreen, this one makes my skin oily and burns my eyes!</li>
            <li> Superior moisturizing even in dry, high altitude climate.  Saved over department store pricing</li>
