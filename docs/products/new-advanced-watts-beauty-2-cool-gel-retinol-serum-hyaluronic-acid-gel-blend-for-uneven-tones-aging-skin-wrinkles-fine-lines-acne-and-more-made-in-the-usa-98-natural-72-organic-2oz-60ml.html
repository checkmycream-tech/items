            <li>this product is amazing and great price</li>
            <li>I have fairly good skin, but around my chin can be a problem area for me when it comes to acne.</li>
            <li>GOOD</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m in good shape, no one</li>
            <li>This product feels so good going on, leaves your skin feeling silky - even after you wake up in the morning.</li>
            <li>I have fair skin</li>
            <li>good product for the price</li>
            <li>I like to make my own beauty creams</li>
            <li>Gentle but working wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>It really is the best product for giving your skin a radiant glow.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use sunscreen at all times during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Watts Beauty :)</li>
            <li>the more persuaded I was to buy one</li>
            <li>My face feels more taught, and my complexion is brighter and seems more even.</li>
            <li>glad i followed the bottles directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I assume this will take more time to take effect...</li>
            <li>BUT THEN MOST THINGS DO</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m in love.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>But, with using a serum, you also need lotion or cream to go on top, doesn&#x27;t need to be Watts.</li>
            <li>I always make sure when nearing the end</li>
            <li>Love this stuff...</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I decided to try this Watts Beauty product.  </li>
            <li>Love it my skin looks clearer more even and better</li>
            <li>I love this stuff</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Will be purchasing again that is for sure.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love all the watts products.</li>
            <li>Love this product for night time use and came on time.</li>
            <li>After I wash w/cleanser, use toner, (make sure toner dries all the way on skin/face)  </li>
            <li>I decided to try other products on this line, since I really liked the Peptide Serum, which in my opinion is comparable to Boots No. 7 Protect &amp; Perfect.</li>
            <li>But I found this product to contain a good amount of Hyaluronic Acid which is very moisturizing and nurturing for the skin!</li>
            <li>I am positive that it will give good results after continuos use.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a true bargian!</li>
            <li>Like product and seller easy to work with</li>
            <li>I love the consistency of it and have easily removed many blackheads that just pop right out.</li>
            <li>I have been using it about 3 weeks now and can see visible improvements in my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t see much difference but now after almost 3 weeks of using it I can tell that some fine lines I had have greatly diminished to almost not being visible.</li>
            <li>My skin looked so radiant and smooth.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product, but I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed any difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I cut back on usage and is working great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve now been using this this serum for several MONTHS with great results.</li>
            <li>so smooth &amp; healthy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It glows, smooth, and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Simply because their products are dependable, organic, and mostly they are made in the USA!!  </li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for a week but already it has made an astounding difference to the tone and texture of my skin!</li>
            <li>I was so excited after reading reviews to order this</li>
            <li>So far, I love it!</li>
            <li>I feel that it spreads more easily, and dries much more quickly than a regular moisturizer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After scouring Amazon reviews for the most modestly priced cream that was rated high enough, I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed not just by retinol&#x27;s effects, but also</li>
            <li>Talk about nice young looking skin in a bottle...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel cool at all .</li>
            <li>I started using this Watts Beauty 2% Cool Retinol Serum 5 and noticed a clearer, softer, brighter, younger-looking face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not harsh on the skin and it lights the age spot pretty good as well.  </li>
            <li>It helps with my acne (I have super oily acne-prone skin).</li>
            <li>I have noticed that that particular area is drying out and feels much better.</li>
            <li>The main reason I would recommend using the serum, over anything else, is because your skin absorbs the serum whereas lotion just sits on the top of your skin, and you want your skin to absorb that Retinol.</li>
            <li>so much is because it is a wonderful combo of Hyaluronic Acid, Green tea, Retinol, etc.</li>
            <li>I think it may be too soon to tell if there are any &#x27;dramatic&#x27; effects, but I honestly think this is great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident that there are positive effects on my face and neck because I can SEE a really positive effect on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So I will be patient and I will be back for more!</li>
            <li>I think it is a great introductory retinol everyday cream.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product as it seems to be doing more for my wrinkles then anything so far.</li>
            <li>I understand 34 is still young but good quality skin care needs to start at a young age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Drys pretty quick on my skin and doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t smell and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Maybe as I get older I might try more expenisive brands, but for now this one is absolutely</li>
            <li>This definitely is worth trying and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Very gentle.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle on the face</li>
            <li>it does exactly.</li>
            <li>the Prime account is in his name ;)</li>
            <li>I have tried many different brands of Retinols, but the reason I like Watts</li>
            <li>It is good, although not as powerful as another Retinol 1% lotion I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I put this on every night then use the some drops of the Argon Oil in my Simple moisturizer and my skin has never been better.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>Like how does this really help anyone right?</li>
            <li>at first I was very apprehensive to try the serum just because it was online</li>
            <li>This product works pretty well for evening out skin tone but can&#x27;t see where it has done much in the way of diminishing wrinkles.</li>
            <li>This Retinol Serum is cool and natural.</li>
            <li>Really clears complexion well</li>
            <li>Thanks yet again</li>
            <li>I guess its because that skin doesnt have much padding and is really susceptible to the elements....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried much pricier retinol products that did nothing.</li>
            <li>I have been using this produce since March of 2014 and use it all over my face, neck, and eye area with no irritating results.  </li>
            <li>Must not be much since I gave it away</li>
            <li>Really cleared my face of ache and brightened my skin.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>My skin looks brighter and feels much softer.</li>
            <li>and I was using too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very vain about my skin &amp; worried about wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I have honestly been skeptical of retinol creams, but as I get older and the more research I do about their antiaging effects</li>
            <li>My make-up goes on so smooth &amp; which  I can wear less and less of it because my skin looks so good.</li>
            <li>this particular</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think at 60 years old there was much hope.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product along with the Argon Gold (Moroccan Oil).</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s far better than more expensive products i&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>This Retinol Serum works very well at eliminating dry, flaky skin and keeping it clean and clear Wear it day or night.</li>
            <li>It just feels like a normal gel to me.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a significant difference in the texture, softness and tone in my skin that I couldnt get with any of my other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out any more than usual, but it also doesn&#x27;t clear up my existing acne any faster.</li>
            <li>I have mild but stubborn acne that&#x27;s difficult to control with most products, so I wanted to try this before seeing a dermatologist.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the actual retinol content is much lower than what the package states.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with using it on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Wow. .</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Retinol&amp;#34; the only thing that really rids of wrinkles</li>
            <li>I am surprised.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be working for me although it is too early to tell.</li>
            <li>Only don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>I am 28 years old and decided to add an anti aging to my beauty routine.</li>
            <li>(wait for it to completely soak in).</li>
            <li>I didnt think that that area really need it, but the bottle suggested to use a bit on the hands and that is where I can see the most dramatic effects so far.</li>
            <li>I put it on every night and have clearer and smoother skin, consistently over several months, than I had prior when I was using a weaker retinol moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Not only does this product have a high percentage of the stuff, it also contains vitamin C and hyaluronic acid, which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for something that actually works!</li>
            <li>I have tried many facial products (age 55) and have had dull skin issues.</li>
            <li>What I really like is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>its only been a week so far!</li>
            <li>nothing major and</li>
            <li>and I am hoping by the time I get to the end of this bottle, I will see a major difference.  </li>
            <li>I have not seen major improvement on wrinkles but will keep on using.</li>
            <li>Also, I am hugely surprised with how well it works on the back of my hands.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin, and I can feel it tingle when I put on the gel, but I haven&#x27;t dried out at all.</li>
            <li>Plus their products are pure and you are paying a fraction of the cost that you would pay at a department store minus the additional ingredients that these department store products add that essentially dries  out &amp; eventually re-damaging your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so you are also purchasing products from a company with social responsibility.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed my normally large and very visible facial pores are hardly noticeable now.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first as I am truly spoiled by the High Grade, High Quality Skin Care products I purchase from Bellahut.com.</li>
            <li>I really like the combo and after using it every night before bed my crows feet are softer and less noticeable.</li>
            <li>What I really like is the under eye lines that I had are really much less visible.</li>
            <li>I did have slight dry flacking skin the first two days using but</li>
            <li>what it promises just I only use it every other day because my skin is very sensitive</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;m confident that there are positive effects on my face and neck because I can SEE a really positive effect on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So I will be patient and I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> I think it is a great introductory retinol everyday cream.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as it seems to be doing more for my wrinkles then anything so far.</li>
            <li> I understand 34 is still young but good quality skin care needs to start at a young age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Drys pretty quick on my skin and doesn&#x27;t rub off.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t smell and dries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Maybe as I get older I might try more expenisive brands, but for now this one is absolutely</li>
            <li> This definitely is worth trying and is very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Very gentle.  </li>
            <li> Very gentle on the face</li>
            <li> it does exactly.</li>
            <li> the Prime account is in his name ;)</li>
            <li> I have tried many different brands of Retinols, but the reason I like Watts</li>
            <li> It is good, although not as powerful as another Retinol 1% lotion I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I put this on every night then use the some drops of the Argon Oil in my Simple moisturizer and my skin has never been better.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Like how does this really help anyone right?</li>
            <li> at first I was very apprehensive to try the serum just because it was online</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well for evening out skin tone but can&#x27;t see where it has done much in the way of diminishing wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This Retinol Serum is cool and natural.</li>
            <li> Really clears complexion well</li>
            <li> Thanks yet again</li>
            <li> I guess its because that skin doesnt have much padding and is really susceptible to the elements....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried much pricier retinol products that did nothing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this produce since March of 2014 and use it all over my face, neck, and eye area with no irritating results.  </li>
            <li> Must not be much since I gave it away</li>
            <li> Really cleared my face of ache and brightened my skin.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter and feels much softer.</li>
            <li> and I was using too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very vain about my skin &amp; worried about wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have honestly been skeptical of retinol creams, but as I get older and the more research I do about their antiaging effects</li>
            <li> My make-up goes on so smooth &amp; which  I can wear less and less of it because my skin looks so good.</li>
            <li> this particular</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think at 60 years old there was much hope.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product along with the Argon Gold (Moroccan Oil).</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s far better than more expensive products i&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> This Retinol Serum works very well at eliminating dry, flaky skin and keeping it clean and clear Wear it day or night.</li>
            <li> It just feels like a normal gel to me.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a significant difference in the texture, softness and tone in my skin that I couldnt get with any of my other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out any more than usual, but it also doesn&#x27;t clear up my existing acne any faster.</li>
            <li> I have mild but stubborn acne that&#x27;s difficult to control with most products, so I wanted to try this before seeing a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the actual retinol content is much lower than what the package states.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with using it on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Wow. .</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Retinol&amp;#34; the only thing that really rids of wrinkles</li>
            <li> I am surprised.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be working for me although it is too early to tell.</li>
            <li> Only don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> I am 28 years old and decided to add an anti aging to my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> (wait for it to completely soak in).</li>
            <li> I didnt think that that area really need it, but the bottle suggested to use a bit on the hands and that is where I can see the most dramatic effects so far.</li>
            <li> I put it on every night and have clearer and smoother skin, consistently over several months, than I had prior when I was using a weaker retinol moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this product have a high percentage of the stuff, it also contains vitamin C and hyaluronic acid, which is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for something that actually works!</li>
            <li> I have tried many facial products (age 55) and have had dull skin issues.</li>
            <li> What I really like is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> its only been a week so far!</li>
            <li> nothing major and</li>
            <li> and I am hoping by the time I get to the end of this bottle, I will see a major difference.  </li>
            <li> I have not seen major improvement on wrinkles but will keep on using.</li>
            <li> Also, I am hugely surprised with how well it works on the back of my hands.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin, and I can feel it tingle when I put on the gel, but I haven&#x27;t dried out at all.</li>
            <li> Plus their products are pure and you are paying a fraction of the cost that you would pay at a department store minus the additional ingredients that these department store products add that essentially dries  out &amp; eventually re-damaging your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you are also purchasing products from a company with social responsibility.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed my normally large and very visible facial pores are hardly noticeable now.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first as I am truly spoiled by the High Grade, High Quality Skin Care products I purchase from Bellahut.com.</li>
            <li> I really like the combo and after using it every night before bed my crows feet are softer and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> What I really like is the under eye lines that I had are really much less visible.</li>
            <li> I did have slight dry flacking skin the first two days using but</li>
            <li> what it promises just I only use it every other day because my skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure why they call it &amp;#34;cool gel&amp;#34; though, because I don&#x27;t really feel any cooling sensation.</li>
            <li> Also, I found it strange that I haven&#x27;t noticed any physical sensations (cooling, tingling, stinging, etc.)</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with other retinol creams, but I can tell from the short amount of time that I have used this product that it definitely works.</li>
            <li> I use it at night, in conjunction with other products, and have definitely seen changes on my skin.</li>
            <li> use other Watts Beauty items and will definitely continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> I mean WOW!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it a little time and would like to see if it makes a difference for my skin.</li>
            <li> but I felt I needed a little something extra in my serum &amp; found  this serum</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints about Watts.</li>
            <li> and this just didn&#x27;t come close to other brands.</li>
            <li> I was afraid of peeling, but so far the only places that have peeled at all are the spots where recent pimples had gone down.</li>
            <li> when applying the serum that are common with other topical acne products - it basically feels like I&#x27;m just rubbing an inert gel-like substance on my face.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I will be looking elsewhere for a different product in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a former estithtician makeup artist and just plain beauty fanatic</li>
            <li> This and other all natural vitamin skin csre is all ill use.</li>
            <li> My face doesn&#x27;t feel tight at all like I was expecting since it contains retinol.</li>
            <li> It cools just a little bit.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed some improvement in the little bumps on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> Will update after a few months..</li>
            <li> Just a few drops at night.  </li>
            <li> Watts is one of the few companies that return to over, and over again.  </li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> In the morning/day I put a few drops of the WATTS Argon Gold Moroccan Oil in my &amp;#34;Olay&amp;#34; day moisturizer  (SPF 15).</li>
            <li> and you see results  in few weeks</li>
            <li> I guess I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> NOT SURE WHAT</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s working or not as it takes time with Vitamin A or Retinol.</li>
            <li> It is subtle and does not give that tight feeling.  </li>
            <li> People usually  think I&#x27;m still in my mid-to -late twenties.</li>
            <li> I mean jeez-</li>
            <li> I always hate  when people leave product reviews after only  a few days/weeks of receiving or using a product.</li>
            <li> It is cooling to put on, and doesn&#x27;t have nay weird smell, and doesnt feel heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I have purchased numerous aging products and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re shocked when I tell them I&#x27;m 34.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really clears complexion well</li>
            <li> Great retinol product for the cost!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been using it about 3 weeks now and can see visible improvements in my fine lines and wrinkles. What I really like is that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I had no noticeable improvements in my skin after using this product for months. Then I went to a dermatologist and got a prescription for a 1% retinol product - I can feel and see the effect of that medication, which leads me to believe the retinol used in the Watts Beauty product is ineffective or of low quality.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had time to fully evaluate</li>
            <li> going back to skin medica retinol 1%,  i just threw away $20 buying this watts product.  did nothing to my skin&lt;br /&gt;what a set back</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a week but already it has made an astounding difference to the tone and texture of my skin!</li>
            <li> Regular application of retinol works, I have been using the stuff for years, and I have no deep lines or wrinkles, even though I already have one foot in the tomb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I needed to replace my retinol serum so went with this. Not only does this product have a high percentage of the stuff, it also contains vitamin C and hyaluronic acid, which is why I bought it. The bottle says \\&quot;72% organic \\&quot;. The last ingredients listed are sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, and hetyl hexyl glycerin. Those probably make up the remaining 28% of non-organic stuff. Who knows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a bargain, and it can be mixed with my night cream, hand cream, or just used alone. Make sure to use sunscreen at all times during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints!</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product as it seems to be doing more for my wrinkles then anything so far. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with using it on my sensitive skin. Yes, I like this product.</li>
            <li> at first I was very apprehensive to try the serum just because it was online I&#x27;m a former estithtician makeup artist and just plain beauty fanatic it does exactly. what it promises just I only use it every other day because my skin is very sensitive</li>
            <li> Comes out like a gel/liquid, not too liquidy (I know that&#x27;s not a word lol). It cools just a little bit. Drys pretty quick on my skin and doesn&#x27;t rub off. It helps with my acne (I have super oily acne-prone skin). It works for me, no irritation either... Thanks yet again Watts Beauty :)</li>
            <li> I have honestly been skeptical of retinol creams, but as I get older and the more research I do about their antiaging effects the more persuaded I was to buy one a try it out. After scouring Amazon reviews for the most modestly priced cream that was rated high enough, I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed not just by retinol&#x27;s effects, but also this particular cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True, I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience with other retinol creams, but I can tell from the short amount of time that I have used this product that it definitely works. I have noticed a significant difference in the texture, softness and tone in my skin that I couldnt get with any of my other moisturizers. My face feels more taught, and my complexion is brighter and seems more even. I have fairly good skin, but around my chin can be a problem area for me when it comes to acne. I have noticed that that particular area is drying out and feels much better. Also, I am hugely surprised with how well it works on the back of my hands. I didnt think that that area really need it, but the bottle suggested to use a bit on the hands and that is where I can see the most dramatic effects so far. (I am  26 btw and I can def see a difference ) I guess its because that skin doesnt have much padding and is really susceptible to the elements....glad i followed the bottles directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am extremely happy with this product. I have pretty sensitive skin, and I can feel it tingle when I put on the gel, but I haven&#x27;t dried out at all. I wear it in the morning (with my SPF 55) and night with no problems. It is cooling to put on, and doesn&#x27;t have nay weird smell, and doesnt feel heavy at all. Because it is a gel and not a cream I feel that it spreads more easily, and dries much more quickly than a regular moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price point I think it is a great introductory retinol everyday cream. Maybe as I get older I might try more expenisive brands, but for now this one is absolutely perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am waiting to see if it helps with some of the redness in my cheeks (I have read that retinols can help with this) but I assume this will take more time to take effect...I mean jeez- its only been a week so far! Will update after a few months..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and I am not Kevin btw, I am his girlfriend- the Prime account is in his name ;)</li>
            <li> NOT SURE WHAT IT DOES NO DIFFERENCE IN WRINKLES&lt;br /&gt;FEELS GOOD AS IT GOES ON BUT THEN MOST THINGS DO</li>
            <li> I was so excited after reading reviews to order this and I ordered it along with some pomegranate oil just in case it was a bit drying.  Well, I received it Friday so that evening before bed, I washed my face, used my toner, put some serum on my face with a bit of pomegranate oil. When I woke up in the morning Wow. . I mean WOW!  My skin looked so radiant and smooth. I think I&#x27;m in love.  This is will be one of those products that&#x27;s a &amp;#34;must have.&amp;#34; I&#x27;m 50 and I have taken care of my skin so I&#x27;m in good shape, no one every guesses my age.  But I think the bigger picture is taking care of your skin so that it stays that way. I religiously use sunscreen and wash my make up off every night so it&#x27;s helped but this is a wonderful product and I highly recommend if you&#x27;re looking for something that actually works!</li>
            <li> I have mild but stubborn acne that&#x27;s difficult to control with most products, so I wanted to try this before seeing a dermatologist. I really wanted to like this product, but I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed any difference whatsoever. I&#x27;ve been using it regularly for about a month now and my skin is in the same condition as it was when I started. It doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out any more than usual, but it also doesn&#x27;t clear up my existing acne any faster. Also, I found it strange that I haven&#x27;t noticed any physical sensations (cooling, tingling, stinging, etc.) when applying the serum that are common with other topical acne products - it basically feels like I&#x27;m just rubbing an inert gel-like substance on my face. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the actual retinol content is much lower than what the package states. Unfortunately, I will be looking elsewhere for a different product in the future.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first as I am truly spoiled by the High Grade, High Quality Skin Care products I purchase from Bellahut.com. But I found this product to contain a good amount of Hyaluronic Acid which is very moisturizing and nurturing for the skin! I like that it combines Vitamin A with the Hyaluronic Acid so it&#x27;s a true bargian! Not sure if it&#x27;s working or not as it takes time with Vitamin A or Retinol. Patience is the key with Retinol as Dr. Oz says. So I will be patient and I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well for evening out skin tone but can&#x27;t see where it has done much in the way of diminishing wrinkles. I think I will save up for the laser skin resurfacing and be done with it.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no complaints about Watts. I&#x27;ve been using their Retinol face cream for some time now, and just started using the serum and I love it. The main reason I would recommend using the serum, over anything else, is because your skin absorbs the serum whereas lotion just sits on the top of your skin, and you want your skin to absorb that Retinol. But, with using a serum, you also need lotion or cream to go on top, doesn&#x27;t need to be Watts.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with a collagen product and the copper peptide sold here on Amazon, and wrinkles are disappearing.  Will continue to use.  When I started using I had just had a visit with a dermatologist, and was going to have to have a biopsy&lt;br /&gt;After using the retinol for a couple of days, I went back for the pre op photo, and the suspicious place had disappeared.  It probably was not a pre cancer. So, using this actually saved me biopsy procedure, and we are just watching the area now.</li>
            <li> This serum works!!!!! Talk about nice young looking skin in a bottle...People keep asking what I am doing to my skin and I keep telling them to buy this serum!</li>
            <li> This and other all natural vitamin skin csre is all ill use. &amp;#34;Retinol&amp;#34; the only thing that really rids of wrinkles This feels so good on the skin ..and does its job! I always make sure when nearing the end I re order so I&#x27;m never without!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel cool at all . Nothing different after using it .</li>
            <li> Love this stuff... I like to make my own beauty creams and I use this with my glycolic acid serum under my moisturizer. I really like the combo and after using it every night before bed my crows feet are softer and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this and I am not one who spends a lot of time on skin care but I&#x27;m glad I decided to try this Watts Beauty product.  At first I didn&#x27;t see much difference but now after almost 3 weeks of using it I can tell that some fine lines I had have greatly diminished to almost not being visible. What I really like is the under eye lines that I had are really much less visible. I really didn&#x27;t think at 60 years old there was much hope.  This definitely is worth trying and is very reasonably priced. I&#x27;ve tried much pricier retinol products that did nothing. I&#x27;ve also noticed my normally large and very visible facial pores are hardly noticeable now.  I am sold and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> Love it my skin looks clearer more even and better texture I did have slight dry flacking skin the first two days using but nothing major and again it was for like two days I love this stuff</li>
            <li> Very gentle.  I have been using this produce since March of 2014 and use it all over my face, neck, and eye area with no irritating results.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I think it works.  What it does is to minimize tireness around the eyes and cheeks.  It is subtle and does not give that tight feeling.  I am surprised.  When I forget to use it, I notice myself in a mirror. It does not take a lot.  Just a few drops at night.  I forget to put it on in daytime. .</li>
            <li> Only been using this product for almost a couple of weeks.  I don&#x27;t have to add extra moisturizer when using it and I have noticed some improvement in the little bumps on my forehead.  I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This Retinol Serum works very well at eliminating dry, flaky skin and keeping it clean and clear Wear it day or night.</li>
            <li> This product feels so good going on, leaves your skin feeling silky - even after you wake up in the morning. Will be reordering when I run low.</li>
            <li> Gentle but working wonderfully.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Watts is one of the few companies that return to over, and over again.  Simply because their products are dependable, organic, and mostly they are made in the USA!!  I use their Retinol products, and recently added their Hyaluronic Acid Acne Serum to my a.m. routine. This Retinol Serum is cool and natural. I have tried many different brands of Retinols, but the reason I like Watts so much is because it is a wonderful combo of Hyaluronic Acid, Green tea, Retinol, etc.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the face yet I swear i saw an overnight difference. Will be purchasing again that is for sure.</li>
            <li> This product has been working well for me.  I put it on every night and have clearer and smoother skin, consistently over several months, than I had prior when I was using a weaker retinol moisturizer.  I use it along with a deep moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I cannot remember how well this product  worked. Must not be much since I gave it away</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Really cleared my face of ache and brightened my skin.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working for me although it is too early to tell.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to have any retinol in it at all.  I&#x27;ve used retinol creams for awhile now and this just didn&#x27;t come close to other brands.</li>
            <li> This product was a waste of money.  There were no results after a month of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an esthesian and I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Like product and seller easy to work with</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help reduce some of the acne scars I have and to help prevent future acne. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 days now, and already I received a compliment on how good my skin looks! My skin looks brighter and feels much softer. The product doesn&#x27;t smell and dries pretty quickly. I was afraid of peeling, but so far the only places that have peeled at all are the spots where recent pimples had gone down. My face doesn&#x27;t feel tight at all like I was expecting since it contains retinol. I&#x27;m not really sure why they call it &amp;#34;cool gel&amp;#34; though, because I don&#x27;t really feel any cooling sensation. It just feels like a normal gel to me.</li>
            <li> Didnt work for me stopped using it cos i started to break out and i dont break out</li>
            <li> I love all the watts products. I have purchased numerous aging products and was disappointed. Watts products work wonders. Only don&#x27;t use too much. I have fair skin and I was using too much. I cut back on usage and is working great.</li>
            <li> The purchase works for me.</li>
            <li> good product for the price, I use it under eye and on lip lines, have noticed a marginal difference and I am hoping by the time I get to the end of this bottle, I will see a major difference.  I will be adding a vit c serum to the regimen so we will see.</li>
            <li> This 2% Retinol gel is AMAZING ! ! !&lt;br /&gt;Since I started putting it on my skin it has a beautiful  glow to it now .&lt;br /&gt;It is not harsh on the skin and it lights the age spot pretty good as well.  I already reorder another one and I have been using it for only two weeks.  I will never be without this serum. It is for life !</li>
            <li> I decided to try other products on this line, since I really liked the Peptide Serum, which in my opinion is comparable to Boots No. 7 Protect &amp; Perfect. I use it at night, in conjunction with other products, and have definitely seen changes on my skin. It is good, although not as powerful as another Retinol 1% lotion I have used in the past. Excellent delivery!</li>
            <li> I have tried many facial products (age 55) and have had dull skin issues. I started using this Watts Beauty 2% Cool Retinol Serum 5 and noticed a clearer, softer, brighter, younger-looking face. It really is the best product for giving your skin a radiant glow. Very happy, and will buy it again!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see a differnce</li>
            <li> The fact that this is a gel helps a lot. It dries quicker than a cream but I do have to use a moisturizer after using this product. I will update as to whether the product is working for me. I&#x27;ve only been using it a little time and would like to see if it makes a difference for my skin.</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a week. My face feels softer. I have not seen major improvement on wrinkles but will keep on using. I am positive that it will give good results after continuos use. So far, I love it!</li>
            <li> I think it may be too soon to tell if there are any &#x27;dramatic&#x27; effects, but I honestly think this is great.  I use it on my face and neck nightly, and the directions mention the back of the hands, too.  I&#x27;m confident that there are positive effects on my face and neck because I can SEE a really positive effect on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use other Watts Beauty items and will definitely continue to purchase this.</li>
            <li> I put this on every night then use the some drops of the Argon Oil in my Simple moisturizer and my skin has never been better.  I&#x27;m totally hooked on this and it&#x27;s far better than more expensive products i&#x27;ve tried.  Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to my mother! I am 28 years old and decided to add an anti aging to my beauty routine. This is perfect! I have seen results in just 3 weeks. I get compliments on how even my skin tone is and how my face is the best they have seen it.</li>
            <li> Love this product for night time use and came on time.</li>
            <li> I always hate  when people leave product reviews after only  a few days/weeks of receiving or using a product. Like how does this really help anyone right? This is not enough time to critique a product. This is NOT this type of review . I&#x27;ve finished this bottle of serum &amp; it is wonderful!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now been using this this serum for several MONTHS with great results. I use this after my toner twice a day along w/the Proactive 3 step system. After I wash w/cleanser, use toner, (make sure toner dries all the way on skin/face)  Then use this WATTS serum on face, neck, &amp; back of hands (wait for it to completely soak in). Then I use the 3rd step of Proactive repairing lotion. In the morning/day I put a few drops of the WATTS Argon Gold Moroccan Oil in my &amp;#34;Olay&amp;#34; day moisturizer  (SPF 15). Keeps skin looking  so smooth &amp; healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For night time I follow the same steps as I mentioned above  (1 - cleanser, 2-Toner, 3 - WATTS serum, 4-Repairing lotion) then I just use the WATTS Argon oil instead of any night/wrinkle cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Watts Hyaluronic Acid serums for several years now but I felt I needed a little something extra in my serum &amp; found  this serum &amp; it is a gem!  If you use this or any of these serums along with the Argon Moroccan oils (won&#x27;t clog pores) this will be the last wrinkle &amp; facial moisturizers you will EVER need to buy.  I&#x27;m very vain about my skin &amp; worried about wrinkles. I&#x27;ve been taking excellent care of my skin for 10 years. I&#x27;m  34....not one wrinkle or sign of being in my mid 30&#x27;s. People usually  think I&#x27;m still in my mid-to -late twenties. They&#x27;re shocked when I tell them I&#x27;m 34. I understand 34 is still young but good quality skin care needs to start at a young age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product along with the Argon Gold (Moroccan Oil). My make-up goes on so smooth &amp; which  I can wear less and less of it because my skin looks so good. It glows, smooth, and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope thisreview helps out...WATTS employs disenfranchised women so you are also purchasing products from a company with social responsibility. Plus their products are pure and you are paying a fraction of the cost that you would pay at a department store minus the additional ingredients that these department store products add that essentially dries  out &amp; eventually re-damaging your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use WATTS and these products. They have made a substantial difference for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of it and have easily removed many blackheads that just pop right out. This is something I will reorder. Very happy.</li>
            <li> I so a noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> this product is amazing and great price and you see results  in few weeks</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product. I guess I wasted my money.</li>
