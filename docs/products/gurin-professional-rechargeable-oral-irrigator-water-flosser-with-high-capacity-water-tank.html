            <li>I think that’s my favorite feature.</li>
            <li>hehe! :-).</li>
            <li>But I still give this 5 stars because it does make a lot easier than using the string or picks :-)  </li>
            <li>Krista, you need to floss more.  </li>
            <li>Love the portability and ease of use.</li>
            <li>so keep this safe from children!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like being able to rinse between my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is rechargeable and cordless, and you can change the heads on it, allowing everyone in your family to be able to use the flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a better way to take care of your dental health like I was.</li>
            <li>So if you are looking for a better way to take care of your dental health like I was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li>So now I am without, and will have to shop around for another, hopefully more reliable brand.</li>
            <li>my fillings are between my teeth, so I am glad to have a way to clean more effectively.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I was excited to receive the Gurin Water Flosser in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Check</li>
            <li>out my Gurin Water Flosser review video right now to get the scoop on this great and affordable water flosser product that will make your dentist smile (and you, too!).  </li>
            <li>I researched for a while a water flosser that is good quality with great reviews but was on the lower end of the spectrum when it came to price, the water comes out strong, stronger, and strongest so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the pressure not being enough.</li>
            <li>so it’s perfect for multiple users.&lt;br /&gt;The flosser is extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is one very handy, portable, cordless water flosser that doesn’t take up the ENTIRE counter top in the bathroom!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product and thoroughly enjoy using it!</li>
            <li>In an attempt to try to make any improvements to my dental care routine, I was happy to try the Gurin Professional Water Flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great replacement to those old floss picks I have been using.</li>
            <li>and it really feels good.</li>
            <li>I looked for several weeks to find a flosser that would fit my budget and my counter space and this one is the perfect fit for both</li>
            <li>of the things I liked right away about this product is that the water tank is easy to fill, which allows me to use water that is room temperature.  </li>
            <li>extra-large reservoir is removable and easy to refill.</li>
            <li>the nozzels are easy to replace.</li>
            <li>I love this, does a great job, just wish the water tank were bigger!</li>
            <li>Easy to fill the tank and to use.</li>
            <li>you learn how to use it, seems to work pretty good, using the periogenpowder with it.put a cap full in the resivior with water.</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest picking up one of these oral irrigators.</li>

            <li>Pressure is perfect on soft for me when my gums are sensitive from braces.</li>
            <li>but this product makes me actually enjoy it.</li>
            <li>and I like that it has three comfortable settings for all flossing styles.  </li>
            <li>: I received a sample for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.</li>

            <li>product is extremely easy to use, and to be honest, I didn’t read the instructions before using it because it is pretty much self</li>
            <li>Helps remove Tatar  and keep Teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Its great that the reservoir to fill up the water can be taken out to fill because the hole to fill up the water on the top is small and you will be there forever trying to add water.</li>
            <li>This flosser holds a charge for a full week of teeth cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Battery on full charge lasted two weeks, used two to three times day before I recharged (battery didn&#x27;t die yet).</li>
            <li>They go into the top of the unit and I have found that if you use the &amp;#34;righty tighty&amp;#34; as you are pushing in and &amp;#34;lefty Losey&amp;#34; as you are pulling the tip from the unit it seems to go in and out much easier.</li>
            <li>Gurin Water Flosser is strong, but not uncomfortably so.  </li>
            <li>uses my irrigator, and lastly a quick rinse with mouthwash.</li>
            <li>uses my irrigator, and lastly a quick rinse with mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I love it, and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>This new version comes with Lithium batteries, providing more power.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This unit is great since it is rechargeable because that means it will most likely have a long life to it.</li>
            <li>-I have had it for about 2 weeks now and it is powerful enough to make my teeth feel very clean with a lower setting if I feel it is too strong on my gums.</li>
            <li>The Professional Oral Irrigator from Gurin Products provides an easy and effective way to support proper teeth and gum health at home.</li>
            <li>Works great - but - very little reservoir.</li>
            <li>The price is good and the flosser holds a charge for several uses when unplugged- good for traveling secondary to size and charge.</li>
            <li>so I know it works, but its far more gentle in regards to my gums.</li>
            <li>My family has tried many different types of water flossers.  </li>
            <li>Every time I head to the dentist, I can tell you exactly what they will say to me:</li>
            <li>First time ever using a water pik.</li>
            <li>There is a tab at the top of the flossing unit that you pop open and fill.</li>
            <li>There is a tab at the top of the flossing unit that you pop open and fill.</li>
            <li>But I think it should last more than 6 months.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I only recommend products or services I tried personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>Regardless, I only recommend products or services I tried personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>It conveniently comes with two flossing heads so multiple people can safely and cleanly use this water flosser without any cross contamination issues.</li>
            <li>Its good for the price and seems to last long before having to recharge.</li>
            <li>Push the large button to start flossing.</li>
            <li>I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: “Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.&amp;#34;rly large tank</li>
            <li>If the family is sleeping, I don&#x27;t use it as it would certainly wake them.  </li>
            <li>This portable unit works great, and is about half the size of our standard home unit.</li>
            <li>I left it on for 3 days the light still blinking will not keep a charge.</li>
            <li>It seems like no matter how much I try, I have a lot of dental issues.  </li>
            <li>Pretty new but</li>
            <li>It is not an overly large tank but it does not have to be since it is super simple to fill.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only got one full charge use out of this unit.</li>
            <li>You can choose the setting first, and I like to set this to “soft” before turning on.  </li>
            <li>First of is the soft mode.</li>
            <li>I never was a huge fan of them to begin with since they were really good at cutting my gums.</li>
            <li>I never was a huge fan of them to begin with since they were really good at cutting my gums.</li>
            <li>Filling the tank is easy and the directions say to empty it after use</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t find anyone who sells replacement tips for this particular unit.</li>
            <li>It is super simple to charge, there is a 2 prong plug on the front of the unit.</li>
            <li>but it does not have to be since it is super simple to fill.</li>
            <li>Another thing I have to get used to, is that I forget to turn the switch off when I take my finger off and then pull it out of my mouth water sprays all over the place like a high force squirt gun.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Would rate the supplier highly.</li>
            <li>The Irrigator is a powerful jet which helps to remove debris deep between teeth and reduces the risk of bacteria build-up in crevices and below the gum line.</li>
            <li>The power is adjustable which I use it on normal but when my teeth hurt I use the pulse mode</li>
            <li>So for those that have sensitivity to hot or cold can adjust accordingly and be much more comfortable when using this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So for those that have sensitivity to hot or cold can adjust accordingly and be much more comfortable when using this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I found this water flosser to be very helpful to clean down between the gums and the teeth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like it is new to me, I know they will say it and</li>
            <li>are three operating modes; normal, soft and pulse.</li>
            <li>usually I start when I get home with the intent to be better \\&quot;this time\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Small device, that doesn&#x27;t clutter counter top.</li>
            <li>The water tank that holds enough water to clean my entire mouth.</li>
            <li>Next is the normal mode, and I go to this if I have something being a little more stubborn on getting out from my teeth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are three modes that are easily operated by pushing a button on the front of the flosser, and a little green light indicates which setting you are on.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this portable water flosser so we wouldn&#x27;t have to pack our regular large plug in water pic.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive tooth that&#x27;s lost its enamel</li>
            <li>So far so good.once</li>
            <li>My 5 year old decided to use this to spray water all over the bathroom..</li>
            <li>Gurin Professional Rechargeable Water Flosser Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the Gurin professional rechargeable Oral Irrigator model  number RO-110.</li>
            <li>I always start out with it on soft and work my teeth.</li>
            <li>no longer use my old flossing picks.</li>
            <li>no longer use my old flossing picks.</li>
            <li>so far it seems to work well.</li>
            <li>Works well, but is slow to fill and  needs more capacity</li>
            <li>but I am finding the water is just the right amount for one use so there is no need to empty it as I have used all the water in one use.</li>
            <li>Once your flosser is charged, unplug and open the small door on the top of the handle and fill with water.</li>
            <li>My old water flosser ran on batteries, and was constantly needing new ones.  </li>
            <li>No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li>No other form of compensation was received.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as it sounds, you hold the trigger down and it shoots streams like a gun firing bullets.</li>
            <li>Let me tell you what; this flosser works exactly the way our old flosser worked and at less than a quarter of the price we paid for that big name</li>
            <li>It would get weak very quickly.  </li>
            <li>First it would turn itself on, which lasted a few weeks.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The Professional Oral Irrigator from Gurin Products provides an easy and effective way to support proper teeth and gum health at home.</li>
            <li> Works great - but - very little reservoir.</li>
            <li> The price is good and the flosser holds a charge for several uses when unplugged- good for traveling secondary to size and charge.</li>
            <li> so I know it works, but its far more gentle in regards to my gums.</li>
            <li> My family has tried many different types of water flossers.  </li>
            <li> Every time I head to the dentist, I can tell you exactly what they will say to me:</li>

            <li> If the family is sleeping, I don&#x27;t use it as it would certainly wake them.  </li>
            <li> This portable unit works great, and is about half the size of our standard home unit.</li>
            <li> I left it on for 3 days the light still blinking will not keep a charge.</li>
            <li> It seems like no matter how much I try, I have a lot of dental issues.  </li>
            <li> Pretty new but</li>
            <li> It is not an overly large tank but it does not have to be since it is super simple to fill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only got one full charge use out of this unit.</li>
            <li> You can choose the setting first, and I like to set this to “soft” before turning on.  </li>
            <li> First of is the soft mode.</li>

            <li> but it does not have to be since it is super simple to fill.</li>
            <li> Another thing I have to get used to, is that I forget to turn the switch off when I take my finger off and then pull it out of my mouth water sprays all over the place like a high force squirt gun.</li>

            <li> The Professional Oral Irrigator from Gurin Products provides an easy and effective way to support proper teeth and gum health at home. This new version comes with Lithium batteries, providing more power. The Irrigator is a powerful jet which helps to remove debris deep between teeth and reduces the risk of bacteria build-up in crevices and below the gum line. This is a great tool for people who have bridges and braces. The irrigator is BPA-FREE and FIA approved. The motor is quiet and it has tip release button. We use holder for mouthwash.&lt;br /&gt;- See more at: http://sueparks2003.blogspot.com/2015/07/gurin-professional-rechargeable-water.html#sthash.tpI9hIZo.dpuf</li>
            <li> Just go to Walmart. This product failed on first usage. By the time I completed just 1/2 of the upper flossing it ran out of water in the reservoir. Basically, it took 4 times to fill it up. No good, sent it back.</li>
            <li> have not learned how to use it yet without throwing water all over.</li>
            <li> This is one very handy, portable, cordless water flosser that doesn’t take up the ENTIRE counter top in the bathroom! The water tank that holds enough water to clean my entire mouth. The water flosser is cordless! I think that’s my favorite feature. I’m not trying to work around a cord or tubes. Oh my gosh this design is brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;The flosser is powered by rechargeable LITHIUM batteries. This flosser holds a charge for a full week of teeth cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;The extra-large reservoir is removable and easy to refill. The flosser is also lightweight and has a great hand grip so it’s really easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;There are three operating modes; normal, soft and pulse. Let me tell you what; this flosser works exactly the way our old flosser worked and at less than a quarter of the price we paid for that big name one!!&lt;br /&gt;There are interchangeable nozzles so it’s perfect for multiple users.&lt;br /&gt;The flosser is extremely easy to use. Once your flosser is charged, unplug and open the small door on the top of the handle and fill with water. Along the base of the flosser are the easy to push buttons. The setting you are using lights up green. Push the large button to start flossing. (NOT before you have this in your mouth; or you’ll find a reason to be cleaning mirrors! Yeah, my mirrors are clean!!)&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine. I have not been influenced in any way. I did not receive cash payment to write this review. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe in.</li>
            <li> I found this water flosser to be very helpful to clean down between the gums and the teeth. I have a sensitive tooth that&#x27;s lost its enamel and it makes it very hard to floss it or scrape it using dental floss string or metal picks. So the water flosser works well. The power is adjustable which I use it on normal but when my teeth hurt I use the pulse mode and it really feels good. the unit is very easy to fill, through the top, or by the bottle itself by removing it. the nozzels are easy to replace. But although I think one thing they could have is a nozzel that curves back inwards to get behind the teeth a lot easier. Another thing I have to get used to, is that I forget to turn the switch off when I take my finger off and then pull it out of my mouth water sprays all over the place like a high force squirt gun. hehe! :-). A momentary switch would probably be handier. But I still give this 5 stars because it does make a lot easier than using the string or picks :-)  Update.. I&#x27;m bringing mine review down to one star. I&#x27;ve only got one full charge use out of this unit. when it was completely dead I went back to try to charge it again for a second charge. This instructions say to leave it on for 8 hours. I left it on for 3 days the light still blinking will not keep a charge. I unplugged it turned it on and buzzed and it died. so it&#x27;s just a one time usr,  a disposable unit. I recommended do not buy this because it will not charge a second time. :-(</li>
            <li> Its great that the reservoir to fill up the water can be taken out to fill because the hole to fill up the water on the top is small and you will be there forever trying to add water. The water pressure is good so no complaints there. The charging port on the front should have a water resistant plug because its almost impossible to avoid water from going inside when flossing and/or filling it up with water. Its good for the price and seems to last long before having to recharge.</li>
            <li> Purchased this portable water flosser so we wouldn&#x27;t have to pack our regular large plug in water pic. This portable unit works great, and is about half the size of our standard home unit. The only potential down side is it comes with two tips and I can&#x27;t find anyone who sells replacement tips for this particular unit. Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> I love this, does a great job, just wish the water tank were bigger!</li>
            <li> My family has tried many different types of water flossers.  This one is by far the best!  It stays charged longer and the effect of the spray is amazing.  I strongly recommend this product and thoroughly enjoy using it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this water flosser! I hate flossing me than anything but this product makes me actually enjoy it. The tank size is perfect. It has a small footprint in my tiny bathroom. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:dec198c7a072101623630807a2535b13]] Every time I head to the dentist, I can tell you exactly what they will say to me: Krista, you need to floss more.  It&#x27;s not like it is new to me, I know they will say it and usually I start when I get home with the intent to be better \\&quot;this time\\&quot; but then I fall off the flossing bandwagon.  Usually because I have sensitive gums and traditional string floss causes me a lot of pain.  That&#x27;s why I was excited to receive the Gurin Water Flosser in exchange for my honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;Check out my Gurin Water Flosser review video right now to get the scoop on this great and affordable water flosser product that will make your dentist smile (and you, too!).  I love that it is rechargeable (as well as not needing to be plugged in while using it!) and I like that it has three comfortable settings for all flossing styles.  It conveniently comes with two flossing heads so multiple people can safely and cleanly use this water flosser without any cross contamination issues.</li>
            <li> Love the portability and ease of use. Battery on full charge lasted two weeks, used two to three times day before I recharged (battery didn&#x27;t die yet). Pressure is perfect on soft for me when my gums are sensitive from braces.</li>
            <li> First time ever using a water pik. So far so good.once you learn how to use it, seems to work pretty good, using the periogenpowder with it.put a cap full in the resivior with water.Helps remove Tatar  and keep Teeth clean. Susan from Fl</li>
            <li> First, I don&#x27;t like flossing, but it is an necessary evil. Floss gets stuck on crowns, plus back teeth hard to reach. This water flosser makes it a snap to use. Easy to fill the tank and to use. Basically, turn it on and spray between teeth. Tank might have to be refilled a few times, but that&#x27;s not a problem. Small device, that doesn&#x27;t clutter counter top. Great product!</li>
            <li> This water flosser is just what I needed.  My old water flosser ran on batteries, and was constantly needing new ones.  It would get weak very quickly.  This Gurin Rechargeable takes care of that problem because it recharges the batteries.  Now, I get a good strong water flow every time.  I love it, and would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> It seems like no matter how much I try, I have a lot of dental issues.  I brush carefully and I floss every single day, but I still end up with cavities, which is extremely frustrating.  In an attempt to try to make any improvements to my dental care routine, I was happy to try the Gurin Professional Water Flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is extremely easy to use, and to be honest, I didn’t read the instructions before using it because it is pretty much self explanatory.&lt;br /&gt;One of the things I liked right away about this product is that the water tank is easy to fill, which allows me to use water that is room temperature.  My teeth are sensitive and icy water is really uncomfortable.  An added bonus – the water tank is BPA-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are three modes that are easily operated by pushing a button on the front of the flosser, and a little green light indicates which setting you are on.  You can choose the setting first, and I like to set this to “soft” before turning on.  Side note - it says on the packaging that this product is not for kids.  My 5 year old decided to use this to spray water all over the bathroom.. so keep this safe from children!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Gurin Water Flosser is strong, but not uncomfortably so.  I like being able to rinse between my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is rechargeable and cordless, and you can change the heads on it, allowing everyone in your family to be able to use the flosser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All my fillings are between my teeth, so I am glad to have a way to clean more effectively.  The Gurin Water Flosser is a great way to maintain good dental health!</li>
            <li> Gurin Professional Rechargeable Water Flosser Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the Gurin professional rechargeable Oral Irrigator model  number RO-110. It comes with the rechargeable flosser, charging cord, 2 picks, and an instructions booklet. This is a great replacement to those old floss picks I have been using. It offers the ability to clean between the teeth without having to worry about the flosser cutting the gums or pulling on the teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is great since it is rechargeable because that means it will most likely have a long life to it. It is super simple to charge, there is a 2 prong plug on the front of the unit. Plug the cord end in that matches that and then the other to a wall socket. The collection bottle for the water on this unit attaches to the side and it is not a very strong bond and can be a pain if it comes apart for getting back on the unit solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the picks. They go into the top of the unit and I have found that if you use the &amp;#34;righty tighty&amp;#34; as you are pushing in and &amp;#34;lefty Losey&amp;#34; as you are pulling the tip from the unit it seems to go in and out much easier. The unit comes with 2 picks that are color coded. One has a blue ring and the other has a green ring at the base where it attaches to the base. This makes it where you can swap out tips from person to person with in the household.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit has 3 settings for use when you are irrigating your teeth. First of is the soft mode. I always start out with it on soft and work my teeth. Next is the normal mode, and I go to this if I have something being a little more stubborn on getting out from my teeth. Lastly is the pulse mode. It is exactly as it sounds, you hold the trigger down and it shoots streams like a gun firing bullets. I try not to use the Normal and Pulse modes because I have very sensitive gums and these both tend to be uncomfortable for me to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to filling the water tank on this unit. It is not an overly large tank but it does not have to be since it is super simple to fill. There is a tab at the top of the flossing unit that you pop open and fill. This is also great because you can choose the temperature of the water you are using to irrigate your teeth with. So for those that have sensitivity to hot or cold can adjust accordingly and be much more comfortable when using this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I no longer use my old flossing picks. I never was a huge fan of them to begin with since they were really good at cutting my gums. My routine will now be to brush my teeth, uses my irrigator, and lastly a quick rinse with mouthwash. So if you are looking for a better way to take care of your dental health like I was. I strongly suggest picking up one of these oral irrigators. I would like to thank Gurin and affiliates for sending me this irrigator to try out and leave my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a sample for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I tried personally and believe will be good for my readers. No other form of compensation was received.

            <li> Great product, recommended.</li>
            <li> nice compact unit that works well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot bigger than I expected and it&#x27;s not easy to use.  If the family is sleeping, I don&#x27;t use it as it would certainly wake them.  Also, please don&#x27;t think that this will take the place of flossing- it won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Works well, but is slow to fill and  needs more capacity</li>
            <li> Works great - but - very little reservoir. My hubby has to fill 3 times.</li>
            <li> Good product, easy to fill and use. As other reviewers noted, this unit has a small water capacity- when you use the high setting you will need to fill the unit again to complete your dental flossing. The price is good and the flosser holds a charge for several uses when unplugged- good for traveling secondary to size and charge. The unit arrived as expected. Would rate the supplier highly. The unit received a four star because of the water capacity only.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this product. I researched for a while a water flosser that is good quality with great reviews but was on the lower end of the spectrum when it came to price, the water comes out strong, stronger, and strongest so you don&#x27;t have to worry about the pressure not being enough. I dont floss because it makes my gums bleed, I will have to avoid food the entire day after I floss because my gums are so inflamed and now that I have this I do it every night before bed. You can see the food coming out so I know it works, but its far more gentle in regards to my gums.</li>
            <li> Pretty new but so far it seems to work well. I like that it is rechargeable and fits in a small space. Now if it last..great!  That was then, this is now, six months later. I have been the sole user and generally once a day, so minimal use. It worked well for 6 months, I really loved it and the convenience of it. But I think it should last more than 6 months. First it would turn itself on, which lasted a few weeks. Now it is dead as a door nail. I had read the same complaints but discounted them. So now I am without, and will have to shop around for another, hopefully more reliable brand. Great item while it lasted.</li>
            <li> I looked for several weeks to find a flosser that would fit my budget and my counter space and this one is the perfect fit for both-I have had it for about 2 weeks now and it is powerful enough to make my teeth feel very clean with a lower setting if I feel it is too strong on my gums. Filling the tank is easy and the directions say to empty it after use but I am finding the water is just the right amount for one use so there is no need to empty it as I have used all the water in one use. Great product!</li>
