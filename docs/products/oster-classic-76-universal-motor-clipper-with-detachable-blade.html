            <li>You&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s the sacrifice you make for a great quality cut.</li>

            <li>These clippers give a great cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Everybody says these clippers are great, but you still have to keep going over and over your hair.</li>
            <li>Not as great as they are cracked up to be.</li>
            <li>My son gets his cut and is happy.</li>

            <li>that&#x27;s why my wife is happy with this.</li>
            <li>I have already used it up to 5 times and it works great.</li>

            <li>Very nice clippers...</li>
            <li>Does a very nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use so many types hair clippers,but this one Best I ever used.</li>
            <li>To each his own!</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with how well it is designed and can understand why it is a favorite of barbers.</li>
            <li>The best. :)</li>
            <li>What good is a set of clippers with a great motor but no replacement blades.</li>
            <li>I also got the plastic adapter which work great and also feel like good quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After looking for \\&quot;best clippers\\&quot;, I found the Oster Classic 76 and considering the great reviews this product has received, I decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man!  </li>
            <li>They are easy to use and provide excellent results for my dogs.</li>
            <li>It cuts easily for a perfect cut.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut my husband&#x27;s hair for over thirty years and this is without a doubt the best, easy to use clipper ever.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m 55, should have started this way sooner, looks  and feels as good as the $30 cut</li>
            <li>The available blade assortment is superb</li>
            <li>it is good, I thought that my hair was going to almost or close to bald</li>
            <li>would have loved to use the #2 blades with it, but it never arrived with my order (another story for another day).  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had these for over a year now, and they are as good as the day we got them.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Good idea to buy this instead of buying others for around $50 every year or two.</li>
            <li>I have owned Oster products before and thought this would be a good buy.  </li>
            <li>All around good clipper</li>
            <li>My fades were never as good as the barber&#x27;s fades.</li>
            <li>, I know a good pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>, I got quite good at the fade and can now give barber shop quality haircuts to my three boys.  </li>
            <li>it is not even a fair comparison.</li>
            <li>I have been out of Barber School for a year, I was told about the clippers and thought their was no way the clippers could be that good..</li>
            <li>a classic,always good.</li>
            <li>Good price and good quality</li>
            <li>Good for prefect cuts</li>
            <li>Cord length is good.  </li>
            <li>Looking like a sound purchase at a great price!</li>
            <li>and I loved it</li>
            <li>The combs are good too.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d recommend the quadruple and quintuple 0&#x27;s, perhaps even the #0A as well, for good measure).</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and this works great.  </li>
            <li>As good as advertised.</li>
            <li>Recommend these to all wanting to cut hair and get a precise and flawless cut.</li>
            <li>As a barber, I have used the Oster Model 76 clippers for years and they give you good service.</li>
            <li>The price was a good deal.</li>
            <li>excellent not one of the cheap vibrator models</li>
            <li>However, they are good clippers and I am not dissatisfied.  </li>
            <li>good news:&lt;br</li>
            <li>good purchase.  </li>
            <li>Cant do a good haircut without good equipment there</li>
            <li>Professionals would be pleased with this clipper and for this self-cutter, it is ideal.  </li>
            <li>so at the price I thought they were good quality.</li>
            <li>but they work as good as gold.</li>
            <li>Good Buy.</li>
            <li>thank you very much it is good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably good to shave the head.</li>
            <li>Was a good deal</li>
            <li>Good investment; get the 00000 attachment</li>
            <li>Good product for grooming.</li>
            <li>Good unit 08-02-2017 UPDATE.</li>
            <li>and I needed to upgrade to good clippers.</li>
            <li>Often, as you may know, you do not know how good something is until you have something to compare it to.  </li>
            <li>It still works as good as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li>I tried the Whal brand, they never worked good for me.  </li>
            <li>I am stationed overseas and needed something really good to keep my hair trimmed.  </li>
            <li>These clippers are as good as I remember them to be.</li>
            <li>I bought these two years ago and wish I had invested in a good pair 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>VERRY VERRY GOOD &amp;</li>
            <li>The adjustable clipper is still good for around the ears tapering.</li>
            <li>If you ever need replacement parts, good luck.  </li>
            <li>I hope you have as good an experience as I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Keep lubed and clean and they will work awesome</li>
            <li>Good product very pleased.</li>
            <li>The quick disconnect blade is so perfect for cleaning and switch lengths in a flash.  </li>
            <li>While I&#x27;ve know an exceptional barber who uses the Oster 76 clipper exclusively; I seldom use mine.</li>
            <li>They cut exceptionally.  </li>
            <li>Excellent quality that is sure to provide many years of trouble-free service.  </li>
            <li>Very good performance on fine hair.  </li>
            <li>Cut great and are very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Excellent great classic clipper</li>
            <li>This has been great, no issues and it has been more than a year.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased.</li>
            <li>this company and amazon did a great job keeping me satisfied.</li>
            <li>a great set of clippers- don&#x27;t have to run over the target area more than once.</li>
            <li>It is very challenging to find a product that feels durable and performs well.  </li>
            <li>If you are debating upgrading to this motor from cheaper clippers you will be more than happy</li>
            <li>very safe.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve very satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li>it is a great product and I can see why many people give this thing 4/5 stars.</li>
            <li>but I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>After using it for a good 20 minutes, the handle wasn&#x27;t even warm.</li>
            <li>They sold the Oster for much more money, so this is a great site for a better deal!</li>
            <li>Great product, Oster Clasic 76 is the best hair clipper ever for home and professional hair cut.</li>
            <li>These clippers worked great right out of the box and after 5 months of 10+ haircuts a week they are still working great.</li>
            <li>They do not come with attachments, so be sure to buy you some!  </li>
            <li>It took all of my will to not shave off the top of my head!</li>
            <li>(*) The A6 does not vent air out the sides - which is excellent!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for and at a great price after doing some research!</li>
            <li>Glad I bought this!</li>
            <li>Love It!.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, i&#x27;ve cut my own hair since 10 years now and I must that this is the best one I used so far.</li>
            <li>This hair trimer is outstanding!  </li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After replacing the switch, I love it!  </li>
            <li>Hope it holds up for many years!</li>
            <li>I love it and it is still in use!  </li>
            <li>and I love them a lot!</li>
            <li>Great Oster quality and the blades are easy to buy and swap out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more then proud to be a classic 76 &#x27;er best tool I&#x27;ve held ever</li>
            <li>Great product and I chose the free delivery which eludes you to believe the product will take forever to arrive...</li>
            <li>The quality is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have to say that this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li>These things are amazing and feel like the could scalp you if you slip.  </li>
            <li>amazing price.  </li>
            <li>Performance is great unlike those cheap clippers you buy at Target with plastic attachments.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product</li>
            <li>Blades are great and fit the way they are supposed too.  </li>
            <li>My dad use to own one of this model and it has the metal switch.</li>
            <li>is a nice machine</li>
            <li>your own oster can put it to the test if you don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>but after using them I would have paid even more there just that good.</li>
            <li>the added locking mechanism is a nice addition</li>
            <li>the added locking mechanism is a nice addition</li>
            <li>I decided to save some money and do my own hair.</li>
            <li>I am not a barber, but I bought it to cut my own hair and my two sons.</li>
            <li>It cuts nicely.  </li>
            <li>but this is the most powerful and perfect clipper I have ever had.</li>
            <li>I have attempted to cut my own hair and almost always needed my wife&#x27;s help.</li>
            <li>No binding or catching hair.  </li>
            <li>If you cut your own hair don&#x27;t hesitate.  </li>
            <li>I shave my own head about every 2 weeks, and I have been doing so for almost 10 years now.</li>
            <li>The instructions aren&#x27;t as helpful as I would of liked.</li>
            <li>but motor does get warm after 5min use.</li>
            <li>The others have both trained themselves to cut their own hair.</li>
            <li>I cleaned it out and applied my own.</li>
            <li>I did watch the maintenance video from Oster about this clipper and they state that if the handle gets warm it needs oil.</li>
            <li>and I feel like I can give an honest review.</li>
            <li>I prefer the spray oil/cleaner over the kind that comes out in drops.</li>
            <li>I am not one of those that can do my own fade; when I do my home cuts it&#x27;s one level all around.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair twice a week</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good quality clipper to be able to give myself my own haircuts.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair - always trimming it and</li>
            <li>The Product trims nicely when using an attached blade.</li>
            <li>I use it all the time for my own hair.</li>
            <li>Nice clippers that can cut any thickness of hair.  </li>
            <li>the it gets too warm.  </li>
            <li>and I cut my own hair</li>
            <li>thing I also really liked is the ease of changing blades.</li>
            <li>I had never held one of these or had this kind of all-clipper haircut before I bought this one</li>
            <li>exercise and perspire and this kind of haircut is the easiest and quickest for cleaning up and taking care of after exercise.  </li>
            <li>My husband cuts his own hair and cannot hold the plug in this jury-rigged position to operate clippers.  </li>
            <li>I wish they would have come with their own guards and not just the 000 and 1 guard.</li>
            <li>Runs warm.</li>
            <li>However, for the price it would be nice to get a storage case and blade holder with it.  </li>
            <li>Now that I own one I will advise friends and family members.</li>
            <li>- I cut my own</li>
            <li>He has cut hair for years and enjoys great clippers to upkeep his own hair and these fit the bill.</li>
            <li>I took off a star because the head does get warm after about 5 minutes of use.</li>
            <li>I still liked them,</li>
            <li>It seems this is popular with hair stylists because of it&#x27;s durability, quality and power.</li>
            <li>and I own my own barbershop.</li>
            <li>It is nice that that blades pop off with no tools for cleaning and lubrication.  </li>
            <li>I am a balding guy who cuts his own hair once per week.  </li>
            <li>if you cut your own hair.</li>
            <li>so we&#x27;re saving a nice amount of money every month.</li>
            <li>The Oster Classic 76 is the best built clippers I have seen.  </li>
            <li>Works great, clean cut.</li>
            <li>This Classic 76 is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>One day, for some reason, I decided to research hair clippers and soon learned that the Classic 76 was considered one of the best.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to watch the YouTube video by oster on this product by the guy with the werewolf looking sideburns for an awesome tutorial on the trimmer.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t comment on my purchases but I was so impressed by these clippers I&#x27;m making an exception.</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean and change, and they don&#x27;t fall off!!!</li>
            <li>Product was in brand new condition and works great!  </li>
            <li>Very happy witj my clippers and new blades</li>
            <li>It live up to my expectation i love it keep up the good word wonderful love</li>
            <li>Most importantly, these clippers do a great job and cut through your hair like butter.  </li>
            <li>Of course Amazon customer service is great and the replacement was quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super happy with these.</li>
            <li>excellent, machine, smooth running and powerful.</li>
            <li>Very easy to switch the blades</li>
            <li>so that is very easy to cut, but I like reliable tools.</li>
            <li>The blade is very easy to exchange.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use</li>
            <li>Right out of the box, these worked great, giving the dogs a nice even cut.  </li>
            <li>These clippers, while a bit large and unwieldy, are an incredible pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li>This product works great and worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best hair clipper that I have owned.  </li>
            <li>im here to say that these by far are the best clippers ive ever cut hair with.</li>
            <li>This hair clipper is by far the best set I have owned.</li>
            <li>I use the clippers every week to trim my own hair and I&#x27;m quite satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Also, I would have liked to see a better cleaning brush or brush set included.</li>
            <li>I am so glad i upgraded from the ones I used in beauty school because quite honestly you cant even compare the two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know of people that say they do their own fades, and I say more power to them.</li>
            <li>It works at its best , I use it professionally</li>
            <li>in America and smacks of old fashioned quality!&lt;br /&gt;Americans build the best products-hopefully this clipper stays American-made.</li>
            <li>but this one sure is nice.  </li>
            <li>These are by far the best clippers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I have to say these are by far the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>These are the best I have used, including professional clippers from wahl and andis.  </li>
            <li>Just a smooth perfect cut the first try.</li>
            <li>The first set was fairly well made and lasted a good 10 years.</li>
            <li>I have used many $30-$100 clippers and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Over the years I have cut my own hair at home with many brands of home hair clippers, mostly from the Wahl brand.  </li>
            <li>Works great, very powerful and smooth.</li>
            <li>Now it runs, gives great results and is a joy to use, though it does take a little practice to get good with it.</li>
            <li>came exactly as ordered and works great</li>
            <li>This was the first issue I had with an Amazon product and it is great they went out of their way without me having to call around.</li>
            <li>Very good, its brand new n cuts like it says , its my favourite item .</li>
            <li>Easy to handle chasis, easy to grip, good length extention cord.</li>
            <li>Very happy with Classic 76, precise cut.</li>
            <li>The #1 blades worked just fine!</li>
            <li>The spring-action attachment is very secure and dead-easy</li>
            <li>the best thing no loud buzzing motor just a nice gental hum.</li>
            <li>Blades are easily exchangeable but do get warm with use.</li>
            <li>Since I got this just to easily cut my own hair</li>
            <li>My BF loved it very very much!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Blades use and changing on these are quite easy, but make sure you keep oil handy.</li>
            <li>This unit is excellent with true professional qualities inlcuding an excellent motor and clippers that are professional grade.  </li>
            <li>nice clean cut very strong clippers</li>
            <li>Once one obtains the correct blade head, 0000 for me, sadly not included in the original kit, it as close to ideal as once can get.</li>
            <li>Very good professional clipper for the price.  </li>
            <li>So far, very, very good.  </li>
            <li>Used Oster products for many years.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re on the fence, my recommendation is to step up and get these - you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>Best ever Clipper I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve been using clippers (this is my third) for over 8 years.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product and would recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li>I do many clipper cuts in a week</li>
            <li>works better than anything you can get at wally world.</li>
            <li>From the moment you turn them on, you can tell by the smoothness and power of the motor that you have stepped up to top quality clippers.</li>
            <li>I purchased a [0000] which is great for real close shaves or fades.</li>
            <li>and I can give my son a great &#x27;High Regulation&#x27; haircut with ease!</li>
            <li>and i only purchase the best quality to get the biggest bang out of my buck.</li>
            <li>I simply love it.  </li>
            <li>I just love these clippers.</li>
            <li>I wish more companies were like this.</li>
            <li>The Next day delivery was perfect since I needed these for a client.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the power is overkill for most haircutting applications.</li>
            <li>After 20 years using lower grade clippers (and being relatively satisfied) I purchased these hoping for an improvement.  </li>
            <li>As you may already have read, many folks commented on the size and weight of the clippers, the noise and heat it produced, and the seemingly retro styling of the unit.</li>
            <li>Did I say it was heavenly already?... :)</li>
            <li>It has been more than a year that I have had this.  </li>
            <li>This clipper is everything that it promises to be and more.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure you use the attachment combs.  </li>
            <li>I love these clippers.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that they are MADE in the USA.</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love these clippers.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different clippers, and these are the best.</li>
            <li>Now we have to spend more money to buy the correct blade.</li>
            <li>Love Oster machines.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>My sister loves it and i will now have free haircuts FOREVER with these clippers!</li>
            <li>My faids are allot better now.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s even more of a long-term savings.</li>
            <li>A well thought out system that will work with its many accessories.</li>
            <li>Hopefully they stay with this product rather than as most companies try to reduce the quality while increasing the price.</li>
            <li>I can see why professionals love this clipper.</li>
            <li>Love everything about it...</li>
            <li>Real quick-</li>
            <li>$15+tip/haircut x 3 boys x 12 months &#x3D; $720/year, this system has more than paid for itself.  </li>
            <li>I love using these clippers.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is so much better</li>
            <li>I have been wanting one of these for many years.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>If you need to set speed records, you are better off going with a cheaper grade.....</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have any issues gripping this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is definitely the best set of clippers I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been so pleased with these clippers, that I also purchased the Oster T-Finisher as well.</li>
            <li>I am sure I can get them repaired but</li>
            <li>The way the clipper is designed is safe to use.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;re four more words.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and then make sure you put the screws in a safe place to avoid losing them.</li>
            <li>It cuts better than others.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly you can get a better cut with</li>
            <li>Simply the best clippers you can purchase.</li>
            <li>These clippers put all of those cheap clippers to shame!  </li>
            <li>like most people are saying it is more like 2 days.</li>
            <li>my head weekly and this is way better than buying a cheapo from walmart.  </li>
            <li>My favorite thing about it?</li>
            <li>I have barbered my kids and grandkids hair for many years.  </li>
            <li>So it will cost more for the attachments to change the degress of hair length thats being cut.</li>
            <li>Hopefully this one lasts me for many years to come.</li>
            <li>Changing blades - costs more but a closer/better cut</li>
            <li>After using those on and off for a year or more; don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li>Maybe I am being more efficient with it&lt;</li>
            <li>The 00000 blades are about like one day&#x27;s stubble after shaving with a blade, which is what most people are looking for.  </li>
            <li>they are phenomenal on my head.</li>
            <li>I love the Oster clippers....be sure to oil the blades before each use.</li>
            <li>so I have more time before I have to do it again.</li>
            <li>That translates into more confidence and a better/quicker haircut.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I have thrown away a dozen or more of the cheaper models.</li>
            <li>*love</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, when my favorite barber retired he told me to get a 76076 and a 1 and 2 clipper and do it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit noisy in operation, but the overall quality is perfect.</li>
            <li>I plan on using these for years to come and expect to get better with practice.</li>
            <li>Excellent clippers!&lt;br /&gt;These are really solid.</li>
            <li>I cute hair on the sides for friends and acquaintances.</li>
            <li>I have it for more that two years and use it almost once every week.</li>
            <li>Most clippers have a vibrator inside, not rotary.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend them for sure.</li>
            <li>They are no louder than the clippers I&#x27;ve had before, and are definitely a lot quieter than vibration-drive clippers that aren&#x27;t in perfect adjustment.    </li>
            <li>The motor is made well and is up to the job for many haircuts.  </li>
            <li>top concern was that they were going to be too bulky</li>
            <li>(I had always only used Andis Masters up until that point), but that wasn&#x27;t the case, they fit nicely and feel awesome.</li>
            <li>If you are a barber don&#x27;t get these because you will be able to cut one head then</li>
            <li>and I would love to keep it if they make a closer blade for it.</li>
            <li>I wish it would have come with more attachments as I had to reorder a 1 1/2 blade.</li>
            <li>Simply the best.</li>
            <li>think it is going to be used many years..</li>
            <li>top quality...go to youtube for help with all types of cuts.</li>
            <li>but so far I&#x27;ve been impressed with how smooth this clipper operates.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend these to anyone looking to purchase a great set of clippers!!!!!</li>
            <li>I didnt know any better</li>
            <li>what would make it better)</li>
            <li>I sincerely wish now I had bought it 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>and I guess I am saving more than the cost of the unit every year.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this Oster hair clipper.</li>
            <li>This is what most professionals use on their hair salons.</li>
            <li>Way better then the cheap ones!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been through many.</li>
            <li>It may not be the most ergonomic clipper</li>
            <li>but it sure makes up for its akwardness through its shear power and accuracy.</li>
            <li>Would give it 5/5 if they improved the design for better grip.</li>
            <li>At Sally&#x27;s, they are more than $200.</li>
            <li>it love it  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>If you have better instructions on how to change out and install the blades</li>
            <li>I sure would like to have them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;boseimmp@msn.com</li>
            <li>This machine blends hair better than ANY machine out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be pleased with the fell and the outcome.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never gotten a better one.</li>
            <li>I love this product and so will you.</li>
            <li>and I find the performance is top notch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this device,...</li>
            <li>You have to take the top blade part of in once piece.  </li>
            <li>My favorite clippers.</li>
            <li>Clippers are ok,.</li>
            <li>I dont know if it is built to be able to handle the heat, but I get worried that it is going to overheat.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve tried a lot and waited a while before committing to these because they cost more.</li>
            <li>I have always bought the 20-30 dollar ones from Walmart, Target or wherever and over the years have bought more than I care to mention.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>but I ordered two more for tapering.</li>
            <li>but I have owned many clippers and never have had this happen.</li>
            <li>I was able to order one on-line</li>
            <li>and I was able to use it, just like I had planned.  </li>
            <li>reason I bought this clipper is that I noticed that many of the cheaper units sold started pulling hair after six months to  a year.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>You will be glad you did.  </li>
            <li>ok this trimmer reminds me of a truck or a harley davidson.</li>
            <li>Make sure to oil the blades everytime and grease the inside once a year.</li>
            <li>This clipper really does a great job.</li>
            <li>so glad i ordered these.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>Outstanding cut.</li>
            <li>Much better than the cheaper sets we use to buy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better to work longer to shorter.</li>
            <li>Nice smooth even cut with no stragglers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing hair for over 10 years and have not found a clipper of better quality.</li>
            <li>You can blend so much better.</li>
            <li>Still love them</li>
            <li>What more can be said.</li>
            <li>Most satisfied with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>My wife cut&#x27;s my hair and over the years we have gone through too many clippers.  </li>
            <li>if I let my stubble or hair on my head grow out for more than a week, I&#x27;ll give it a buzz with these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, great quality, very durable.</li>
            <li>In fact i&#x27;m doing a better job than the Barbers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several hair clippers and this is the best.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would not recommend these for home use, but instead get the wahl seniors, or andis masters or better yet visit the barbershop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Get this and enjoy!</li>
            <li>Is a good cliper to own if your a real pro.</li>
            <li>The motor is very strong, easy to handle.</li>
            <li>I would not return them Because I can tell they are well made and very powerful!</li>
            <li>but with the 76er it gives u a nice  clean cut and wont leave any patches.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great to have a pair of clippers with a motor from a classic muscle car in your hand.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind they won&#x27;t cut nearly as clean, but nice for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>its clean, nice build.</li>
            <li>They cut as close as you want and the blade change is very easy to do, yet secure.</li>
            <li>Great clippers, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>still works great, highly recommended..</li>
            <li>They are so easy to use, and do such a great job!</li>
            <li>One or two passes is all it takes for a very clean cut.  </li>
            <li>a great tool, one of the best in the industry, and will suite your needs whether you are looking to purchase it for professional or personal use.</li>
            <li>After giving the clipper a good cleaning the first time, I noticed the blade was off a bit.</li>
            <li>The cost is well worth the quality!!</li>
            <li>It has a lot of power and cuts hair easily, and it&#x27;s an outstanding clipper.</li>
            <li>wife cuts my hair and we have easily saved more money than the cost of the cuts at a barber.</li>
            <li>super nice close shave with the 000 blades</li>
            <li>I had only known how superior a good pair of clippers (either these OR the Andis BRC)</li>
            <li>They sound more like a well oiled bicycle chain instead of a buzz saw like most clippers.&lt;br /&gt;3-The blades can be switched out without unscrewing screws.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very easy to change and clean blades.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean too.</li>
            <li>But yes ,its a great professional machine!</li>
            <li>Truthfully, this clipper is maybe overkill for once-a-week haircuts but it does SUCH a good job!</li>
            <li>/&gt;- clean, fast, great cut and operation across the board.</li>
            <li>It does a better job, does it faster, is easier to clean and to top it off</li>
            <li>This hair clipper is very good and looks like it will last for years.</li>
            <li>He never used comb attachments, therefore, invest in more blades if you want to decrease the cut or invest in another set of clippers if you need an huge guard for your hair.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product ... cuts through my sons&#x27; hair like a hot knife slicing through soft butter.  </li>
            <li>I decided on the Oster professional clippers and have been a happy clipper since.  </li>
            <li>The motor is sooooooo smooth, and the cut will be even ever time, I really really Love them........</li>
            <li>I only cut my own families hair, but these clippers are amazing!  </li>
            <li>While these clippers might be great for the professional, trying to use them yourself can be quite a task.  </li>
            <li>I have been shaving my head for over 20 years and in that time I&#x27;ve gone through many clippers some cheap</li>
            <li>The detachable metal blades are much more comfortable to me than the plastic guides that you can buy, too.</li>

            <li>Plus, it is kind of fun giving haircuts.  </li>
            <li>It cuts great, keeps cool, and it is very durable.</li>
            <li>Also, while incurring more upfront cost, the blade system is  FAR superior the plastic guards of most store bought clippers.</li>
            <li>it is a good quality as much as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Having the option to buy other attachable blades is wonderful if you know what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>Other than that I&#x27;m very happy wiht my purchase.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to take the plunge and spend the money on a good set!</li>

            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>that is nice, but what really struck me is just how much better these clippers cut my hair.</li>
            <li>I purchased the 00000 size blade in addition to those that come with the clipper so that I can shave off my beard easily when called for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It brings two blade types - easily interchanged in seconds &lt;br</li>
            <li>The clipper blade is extremely easy to remove.</li>
            <li>Reliable and has easily detachable blades.</li>

            <li>This makes clipping easy -----</li>
            <li>Easy to maintain (see youtube video).</li>
            <li>watch youtube for easy instructions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too easy for that plastic to fall off.  </li>
            <li>easy to use</li>
            <li>11/25/14&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong.</li>
            <li>This clipper is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I bought this clipper 5 years ago for keeping my head shaved and its still going strong.</li>
            <li>if you want thicker plastic and a strong motor).  </li>
            <li>It has a 000 blade, cuts my hair every week and is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Still going strong.  </li>
            <li>However, It gives amazing cut at first attempt.</li>
            <li>Mine get warm, but I wouldn&#x27;t say hot.  </li>
            <li>Oh wow, the difference is astounding!</li>
            <li>The first I had was a $25 Wahl set from Walmart which kind of sucked out after awhile.</li>
            <li>They get pretty warm if you use longer than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>this is hands down the best hair clipper i&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>Switching blades is quick and easy, and the results are better than I&#x27;ve ever gotten with comb attachments.    </li>
            <li>This the best to knock down hair</li>
            <li>This is an excellent pair of clippers and I would highly recommend it to anyone from a novice to a professional.</li>
            <li>&quot; it did a good job until it broke and needed to get a new clipper.  </li>
            <li>I did my son&#x27;s curly hair and again, went very quickly and with a precise hair length.</li>
            <li>will tell in terms of value/longevity but in terms of performance these easily exceed the cheap models.</li>
            <li>I am a black guy and it cuts my hair perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Peel and half peel are what it does best...</li>
            <li>I did try a cheap pair first, to see if I could even shave my own head.  </li>
            <li>Lots of blades are available with sizes that are easy to understand.</li>
            <li>They go on just fine with the clipper turned off.</li>
            <li>The one and a half blade is perfect for clipper over comb work.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine, but I sprung for the 0000</li>
            <li>Though I am in it for the quick buzz cuts I haven&#x27;t had the thing running for more than 20min tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They cut quickly and well, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the motor dying on me or the blades not being able to handle that amount of hair like I did with the cheaper clippers I had purchased.</li>
            <li>They are so pleasant to use no pulled hairs, no going over the same area many times and</li>
            <li>Works good but getting very hot very soon</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re both very pleased and would highly recommend them to anyone.  </li>
            <li>What a vast wonderful improvement in performance.plus the blades are replaceable and the motor is repairable, Smart Choice</li>
            <li>Best clippers ever......hands down!</li>
            <li>Heavy duty clippers, great for shaving my own head.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with the smooth and quiet operation of this clipped.</li>
            <li>the time it used to take me to trim now which is a huge quality of life improvement.</li>
            <li>your cash and buy this instead of the cheap 40-50$ ones.</li>
            <li>Great product overall!</li>
            <li>It cuts like a knife through butter and is easy to clean and change blades.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and relube.  </li>
            <li>It is solid (and rather heavy)and seems to have a great motor.</li>
            <li>These extensions work well and have a secure fit on the clipper.</li>
            <li>My wife has been clipping my hair for years with cheap clippers.</li>
            <li>So precise and on point.</li>
            <li>This one will last and works great.</li>
            <li>The sound of the motor is music to my ears.</li>
            <li>It cuts easy and clean.</li>
            <li>some not so cheap and these clipper blow everyone one of them away.</li>
            <li>The newer A6 (marketed for pet grooming, but great for human hair) is slimmer, quieter, and cooler running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The instruction manual obviously doesn&#x27;t expect blade changes on the fly because there are no diagrams.  </li>
            <li>They cut smoothly and precisely.</li>
            <li>I have bought cheap clippers from department stores for years.  </li>
            <li>and they fit my hands perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They do get warm when doing your whole head, but not hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but this item is one of my most productive purchase in years.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and store.    </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect the \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; sound as you cut your hair, it just cuts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic, what can I say?</li>
            <li>and they are fantastic.      </li>
            <li>I cannot say enough and happy with my investment.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>some cheap walmart clippers take your pick on the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I primarily use these as my &amp;#34;take down&amp;#34; clippers.</li>
            <li>This clipper is fantastic.</li>
            <li>They were affordable and with amazon prime the shipping was free.</li>
            <li>There are somethings you can go cheap on; this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t cheap out</li>
            <li>Absolutely fantastic set of clippers.</li>
            <li>my time is worth more to me than waiting in line for a cut.</li>
            <li>their lengths, and how many days of hair growth the length corresponds to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade - Length, days worth of hair growth:&lt;br /&gt;00000 - 1/125” , 10 hours&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only problem I had is that I dropped them from about 3 feet and the case cracked, but the clippers still work great.  </li>
            <li>I used them the same day and performed a great Fade haircut on a friend.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t cheap, but I can&#x27;t imagine being happier with a set of clippers.</li>
            <li>I have this for several years, and it works great.  </li>
            <li>The way the blade move is really smooth</li>
            <li>I purchased a couple sets of guides that fit these clippers depending on the blades attached.</li>
            <li>If the blades are lightly oiled after every use, they should cut one or two heads virtually forever.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend the clippers to someone who is looking for clippers of great quality.</li>
            <li>These things are fabulous.</li>
            <li>Just the way the sound and</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>I continued along the rest of my scalp it was fantastic.</li>
            <li>honestly can&#x27;t imagine how much better(or</li>
            <li>I went back to the 000 blade and that works great for</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am saving money on haircuts and I am saving time by doing it all at home without driving or making an appointment or having to wait for my stylist to be available.  </li>
            <li>After running through two sets of cheap shears, I decided to step up and buy there.  </li>
            <li>Holy smokes, this thing is a Cadillac compared to my cheap clippers that my wife has trimmed my hair with for 10 years.</li>
            <li>would recommend Oster&#x27;s fast feed clippers over these, I have them too,  if you want to cut your own hair...</li>
            <li>WHY YOU SHOULDN&#x27;T BOTHER WITH A CHEAP BUZZER:&lt;br</li>
            <li>They cut smoothly and don&#x27;t push the hair like cheaper clippers that you by in department stores.</li>
            <li>I bought a cheap clipper made by GE at Walmart.</li>
            <li>These clippers don&#x27;t even change sound when I swamp it with my hair.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap like the one you buy for 50-60$.</li>
            <li>Before i had purchased these, i had been buying the cheaper versions available in department and drug stores.  </li>
            <li>I cut my hair and face with these and it leaves both looking smooth</li>
            <li>I went onto another Wahl set, a $50 model with a more powerful motor.</li>
            <li>The problem is they do not cut as close as the cheap ones do.  </li>
            <li>Works great for all the different blades and clipper, cape, etc.</li>
            <li>The blades on this Oster are mechanically reciprocating (not just vibrating like the cheap clippers).  </li>
            <li>These are well built and precisely made.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves it and so far, the best investment considering that he cuts his hair every ten days :)</li>
            <li>You can tell by how smooth the unit works.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>For years I have shaved my head with cheap $20-$30</li>
            <li>Cuts Clean and easily.</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT, VERY QUIET, WELL MADE, PRICED RIGHT,&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>No stray hairs, no gouges, just an overall great experience.</li>
            <li>Sure its more than twice as much</li>
            <li>It has more heft, the cord is thicker and more substantial, even the blades appear much tougher.</li>
            <li>/&gt;4)The \\&quot;76\\&quot; is made in the USA, it&#x27;s good to know we still make something, and I gladly support an American company</li>
            <li>My wife will cut the back of my head to make sure I don&#x27;t butcher it, and I&#x27;m good to go for another month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Andis is the best for fast short head and face shaving</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>I use this every week end since i bought it - strong and sturdy - no failure REMARKS An air blower would be a nice thing to have for maintenance.</li>
            <li>Out of all the researching i had done, the Oster Classic 76 came out on top!</li>
            <li>Classic 76 Professional is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>Quick, easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and they are all very useful.</li>
            <li>Very powerful clippers.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are already many, many review for the Classic 76.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty pleased w/ the Wahl but decided to purchase this trimmer based upon its reputation as an industry standard and great reviews.  </li>
            <li>Yes, these aren&#x27;t cheap, but  after 30 seconds, 59 year old wife liked how easily they cut and performed.</li>
            <li>Clean and precise.</li>
            <li>You can even cut your own hair with the tried and trued Classic 76 if no one around to cut it for you.  </li>
            <li>first impression was that these clippers were much more substantial than the cheap ones I had been using.</li>
            <li>This is the best,It cut&#x27;s hair quickly and so easily.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Haircuts\\&quot; by this method are now so quick and easy</li>
            <li>If you cut your own hair, or your children&#x27;s hair often, make the investment and by the Oster Classic 76.</li>
            <li>maintenance is super easy, as is changing the blades.  </li>
            <li>and I still can&#x27;t get over how easy and quick it is to trim my hair now.</li>
            <li>I have cut my own hair since high school and have always used the run of the mill clippers.  </li>
            <li>Comes highly recommended and it does the job,  Sturdy construction although a bit bulky and warm to the touch after extended use</li>
            <li>Nice set of clippers, you can tellits high quality.  </li>
            <li>these are huge clippers - and whether you can adjust to that or not, the size is still less than ideal.</li>
            <li>Powerful!</li>
            <li>I used the first one on a weekly basis for many years.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>I  was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact that parts are available from the manufacturer (rare these days and getting more rare every year)</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t mind yearly maintenance, these are great.</li>
            <li>&gt;... and to think how long I&#x27;ve been getting by with the cheapy Walmart/ happy homeowner clipper brands.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything that I said in my original review stands.</li>
            <li>it gets too hot and also just come with 2 options os cut, if you want more you have to buy.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with it&lt;</li>
            <li>When I first used these clippers I was in love.  </li>
            <li>Worth the investment!</li>
            <li>Really worth the price!</li>
            <li>The 9&#x27; Cord is the best no more looking for a closer outlet or extension cord.</li>
            <li>Get the job done fast and easy!</li>
            <li>Powerful, and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>I bought the spray and some barbicide to keep all my tools clean</li>
            <li>Amazing quality cuts at home just make sure that your metal blades are greased properly or else your hair will snag.</li>
            <li>I keep my head shaved clean</li>
            <li>Keep it clean and well oiled.  </li>
            <li>The cheap ones pull as much as they cut, require many passes, and still miss plenty of &#x27;rogue&#x27; hairs.</li>
            <li>I clean out the hairs and add some clipper oil before and after each use.</li>
            <li>hair looks better, feels better, and offers the benefits of being a bit butch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a through cleaning I tried them on myself and was thrilled at the ease of the cut and the fact that I was able to clean up my very short haircut without a trip to the barber.</li>
            <li>No comb-over, just the Mr. Clean look with the help of the Oster 76076.  </li>
            <li>The Oster Classic 76 makes fading very easy, and there is no vibration in the unit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These clippers work very well, very smooth, effortless trimming.</li>
            <li>The quality of the a classic 76 Universal Motor Clipped is very good.  </li>
            <li>This is the right one!</li>
            <li>Smooth, quick, but heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>I recommend this Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper because it is great at trimming the head and beards.</li>
            <li>so I wanted to update this review and say I love the Classic 76 even more than when I first got it.</li>
            <li>I had several clippers, and this one is by far the best and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Still using these after 3 years, they paid for themselves in the first month,  I still get fresh cuts at the house :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time in my life i was exited to open the box of a hair clipper lol.</li>
            <li>Powerful accurate operation.</li>
            <li>Would have been nice to include the combs directly in the kit...</li>
            <li>Sweet, J\just what I ordered</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a kind of old school look about it.  </li>
            <li>thing has the feel of a good solid machine.</li>
            <li>I USE THIS EVERY MONTH OR TWO FOR A FULL SHAVE..</li>
            <li>FULL BODY SHAVE</li>
            <li>The cheap ones just aren&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
            <li>FINALLY, HE HAS SOME GOOD CLIPPERS.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair, so far this thing has paid for it&#x27;self</li>
            <li>but you probably won&#x27;t buy that many or replace them very often.</li>
            <li>The only way it can cut my hair is if I go against the grain which does not look as good on me.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>The old school look is nice and sleek.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very meticulous about cleaning/lubricating them and making sure the cord doesn&#x27;t kink.  </li>
            <li>know it&#x27;s going to last me for a good time,</li>
            <li>B0012KKRBO Oster AgION clipper blade size 3.75 Full Tooth.]], plus the two a #1 and a #00000 that came with the kit.</li>
            <li>clippers themselves are powerful and precise.  </li>
            <li>and it is sweet.</li>
            <li>One pass and the hair is perfect, no matter how thick it is.  </li>
            <li>To achieve a good fade it takes some trial and error with the different blade sizes, but I have it figured out now.  </li>
            <li>have to let them cool</li>
            <li>I am satisfied and would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much, Rosanna</li>
            <li>Within 24 hours of leaving this review I received an email that they will refund the full amount.</li>
            <li>And if somehow, after years of use, some part wears out or breaks, just look it up on the full schematic and order a replacement PART and fix it yourself.</li>
            <li>Some may say it&#x27;s exagereted to buy a professionnal unit to cut your own hair, but i&#x27;ve spent more on cheap unit.</li>
            <li>the extra money to invest in a good pair</li>
            <li>I can go full speed whisking this thing through my hair and it doesn&#x27;t even stutter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not so bad that I don&#x27;t want to use it, but it is noticeable&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not so bad that I don&#x27;t want to use it, but it is noticeable&lt;br</li>
            <li>Like many others, I have a whole drawer full of $20 clippers.  </li>
            <li>(2) Switching out new blades &#x3D; VERY EASY.  </li>
            <li>Well it got warm / hot right out of the box, so I oiled it exactly the way the video showed, and no change.</li>
            <li>But it would be fairly easy to switch it out for a higher quality metal</li>
            <li>Its really pretty easy.  </li>
            <li>, it should be noted that these clippers get hot VERY quickly.</li>
            <li>I first tried these on  my dog who has incredibly thick and fine hair,  and they worked superbly.</li>
            <li>The steel blades are quickly interchanged and provide a very smooth and comfortable cut, with that professional look I so wanted.</li>
            <li>One nice thing I liked is the little metal hanger on the bottom</li>
            <li>It cuts with ease through my hair which clogs most other clippers and also leaves a nice clean finish (no clipper streaks or stripes).</li>
            <li>Also, the haircut process is much more pleasant with no tugging/pulling like is common from the cheap brands.</li>
            <li>It is powerful and cuts clean.  </li>
            <li>Tends to heat up too quickly.</li>
            <li>(salon charges $55 a cut and Super Cut</li>
            <li>It has some heft to it, but it cuts so quickly that the weight is not a problem.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and I received the package within five days of ordering.</li>
            <li>Makes quick work of my beard.  </li>
            <li>Not convenient for a quick grab and shave  -No carrying case or any type of storage for that matter    </li>
            <li>This clipper cuts super.</li>
            <li>quick shipping.</li>
            <li>blade change with quick detach.&lt;br /&gt;Standard</li>
            <li>Very durable, easy to use, fantastic quality, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Of course this clipper pays for itself quite quickly if compared to the cost and inconvenience of going to a</li>
            <li>Also there is no sitting and waiting for the next available barber when you cut your own hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK...so I pulled the trigger on the Oster \\&quot;Classic 76\\&quot; after throwing away the $25 type clippers more times than I care to remember.  </li>
            <li>Five Stars is appropriate here, for a genuine, professional quality machine.  </li>
            <li>It cuts quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>This one definitely has more heft to it and a lot more power.</li>
            <li>Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned and I&#x27;ve had a lot over the last ten years.</li>
            <li>I do love how fast and powerful they are</li>
            <li>quick delivery.</li>
            <li>I called Oster hoping for a quick fix</li>
            <li>I have tried many different clippers on the market, some cheap some not so cheap but on special</li>
            <li>Other than that works fine good price</li>
            <li>Its high quality and top notch quality.</li>
            <li>and it does a great job if you&#x27;re looking for a clean and tight cut.</li>
            <li>Most of all, Amazon made it so easy to acquire the clipper, better than any other sites.</li>
            <li>I bought this while I was deployed over seas and cut my own hair and the hair of many other Marines.</li>
            <li>When you turn it on, the first thing you notice is the sound.</li>
            <li>but it gets very hot when using</li>
            <li>The motor runs smoothly and, while it does get hot evetually, it takes a while for it to heat up.    </li>
            <li>the motor gets very hot though...</li>
            <li>The directions kind of suck.&lt;br /&gt;You absolutely need a blade wash to make sure these work properly.  </li>
            <li>Great product, Hands Down.</li>
            <li>Although it was pretty $$$, it was very worth it.</li>
            <li>but so far, I am impressed with the speed and ease with which it cut through my hair, requiring only two passes...one to get all the hair and the second one being my anxiety and wanting to just make sure.</li>
            <li>Make sure the unit is running when you slap the new blade on.</li>
            <li>I was confident the product was brand new because each part was wrapped in plastic and the box was undamaged.</li>
            <li>I love my new clippers.  </li>
            <li>New to Amazon, I was a bit apprehensive to buy something with a reasonably large price tag, BUT this clipper is amazing.</li>
            <li>Parts and extra blades in many sizes and types are easily available and professional repair is available in most areas.</li>
            <li>but, even though they don&#x27;t last as long as I think they should, I still use one because I think it is the best for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can absolutely recommend these if you are looking for a reliable easy to use set of clippers.</li>
            <li>They give a nice, smooth finish and the triple zero blades give a nice high and tight.</li>
            <li>Good manufacturing very well made, a bit heavy, which means it has a very strong motor.  </li>
            <li>Also, like a lawn mower, the Oster 76 clippers are very loud when compared to most magnetic clippers.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re ready to step up from the cheap disposables most people try to get by with, the Classic 76 is worth considering.</li>
            <li>Because he&#x27;s gone through so many, all of minimal quality, I bought the Oster Classic 76 for him knowing they were top of the line and hoping he&#x27;d love them.  </li>
            <li>From the first gliding pass, I was wide-eyed giddy!</li>
            <li>At first I balked at paying the price since they&#x27;re just for home use, but I would do it again in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li>so if you are a self trimmer you will have your hand wrapped around the hot vents!  </li>
            <li>For saving me from that, it paid for itself on its first use!</li>
            <li>after 10 mins of using its burning hot !</li>
            <li>It broke on the first use!  </li>
            <li>I was very excited to get my new clippers, I&#x27;d considered this purchase for a year or two.  </li>
            <li>it so nice ...a little costly though by its worthy ,my husband love it</li>
            <li>Does a great job, easy to clean, and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>it takes MUCH practice to fine tune</li>
            <li>Well worth the high price!!!</li>
            <li>I have had them now for a couple of years and they are as good as new whereas the others were ready to throw out by now, mainly because the blades blunt.</li>
            <li>This Clipper is the real deal, Salon quality and it cuts incredible, it is a bit heavy but with weight come quality.  </li>
            <li>The power cord is very sturdy and never curls up around itself like the power cables for cheap clippers.    </li>
            <li>As a balding person, it really helped me clip the sides of my head for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>POWERFUL.</li>
            <li>The Oster 76 is not the slimmest of the trimmers but its quite a powerful unit that gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>I think if it is good enough for the professional barber it is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>There are many different attachments available too.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it as the clippers do such a nice job.</li>
            <li>Quieter than my old clippers, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>Totally worth it.  </li>
            <li>I am a male whom has cut his own hair since I was 17</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Its worth it, faster too.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Alas, when my girlfriend came home from work, I just had to share my joy!....</li>
            <li>It is powerful and the motor just keeps going and going.  </li>
            <li>They are well worth the money and have already paid for themselves in the savings from not having to visit a barber or stylist.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few others but these are by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality is worth the price.</li>
            <li>In the \\&quot;old days\\&quot; the quality of Osters were much better than they are today</li>
            <li>But if you just use it at home for your own haircutting, this clipper should last you a lifetime, unlike the drug store brands.</li>
            <li>this clipper seem to be so much better than my old wahl clipper i had.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is the rare exception.  </li>
            <li>Yes, they are over $100, but they are worth every dollar.  </li>
            <li>The body cavity is bigger and heavier than the kind you get at the pharmacy, Target or Walmart.  </li>
            <li>These clippers are well-made and powerful.</li>
            <li>Worth the money I hope.  </li>
            <li>I love these clippers, I use them on my husband and 2 1/2 yr old son.</li>
            <li>Motor cooling vents are near top</li>
            <li>Love it so far.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better to spend the extra $$$ than to go cheap.</li>
            <li>The quality of my cuts have gone up considerably and these things are built so much better than the others I always bought.  </li>
            <li>The clippers tend to operate warm almost immediately after turning them on (this really isn&#x27;t a big deal).    </li>
            <li>This was definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Make no mistake about it, this machine is incredibly powerful.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have to keep going over the same spots for a nice close even cut.  </li>
            <li>POWERFUL &amp; STURDY.  </li>
            <li>IMO it is also worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>This Oster clipper is worth five, IMO.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The oster 76 is worth every dollar</li>
            <li>well made and powerful.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for the working professional or anyone that maintains their appearance on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>It went through like butter and the only way I knew it had cut a nice swath of hair is all the shavings that fell in the sink.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent.</li>
            <li>Took me a while to get used to holding the bigger heavier clippers while buzzing my own head.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame that the ability to repair something has become so rare that it&#x27;s a selling point, but there you have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked this actually as I only needed</li>
            <li>so you&#x27;ll get your monies worth.</li>
            <li>I came here to buy the 00000 blade just for the fun of it and decided to leave a review.</li>
            <li>I had become discouraged with the cheap clippers I&#x27;d bought over the years (eventually breaking or not cutting very well with use).  </li>
            <li>Great professional clippers for personal style!!</li>
            <li>Probably worth $70-80.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitely worth</li>
            <li>worth the money...</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>But if you want a reliable powerful blade system, the 76 is IT.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just a regular middle-aged bald guy who cuts his own hair at home.</li>
            <li>But the cost didn&#x27;t leave me ecstatic about them - although I thought it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>Worth every cent...</li>
            <li>It cuts so nice and short.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth learning.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>cut my own hair and I like it short.</li>
            <li>When you turn them on you hear the sound of a quality motor.... and the blade action is smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li>but they are powerful.  </li>
            <li>and this is it, only more precise.  </li>
            <li>it was nice to have the extra razor in the package</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Maybe the best $ I&#x27;ve ever spent for personal care.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>So far I have found that these clippers produce a perfectly even cut the first pass every time, this cuts down on the time it takes to cut my hair and it also reduces wear on the motor.</li>
            <li>These too are high quality clippers making trimming quick and accurate.</li>
            <li>I love my wahls but the oster cut is so much more tight and clean without leaving those sprigs from split ends.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about twice the weight of a walmart brand trimmer, but as long as you&#x27;re ok with that it&#x27;s perfect (other than the high price).    </li>
            <li>Not only are they efficient, but they cut very accurately and cleanly.</li>
            <li>$117.90 is a lot more than other brands but quality costs more.  </li>
            <li>thing I do not like about the 76 is that it heats up pretty quickly, it&#x27;s like having a portable Heater in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trunk can quickly become too hot to handle.</li>
            <li>Keep it clean, well oiled and rig a large rubber band to hold the blade guard in place.  </li>
            <li>Multiple guides make styling easy and length of cut easy.</li>
            <li>The instructions said &amp;#34;Professional Use Only&amp;#34; and I thought maybe I gone too far in the search for high quality clippers, but they are nice for home use too.  </li>
            <li>High end product with low maintenance and a fair price.</li>
            <li>This enables it to be cleaned the right way.</li>
            <li>I ordered these clippers 3 months ago and right off the bat I was having issues.</li>
            <li>thats right, two in</li>
            <li>Just click buy and stop wasting your time getting your hair cut right.</li>
            <li>The body of the clippers broke right below the blades.  </li>
            <li>THE PRICE WAS RIGHT.</li>
            <li>Look like something produced decades ago when things were built right.</li>
            <li>Renegade\\&quot;, and you&#x27;ll also be a pro at maintaining your own 76 in 8 minutes and 37 seconds flat!    </li>
            <li>/&gt;3)The size of the \\&quot;76\\&quot; is pretty perfect for my slightly larger than average hands, but I think most any adult wouldn&#x27;t have difficulty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to know how it worked, how it was put together, and, most importantly, how to keep it perpetually giddy, too, with grease and oil and all the TLC it deserved.</li>
            <li>The Classic 76 has the power to give you a comfortable and effortless haircut.  </li>
            <li>These clippers do a pretty good job, but aren&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li>Cuts fast and cleanly.</li>
            <li>and I feel sure the heft is oweing to its better construction with higher quality motor and other parts.</li>
            <li>Few things are more satisfying than shaving your own head and going through your mane with ease, especially after a No Shave marathon.</li>
            <li>In my opinion you can get the same results from buying a better quality NON detachable clipper like an Andis Master, Oster Fast feed, or a Wahl senior for a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li>this new oster is a very fine high qualitY product.  </li>
            <li>but I can say for certain this is by far the most powerful machine I have ever used</li>
            <li>I like how the 2 blades are easily switched out for the different types of blades available.</li>
            <li>After switching from my cheap, $50 clippers with the plastic guards, the time that it took to cut my own hair was \\&quot;cut\\&quot; in half.</li>
            <li>but I may switch back to the Cordless remington some day for the light easy self trim.</li>
            <li>It does get hot pretty quickly but still seems to work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s big, powerful, heavily built and does an excellent job.</li>
            <li>Is fast easy to clean and you get the barber shop professional cut without their price</li>
            <li>These are powerful, the quality is evident the moment you begin using&lt;br</li>
            <li>As someone who shaves his head weekly and has given himself haircuts his entire life, i can&#x27;t say enough how important it is to invest in good clippers.  </li>
            <li>It seems there is a better cut when using the bare blade.  </li>
            <li>The cord on the A6 is nice and long, but Oster added a transformer box that hangs about a foot away from the outlet.</li>
            <li>Good clipper for taking down hair.</li>
            <li>It was a good investment other than that!</li>
            <li>My husband has very thick hair, and after going through 2 much cheaper Wahls within a month each, we decided that this might be our best bet.  </li>
            <li>I bought them to shave my head and these things go right through the hair the first time.</li>
            <li>an shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>A6 requires you to depress a button before the blade will swing out - that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>same old design but still maintain good quality.</li>
            <li>If you want a clean bald look then I would recommend the Andis T Outlinner over the classic 76.</li>
            <li>The blades included with the clipper 1 and 000 are skinhead boot camp army style short, so buy a bigger blade, 3 3/4 blade worked great for</li>
            <li>It was easy to clean after use, and it seems pretty simple to switch blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t quite understand how this happened, nor can I understand why Oster would use a cheap plastic on/off switch on such a beautiful heavy duty pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>(*) The A6 requires you to depress a button before the blade will swing out - that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li>They were very fast in encouraging me to buy from them and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>It happens very fast as well.</li>
            <li>I bough it for my husband and so far works perfectly fine till now</li>
            <li>So far they are working just fine.</li>
            <li>The 76 feels very substantial and durable, with a strong, quiet, motor that cuts extremely smooth.  </li>
            <li>There is a nice video on the Oster website that will show you how to grease the mechanism and other useful tips.</li>
            <li>Even though it&#x27;s a little bulky, the clipper does a good job.</li>
            <li>I replaced it with this NEW oster hair clipper and like mY original oster</li>
            <li>Pros: excellent build quality and cutting ability, cuts swiftly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more like \\&quot;the dark side of the moon and a super nova\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you never used a clipper (like myself) it can very very itimidating on your first use.</li>
            <li>I finally upgraded to these clippers and it made a huge difference!  </li>
            <li>The first clipper I owned lasted for twenty five years.</li>
            <li>gets to hot after u use it for like 5 or 10 min</li>
            <li>The Oster is powerful and cuts my hair much faster than off the shelf brands.</li>
            <li>After 15 minutes is was hot as hell, what a bunch of lairs oster team.</li>
            <li>Beast of a machine, cut&#x27;s through everything first time around -</li>
            <li>The kids remain cooperative through the entire cut, and results are much better and even looking.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident these will last for years since I&#x27;m using them at home and not in a shop.</li>
            <li>They stay cool and pretty quiet compared to my cheap pair I had.  </li>
            <li>i did a lot of research on different types of clippers and i am so glad that i chose this one.</li>
            <li>It zips through my husband&#x27;s hair like the proverbial hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It also get really hot at times.  </li>
            <li>I use the #0A blade (which I got for an extra $22) and love this machine.</li>
            <li>The first set I bought was defective, I returned them without any issues.</li>
            <li>Just got this clipper a couple weeks ago and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>(*)</li>
            <li>(*)</li>
            <li>(*)</li>
            <li>(*)</li>
            <li>(*) The A6 does run cooler on the handle.</li>
            <li>The blade sure was, but that&#x27;s no different than my experience with the 76 (and why I bought some of Oster&#x27;s cooling</li>
            <li>(*)</li>
            <li>(*)</li>
            <li>Very durable and powerful machine.  </li>
            <li>Sure, the cord gets in the way occasionally, but not to a point of frustration.</li>
            <li>Love them and feel like I made a purchase that will last for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>Detachable blades give much flexiblity for length of hair, which makes it great for cutting your own hair as I do.  </li>
            <li>Blades are somewhat expensive so it is probably best to get them on eBay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this one will last longer than I will.</li>
            <li>Very durable and worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>Not noisy or hot either.</li>
            <li>They work much, much better than the big box clippers and appear to be built to last for many years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are pretty beefy.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to have plenty of power.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one consistent cut length for each guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this will be the last pair of hair clippers</li>
            <li>If you experience the blade getting too hot try using some oil on the blade before you start it up.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re exactly what I was hoping for and needing.</li>
            <li>Especially if you trim your hair weekly or more</li>
            <li>Sad I missed out on the awesome mustache printed clippers.</li>
            <li>I believe this will last for many years.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>I am so glad I finally made this purchase.  </li>
            <li>The difference between the quality of the Classic 76 and department store bought clippers is tremendous.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer itself does exhaust hot air, something the wahl never did.</li>
            <li>It is extremely smooth and quiet but does get warm after a very short period of use.</li>
            <li>And finally I love the old fashioned fantastic quality of the 76 and I expect it to last for the rest of my life and turning 73 this month</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first one I ordered got almost too hot to hold.  </li>
            <li>Pretty sealed off in that I don&#x27;t have to worry about hair going inside the housing.</li>
            <li>if you want a better cut and a clipper that will last longer, get these.</li>
            <li>to clean&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot.  </li>
            <li>I decided to step up to a \\&quot;hopefully\\&quot; longer lasting better quality clippers.</li>
            <li>They melted away the hair on my head like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been kicking myself for not purchasing these two clippers sooner, but I&#x27;m glad that I finally stumbled upon them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There were times when I wanted to place it on Ebay to sell it because I have been lugging it around all my life in all the various cities/states that I lived in and can say that I am glad it kept it even though I haven&#x27;t owned a dog for over 8 years.  </li>
            <li>I love the clippers, however, they only lasted about a year.</li>
            <li>They run quite hot and snag the hair in spite of cleaning and oiling.</li>
            <li>More tricky is the Oster T-finisher tool, sold separately, because the T-finisher tool can cut the skin if not used properly.</li>
            <li>The motor is fast and powerful.</li>
            <li>As a fifteen year vet of the industry, I suppose I have the chops to weigh this pretty</li>
            <li>meaning...if you invest in the metal blades in different sizes, your cuts will be much more polished, fades look immaculate.</li>
            <li>It cuts through hair like a hot knife through butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really nice having actual blades of different sizes to change out instead of the cheap flimsy plastic clip on combs.</li>
            <li>The blades are a bit expensive but you WILL get a perfect cut every time.</li>
            <li>The motor does get hot after a while, however.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought more then 10 clippers so when my last walmart whal died i decided to bite the bullet and get something</li>
            <li>but I recommend using clippers that are more geared toward fades such as the Wahl Five Star Seniors or Andis Masters (without the fade blade as the fade blade pulls and bites your skin).</li>
            <li>I noticed this the first time I used the clippers.</li>
            <li>I had an old pair of cheap ones that I purchased at Walmart and when they broke, I decided to make the investment in a nicer pair.  </li>
            <li>The first Oster I bought was in 1962.  </li>
            <li>Others have said they get hot.  </li>
            <li>Like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li>I made sure they were properly oiled and greased, but they still run hot after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>The casing does get hot, which I was not accustomed to this heat.</li>
            <li>This clipper can stand haircut after haircut without getting hot.  </li>
            <li>They can get a bit hot if you use them for a while</li>
            <li>Well, it is a lot heavier than my last Wahl clipper, that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li>Overall this is an outstanding product</li>
            <li>Wish I never wasted money and time on all those cheap models before getting these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>the dog)&lt;br /&gt;My main issue is how insanely hot the clippers get, and how quickly.</li>
            <li>addition, the clippers, themselves, are hot to hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it still runs hot.  </li>
            <li>: I still love this clipper and I use it regularly.  </li>
            <li>They looked just like the ones I had seen at my barber shop(probably the exact same in all reality), It had great weight to it, the blades looked to be a giant leap over the Wahl and the whole thing</li>
            <li>I powered it up and turned it on, it vibrated at such a higher speed that I could feel it was going to cut much better.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The clipper does not begin to get hot in that amount of time.  </li>
            <li>I was aware of</li>
            <li>but you would expect a product to last for more than 3 months.</li>
            <li>, the clipper gets EXTREMELY HOT while in use.</li>
            <li>We tried plugging the clippers into many outlets in our home, but the same issues occur at each outlet.  </li>
            <li>We are totally dissatisfied and will not be buying any more Oster products, hair clippers or otherwise.</li>
            <li>No issues from the begining, i use it every WE since the first day.</li>
            <li>This product is great and will last a LONG time.</li>
            <li>It broke after first use.</li>
            <li>They are solid and plan on using them for many years to come.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t become hot on the portion that you hold, if well lubricated.</li>
            <li>but they are pretty noisy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blades do warm up, but that is to be expected, they don&#x27;t get too hot to touch by any means.&lt;br</li>
            <li>fan is attached to the motor which circulates air through it, the motor does not get hot.</li>
            <li>My kids have been using it almost daily for more than a year</li>
            <li>I have been doing this for almost 2 years and in that time, this is the 3rd pair of clippers I have had, graduating to better quality each time.</li>
            <li>husband started shaving the first time</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it would be if I had to cut a lot of hair in a day but only having to shave my husband</li>
            <li>It also gets extremely hot.  </li>
            <li>This is not difficult.  </li>
            <li>the higher the number the longer the cut.  </li>
            <li>Came in on time and works exactly as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>and it went threw it like a hot knife threw butter.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you need anything higher than the 3/4&#x27;s inch blade cause</li>
            <li>the cheap department store clippers and these are a long ways from the cheap vibrating motor clipper.  </li>
            <li>The blades are a different story, they work ok but within a year ull have to replace them.</li>
            <li>they would produce better results and last longer.</li>
            <li>I am the first person to use the spare pair of clippers the salon just bought.</li>
            <li>Does a better job in one pass than cheaper clipped do in multiple passes.</li>
            <li>Larger and heavier than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; clippers, but worth it for an easy cut</li>
            <li>my 10 year old daughter who is very artistic plus these Oster 76 clippers (and a set of Oster Fast Feeds....</li>
            <li>It is quiet when it is running and the blades are super smooth.</li>
            <li>When I got the Oster Classic 76&#x27;s, needless to say the service was great but the product its self was outstanding.</li>
            <li>Another positive aspect of these that is worth the price -- no crappy plastic guards are necessary, you can just get easily interchangable blades.  </li>
            <li>My impression is that the electric motor is larger and more powerful, but that it also operates at a lower RPM giving it a different sound.</li>
            <li>I spent most of that time buying a new set of the cheapest clippers available and running them into the ground, which only took about a year for most.</li>
            <li>After years of clipping my own hair with a consumer-grade Oster clipper, I finally plunged into the realm of pure clipping bliss with my new toy...</li>
            <li>A little loud, but great.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better than the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; attachments to boot&lt;br /&gt;6)Speaking of the combs, I ordered those too and they are far better than average.  </li>
            <li>After seeing my boys, several family and friends have asked me to cut their hair, too, so I can only figure I am doing a pretty good</li>
            <li>It got warm, but not hot.  </li>
            <li>Gets real hot and reminds me of old BMW or Mercedes motor.</li>
            <li>Strong motor, sharp blades and provides a smooth even trim everytime.</li>
            <li>Very precise and made to run for long time.  </li>
            <li>In practical terms, that means that on a single pass, you&#x27;re getting even, smooth cuts saving you significant amounts of time.</li>
            <li>A great choice for a serious pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>They are truly professional in that they cut cleanly and effortlessly to exacting lengths.</li>
            <li>It is indeed far superior to the previous set of $30 clippers I had from Walmart, and well worth the $125</li>
            <li>The Oster Classic 76 Pro Hair Clipper is not disappointing in any way.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several different makes and models but yet to find a good clipper.</li>
            <li>The cut is much smoother and done in one pass versus multiple passes with the many cheaper models I have used.  </li>
            <li>After having gone through about five of these kits in the last 10 years, I finally decided to get a good set of clippers.</li>
            <li>The 000 blade it comes with is good, but not low enough for me.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on a cheap product you&#x27;ll have to replace yearly (or more).</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair in a simple military style so what I want from a clipper is reliability, sturdiness, a quiet motor and, most importantly, a smooth and even clip.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and quit running for such a powerful machine.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money for a high quality product.</li>
            <li>My hair never grows long enough to find out if it is way more powerful than a cheap one.  </li>
            <li>and I mean MANY MANY YEARS.</li>
            <li>after many years of cutting my own hair with $30-ish clippers....i finally decided to get a professional clipper.. for those of you that cut your own hair...throw or give away those cheap clippers.</li>
            <li>They are extremely loud and get hot a bit to quick.  </li>
            <li>I AGREE WITH ALL OF THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ON THIS CLIPPER.</li>
            <li>The A6 seems to vibrate a bit more in my hand than the 76, but I think it&#x27;s that it vibrates at a different frequency (similar to the sound).</li>
            <li>(*) The A6 doesn&#x27;t require (or really allow) you to periodically replace grease.</li>
            <li>The A6 seems to vibrate a bit more in my hand than the 76, but I think it&#x27;s that it vibrates at a different frequency (similar to the sound).</li>
            <li>(*) The A6 doesn&#x27;t require (or really allow) you to periodically replace grease.</li>
            <li>This clipper will cut hair pretty fast.</li>
            <li>&quot; buy periodically replacing my failing cheap&#x27;ohs with other cheap&#x27;ohs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think they are pretty much just junk.</li>
            <li>All said, the Oster 76 makes the clippers you find at most department store retailers seem like toys, and because spare parts are readily available for this model, there&#x27;s no reason why they shouldn&#x27;t last a lifetime if you properly maintain them.</li>
            <li>I would also strongly recommend purchasing a tube or bottle of the Oster Lubricating Oil to keep them sharp and use the included brush to clean them thoroughly after each use.</li>
            <li>it pretty much just feels like you are brushing your hair the clippers.</li>
            <li>it was exactly how it was described and fast delivery</li>
            <li>For my purposes the \\&quot;000\\&quot; is OK, but I&#x27;ll have to buy the \\&quot;00000\\&quot; before long.  </li>
            <li>the clippers arrived two weeks ago and tried working with it twice, the body and blade (the whole thing) gets hot after 4-minutes</li>
            <li>Thanks so much, Oster!</li>
            <li>Cuts a lot better than WA__ _ now lets see for how long .</li>
            <li>Having said that, I find the cut (when clippers are working properly) to be far superior to other brands.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Oster Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper to replace a cheap model from Wal-Mart that broke.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews on this clipper and others, it was obvious that the Oster Classic 76 is the Cadillac of clippers, so I bit the bullet and bought them.  </li>
            <li>The A6 is a more rounded shape, but it&#x27;s not that much smaller than the Classic 76.</li>
            <li>As many have stated, Classic 76 will be your last home hair clippers!</li>
            <li>a lot of haircuts later and am so pleased I purchased the Classic 76.  </li>
            <li>With the 3/4 inch and the 1/2 inch combs (VERY easy to change), I can cut my hair myself with a definite professional look.</li>
            <li>Gets a little warm but not uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>It works just like I thought it would will be using it for a very long time gladly recomend it</li>
            <li>Most quality magnetic clippers could last 15 years without even replacing or sharpening the blades if well maintained and if the operator cuts only clean hair.</li>
            <li>It comes with two different blades and they are really easy to interchange.    </li>
            <li>They are easy to maintain, built to last, and cut hair with ease.</li>
            <li>The Classic 76 clippers are smooth, relatively quiet, and powerful.  </li>
            <li>especially how easily they cut my hair.  </li>
            <li>I can easily see this lasting a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have two American Cocker Spaniels and this product efficiently and easily cuts through their hair in no time, reducing the time and stress put on them.  </li>
            <li>Strong and built to last.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s had the same set of these clippers for over 5 years now and they are still going strong.</li>
            <li>The material and quality of the parts seems good and seems like it will last for a long time.  </li>
            <li>have relatively large hands</li>
            <li>but certainly does the job.  </li>
            <li>These clippers are large...</li>
            <li>B001T0HHB0 Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb Set Specially Designed to Fit Oster Clippers]] which are very high quality and are spring loaded to snap onto the blades</li>
            <li>be sure to only put a new blade on when the clippers are turned on or you could ruin them</li>
            <li>It was pure smoooooothness; the motor hummed steadily and effortlessly; and there were no missed hairs!</li>
            <li>Easy to switch them out and much more reliable than plastic guards, at least in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other clippers in the past and this has certainly worked the best.  </li>
            <li>It works fine for me though as I only use it to cut my hair and trim my beard once every two weeks.</li>
            <li>her second and third cuts were better than my barber!</li>
            <li>box set had an extra clipper hear for doing fine clipping on the neck and around the</li>
            <li>This Oster Classic 76 clipper, however, cuts through the hair crisply.  </li>
            <li>the Oster Classic 76!    </li>
            <li>Her first cut come out decent...</li>
            <li>This is the first review I have written on Amazon, but I felt compelled to report my dissatisfaction with the Oster Classic 76 clippers and Oster&#x27;s customer service.  </li>
            <li>The quality of these Oster 76 Classic clippers was evident the moment I picked them up out of the well packed box.</li>
            <li>Blades are very high quality.</li>
            <li>Very high quality piece made in the USA.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the package recommendations, Make certain the cord is straight...</li>
            <li>but if you cut your own, like I do, then you would like it to be a little lighter.</li>
            <li>Body of the unit gets a little warm after 10 mins or so but head/blade assy does not.</li>
            <li>Sturdy little machine with nice heft.</li>
            <li>so it takes a little getting used to, if you clip your own hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off, the clipper itself retail for as high as $200 depending on the distributor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this clipper to anyone looking to start shaving their head for the first time or just to replace the clipper they already have.</li>
            <li>They are a little more but its your hair and its worth it.    </li>
            <li>Ive had these clippers for a little while now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut easy and clean.</li>
            <li>The clippers are a little heavy, but you can feel that they have a lot of power, and they cut perfectly.</li>
            <li>One minor concern I have is, when I tried to replace the comb, the blade easily came off clipper and it wasn&#x27;t easy to put it back.</li>
            <li>The blades are super sharp and do a FAR better job then</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s heavy duty, easy to clean, convenient for changing blades and basically indestructible.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really well built</li>
            <li>My wife has been cutting my hair with this (using a comb set) and it has been great!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li>i am very picky when it comes to the things that i purchase</li>
            <li>These clippers are the real deal.</li>
            <li>My wife used to cut my hair with the cheap, generic clipper we got from department stores, and it kept pulling on my hair.  </li>
            <li>SO much easier than using hand</li>
            <li>This is a relevant point with regards to the overall appraisal of the Oster 76 hair clipper.     </li>
            <li>We got them to replace the Wal-Mart brand ones which have to be replaced very often.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping...  </li>
            <li>and I have saved so much money by doing so.</li>
            <li>This clipper cuts fast, close and doesn&#x27;t clog up.</li>
            <li>Never realized how much time I was wasting before.  </li>
            <li>This was confirmed by our local barber.</li>
            <li>And to think, we spent $125 (with shipping) to still not be able to cut hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>Fading is easily accomplished.</li>
            <li>So I went and paid for this real clipper an a 000 blade to do it myself.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks Oster company for offering online 15 min.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny, if you want to save your time and money and give yourself a professional look this is a must have.</li>
            <li>i use this product regularly at work so it is important to have a quality tool and not to go with out it also.</li>
            <li>It cuts very well , I just wish that it would have included the # 2 metal guard :</li>
            <li>really like it though.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Also, I found it much easier to handle than some of the reviews suggested.    </li>
            <li>Cuts and cleans with no problems and is always ready for me, my brother, or my dad to use when needed.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon  Heather</li>
            <li>but it is definitely heaver than cheap plastic ones.</li>
            <li>I have been cutting my hair with clippers for almost 10 years now and this is the BEST clipper I ever had.</li>
            <li>it can get away from you fast.</li>
            <li>So much so that I have been told this by a barber.</li>
            <li>This clipper works very well.</li>
            <li>As I know how to fix clippers I pulled out the guts gently to see what the problem was.</li>
            <li>Thanks a lot dudes.</li>
            <li>Spend the money, get what real barbers use.</li>
            <li>I used the 00000 blades that I bought separately for $20 and they shave very close.</li>
            <li>really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well you might say, $120 is a bit much for a hair clippe, and I would say, lets talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With these I can literally goes as fast as I want.</li>
            <li>I like this replacement very well.  </li>
            <li>This is the Harley Davidson of hair clippers: old fashioned, sturdy, and outrageously powerful.</li>
            <li>Definitely a real machine and No wonder</li>
            <li>In summary, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;--They cut the hair like butter, they cut fast and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;--Powerful mortar that works</li>
            <li>He really loves them.</li>
            <li>then you really just need one.</li>
            <li>The cut is much smoother and quicker than with the cheaper units.</li>
            <li>so I told her if she messed up, I&#x27;ll just shave my whole head...</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re doing fades without a Fast Feed you&#x27;ll want the 0A blade also at a minimum.</li>
            <li>So finally the light came on</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like I getting much of the lubricant (provided) into the tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I prefer the length of a #2 size blade, which is available, but will set you back another $25 or so, sold separately.</li>
            <li>And very durable....</li>
            <li>Get the job done fast if you know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>clippers come with a very generous tube of oil for the blade and a tube of grease for the motor.</li>
            <li>Very efficient and one swipe does it.</li>
            <li>Cuts fast and thorough.</li>
            <li>I would suggest to Oster that they come out with a 000000 blade to accomodate those of us who are seeking a very close cut.</li>
            <li>I can now cut my hair much faster.  </li>
            <li>but they worked really well.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Got here fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not noisy and the iron clipper are very durable.</li>
            <li>After much research I ended up with this 76 model.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was much quieter too.</li>
            <li>The blades are excellent and the cutting effortless.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say it made it much easier for me.</li>
            <li>three &amp; often a whole collection are sold together.</li>
            <li>I highly recomend these over the $20 ones that you have to replace every year!</li>
            <li>bought a size 00000 blade also so to get a very close cut (almost shaved but not quite).  </li>
            <li>I thought they would blow through the hair much easier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m considering getting #0000 or #00000 blades as I like it real close (waited to see how close the #000 blade that comes with the set was).</li>
            <li>STILLLL cuts my head smooth bald with no problem...very quiet and never had any problems at all..</li>
            <li>Even my clients noticed the difference, said the clipper cut was much smoother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m bald and like to wear the hair I do have very close to the scalp, like .5-1.0mm, so I trim it weekly.</li>
            <li>After much thought and research (and a $100 Amazon gift card from my mother-in-law), I went with the Oster 76.</li>
            <li>Purchased there clippers to give myself a buzz cut two years ago and they are still cutting awesome.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my home to last longer than the cheap ones.  </li>
            <li>They have plenty of power and produce a very even cut.</li>
            <li>and he is very satisfy with it</li>
            <li>and it was ready for use which I used for a non-profit fundraiser.  </li>
            <li>I use the 00000 blade and it cuts really close.</li>
            <li>He really loves them.  </li>
            <li>My husband has been using this hair clipper now for some months, really likes it  and finds it very durable.  </li>
            <li>The one 1 blade and the triple 000 blade are equivalent to the adjustable clipper in the opend and closed position respectfully.  </li>
            <li>Very powerfull like I said.</li>
            <li>I really like the changable blades vs putting a plastic piece over the blade.</li>
            <li>this my choice to use as this brand is very affordable and dependable</li>
            <li>Should have bought one years ago, fooled around with cheaper clippers that never lasted or worked very well.</li>
            <li>VERY WELL BUILT, WORKS LIKE A CHARM, VERY SATISFIED!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>, they&#x27;re user serviceable (let&#x27;s face it: if you can&#x27;t repair your own clippers you probably shouldn&#x27;t be cutting your own hair anyway</li>
            <li>I only wish there was a step by step pamphlet that came with this and all the multiple trimmer attachments on how to use it effectively.</li>
            <li>Anyone who has anything negative to say about these clippers has no clue what there complaining about, I read a review that stated that these clippers are too pricey and are not as good as clippers a barber would use.</li>
            <li>It is heavy and nicely built.  </li>
            <li>If I had listened to reviewers who said it was heavy, and this and that, I would have missed out in acquiring a nice clipper for my family&#x27;s use, when we can&#x27;t make it to the barber.</li>
            <li>Does get warm after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for a few years now.  </li>
            <li>It is really good for thick hair.  </li>
            <li>The 76 might hold up better over a long period of time because you can do maintenance on it, but I like the thought of not having to put in new grease -</li>
            <li>The 76 might hold up better over a long period of time because you can do maintenance on it, but I like the thought of not having to put in new grease -</li>
            <li>I find it stays cool and comfortable throughout my cut and that clippings load up less than on the clipper</li>
            <li>My wife used the first one for over 20 years, with no problems, and just wanted a new one.</li>
            <li>Electric cord is about 6 ft long and flexible so it is easy to maneuver with it.</li>
            <li>Well, let me say that after purchasing these clippers it quickly became apparent that these were what I had been searching for after years of frustration.</li>
            <li>3 stars because my plastic screw part on the left side of the clipper look like someone had tampered other than that the clippers are good but just be care when buying from Amazon..</li>
            <li>and I have on mine, even just using it every other week or so on myself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The A6 doesn&#x27;t seem to cut any better or worse than the Classic 76, but the cooler handle and the (to me) more enjoyable noise level give it the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have on mine, even just using it every other week or so on myself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The A6 doesn&#x27;t seem to cut any better or worse than the Classic 76, but the cooler handle and the (to me) more enjoyable noise level give it the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its only been a few weeks since I&#x27;ve owned it, but it runs quiet, cool and has great torque.</li>
            <li>The clipper was smaller than my mental impression from reading others&#x27;reviews; it fit in my hand nicely, and I liked the little extra heft.</li>
            <li>I love this hair clipper compare with other brands and models.  </li>
            <li>We originally bought \\&quot;cheap-o\\&quot; clippers from a local department store and struggled using them twice.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I was pleased.</li>
            <li>The blade it came with cuts extremely well and for that I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>The #1 mostly for summer, and the #3 for all the other seasons.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always get excited when I seem then in a barbershop which I next to never do unless I want a fade or/and change in contrast.</li>
            <li>opinion is that it is not loud, however, it does sound different than the cheap clippers.  </li>
            <li>Costs 4 times more than other clippers, cuts 10 times faster.&lt;br /&gt;Real</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;d done this originally I would&#x27;ve saved myself the cost of countless haircuts plus the $120.00</li>
            <li>Do not pay attention to most of these other reviews, these people have no idea what they are talking about.</li>
            <li>They seem to be completely rebuild-able if they wear out or break down and they have great solid feel to them.</li>
            <li>As a self-buzzer for nearly 20 years, if I live but one more year, this clipper will essentially pay for itself.  </li>
            <li>No more ear plugs required :) It cost about twice what we paid for the Sassoon clipper, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a easy buzz cut on top, fade in back, with a heavy trim on the ears and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>once i know how to take everything apart and clean it and put it back together ,it has been heaven .</li>
            <li>My Andis T Outlinner cuts much closer than the Oster Classic 76.</li>
            <li>As far as some of the negitive reviews, they are not as loud as the cheap $30 ones, yes they have a little more weight to them</li>
            <li>other thing I like is that this product is still made in USA - thanks Oster.&lt;br /&gt;Please create more jobs back in the USA by bringing more of your manufacturing in China back to North America.</li>
            <li>It is superior to the standard buzzers with combs that one buys for less price.</li>
            <li>The metal blade guides are a huge step up from the cheap plastic guides and dull blades and replacement blade sets are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I really like the Classic 76 and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Changing guides on a 000 blade - cheaper but not nearly close or accurate of a cut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They operate smoothly and they have a long cord.</li>
            <li>I had been using cheap clippers in the $50 range for a long time.</li>
            <li>The clipper is professional quality and it is exactly what my barber uses.  </li>
            <li>I have cut my own hair for several years and after using an inexpensive Wahl clipper I decided to spend the extra money on a professional clipper.  </li>
            <li>A true standard prized by barbers and stylists alike.</li>
            <li>imagine the opening Basic Training haircut scene from Full Metal Jacket.....</li>
            <li>If you are putting off the purchase because you are not sure about the quality of the clipper or the ease of use or what you will look like with this kind of \\&quot;haircut,\\</li>
            <li>you haven&#x27;t used professional clippers before (this is my first time), follow these tips:&lt;br /&gt;Do</li>
            <li>Now when I cut my hair, I get that consistent, even professional look that would get from coming out of the barber shop.</li>
            <li>Well first off the oster Is defenitly louder however it&#x27;s not overly loud.</li>
            <li>Use it regularly for full body trimming/grooming.  </li>
            <li>So for about $150 I can cut my hair whenever I want with great equipment that will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li>I thought it worked better than the cheap ones you buy in local stores but a little to high in price.</li>
            <li>It can get warm, again to be expected but nothing that would cause concern or have you stop to wait for cool down.</li>
            <li>The Classic 76 appears to be a real solid clipper and is probably great for many hair cutting tasks.</li>
            <li>I have had other popular brand name clippers that didn&#x27;t last long and became misaligned easily.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a little on the heavy side, but you can tell these clippers are built with incredible quality.</li>
            <li>As this was my first hair clipper I reviewed the many reviews made by purchasers of both other brands and their models as well as Osters models and found the Classic 76 to have the best reviews with the least negative reviews.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got this for my other half on his bday and he loves it, this is a great gift for a man.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast brand new in box</li>
            <li>/&gt;It continues to run like it&#x27;s new to this very day.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>Sure, you can buy four pairs of cheap clippers for the same price, but they won&#x27;t work anything like these or last very long.</li>
            <li>Used it 2 more times, sound got worse.</li>
            <li>Oh wait maybe, hot is relative, i can feel it hot</li>
            <li>The Oster Classic 76 is the \\&quot;Cadillac\\&quot; of clippers.</li>
            <li>Finally, unlike most magnetic clippers, the Oster 76 clipper has parts that wear with regular use and must be replaced:</li>
            <li>I have used many different brands of clippers and have been totally spoiled with these!  </li>
            <li>After some research (looking to see what the barber was using, and reading reviews), I bought a classic 76.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>/&gt;Some things that stood out to me after getting the A6 and comparing it to the Classic 76:&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>We reviewed some consumers appraisal&#x27;s on the Oster Classic 76 and decided to bite the bullet and spend the money for the Oster.  </li>
            <li>The Oster Classic 76&#x27;s cut through hair like butter.</li>
            <li>All in all, this was an expensive initial purchase, but the money and time savings are priceless.</li>
            <li>5 years ago I switched to the Oster Classic 76.</li>
            <li>With Oster Classic, the guards are steel.</li>
            <li>I received the Classic 76 hair clipper.</li>
            <li>Manufactured to feel and work like the classic 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s clippers.</li>
            <li>And now that im older</li>
            <li>Bought an Oster 76 Classic clipper, along with a #1.5 and #2 blade for haircut purposes.  </li>
            <li>only downside to these clippers that I can see is that they are substantially larger and heavier than most hair clippers, so if you work with them for a prolonged period, I can see how these might become fatiguing.</li>
            <li>the package for which blades come with the Classic 76.</li>
            <li>I wanted a clipper to buy to replace my older cheaper ones.  </li>
            <li>The Classic is a must have.</li>
            <li>For the Classic 76</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s extremely expensive hairdresser described these clippers as \\&quot;the best money can buy.\\&quot;  Enough said.</li>
            <li>Well, it applies to the Oster Classic 76 clipper.</li>
            <li>Even worse, in order to get a good clean cut, I had to go over the same spot so many times that it could end up taking a half hour to clip my hair.  </li>
            <li>With proper maintenance &amp; cleaning I can tell they will last many years to come.</li>
            <li>a quick cut, small dog, or not a close cut, these are fine.</li>
            <li>So I decided to try the Oster Classic 76</li>
            <li>This oster classic motor clipper worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li>After so many years with cheap buzzers, I didn&#x27;t even realize how poorly they cut.</li>
            <li>Since I save so much cutting my own hair, I decided to invest in a better clipper.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Oster Classic 76</li>
            <li>I am able to cut my hair with the smaller blade while I cut my son&#x27;s hair with the larger blade.  </li>
            <li>These are Classic Oster 76 Clippers..........</li>
            <li>I guarantee you wont regret buying the oster classic 76</li>
            <li>Gave  his older clippers to our brother in law</li>
            <li>Terrific and does not overheat quickly using the blade cooler lubricant.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a Classic.  </li>
            <li>My barber had been using the Classic 76</li>
            <li>also purchased a Wahl Echo trimmer as a companion to the Classic 76 (facial hair, quick neck trims, etc.)</li>
            <li>Classic 76 was about $100, Wahl Echo was $42 and the 0000 blade was $20.</li>
            <li>I have been cutting my hair since I was in Jr. High School (over 20 years), and the Oster Classic 76 is by far the best set of clippers I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Oster Classic 76.</li>
            <li>(This is good as unfortunately these clippers do got hot to the touch much faster than cheaper models as well.)&lt;br /&gt;Time</li>
            <li>You can tell they are very high quality clippers ... very strong sharp blades that will last forever...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this clipper.</li>

            <li>Highly recommended, though it does take a bit of maintenance to keep it in tip-top shape (</li>

            <li>Highly recommended.</li>

            <li>Highly recommended.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>

            <li>motor is high quality.</li>

            <li>HIGHLY recommend to all.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!d.</li>
            <li>It runs a bit hot and can be loud, and it&#x27;s not a small set of clippers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them for nearly a year now, after using cheap ones previously, and these are worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>They seemed to work fine, but having nothing to compare it to the blades seemed to move at a slower speed than I expected from the appearance of the motor.  </li>
            <li>well done guys easy fast reliable just back when needed again,, hopefully furthest possible</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re all done in little more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I feel that in my situation, going to any of the box-store hair places is of little value for the price that you pay for the service and the tip on top of it.</li>
            <li>It is a little heavier than most because the motor is heavy-duty and won&#x27;t overheat.  </li>
            <li>This thing is a beast, and is probably a little overkill for most people including me.  </li>
            <li>The cutters are sharp and can be easily replaced.</li>
            <li>This clipper goes through my tough beard like a hot knife through warm butter.  </li>
            <li>The Oster76 clipper is easy to operate, the blades are easy to change and it is very efficient and powerful when it comes to cutting hair.</li>
            <li>The unit is very sturdy--a professional unit of high quality, and you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li>The standard #00 and #1 blades that come with the clippers are great, but both are a little too short for my liking.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought this, the interchangeable blades are key for me and the little bit of maintenance I will need to do over the long-term will be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The Oster 76 is very powerful and is very effective at removing lots of hair fast without bogging down and seizing up like some magnetic clipper will when over tasked with thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li>large and a bit heavy; the size doesn&#x27;t bother me, but most female stylists avoid these due to wrist strain.&lt;br /&gt;--color scheme; they are called classic for a reason, but that burgundy is not my favorite  NOTE:</li>
            <li>though no where near as much as it took me to maintain my straightedge).</li>
            <li>My fiancé likes them so much that he tossed his old beard trimmer and just uses this.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve spent on cheap clippers over the years.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money, especially if you cut/</li>
            <li>Its a bit more heavy, than the $29 brand, thats</li>
            <li>Normally it would take me 30 to 40 minutes to cut my hair and beard then shave the remaining stubble</li>
            <li>Normally my wife is the hair cutter.  </li>
            <li>From the moment you plug and click on this product, listsen to it&#x27;s motor, you began to regret all the dollars wasted on cheaper versions, you deserve better, you deserve Rolls Royce.    </li>
            <li>Ive been cutting my own hair for a few years now and owned andis masters which are pretty good also,and</li>
            <li>Would have been better off buying a few cheaper&lt;</li>
            <li>I shave my whole head and like it pretty short</li>
            <li>Rarely have to go over the same spot twice with these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dropped it more than a few times, and it keeps on running.</li>
            <li>The only better one that I&#x27;m aware of is essentially the same machine in a metal case.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m critical and Five Star reviews are rare.  </li>
            <li>Some have said that it is heavy, but I don&#x27;t think it is any heavier than a Mopar gear reduction starter :-) .  </li>
            <li>is this normal?</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t think this is a normal feature...</li>
            <li>Why doesn&#x27;t Oster make the gear out of a more heavy duty plastic or metal?</li>
            <li>The cord is heavy duty and should last long, the retro style is just beautiful.</li>
            <li>Iw on&#x27;t waste my money on cheap clippers again!</li>
            <li>You get better at it once you&#x27;ve done it a few times.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did get too hot to the touch once, so we just put it down, let it cool off for a hour, and resumed the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only use them for myself and they make the job so easy I actually have fun giving myself basic haircuts.</li>
            <li>These clippers show up the other day, heavy, which is good, soundly constructed, will more than likely work till I&#x27;m way past the need for them, and made in the USA.</li>
            <li>They do give you a perfect clip without the dumb little plastic combs.</li>
            <li>I have an Oster classic that&#x27;s over 15 years old!</li>
            <li>There are other models, from Oster and others, in this same price range that might be more appropriate for the average person.</li>
            <li>easy to use, cutting my own hair for the 1st time in my life</li>
            <li>This cut my home haircutting time by more than half compared to my old clippers.</li>
            <li>clip my own hair and the only issue that is a slight hassle is the cord getting in the way.&lt;br /&gt;As for noise.  </li>
            <li>It is seriously solid and will easy last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel the motor was strong enough to the point where I couldn&#x27;t properly maintain my grip.  </li>
            <li>personal/home use its probably a little too much; in retrospect I should have focused on something more portable and easier to manage, as I just use it to shave my own head (and face, when I&#x27;m too lazy to properly shave).&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>So, recently I purchased the #2 blade and it is just about right.    </li>
            <li>I have ended up throwing them away after a short time, they just quit or do not cut my hair right anymore.  </li>
            <li>I can put this right next to my ear</li>
            <li>I bought an extra set of brushes right off the bat for a couple bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: Very solid construction, clean cutting lines and great steel</li>
            <li>The Oster 76 is the only hair clipper I would use, I have tried many others but the Oster provides a better cut with less maintenance than any other clipper</li>
            <li>Fit right in the hand, not that big like other mention.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After finding the manufacturer&#x27;s full retail price online, we then shopped around locally and found the local retail stores including a &#x27;discount hair supply store&#x27; were selling ABOVE the full retail price.</li>
            <li>I used to cut my hair with #2 blades on all sides for the longest time (7+ years), then about 3 months ago, I decided to let my hair grow a bit and get a professionally done haircut(short on sides, a bit long on the top), I had to get that same haircut once a month</li>
            <li>Not a buzzing \\&quot;hum\\&quot; like the other cheap versions, but a machine-like whirl.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other machines and even when they work just as well, they somehow manage to feel cheap.</li>
            <li>I also like looking pretty much the same all the time as far as the length of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I cut my own hair and ask my wife to trim up the back a little afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Clippers are new as stated..  </li>
            <li>and it was brand new.</li>
            <li>The new set cuts like butter</li>
            <li>I live in Calgary, Alberta Canada and they sell this clipper here for $269 so way cheaper to purchase it on line.</li>
            <li>when new.    </li>
            <li>I should probably look into buying a new set, but why would I bother when they are still working?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>you get a new one</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like new until the motor goes on you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product was delivered on time via Canada Post and with no added cost even though I live in Canada</li>
            <li>have it break and then have to spend 145.00 for a new one.</li>
            <li>you, I bought these clippers brand new</li>
            <li>And now I have to buy a new pair.</li>
            <li>The clippers arrived on time and brand new, just as described.  </li>
            <li>If you drop it, don&#x27;t screw around - just buy a new blade.</li>
            <li>I live on 240v so have to run through a converter</li>
            <li>received the new clippers and upon taking them out of the box I knew they were quality.</li>
            <li>But when it started to wear out, I decided to get a new unit instead of just replacing the blades.</li>
            <li>The clippers were new in a sealed box.</li>
            <li>Leave the clipper running to snap the new clipper head into place</li>
            <li>Everyone I work with that use wahls or andis are having to buy new clippers twice as often.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the new 76.</li>
            <li>new-</li>
            <li>came to the reviews section to verify that the retailer was legit and clippers were brand new.</li>
            <li>I have coarse hair and the detachable gaurds are a huge plus for low haircuts.</li>
            <li>With my husband in the military and my son wanting the same haircut as his dad, we&#x27;ve gone through many sets of drug store clippers.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of a time when American products were built to last,  a time before light weight plastic and flimsy imports were the norm.&lt;br</li>
            <li>fast shipping;does a great job on cutting hair.</li>
            <li>It is also more quiet than I expected for a plug-in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found myself having to constantly go over the same spots with the cheap clippers.</li>
            <li>B00070E8LA Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper]]</li>
            <li>I have used the oster classic 76 hair clipper for years , it holds up to every day professional use.  </li>
            <li>Have been using cheap clippers for years of cutting my own hair, should have stepped up to this sooner.</li>
            <li>THAT SAY THIS CLIPPER IS VERY LOUD.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a professional device and is high quality.</li>
            <li>A very professional set of clippers.  </li>
            <li>the very near future.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the blades are easy to change and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I expected more power would mean more noise, but I was happily surprised that these clipppers are actually far quieter than the old ones I had been using.</li>
            <li>I researched for a long time trying to decide on which pair of clippers was worth the investment.  </li>
            <li>Secondly, the machine gets extremely hot, to the point where I&#x27;m scared of holding it.  </li>
            <li>Wow!     </li>
            <li>After getting tired of spending more on my dogs than my whole family for haircuts, I decided to purchase a real clipper and see if I could groom the dogs myself.  </li>
            <li>it simply doesn&#x27;t matter... like a hot knife through butter, but easier than that.  </li>
            <li>I finally decided to try a higher end model to see what the difference would be.</li>
            <li>Glad I took the more expensive plunge finally!</li>
            <li>If you look for a really short hair cut, this machine is pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s hardly a substitute for a skilled barber&#x27;s haircut, but using the Oster Classic 76 is as close to it as you can get.</li>
            <li>After my first cut, I wanted my hair to grow back, just so I could do it again.</li>
            <li>You can tell from the first cut that these are well above the rest in quality and reliability.  </li>
            <li>Over the past 30 years I have used many cheaper sets of hair clippers...</li>
            <li>and it actually cuts better than the other brand did when it worked.</li>
            <li>This is the exact same size as my $20 clipper was.</li>
            <li>Perhaps should have sent it back for an exchange as it gets hot.</li>
            <li>but I saw it running into the same issues as the first set</li>
            <li>Sure it is no where around the $30 price tag like other machines, but it will last you a life time if you take care of it.</li>
            <li>only reason I gave this thing 3 stars is because it gets REALLY hot after 5-10 minutes of use.</li>
            <li>My dad bought a 76 several years ago before they started to put CLASSIC 76 in big bold letters and the thing is indestructible, its been used and dropped and used again and it still works.</li>
            <li>I bought my first pair two years when I began working at the salon, along with the necessary blades.</li>
            <li>I usually shave my head and wear a +/-3 day beard most of the time.</li>
            <li>I would recommend replacing all your blades when you buy a new clipper because in my experience the old blades make the new clipper wear out faster.</li>
            <li>Now, on to the brief review: The Classic 76 in our household has been running for over three years now, without so much as a hiccup.</li>
            <li>I only used the 000 to clean up my neck, back, butt...</li>
            <li>My older former Marine coworker also bought a pair at my recommendation and he absolutely loves them.  </li>
            <li>so those cheap clippers would always bog down but not the Oster.  </li>
            <li>This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve purchased -- and only because the one I originally purchased in 1988 finally gave up the ghost (my own fault -- I twisted &amp; folded the power cord one too many times and it eventually split open).  </li>
            <li>The Oster classic 76 is an amazing pair of clippers like others I&#x27;ve purchased previous clippers from the big retailers for between $30 and $50 only to have to replace after a couple years because they are warn out or just don&#x27;t cut anymore.  </li>
            <li>though I don&#x27;t know how warm relative to other clippers, this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>Over that decade, Wahl&#x27;s manufacturing standards dropped dramatically, and the brand new one wasn&#x27;t even close to the old one.</li>
            <li>Using the blades (instead of combs) yields a very smooth-looking cut that does not pinch the hair as long as one doesn&#x27;t slide the buzzer too fast.</li>
            <li>This clipper should last you a lifetime, a true commercial grade clipper.</li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you are at the point that you would choose to now go and have it all at one size, your hair, then this is breat, just get a detachable blade, a size that you like, try Andis since they also make sizes that apparently are not available by Oster, and just make sure that it fits, and then you can save yourself anywhere between $5-20 per cut, so if you go once a month to a barber</li>
            <li>I was worried about this when I first got the 00000&#x27;s, but the only time I&#x27;ve cut myself is when I ran the clippers directly into my ear.  </li>
            <li>Every year I buy at least two cheap hair clippers that end up burning out - I live in a large household that uses them a lot.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed by how much faster my hair cut went, no more running over the same area over and over to make sure it looks even.  </li>
            <li>I am a hairstylist and this is my 2nd pair in 25 years just love oster clippers they last a long time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this trimmer will last at least 10 years.</li>
            <li>Its a little heavier than the cheap Wahl units but not excessively so</li>
            <li>Average clippers come with a magnetic motor which, when activated, generate the familiar clipper &#x27;hum&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It gets hot after a few minutes of use, but that&#x27;s pretty normal for clippers.</li>
            <li>These are heavy and the switch may be fragile, but the motor is powerful and the blades run cool.  </li>
            <li>I found that it is not very hard to self-administer the cut.</li>
            <li>The ONLY challenge is to slightly taper the 1/2 inch sides with the 3/4 inch top</li>
            <li>I attribute this less to my skills and more to the fact that the Oster 76 and the blades work terrific.  </li>
            <li>note is that this clipper would be very hard to use if I was trying to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>Very easy to change cutting blade and clean after using.</li>
            <li>They slice through our hair with ease and only require minimal oiling maintenance to keep them going strong thus far.  </li>
            <li>Certainly a tier above the cheapo $20 hair clipper sets you see.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although they certainly aren&#x27;t the quality they used to be the Oster 76&#x27;s are still the standard in the barber business.</li>
            <li>My next purchase in this category will certainly be a battery-option.</li>
            <li>The cheap ones always seemed to break after little use.  </li>
            <li>I think the key to keeping this thing going for a long time is to clean it often and add in plenty of lubricant to protect it from rust and wear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Blades are super sharp and the hair falls away with no resistance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not talking like your arm will be tired, more a little more cumbersome.  </li>
            <li>but they are professional, and finally the do get a little warm, but not enough to bother or concern me.  </li>
            <li>Works great for cutting hair.</li>
            <li>These clippers are smooth running, quiet, and super clean cutting.  </li>
            <li>After 10 minutes it will become warm but not so much that will feel uncomfortable on your skin.</li>
            <li>The cord or plug is clearly defective.  </li>
            <li>Flip the heavy-duty ON switch and the difference is clear.</li>
            <li>They are clearly quality through and through.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s being used in professional barber shops.</li>
            <li>This is by far a must for all barbers.</li>
            <li>The attachment system, for attaching different size clipper blades works very well, just pull up in the clipper blade(s) and then remove.</li>
            <li>This is obviously professional grade.  </li>
            <li>Loud?</li>
            <li>Another disadvantage the Oster 76 is that the blade attachments cut at a fixed length and are not adjustable like the Andis Master ML or the Wahl Senior.</li>
            <li>The only downside is they don&#x27;t really work as a beard trimmer</li>
            <li>I have gone thru dozens of $30 to $40 clippers over the years and finally invested in the real deal.</li>
            <li>From the time I&#x27;ve owned this clipper, I would have replaced 2 or 3 cheaper ones, which would bring me to nearly the price of one of these.</li>
            <li>It was loud and pulled hair from the get go.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quieter than my old ConAir clipper.  </li>
            <li>That box will be well out of the way if you use this professionally, though&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a blade swing out accidentally on my 76, but I can imagine a clipper getting bumped during professional use, so</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a blade swing out accidentally on my 76, but I can imagine a clipper getting bumped during professional use, so</li>
            <li>These are professional hair clippers and quality made.</li>
            <li>You have to make sure you maintain it properly with oil and brushing and such, but it&#x27;s not much.</li>
            <li>We had also purchased a set of the plastic guide combs at the same time, which work very well.</li>
            <li>Undoubtedly a King of all clippers and professional barbers recommended.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money in cheap plastic clippers.</li>
            <li>If you want a professional hair cut you have to use a professional&#x27;s tools.</li>
            <li>Oster is fundamental to producing professional hair cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plastic</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste money on cheap models that will wear out too soon.    </li>
            <li>Professional grade and</li>
            <li>Effortless, I cut my hair in a fraction of the time it took me with my old clippers.</li>
            <li>Also, since these are professional clippers, you must maintain them and keep the blades lubed at all times.</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give the 5 stars is styling (it must really have been designed in 1976) and weight.</li>
            <li>I had a pair identical to these in the early sixties .</li>
            <li>is like having a professional at home.</li>
            <li>Finally bought this clipper about 4 mos ago after going through a couple of cheap Wahl clippers ($30 clippers) over the last several yrs.</li>
            <li>I thought they could be fixed with clipper grease.</li>
            <li>24 months is just the amount of time of the old phone plans, so thats it</li>
            <li>I think it was designed using the old Harley Davidson theory of engineering.</li>
            <li>The old one I had tended to jerk out a whisker every now and then causing me to yelp like a puppy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They can get hot to hold when on for long periods of time.  </li>
            <li>and it is not overly loud like others i have used that scare the hell out of my son.</li>
            <li>My old Oster electrical cord quit working</li>
            <li>And I really expect these to last longer than I do.  </li>
            <li>Those didn&#x27;t cut nearly as well as these, and didn&#x27;t have replaceable blades, so they didn&#x27;t cut as close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The buzzer is fairly loud with the fan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;1)The \\&quot;76\\&quot; is far quieter and smoother than any of the others</li>
            <li>The blade I use for shaving: Oster Professional 76918-006 Replacement Clipper Blade, Size 00000</li>
            <li>This clipper is a professional tool.  </li>
            <li>No doubt professional quality.</li>
            <li>It works seamless.</li>
            <li>but its mostly the center where above the handle and below the actual razor heads</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the clipper of choice.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time on those cheap buzzers .In</li>
            <li>They seem about the same as my last pair of cheap clippers, actually.  </li>
            <li>So far, these clippers are everything that they claim to be.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>and I want the closest cut I can get from a trimmer as my skalp is too sensitive for a blade or an electric face shaver.</li>
            <li>the years I&#x27;ve invested in Oster stainless steel blades (9 different blades).&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>No hair-salons, no wasted time, no fuss.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to go over thek same areas as much to get</li>
            <li>professional quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i would recommend it to anyone for home or professional use.</li>
            <li>This is a professional piece of gear - and it shows.</li>
            <li>Maybe it would be in continuous, professional use.  </li>
            <li>but if I were a professional I&#x27;d be buying these.</li>
            <li>and it is a truly a professional hair clipper.</li>
            <li>you know that they are professional grade.</li>
            <li>I returned to oster under warranty and they fixed it.</li>
            <li>If you are looking a clipper for home or professional use</li>
            <li>It may be loud for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Get one professional grade clipper</li>
            <li>Pull the trigger on the Professional comb set while you&#x27;re at it.</li>
            <li>One thing with professional clippers like these is that the blades are wider than what I was used to with cheaper clippers/trimmers, so they don&#x27;t seem to &#x27;hug&#x27; your head as well while clipping, but you can get used to it.</li>
            <li>Wow, compared to the Store brand models this thing can cut.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Those reviews however are completely mistaken.</li>
            <li>When I go into the barbers my hair will jam up their clippers.. which always causes them to go \\&quot;wow</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a professional stylist</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been clipping my hair pretty short for the past 8 years or so, always using a set of cheap Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li>But the first look in the mirror revealed the quality I&#x27;ve been wanting for so long.</li>
            <li>This is a professional quality clipper.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I decided to stop spending money to have my dogs hair cut by a professional and do it myself.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny,my hair cant grow fast enuff, want to use them everyday.</li>
            <li>it was well worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li>I know they are a bit more expensive than others, but trust me, they are well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money spent.  </li>
            <li>My husband cuts his own hair once a week and his facial hair at least twice a week.  </li>
            <li>, they are on the more expensive side, but the quality is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>They are big and noisy, but that is because they need to be powerful, They last for years and years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They mostly just pulled my thick hair.  </li>
            <li>def worth every penny and saved me money over the long run from having to constantly buy cheap broke down clippers..</li>
            <li>They cut through my hair so smoothly and quickly that at first I didn&#x27;t think they were cutting at all.</li>
            <li>They are large though, so if you&#x27;re using them on your own, be prepared for some awkward angles/configurations because they&#x27;re pretty big to control with one hand while looking in a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a lot of Wahls over the years, but decided to take a new approach after the last one broke with less than a year of light use.</li>
            <li>I expect it to last forever but even if it doesnt the extra cost is worth it if for no other reason than saving the aggrivation of using the cheap retail models which get stuck and jammed and are hard to clean.</li>
            <li>I normally never write reviews about a product, but have to say that I had this clipper since I was 22 years (1992) old for my first dog and wanted to save money on grooming.  </li>
            <li>My 7-year-old son was unhappy to get his buzz cut from a standard buzzer with combs, but he&#x27;s happy to get his hair cut now with the Oster Classic 76.</li>
            <li>After a few years of use, the cable broke internally because you had to kink it at one particular spot every time you wanted to fit it in the provided case.</li>
            <li>The previous Oster cool vibes just didn&#x27;t perform.</li>
            <li>They are very heavy and bulky, and get very HOT when used for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I decided to ante up for the Osters after going through at least one set of cheap clippers a year with pretty low usage.</li>
            <li>They get hot a little to fast though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey when compared to other clippers but its worth the investment.</li>
            <li>exhaust fan, powerful, and extremely user-friendly.  </li>
            <li>I have lots of thick hair and the cheap clippers just bind up, get hot, make a ton of noise, and constantly miss hair.  </li>
            <li>On first use, no more than 15 minutes in, the motor started sounding funny.</li>
            <li>After 40 years of trimming hair and beard wth the 20.00 cheapies Finally bought a Pro trimmer Oster Classic 76.  </li>
            <li>Buy the Oster Classic 76 and have a lasting product.</li>
            <li>After years of paying a barber to cut his hair, my husband gave in to the chidings of his brother and a friend to buy the same clipper used by barbers, the Oster Classic 76, to begin using it to cut his hair at home.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re newer to cutting hair and it takes you a while to get the job done, be warned that these clippers do get pretty warm.  </li>
            <li>My Classic 76 has already paid for itself in the short time I have had it.  </li>
            <li>After Years of riding the fence, I finally made the plunge and bought the Classic 76 series.</li>
            <li>I researched high and low and finally bought the Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 clippers about 2 years ago</li>
            <li>Not long ago, I got a new clipper for my dog</li>
            <li>My previous several years experience with cheap $30-$40 clippers was that they were always the exact opposite of the Oster&#x27;s current performance.</li>
            <li>Cut clean and without having to do another pass over that I would have to do because my other clippers would have left some stays standing.  </li>
            <li>Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It made such a high pitched whine</li>
            <li>I bought these clippers because they had such high ratings.  </li>
            <li>This is the same clipper my barber used when I was in high school and college</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these clippers for home and of course commercial use.</li>
            <li>In comparison to other clipper sets I have owned, the Oster Classic has an easy &#x27;flip open&#x27; blade holder that facilitates simple cleaning without having to unscrew a back plate.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d have plunked down the $100-ish dollars the first time!  </li>
            <li>Although it is more expensive than some other hair clippers, we both appreciate the quality of the product, the fact that it&#x27;s US made and how easy it is to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me, the lower pitch noise, cooler running handle, added button for blade release, and no need to grease it put the A6 a bit ahead of the Classic 76 to me - but not so far that I&#x27;d highly recommend one model over the other.  </li>
            <li>To me, the lower pitch noise, cooler running handle, added button for blade release, and no need to grease it put the A6 a bit ahead of the Classic 76 to me - but not so far that I&#x27;d highly recommend one model over the other.  </li>
            <li>It was barely hanging on and fell completely off when I tried to turn he unit off.</li>
            <li>Also do not plan on traveling with these, they weight a ton and are way to big for normal use.</li>
            <li>This was a pretty big initial money layout, but has saved me several hundred dollars thus far on haircuts for my three young boys.  </li>
            <li>Like many people here I have been cutting my own hair for a few years and using clippers from Walmart with the plastic</li>
            <li>On the first pass I didnt even realize I had cut anything as there was absolutely no resistance.</li>
            <li>Because of the long hours, a new baby, and little free time we bought these so my wife could do my weekly haircuts</li>
            <li>had 2 little wires holding the blade on and they snapped quickly.</li>
            <li>I like my hair as short as possible without shaving and this certainly does the trick.  </li>
            <li>I finally spent a little more money for the Oster 76.  </li>
            <li>It is a little heavier than the cheap clippers and it does have a larger circumference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Classic 76 flat out gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>Also, all my inexpensive clippers worked via a vibrating magnet drive, which would hold a good setting for a little while, but then drift off and either stop cutting or get super loud.    </li>
            <li>After using the cheap clippers from the local drug store, not to mention having to buy new ones every year, I finally broke down and spent the money on some real clippers.</li>
            <li>I recently acquired a new puppy (Yorkie) and I am planning to groom her myself again.  </li>
            <li>However I live out of the country and don&#x27;t want to take it back and forth with me when I return to the States, so I decided to buy another pair to keep there.</li>
            <li>Second pair , this new one is the Strongest clipper ive ever had&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It is obviously very durable and the blade lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through several sets of cheap $30 to $40 clippers, but all of them died after a few years.  </li>
            <li>the only part that worries me a little is that the clippers get really hot really fast.</li>
            <li>Only downside is that they do get pretty warm after continuous cutting 30 plus minutes.</li>
            <li>And, as in the tradition of the Tool Man, I promptly unplugged it and took it all apart to get a glimpse of the source of its apparent power and precision buzz!</li>
            <li>The major difference between these is the motor type.</li>
            <li>This is not a small clipper but you will appreciate its power and simple design.</li>
            <li>the less I would still rate it as 5 stars experience because so far the product is exactly as claimed.</li>
            <li>The motor is plenty strong; it does not slow down even a little when in use on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It will pay for itself in a few haircuts and you will be happy that you spent the extra few dollars.</li>
            <li>The housing is plastic, but does feel beefy, and hope to get many years out of it.&lt;br /&gt;However, there were three things that prevented me from giving a 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;First, the instruction manual that comes with clipper is very poor.</li>
            <li>Thus, if you purchase this clipper, you should keep in mind that there will only be rare instances where the Oster 76 outshines all other clippers.</li>
            <li>That thing is heavy, it is ok if you cut other peoples hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at several other brands, including Andis, Wahl and Panasonic and several other models in this brand and went with this because it seemed to be a middle-of-the-road standard kind of unit that I could probably sell if I didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as everyone describes - far and away a &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; above Wahl and other lower-class clippers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Heavier and a little thicker than the cheaper models I&#x27;m used to but definitely worth their weight.</li>
            <li>I have bought other clippers in the past but none have had the same kind of power this one does.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been clipper cutting my own hair for over 15 years now, and I used these Oster Classic 76 for over two years.</li>
            <li>As I said earlier, the Oster Classic 76 clipper is very solid</li>
            <li>One that cuts smooth doesn&#x27;t pull hair and one that can be sharpened or parts replaced if they become dull.  </li>
            <li>The A6 is quieter on low and medium speeds, but it&#x27;s about the same as the 76 on high speed.</li>
            <li>Feels a little heavy after a while, but is nicely balanced and does heat up quite a bit after continuous use (15-20 minutes); but again, not that big a deal.  </li>
            <li>it is a little big, but aren&#x27;t they all - at least the good ones</li>
            <li>Other limited edition shades are available (for a different price)&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cut is very tight and quick to finish.</li>
            <li>Will never consider those Dollar General clippers ever again.</li>
            <li>family has complained about the sound.  </li>
            <li>I took off a huge thick beard the either day</li>
            <li>We finally got around to using the clippers (unfortunately past the return date) and found that the #000 blade that came with it doesn&#x27;t fit this product.</li>
            <li>They are  very sturdy and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>With these clippers, I think I can get there over the next couple of years - with the old clippers, the kids we rebelling.</li>
            <li>Expect it to last nearly forever.</li>
            <li>the strength of the motor frequently changes as it was running and at one point, the blade actually stopped moving.</li>
            <li>Also when using the #00000 blade, it will cut the hell out of you if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews here, I expected as much.</li>
            <li>So far I used the clipper only once</li>
            <li>A professional grade clipper to last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old clipper finally gave up to justify the purchase.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it is a solid piece of  professional equipment.</li>
            <li>I also ordered the &amp;#34;Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb</li>
            <li>For years I have shaved my head, and for years I have used low quality clippers because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money of the professional stuff.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that loud, myself, but beware of the potential noise.  </li>
            <li>When I read reviews saying this was loud and big</li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially, I found the same clippers at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, but they were ridiculously marked up.  </li>
            <li>I have only used the clippers once so far</li>
            <li>I also bought Oster&#x27;s Professional 10 Universal Comb set to go with this unit.  </li>
            <li>Do not buy them for personal use if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing, again this is a professional clipper made specifically for professionals.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t think that you&#x27;d go wrong with either model.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t think that you&#x27;d go wrong with either model.</li>
            <li>but if you cut your own hair it is silly not to invest in something like this.</li>
            <li>For my small poodle, who gets a full body cut, it&#x27;s a two session job.</li>
            <li>The blade wash Oster sells is kind of expensive.</li>
            <li>a bit heavy but powerful and durable...</li>
            <li>This clipper classic 76 is not new to me, I&#x27;v used them before and have confidence in clippers and Oster company.</li>
            <li>And broke down and paid the higher price</li>
            <li>I had my last one for 4 years and the only reason I got a new one is because the on/off switch got faulty.  </li>
            <li>Not only that: I just recently had to purchase a new blade.</li>
            <li>All you do is turn the clippers off, push the current blade back, pop it up, put on a new one, push it in.    </li>
            <li>you can really feel that these will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>The power cord was similar to that of heavy duty workshop tools and the bold metal name plate/gear cover</li>
            <li>I previously owned a pair of clippers exactly like these, those lasted me five years.</li>
            <li>and it took about half the time to shave his head as it did the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve only owned TWO clippers from two different brands prior to getting the Oster Classic 76.  </li>
            <li>The Classic 76 does require some minor maintenance, like oiling the blades, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.  </li>
            <li>This is a fairly large clipper, more suited to cutting someone else&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>We use the Oster Classic 76 for the main cutting and clean up the sideburns, back, and back of the neck with the Oster T-Finisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the Oster Classic 76 is sold in a combination pack with the Oster T-Finisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read</li>
            <li>The 76er is the real deal i dont think any other clipper can match it&#x27;s power and durability.</li>
            <li>These are so much nicer than any other clippers.  </li>
            <li>This will last you a long time, don&#x27;t waste your time buying a cheap one.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it works really well.</li>
            <li>Love it, but a little heavy...</li>
            <li>My hair is thick, and the cheap $30 clippers would always bog down if I tried to take too much in one cut.  </li>
            <li>Not a single problem.</li>
            <li>So when you have to take old shaggy down to \\&quot;High &amp; Tight\\&quot; this is your clipper.</li>
            <li>Great when they work, but when the worm gear goes bad, and you are in the middle of shaving your head...</li>
            <li>If you need to change them just pull the old ones away from Trimmer until the spring snaps open, then it&#x27;s simple no tools needed.</li>
            <li>These are solid and much quieter than I expected.</li>
            <li>I have thick straight hair and this machine cuts without any pulling no matter how fast I go.</li>
            <li>The Oster Classic 76 are high quality clippers, expensive, but will pay for themselves quickly, and should last forever with home use.  </li>
            <li>It runs a little hot</li>
            <li>I am a bit concerned that they run a little hot.</li>
            <li>Gets a little hot</li>
            <li>I thought the 45 watt Oster classic 76 should have no trouble at all, NOT TRUE.  </li>
            <li>You will literally have to rest your arms after cutting for a while.&lt;br /&gt;2-They get too hot very quickly (after 15 minutes).  </li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve have bought them first and saved myself the price of a half dozen lesser quality clippers.</li>
            <li>B001T0HHB0 Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb Set Specially Designed to Fit Oster Clippers]] which is way less expensive than buying all the different cutters.</li>
            <li>I went from using a cheap clipper to this one, why did I ever waste time and energy with any other clippers?</li>
            <li>It does tend to get a bit hot after heavy use (10+ minutes), but nothing that will hinder its performance or your comfort.</li>
            <li>First, a disclaimer: We did not purchase this through Amazon, as they were not available at the time.</li>
            <li>However, it does make a lot of noise, is heavy, gets hot, and doesn&#x27;t have an ergonomic design.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty heavy, but that just means it&#x27;s well built.</li>
            <li>They are heavy and run hot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a few tries to get used to holding the clipper correctly to take care of the whole head, especially while doing the back of the head, but it is not difficult.  </li>
            <li>cuts my thick hair better then any other clippers i tried with ease does not pull at all</li>
            <li>When a barber is telling you that you have thick hair you know it must be true.</li>
            <li>These clippers take down hair like butter and fast.</li>
            <li>in it can quickly damage or dull clippers.                      </li>
            <li>Also the blades change quick so even if one did rust or dull, for $20</li>
            <li>My husband likes to wear his hair in a \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; cut, just like those given to new military recruits.</li>
            <li>I got this clipper after previously owning the Oster fast feed clipper for years.</li>
            <li>Very precise,a little heavy, gets a bit hot towards the end of cut</li>
            <li>They always cut hair good the first few times, then eventually would pull my hair painfully or vibrate louder than a lightsaber on steroids.    </li>
            <li>Not any of those cheap $20-40 ones that ultimately break down and become crappy a few months to a year in.  </li>
            <li>If you compare the number 3,2, and 1 guards between the two clippers you will notice that the oster numbers are actually a little bit longer than the plastic guards, however because they cut so smoothly the hair actually looks a little shorter.</li>
            <li>The blades stay sharp and continue to cut as if they were new.</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I&#x27;m the type of person that would buy a new pair of clippers every once</li>
            <li>The 76 Classic became a Classic Failure.  </li>
            <li>but I would certainly like to get a few years out of them before it becomes necessary.</li>
            <li>Cutting your hair with a Oster Classic 76 metal blades is really like a hot knife in butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Used this product for a while now and very much would recommend this to anyone who is interested in skipping the expensive barber</li>
            <li>I am well into my 2nd year with the new one and would never go back to some of the cheaper versions or other products I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>It will cut any kind of hair be it thick, tangled or wet without bogging down or stopping (ouch!).</li>
            <li>Where other clippers would simply bog down and stop cutting, these things effortlessly mow right through, like a knife through warm butter.</li>
            <li>These are amazing I bought them for my boyfriend because he enjoys cutting hair</li>
            <li>Changing blades was another task I expected to be more difficult, but unlike the old clippers I didn&#x27;t even need any tools to remove/replace the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> You&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s the sacrifice you make for a great quality cut.</li>

            <li> It is of great quality though.</li>

            <li> Everybody says these clippers are great, but you still have to keep going over and over your hair.</li>
            <li> Not as great as they are cracked up to be.</li>
            <li> My son gets his cut and is happy.</li>

            <li> and I like the blade system they use, and the fact that it is serviceable is great.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why my wife is happy with this.</li>
            <li> I have already used it up to 5 times and it works great.</li>

            <li> This is a very nice tool for the toolbox and a lifetime purchase.</li>
            <li> I gave myself a very nice cut.  </li>
            <li> Very nice product.</li>
            <li> Very nice clippers...</li>
            <li> Does a very nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use so many types hair clippers,but this one Best I ever used.</li>
            <li> To each his own!</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with how well it is designed and can understand why it is a favorite of barbers.</li>
            <li> The best. :)</li>
            <li> What good is a set of clippers with a great motor but no replacement blades.</li>
            <li> I also got the plastic adapter which work great and also feel like good quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After looking for \\&quot;best clippers\\&quot;, I found the Oster Classic 76 and considering the great reviews this product has received, I decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man!  </li>
            <li> They are easy to use and provide excellent results for my dogs.</li>
            <li> It cuts easily for a perfect cut.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my husband&#x27;s hair for over thirty years and this is without a doubt the best, easy to use clipper ever.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m 55, should have started this way sooner, looks  and feels as good as the $30 cut</li>
            <li> The available blade assortment is superb</li>
            <li> it is good, I thought that my hair was going to almost or close to bald</li>
            <li> would have loved to use the #2 blades with it, but it never arrived with my order (another story for another day).  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had these for over a year now, and they are as good as the day we got them.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Good idea to buy this instead of buying others for around $50 every year or two.</li>
            <li> I have owned Oster products before and thought this would be a good buy.  </li>
            <li> All around good clipper</li>
            <li> My fades were never as good as the barber&#x27;s fades.</li>
            <li> , I know a good pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> , I got quite good at the fade and can now give barber shop quality haircuts to my three boys.  </li>
            <li> it is not even a fair comparison.</li>
            <li> I have been out of Barber School for a year, I was told about the clippers and thought their was no way the clippers could be that good..</li>
            <li> a classic,always good.</li>
            <li> Good price and good quality</li>
            <li> Good for prefect cuts</li>
            <li> Cord length is good.  </li>
            <li> Looking like a sound purchase at a great price!</li>
            <li> and I loved it</li>
            <li> The combs are good too.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d recommend the quadruple and quintuple 0&#x27;s, perhaps even the #0A as well, for good measure).</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and this works great.  </li>
            <li> As good as advertised.</li>
            <li> Recommend these to all wanting to cut hair and get a precise and flawless cut.</li>
            <li> As a barber, I have used the Oster Model 76 clippers for years and they give you good service.</li>
            <li> The price was a good deal.</li>
            <li> excellent not one of the cheap vibrator models</li>
            <li> However, they are good clippers and I am not dissatisfied.  </li>
            <li> good news:&lt;br</li>
            <li> good purchase.  </li>
            <li> Cant do a good haircut without good equipment there</li>
            <li> Professionals would be pleased with this clipper and for this self-cutter, it is ideal.  </li>
            <li> so at the price I thought they were good quality.</li>
            <li> but they work as good as gold.</li>
            <li> Good Buy.</li>
            <li> thank you very much it is good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably good to shave the head.</li>
            <li> Was a good deal</li>
            <li> Good investment; get the 00000 attachment</li>
            <li> Good product for grooming.</li>
            <li> Good unit 08-02-2017 UPDATE.</li>
            <li> and I needed to upgrade to good clippers.</li>
            <li> Often, as you may know, you do not know how good something is until you have something to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> It still works as good as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> I tried the Whal brand, they never worked good for me.  </li>
            <li> I am stationed overseas and needed something really good to keep my hair trimmed.  </li>
            <li> These clippers are as good as I remember them to be.</li>
            <li> I bought these two years ago and wish I had invested in a good pair 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> VERRY VERRY GOOD &amp;</li>
            <li> The adjustable clipper is still good for around the ears tapering.</li>
            <li> If you ever need replacement parts, good luck.  </li>
            <li> I hope you have as good an experience as I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Keep lubed and clean and they will work awesome</li>
            <li> Good product very pleased.</li>
            <li> The quick disconnect blade is so perfect for cleaning and switch lengths in a flash.  </li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve know an exceptional barber who uses the Oster 76 clipper exclusively; I seldom use mine.</li>
            <li> They cut exceptionally.  </li>
            <li> Excellent quality that is sure to provide many years of trouble-free service.  </li>
            <li> Very good performance on fine hair.  </li>
            <li> Cut great and are very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Excellent great classic clipper</li>
            <li> This has been great, no issues and it has been more than a year.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> this company and amazon did a great job keeping me satisfied.</li>
            <li> a great set of clippers- don&#x27;t have to run over the target area more than once.</li>
            <li> It is very challenging to find a product that feels durable and performs well.  </li>
            <li> If you are debating upgrading to this motor from cheaper clippers you will be more than happy</li>
            <li> very safe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve very satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> it is a great product and I can see why many people give this thing 4/5 stars.</li>
            <li> but I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> After using it for a good 20 minutes, the handle wasn&#x27;t even warm.</li>
            <li> They sold the Oster for much more money, so this is a great site for a better deal!</li>
            <li> Great product, Oster Clasic 76 is the best hair clipper ever for home and professional hair cut.</li>
            <li> These clippers worked great right out of the box and after 5 months of 10+ haircuts a week they are still working great.</li>
            <li> They do not come with attachments, so be sure to buy you some!  </li>
            <li> It took all of my will to not shave off the top of my head!</li>
            <li> (*) The A6 does not vent air out the sides - which is excellent!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and at a great price after doing some research!</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> Love It!.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, i&#x27;ve cut my own hair since 10 years now and I must that this is the best one I used so far.</li>
            <li> This hair trimer is outstanding!  </li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After replacing the switch, I love it!  </li>
            <li> Hope it holds up for many years!</li>
            <li> I love it and it is still in use!  </li>
            <li> and I love them a lot!</li>
            <li> Great Oster quality and the blades are easy to buy and swap out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more then proud to be a classic 76 &#x27;er best tool I&#x27;ve held ever</li>
            <li> Great product and I chose the free delivery which eludes you to believe the product will take forever to arrive...</li>
            <li> The quality is amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have to say that this thing is amazing.</li>
            <li> These things are amazing and feel like the could scalp you if you slip.  </li>
            <li> amazing price.  </li>
            <li> Performance is great unlike those cheap clippers you buy at Target with plastic attachments.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product</li>
            <li> Blades are great and fit the way they are supposed too.  </li>
            <li> My dad use to own one of this model and it has the metal switch.</li>
            <li> is a nice machine</li>
            <li> your own oster can put it to the test if you don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> but after using them I would have paid even more there just that good.</li>
            <li> the added locking mechanism is a nice addition</li>
            <li> the added locking mechanism is a nice addition</li>
            <li> I decided to save some money and do my own hair.</li>
            <li> I am not a barber, but I bought it to cut my own hair and my two sons.</li>
            <li> It cuts nicely.  </li>
            <li> but this is the most powerful and perfect clipper I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I have attempted to cut my own hair and almost always needed my wife&#x27;s help.</li>
            <li> No binding or catching hair.  </li>
            <li> If you cut your own hair don&#x27;t hesitate.  </li>
            <li> I shave my own head about every 2 weeks, and I have been doing so for almost 10 years now.</li>
            <li> The instructions aren&#x27;t as helpful as I would of liked.</li>
            <li> but motor does get warm after 5min use.</li>
            <li> The others have both trained themselves to cut their own hair.</li>
            <li> I cleaned it out and applied my own.</li>
            <li> I did watch the maintenance video from Oster about this clipper and they state that if the handle gets warm it needs oil.</li>
            <li> and I feel like I can give an honest review.</li>
            <li> I prefer the spray oil/cleaner over the kind that comes out in drops.</li>
            <li> I am not one of those that can do my own fade; when I do my home cuts it&#x27;s one level all around.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair twice a week</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good quality clipper to be able to give myself my own haircuts.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair - always trimming it and</li>
            <li> The Product trims nicely when using an attached blade.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time for my own hair.</li>
            <li> Nice clippers that can cut any thickness of hair.  </li>
            <li> the it gets too warm.  </li>
            <li> and I cut my own hair</li>
            <li> thing I also really liked is the ease of changing blades.</li>
            <li> I had never held one of these or had this kind of all-clipper haircut before I bought this one</li>
            <li> exercise and perspire and this kind of haircut is the easiest and quickest for cleaning up and taking care of after exercise.  </li>
            <li> My husband cuts his own hair and cannot hold the plug in this jury-rigged position to operate clippers.  </li>
            <li> I wish they would have come with their own guards and not just the 000 and 1 guard.</li>
            <li> Runs warm.</li>
            <li> However, for the price it would be nice to get a storage case and blade holder with it.  </li>
            <li> Now that I own one I will advise friends and family members.</li>
            <li> - I cut my own</li>
            <li> He has cut hair for years and enjoys great clippers to upkeep his own hair and these fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I took off a star because the head does get warm after about 5 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> I still liked them,</li>
            <li> It seems this is popular with hair stylists because of it&#x27;s durability, quality and power.</li>
            <li> and I own my own barbershop.</li>
            <li> It is nice that that blades pop off with no tools for cleaning and lubrication.  </li>
            <li> I am a balding guy who cuts his own hair once per week.  </li>
            <li> if you cut your own hair.</li>
            <li> so we&#x27;re saving a nice amount of money every month.</li>
            <li> The Oster Classic 76 is the best built clippers I have seen.  </li>
            <li> Works great, clean cut.</li>
            <li> This Classic 76 is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> One day, for some reason, I decided to research hair clippers and soon learned that the Classic 76 was considered one of the best.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to watch the YouTube video by oster on this product by the guy with the werewolf looking sideburns for an awesome tutorial on the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t comment on my purchases but I was so impressed by these clippers I&#x27;m making an exception.</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean and change, and they don&#x27;t fall off!!!</li>
            <li> Product was in brand new condition and works great!  </li>
            <li> Very happy witj my clippers and new blades</li>
            <li> It live up to my expectation i love it keep up the good word wonderful love</li>
            <li> Most importantly, these clippers do a great job and cut through your hair like butter.  </li>
            <li> Of course Amazon customer service is great and the replacement was quick and easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super happy with these.</li>
            <li> excellent, machine, smooth running and powerful.</li>
            <li> Very easy to switch the blades</li>
            <li> so that is very easy to cut, but I like reliable tools.</li>
            <li> The blade is very easy to exchange.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use</li>
            <li> Right out of the box, these worked great, giving the dogs a nice even cut.  </li>
            <li> These clippers, while a bit large and unwieldy, are an incredible pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li> This product works great and worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best hair clipper that I have owned.  </li>
            <li> im here to say that these by far are the best clippers ive ever cut hair with.</li>
            <li> This hair clipper is by far the best set I have owned.</li>
            <li> I use the clippers every week to trim my own hair and I&#x27;m quite satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Also, I would have liked to see a better cleaning brush or brush set included.</li>
            <li> I am so glad i upgraded from the ones I used in beauty school because quite honestly you cant even compare the two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know of people that say they do their own fades, and I say more power to them.</li>
            <li> It works at its best , I use it professionally</li>
            <li> in America and smacks of old fashioned quality!&lt;br /&gt;Americans build the best products-hopefully this clipper stays American-made.</li>
            <li> but this one sure is nice.  </li>
            <li> These are by far the best clippers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I have to say these are by far the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> These are the best I have used, including professional clippers from wahl and andis.  </li>
            <li> Just a smooth perfect cut the first try.</li>
            <li> The first set was fairly well made and lasted a good 10 years.</li>
            <li> I have used many $30-$100 clippers and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have cut my own hair at home with many brands of home hair clippers, mostly from the Wahl brand.  </li>
            <li> Works great, very powerful and smooth.</li>
            <li> Now it runs, gives great results and is a joy to use, though it does take a little practice to get good with it.</li>
            <li> came exactly as ordered and works great</li>
            <li> This was the first issue I had with an Amazon product and it is great they went out of their way without me having to call around.</li>
            <li> Very good, its brand new n cuts like it says , its my favourite item .</li>
            <li> Easy to handle chasis, easy to grip, good length extention cord.</li>
            <li> Very happy with Classic 76, precise cut.</li>
            <li> The #1 blades worked just fine!</li>
            <li> The spring-action attachment is very secure and dead-easy</li>
            <li> the best thing no loud buzzing motor just a nice gental hum.</li>
            <li> Blades are easily exchangeable but do get warm with use.</li>
            <li> Since I got this just to easily cut my own hair</li>
            <li> My BF loved it very very much!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Blades use and changing on these are quite easy, but make sure you keep oil handy.</li>
            <li> This unit is excellent with true professional qualities inlcuding an excellent motor and clippers that are professional grade.  </li>
            <li> nice clean cut very strong clippers</li>
            <li> Once one obtains the correct blade head, 0000 for me, sadly not included in the original kit, it as close to ideal as once can get.</li>
            <li> Very good professional clipper for the price.  </li>
            <li> So far, very, very good.  </li>
            <li> Used Oster products for many years.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on the fence, my recommendation is to step up and get these - you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> Best ever Clipper I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve been using clippers (this is my third) for over 8 years.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product and would recommend it to others.  </li>
            <li> I do many clipper cuts in a week</li>
            <li> works better than anything you can get at wally world.</li>
            <li> From the moment you turn them on, you can tell by the smoothness and power of the motor that you have stepped up to top quality clippers.</li>
            <li> I purchased a [0000] which is great for real close shaves or fades.</li>
            <li> and I can give my son a great &#x27;High Regulation&#x27; haircut with ease!</li>
            <li> and i only purchase the best quality to get the biggest bang out of my buck.</li>
            <li> I simply love it.  </li>
            <li> I just love these clippers.</li>
            <li> I wish more companies were like this.</li>
            <li> The Next day delivery was perfect since I needed these for a client.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the power is overkill for most haircutting applications.</li>
            <li> After 20 years using lower grade clippers (and being relatively satisfied) I purchased these hoping for an improvement.  </li>
            <li> As you may already have read, many folks commented on the size and weight of the clippers, the noise and heat it produced, and the seemingly retro styling of the unit.</li>
            <li> Did I say it was heavenly already?... :)</li>
            <li> It has been more than a year that I have had this.  </li>
            <li> This clipper is everything that it promises to be and more.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure you use the attachment combs.  </li>
            <li> I love these clippers.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact that they are MADE in the USA.</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different clippers, and these are the best.</li>
            <li> Now we have to spend more money to buy the correct blade.</li>
            <li> Love Oster machines.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> My sister loves it and i will now have free haircuts FOREVER with these clippers!</li>
            <li> My faids are allot better now.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s even more of a long-term savings.</li>
            <li> A well thought out system that will work with its many accessories.</li>
            <li> Hopefully they stay with this product rather than as most companies try to reduce the quality while increasing the price.</li>
            <li> I can see why professionals love this clipper.</li>
            <li> Love everything about it...</li>
            <li> Real quick-</li>
            <li> $15+tip/haircut x 3 boys x 12 months &#x3D; $720/year, this system has more than paid for itself.  </li>
            <li> I love using these clippers.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is so much better</li>
            <li> I have been wanting one of these for many years.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> If you need to set speed records, you are better off going with a cheaper grade.....</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have any issues gripping this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best set of clippers I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been so pleased with these clippers, that I also purchased the Oster T-Finisher as well.</li>
            <li> I am sure I can get them repaired but</li>
            <li> The way the clipper is designed is safe to use.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;re four more words.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and then make sure you put the screws in a safe place to avoid losing them.</li>
            <li> It cuts better than others.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly you can get a better cut with</li>
            <li> Simply the best clippers you can purchase.</li>
            <li> These clippers put all of those cheap clippers to shame!  </li>
            <li> like most people are saying it is more like 2 days.</li>
            <li> my head weekly and this is way better than buying a cheapo from walmart.  </li>
            <li> My favorite thing about it?</li>
            <li> I have barbered my kids and grandkids hair for many years.  </li>
            <li> So it will cost more for the attachments to change the degress of hair length thats being cut.</li>
            <li> Hopefully this one lasts me for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Changing blades - costs more but a closer/better cut</li>
            <li> After using those on and off for a year or more; don&#x27;t do it.</li>
            <li> Maybe I am being more efficient with it&lt;</li>
            <li> The 00000 blades are about like one day&#x27;s stubble after shaving with a blade, which is what most people are looking for.  </li>
            <li> they are phenomenal on my head.</li>
            <li> I love the Oster clippers....be sure to oil the blades before each use.</li>
            <li> so I have more time before I have to do it again.</li>
            <li> That translates into more confidence and a better/quicker haircut.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I have thrown away a dozen or more of the cheaper models.</li>
            <li> *love</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, when my favorite barber retired he told me to get a 76076 and a 1 and 2 clipper and do it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit noisy in operation, but the overall quality is perfect.</li>
            <li> I plan on using these for years to come and expect to get better with practice.</li>
            <li> Excellent clippers!&lt;br /&gt;These are really solid.</li>
            <li> I cute hair on the sides for friends and acquaintances.</li>
            <li> I have it for more that two years and use it almost once every week.</li>
            <li> Most clippers have a vibrator inside, not rotary.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend them for sure.</li>
            <li> They are no louder than the clippers I&#x27;ve had before, and are definitely a lot quieter than vibration-drive clippers that aren&#x27;t in perfect adjustment.    </li>
            <li> The motor is made well and is up to the job for many haircuts.  </li>
            <li> top concern was that they were going to be too bulky</li>
            <li> (I had always only used Andis Masters up until that point), but that wasn&#x27;t the case, they fit nicely and feel awesome.</li>
            <li> If you are a barber don&#x27;t get these because you will be able to cut one head then</li>
            <li> and I would love to keep it if they make a closer blade for it.</li>
            <li> I wish it would have come with more attachments as I had to reorder a 1 1/2 blade.</li>
            <li> Simply the best.</li>
            <li> think it is going to be used many years..</li>
            <li> top quality...go to youtube for help with all types of cuts.</li>
            <li> but so far I&#x27;ve been impressed with how smooth this clipper operates.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend these to anyone looking to purchase a great set of clippers!!!!!</li>
            <li> I didnt know any better</li>
            <li> what would make it better)</li>
            <li> I sincerely wish now I had bought it 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> and I guess I am saving more than the cost of the unit every year.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this Oster hair clipper.</li>
            <li> This is what most professionals use on their hair salons.</li>
            <li> Way better then the cheap ones!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been through many.</li>
            <li> It may not be the most ergonomic clipper</li>
            <li> but it sure makes up for its akwardness through its shear power and accuracy.</li>
            <li> Would give it 5/5 if they improved the design for better grip.</li>
            <li> At Sally&#x27;s, they are more than $200.</li>
            <li> it love it  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> If you have better instructions on how to change out and install the blades</li>
            <li> I sure would like to have them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;boseimmp@msn.com</li>
            <li> This machine blends hair better than ANY machine out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be pleased with the fell and the outcome.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never gotten a better one.</li>
            <li> I love this product and so will you.</li>
            <li> and I find the performance is top notch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this device,...</li>
            <li> You have to take the top blade part of in once piece.  </li>
            <li> My favorite clippers.</li>
            <li> Clippers are ok,.</li>
            <li> I dont know if it is built to be able to handle the heat, but I get worried that it is going to overheat.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve tried a lot and waited a while before committing to these because they cost more.</li>
            <li> I have always bought the 20-30 dollar ones from Walmart, Target or wherever and over the years have bought more than I care to mention.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> but I ordered two more for tapering.</li>
            <li> but I have owned many clippers and never have had this happen.</li>
            <li> I was able to order one on-line</li>
            <li> and I was able to use it, just like I had planned.  </li>
            <li> reason I bought this clipper is that I noticed that many of the cheaper units sold started pulling hair after six months to  a year.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li> You will be glad you did.  </li>
            <li> ok this trimmer reminds me of a truck or a harley davidson.</li>
            <li> Make sure to oil the blades everytime and grease the inside once a year.</li>
            <li> This clipper really does a great job.</li>
            <li> so glad i ordered these.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Outstanding cut.</li>
            <li> Much better than the cheaper sets we use to buy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better to work longer to shorter.</li>
            <li> Nice smooth even cut with no stragglers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing hair for over 10 years and have not found a clipper of better quality.</li>
            <li> You can blend so much better.</li>
            <li> Still love them</li>
            <li> What more can be said.</li>
            <li> Most satisfied with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> My wife cut&#x27;s my hair and over the years we have gone through too many clippers.  </li>
            <li> if I let my stubble or hair on my head grow out for more than a week, I&#x27;ll give it a buzz with these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, great quality, very durable.</li>
            <li> In fact i&#x27;m doing a better job than the Barbers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several hair clippers and this is the best.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would not recommend these for home use, but instead get the wahl seniors, or andis masters or better yet visit the barbershop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get this and enjoy!</li>
            <li> Is a good cliper to own if your a real pro.</li>
            <li> The motor is very strong, easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I would not return them Because I can tell they are well made and very powerful!</li>
            <li> but with the 76er it gives u a nice  clean cut and wont leave any patches.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great to have a pair of clippers with a motor from a classic muscle car in your hand.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind they won&#x27;t cut nearly as clean, but nice for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> its clean, nice build.</li>
            <li> They cut as close as you want and the blade change is very easy to do, yet secure.</li>
            <li> Great clippers, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> still works great, highly recommended..</li>
            <li> They are so easy to use, and do such a great job!</li>
            <li> One or two passes is all it takes for a very clean cut.  </li>
            <li> a great tool, one of the best in the industry, and will suite your needs whether you are looking to purchase it for professional or personal use.</li>
            <li> After giving the clipper a good cleaning the first time, I noticed the blade was off a bit.</li>
            <li> The cost is well worth the quality!!</li>
            <li> It has a lot of power and cuts hair easily, and it&#x27;s an outstanding clipper.</li>
            <li> wife cuts my hair and we have easily saved more money than the cost of the cuts at a barber.</li>
            <li> super nice close shave with the 000 blades</li>
            <li> I had only known how superior a good pair of clippers (either these OR the Andis BRC)</li>
            <li> They sound more like a well oiled bicycle chain instead of a buzz saw like most clippers.&lt;br /&gt;3-The blades can be switched out without unscrewing screws.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very easy to change and clean blades.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> But yes ,its a great professional machine!</li>
            <li> Truthfully, this clipper is maybe overkill for once-a-week haircuts but it does SUCH a good job!</li>
            <li> /&gt;- clean, fast, great cut and operation across the board.</li>
            <li> It does a better job, does it faster, is easier to clean and to top it off</li>
            <li> This hair clipper is very good and looks like it will last for years.</li>
            <li> He never used comb attachments, therefore, invest in more blades if you want to decrease the cut or invest in another set of clippers if you need an huge guard for your hair.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product ... cuts through my sons&#x27; hair like a hot knife slicing through soft butter.  </li>
            <li> I decided on the Oster professional clippers and have been a happy clipper since.  </li>

            <li> I only cut my own families hair, but these clippers are amazing!  </li>
            <li> While these clippers might be great for the professional, trying to use them yourself can be quite a task.  </li>
            <li> I have been shaving my head for over 20 years and in that time I&#x27;ve gone through many clippers some cheap</li>

            <li> that is nice, but what really struck me is just how much better these clippers cut my hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 00000 size blade in addition to those that come with the clipper so that I can shave off my beard easily when called for.&lt;br</li>

            <li> This makes clipping easy -----</li>
            <li> Easy to maintain (see youtube video).</li>
            <li> watch youtube for easy instructions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too easy for that plastic to fall off.  </li>
            <li> easy to use</li>
            <li> 11/25/14&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong.</li>
            <li> This clipper is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I bought this clipper 5 years ago for keeping my head shaved and its still going strong.</li>
            <li> if you want thicker plastic and a strong motor).  </li>
            <li> It has a 000 blade, cuts my hair every week and is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Still going strong.  </li>
            <li> However, It gives amazing cut at first attempt.</li>
            <li> Mine get warm, but I wouldn&#x27;t say hot.  </li>
            <li> Oh wow, the difference is astounding!</li>
            <li> The first I had was a $25 Wahl set from Walmart which kind of sucked out after awhile.</li>
            <li> They get pretty warm if you use longer than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> this is hands down the best hair clipper i&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Switching blades is quick and easy, and the results are better than I&#x27;ve ever gotten with comb attachments.    </li>
            <li> This the best to knock down hair</li>
            <li> This is an excellent pair of clippers and I would highly recommend it to anyone from a novice to a professional.</li>
            <li> &quot; it did a good job until it broke and needed to get a new clipper.  </li>
            <li> I did my son&#x27;s curly hair and again, went very quickly and with a precise hair length.</li>
            <li> will tell in terms of value/longevity but in terms of performance these easily exceed the cheap models.</li>
            <li> I am a black guy and it cuts my hair perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Peel and half peel are what it does best...</li>
            <li> I did try a cheap pair first, to see if I could even shave my own head.  </li>
            <li> Lots of blades are available with sizes that are easy to understand.</li>
            <li> They go on just fine with the clipper turned off.</li>
            <li> The one and a half blade is perfect for clipper over comb work.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine, but I sprung for the 0000</li>
            <li> Though I am in it for the quick buzz cuts I haven&#x27;t had the thing running for more than 20min tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They cut quickly and well, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the motor dying on me or the blades not being able to handle that amount of hair like I did with the cheaper clippers I had purchased.</li>
            <li> They are so pleasant to use no pulled hairs, no going over the same area many times and</li>
            <li> Works good but getting very hot very soon</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re both very pleased and would highly recommend them to anyone.  </li>
            <li> What a vast wonderful improvement in performance.plus the blades are replaceable and the motor is repairable, Smart Choice</li>
            <li> Best clippers ever......hands down!</li>
            <li> Heavy duty clippers, great for shaving my own head.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with the smooth and quiet operation of this clipped.</li>
            <li> the time it used to take me to trim now which is a huge quality of life improvement.</li>
            <li> your cash and buy this instead of the cheap 40-50$ ones.</li>
            <li> Great product overall!</li>
            <li> It cuts like a knife through butter and is easy to clean and change blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and relube.  </li>
            <li> It is solid (and rather heavy)and seems to have a great motor.</li>
            <li> These extensions work well and have a secure fit on the clipper.</li>
            <li> My wife has been clipping my hair for years with cheap clippers.</li>
            <li> So precise and on point.</li>
            <li> This one will last and works great.</li>
            <li> The sound of the motor is music to my ears.</li>
            <li> It cuts easy and clean.</li>
            <li> some not so cheap and these clipper blow everyone one of them away.</li>
            <li> The newer A6 (marketed for pet grooming, but great for human hair) is slimmer, quieter, and cooler running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The instruction manual obviously doesn&#x27;t expect blade changes on the fly because there are no diagrams.  </li>
            <li> They cut smoothly and precisely.</li>
            <li> I have bought cheap clippers from department stores for years.  </li>
            <li> and they fit my hands perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do get warm when doing your whole head, but not hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this item is one of my most productive purchase in years.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and store.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect the \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; sound as you cut your hair, it just cuts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic, what can I say?</li>
            <li> and they are fantastic.      </li>
            <li> I cannot say enough and happy with my investment.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> some cheap walmart clippers take your pick on the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I primarily use these as my &amp;#34;take down&amp;#34; clippers.</li>
            <li> This clipper is fantastic.</li>
            <li> They were affordable and with amazon prime the shipping was free.</li>
            <li> There are somethings you can go cheap on; this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t cheap out</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic set of clippers.</li>
            <li> my time is worth more to me than waiting in line for a cut.</li>
            <li> their lengths, and how many days of hair growth the length corresponds to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade - Length, days worth of hair growth:&lt;br /&gt;00000 - 1/125” , 10 hours&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem I had is that I dropped them from about 3 feet and the case cracked, but the clippers still work great.  </li>
            <li> I used them the same day and performed a great Fade haircut on a friend.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t cheap, but I can&#x27;t imagine being happier with a set of clippers.</li>
            <li> I have this for several years, and it works great.  </li>
            <li> The way the blade move is really smooth</li>
            <li> I purchased a couple sets of guides that fit these clippers depending on the blades attached.</li>
            <li> If the blades are lightly oiled after every use, they should cut one or two heads virtually forever.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend the clippers to someone who is looking for clippers of great quality.</li>
            <li> These things are fabulous.</li>
            <li> Just the way the sound and</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I continued along the rest of my scalp it was fantastic.</li>
            <li> honestly can&#x27;t imagine how much better(or</li>
            <li> I went back to the 000 blade and that works great for</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am saving money on haircuts and I am saving time by doing it all at home without driving or making an appointment or having to wait for my stylist to be available.  </li>
            <li> After running through two sets of cheap shears, I decided to step up and buy there.  </li>
            <li> Holy smokes, this thing is a Cadillac compared to my cheap clippers that my wife has trimmed my hair with for 10 years.</li>
            <li> would recommend Oster&#x27;s fast feed clippers over these, I have them too,  if you want to cut your own hair...</li>
            <li> WHY YOU SHOULDN&#x27;T BOTHER WITH A CHEAP BUZZER:&lt;br</li>
            <li> They cut smoothly and don&#x27;t push the hair like cheaper clippers that you by in department stores.</li>
            <li> I bought a cheap clipper made by GE at Walmart.</li>
            <li> These clippers don&#x27;t even change sound when I swamp it with my hair.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap like the one you buy for 50-60$.</li>
            <li> Before i had purchased these, i had been buying the cheaper versions available in department and drug stores.  </li>
            <li> I cut my hair and face with these and it leaves both looking smooth</li>
            <li> I went onto another Wahl set, a $50 model with a more powerful motor.</li>
            <li> The problem is they do not cut as close as the cheap ones do.  </li>
            <li> Works great for all the different blades and clipper, cape, etc.</li>
            <li> The blades on this Oster are mechanically reciprocating (not just vibrating like the cheap clippers).  </li>
            <li> These are well built and precisely made.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves it and so far, the best investment considering that he cuts his hair every ten days :)</li>
            <li> You can tell by how smooth the unit works.</li>
            <li> Enjoy.</li>
            <li> For years I have shaved my head with cheap $20-$30</li>
            <li> Cuts Clean and easily.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT, VERY QUIET, WELL MADE, PRICED RIGHT,&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> No stray hairs, no gouges, just an overall great experience.</li>
            <li> Sure its more than twice as much</li>
            <li> It has more heft, the cord is thicker and more substantial, even the blades appear much tougher.</li>
            <li> /&gt;4)The \\&quot;76\\&quot; is made in the USA, it&#x27;s good to know we still make something, and I gladly support an American company</li>
            <li> My wife will cut the back of my head to make sure I don&#x27;t butcher it, and I&#x27;m good to go for another month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Andis is the best for fast short head and face shaving</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> I use this every week end since i bought it - strong and sturdy - no failure REMARKS An air blower would be a nice thing to have for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Out of all the researching i had done, the Oster Classic 76 came out on top!</li>
            <li> Classic 76 Professional is a very good product.  </li>
            <li> Quick, easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> and they are all very useful.</li>
            <li> Very powerful clippers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are already many, many review for the Classic 76.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty pleased w/ the Wahl but decided to purchase this trimmer based upon its reputation as an industry standard and great reviews.  </li>
            <li> Yes, these aren&#x27;t cheap, but  after 30 seconds, 59 year old wife liked how easily they cut and performed.</li>
            <li> Clean and precise.</li>
            <li> You can even cut your own hair with the tried and trued Classic 76 if no one around to cut it for you.  </li>
            <li> first impression was that these clippers were much more substantial than the cheap ones I had been using.</li>
            <li> This is the best,It cut&#x27;s hair quickly and so easily.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Haircuts\\&quot; by this method are now so quick and easy</li>
            <li> If you cut your own hair, or your children&#x27;s hair often, make the investment and by the Oster Classic 76.</li>
            <li> maintenance is super easy, as is changing the blades.  </li>
            <li> and I still can&#x27;t get over how easy and quick it is to trim my hair now.</li>
            <li> I have cut my own hair since high school and have always used the run of the mill clippers.  </li>
            <li> Comes highly recommended and it does the job,  Sturdy construction although a bit bulky and warm to the touch after extended use</li>
            <li> Nice set of clippers, you can tellits high quality.  </li>
            <li> these are huge clippers - and whether you can adjust to that or not, the size is still less than ideal.</li>
            <li> Powerful!</li>
            <li> I used the first one on a weekly basis for many years.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I  was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that parts are available from the manufacturer (rare these days and getting more rare every year)</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t mind yearly maintenance, these are great.</li>
            <li> &gt;... and to think how long I&#x27;ve been getting by with the cheapy Walmart/ happy homeowner clipper brands.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything that I said in my original review stands.</li>
            <li> it gets too hot and also just come with 2 options os cut, if you want more you have to buy.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with it&lt;</li>
            <li> When I first used these clippers I was in love.  </li>
            <li> Worth the investment!</li>
            <li> Really worth the price!</li>
            <li> The 9&#x27; Cord is the best no more looking for a closer outlet or extension cord.</li>
            <li> Get the job done fast and easy!</li>
            <li> Powerful, and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> I bought the spray and some barbicide to keep all my tools clean</li>
            <li> Amazing quality cuts at home just make sure that your metal blades are greased properly or else your hair will snag.</li>
            <li> I keep my head shaved clean</li>
            <li> Keep it clean and well oiled.  </li>
            <li> The cheap ones pull as much as they cut, require many passes, and still miss plenty of &#x27;rogue&#x27; hairs.</li>
            <li> I clean out the hairs and add some clipper oil before and after each use.</li>
            <li> hair looks better, feels better, and offers the benefits of being a bit butch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a through cleaning I tried them on myself and was thrilled at the ease of the cut and the fact that I was able to clean up my very short haircut without a trip to the barber.</li>
            <li> No comb-over, just the Mr. Clean look with the help of the Oster 76076.  </li>
            <li> The Oster Classic 76 makes fading very easy, and there is no vibration in the unit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These clippers work very well, very smooth, effortless trimming.</li>
            <li> The quality of the a classic 76 Universal Motor Clipped is very good.  </li>
            <li> This is the right one!</li>
            <li> Smooth, quick, but heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> I recommend this Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper because it is great at trimming the head and beards.</li>
            <li> so I wanted to update this review and say I love the Classic 76 even more than when I first got it.</li>
            <li> I had several clippers, and this one is by far the best and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Still using these after 3 years, they paid for themselves in the first month,  I still get fresh cuts at the house :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time in my life i was exited to open the box of a hair clipper lol.</li>
            <li> Powerful accurate operation.</li>
            <li> Would have been nice to include the combs directly in the kit...</li>
            <li> Sweet, J\just what I ordered</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a kind of old school look about it.  </li>
            <li> thing has the feel of a good solid machine.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS EVERY MONTH OR TWO FOR A FULL SHAVE..</li>
            <li> FULL BODY SHAVE</li>
            <li> The cheap ones just aren&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> FINALLY, HE HAS SOME GOOD CLIPPERS.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair, so far this thing has paid for it&#x27;self</li>
            <li> but you probably won&#x27;t buy that many or replace them very often.</li>
            <li> The only way it can cut my hair is if I go against the grain which does not look as good on me.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> The old school look is nice and sleek.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very meticulous about cleaning/lubricating them and making sure the cord doesn&#x27;t kink.  </li>
            <li> know it&#x27;s going to last me for a good time,</li>
            <li> B0012KKRBO Oster AgION clipper blade size 3.75 Full Tooth.]], plus the two a #1 and a #00000 that came with the kit.</li>
            <li> clippers themselves are powerful and precise.  </li>
            <li> and it is sweet.</li>
            <li> One pass and the hair is perfect, no matter how thick it is.  </li>
            <li> To achieve a good fade it takes some trial and error with the different blade sizes, but I have it figured out now.  </li>
            <li> have to let them cool</li>
            <li> I am satisfied and would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much, Rosanna</li>
            <li> Within 24 hours of leaving this review I received an email that they will refund the full amount.</li>
            <li> And if somehow, after years of use, some part wears out or breaks, just look it up on the full schematic and order a replacement PART and fix it yourself.</li>
            <li> Some may say it&#x27;s exagereted to buy a professionnal unit to cut your own hair, but i&#x27;ve spent more on cheap unit.</li>
            <li> the extra money to invest in a good pair</li>
            <li> I can go full speed whisking this thing through my hair and it doesn&#x27;t even stutter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not so bad that I don&#x27;t want to use it, but it is noticeable&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not so bad that I don&#x27;t want to use it, but it is noticeable&lt;br</li>
            <li> Like many others, I have a whole drawer full of $20 clippers.  </li>
            <li> (2) Switching out new blades &#x3D; VERY EASY.  </li>
            <li> Well it got warm / hot right out of the box, so I oiled it exactly the way the video showed, and no change.</li>
            <li> But it would be fairly easy to switch it out for a higher quality metal</li>
            <li> Its really pretty easy.  </li>
            <li> , it should be noted that these clippers get hot VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> I first tried these on  my dog who has incredibly thick and fine hair,  and they worked superbly.</li>
            <li> The steel blades are quickly interchanged and provide a very smooth and comfortable cut, with that professional look I so wanted.</li>
            <li> One nice thing I liked is the little metal hanger on the bottom</li>
            <li> It cuts with ease through my hair which clogs most other clippers and also leaves a nice clean finish (no clipper streaks or stripes).</li>
            <li> Also, the haircut process is much more pleasant with no tugging/pulling like is common from the cheap brands.</li>
            <li> It is powerful and cuts clean.  </li>
            <li> Tends to heat up too quickly.</li>
            <li> (salon charges $55 a cut and Super Cut</li>
            <li> It has some heft to it, but it cuts so quickly that the weight is not a problem.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and I received the package within five days of ordering.</li>
            <li> Makes quick work of my beard.  </li>
            <li> Not convenient for a quick grab and shave  -No carrying case or any type of storage for that matter    </li>
            <li> This clipper cuts super.</li>
            <li> quick shipping.</li>
            <li> blade change with quick detach.&lt;br /&gt;Standard</li>
            <li> Very durable, easy to use, fantastic quality, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Of course this clipper pays for itself quite quickly if compared to the cost and inconvenience of going to a</li>
            <li> Also there is no sitting and waiting for the next available barber when you cut your own hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> OK...so I pulled the trigger on the Oster \\&quot;Classic 76\\&quot; after throwing away the $25 type clippers more times than I care to remember.  </li>
            <li> Five Stars is appropriate here, for a genuine, professional quality machine.  </li>
            <li> It cuts quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li> This one definitely has more heft to it and a lot more power.</li>
            <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned and I&#x27;ve had a lot over the last ten years.</li>
            <li> I do love how fast and powerful they are</li>
            <li> quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I called Oster hoping for a quick fix</li>
            <li> I have tried many different clippers on the market, some cheap some not so cheap but on special</li>
            <li> Other than that works fine good price</li>
            <li> Its high quality and top notch quality.</li>
            <li> and it does a great job if you&#x27;re looking for a clean and tight cut.</li>
            <li> Most of all, Amazon made it so easy to acquire the clipper, better than any other sites.</li>
            <li> I bought this while I was deployed over seas and cut my own hair and the hair of many other Marines.</li>
            <li> When you turn it on, the first thing you notice is the sound.</li>
            <li> but it gets very hot when using</li>
            <li> The motor runs smoothly and, while it does get hot evetually, it takes a while for it to heat up.    </li>
            <li> the motor gets very hot though...</li>
            <li> The directions kind of suck.&lt;br /&gt;You absolutely need a blade wash to make sure these work properly.  </li>
            <li> Great product, Hands Down.</li>
            <li> Although it was pretty $$$, it was very worth it.</li>
            <li> but so far, I am impressed with the speed and ease with which it cut through my hair, requiring only two passes...one to get all the hair and the second one being my anxiety and wanting to just make sure.</li>
            <li> Make sure the unit is running when you slap the new blade on.</li>
            <li> I was confident the product was brand new because each part was wrapped in plastic and the box was undamaged.</li>
            <li> I love my new clippers.  </li>
            <li> New to Amazon, I was a bit apprehensive to buy something with a reasonably large price tag, BUT this clipper is amazing.</li>
            <li> Parts and extra blades in many sizes and types are easily available and professional repair is available in most areas.</li>
            <li> but, even though they don&#x27;t last as long as I think they should, I still use one because I think it is the best for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can absolutely recommend these if you are looking for a reliable easy to use set of clippers.</li>
            <li> They give a nice, smooth finish and the triple zero blades give a nice high and tight.</li>
            <li> Good manufacturing very well made, a bit heavy, which means it has a very strong motor.  </li>
            <li> Also, like a lawn mower, the Oster 76 clippers are very loud when compared to most magnetic clippers.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re ready to step up from the cheap disposables most people try to get by with, the Classic 76 is worth considering.</li>
            <li> Because he&#x27;s gone through so many, all of minimal quality, I bought the Oster Classic 76 for him knowing they were top of the line and hoping he&#x27;d love them.  </li>
            <li> From the first gliding pass, I was wide-eyed giddy!</li>
            <li> At first I balked at paying the price since they&#x27;re just for home use, but I would do it again in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> so if you are a self trimmer you will have your hand wrapped around the hot vents!  </li>
            <li> For saving me from that, it paid for itself on its first use!</li>
            <li> after 10 mins of using its burning hot !</li>
            <li> It broke on the first use!  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to get my new clippers, I&#x27;d considered this purchase for a year or two.  </li>
            <li> it so nice ...a little costly though by its worthy ,my husband love it</li>
            <li> Does a great job, easy to clean, and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> it takes MUCH practice to fine tune</li>
            <li> Well worth the high price!!!</li>
            <li> I have had them now for a couple of years and they are as good as new whereas the others were ready to throw out by now, mainly because the blades blunt.</li>
            <li> This Clipper is the real deal, Salon quality and it cuts incredible, it is a bit heavy but with weight come quality.  </li>
            <li> The power cord is very sturdy and never curls up around itself like the power cables for cheap clippers.    </li>
            <li> As a balding person, it really helped me clip the sides of my head for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> POWERFUL.</li>
            <li> The Oster 76 is not the slimmest of the trimmers but its quite a powerful unit that gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> I think if it is good enough for the professional barber it is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> There are many different attachments available too.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it as the clippers do such a nice job.</li>
            <li> Quieter than my old clippers, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> Totally worth it.  </li>
            <li> I am a male whom has cut his own hair since I was 17</li>
            <li> well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Its worth it, faster too.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Alas, when my girlfriend came home from work, I just had to share my joy!....</li>
            <li> It is powerful and the motor just keeps going and going.  </li>
            <li> They are well worth the money and have already paid for themselves in the savings from not having to visit a barber or stylist.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few others but these are by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Quality is worth the price.</li>
            <li> In the \\&quot;old days\\&quot; the quality of Osters were much better than they are today</li>
            <li> But if you just use it at home for your own haircutting, this clipper should last you a lifetime, unlike the drug store brands.</li>
            <li> this clipper seem to be so much better than my old wahl clipper i had.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is the rare exception.  </li>
            <li> Yes, they are over $100, but they are worth every dollar.  </li>
            <li> The body cavity is bigger and heavier than the kind you get at the pharmacy, Target or Walmart.  </li>
            <li> These clippers are well-made and powerful.</li>
            <li> Worth the money I hope.  </li>
            <li> I love these clippers, I use them on my husband and 2 1/2 yr old son.</li>
            <li> Motor cooling vents are near top</li>
            <li> Love it so far.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better to spend the extra $$$ than to go cheap.</li>
            <li> The quality of my cuts have gone up considerably and these things are built so much better than the others I always bought.  </li>
            <li> The clippers tend to operate warm almost immediately after turning them on (this really isn&#x27;t a big deal).    </li>
            <li> This was definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Make no mistake about it, this machine is incredibly powerful.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t have to keep going over the same spots for a nice close even cut.  </li>
            <li> POWERFUL &amp; STURDY.  </li>
            <li> IMO it is also worth every cent.  </li>
            <li> This Oster clipper is worth five, IMO.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The oster 76 is worth every dollar</li>
            <li> well made and powerful.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for the working professional or anyone that maintains their appearance on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> It went through like butter and the only way I knew it had cut a nice swath of hair is all the shavings that fell in the sink.</li>
            <li> Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Took me a while to get used to holding the bigger heavier clippers while buzzing my own head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that the ability to repair something has become so rare that it&#x27;s a selling point, but there you have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked this actually as I only needed</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll get your monies worth.</li>
            <li> I came here to buy the 00000 blade just for the fun of it and decided to leave a review.</li>
            <li> I had become discouraged with the cheap clippers I&#x27;d bought over the years (eventually breaking or not cutting very well with use).  </li>
            <li> Great professional clippers for personal style!!</li>
            <li> Probably worth $70-80.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitely worth</li>
            <li> worth the money...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> But if you want a reliable powerful blade system, the 76 is IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a regular middle-aged bald guy who cuts his own hair at home.</li>
            <li> But the cost didn&#x27;t leave me ecstatic about them - although I thought it would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> Worth every cent...</li>
            <li> It cuts so nice and short.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth learning.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> cut my own hair and I like it short.</li>
            <li> When you turn them on you hear the sound of a quality motor.... and the blade action is smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li> but they are powerful.  </li>
            <li> and this is it, only more precise.  </li>
            <li> it was nice to have the extra razor in the package</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Maybe the best $ I&#x27;ve ever spent for personal care.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> So far I have found that these clippers produce a perfectly even cut the first pass every time, this cuts down on the time it takes to cut my hair and it also reduces wear on the motor.</li>
            <li> These too are high quality clippers making trimming quick and accurate.</li>
            <li> I love my wahls but the oster cut is so much more tight and clean without leaving those sprigs from split ends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about twice the weight of a walmart brand trimmer, but as long as you&#x27;re ok with that it&#x27;s perfect (other than the high price).    </li>
            <li> Not only are they efficient, but they cut very accurately and cleanly.</li>
            <li> $117.90 is a lot more than other brands but quality costs more.  </li>
            <li> thing I do not like about the 76 is that it heats up pretty quickly, it&#x27;s like having a portable Heater in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trunk can quickly become too hot to handle.</li>
            <li> Keep it clean, well oiled and rig a large rubber band to hold the blade guard in place.  </li>
            <li> Multiple guides make styling easy and length of cut easy.</li>
            <li> The instructions said &amp;#34;Professional Use Only&amp;#34; and I thought maybe I gone too far in the search for high quality clippers, but they are nice for home use too.  </li>
            <li> High end product with low maintenance and a fair price.</li>
            <li> This enables it to be cleaned the right way.</li>
            <li> I ordered these clippers 3 months ago and right off the bat I was having issues.</li>
            <li> thats right, two in</li>
            <li> Just click buy and stop wasting your time getting your hair cut right.</li>
            <li> The body of the clippers broke right below the blades.  </li>
            <li> THE PRICE WAS RIGHT.</li>
            <li> Look like something produced decades ago when things were built right.</li>
            <li> Renegade\\&quot;, and you&#x27;ll also be a pro at maintaining your own 76 in 8 minutes and 37 seconds flat!    </li>
            <li> /&gt;3)The size of the \\&quot;76\\&quot; is pretty perfect for my slightly larger than average hands, but I think most any adult wouldn&#x27;t have difficulty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to know how it worked, how it was put together, and, most importantly, how to keep it perpetually giddy, too, with grease and oil and all the TLC it deserved.</li>
            <li> The Classic 76 has the power to give you a comfortable and effortless haircut.  </li>
            <li> These clippers do a pretty good job, but aren&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> Cuts fast and cleanly.</li>
            <li> and I feel sure the heft is oweing to its better construction with higher quality motor and other parts.</li>
            <li> Few things are more satisfying than shaving your own head and going through your mane with ease, especially after a No Shave marathon.</li>
            <li> In my opinion you can get the same results from buying a better quality NON detachable clipper like an Andis Master, Oster Fast feed, or a Wahl senior for a more reasonable price.</li>
            <li> this new oster is a very fine high qualitY product.  </li>
            <li> but I can say for certain this is by far the most powerful machine I have ever used</li>
            <li> I like how the 2 blades are easily switched out for the different types of blades available.</li>
            <li> After switching from my cheap, $50 clippers with the plastic guards, the time that it took to cut my own hair was \\&quot;cut\\&quot; in half.</li>
            <li> but I may switch back to the Cordless remington some day for the light easy self trim.</li>
            <li> It does get hot pretty quickly but still seems to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big, powerful, heavily built and does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> Is fast easy to clean and you get the barber shop professional cut without their price</li>
            <li> These are powerful, the quality is evident the moment you begin using&lt;br</li>
            <li> As someone who shaves his head weekly and has given himself haircuts his entire life, i can&#x27;t say enough how important it is to invest in good clippers.  </li>
            <li> It seems there is a better cut when using the bare blade.  </li>
            <li> The cord on the A6 is nice and long, but Oster added a transformer box that hangs about a foot away from the outlet.</li>
            <li> Good clipper for taking down hair.</li>
            <li> It was a good investment other than that!</li>
            <li> My husband has very thick hair, and after going through 2 much cheaper Wahls within a month each, we decided that this might be our best bet.  </li>
            <li> I bought them to shave my head and these things go right through the hair the first time.</li>
            <li> an shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> A6 requires you to depress a button before the blade will swing out - that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> same old design but still maintain good quality.</li>
            <li> If you want a clean bald look then I would recommend the Andis T Outlinner over the classic 76.</li>
            <li> The blades included with the clipper 1 and 000 are skinhead boot camp army style short, so buy a bigger blade, 3 3/4 blade worked great for</li>
            <li> It was easy to clean after use, and it seems pretty simple to switch blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t quite understand how this happened, nor can I understand why Oster would use a cheap plastic on/off switch on such a beautiful heavy duty pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> (*) The A6 requires you to depress a button before the blade will swing out - that&#x27;s nice.</li>
            <li> They were very fast in encouraging me to buy from them and at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much</li>
            <li> It happens very fast as well.</li>
            <li> I bough it for my husband and so far works perfectly fine till now</li>
            <li> So far they are working just fine.</li>
            <li> The 76 feels very substantial and durable, with a strong, quiet, motor that cuts extremely smooth.  </li>
            <li> There is a nice video on the Oster website that will show you how to grease the mechanism and other useful tips.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s a little bulky, the clipper does a good job.</li>
            <li> I replaced it with this NEW oster hair clipper and like mY original oster</li>
            <li> Pros: excellent build quality and cutting ability, cuts swiftly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more like \\&quot;the dark side of the moon and a super nova\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you never used a clipper (like myself) it can very very itimidating on your first use.</li>
            <li> I finally upgraded to these clippers and it made a huge difference!  </li>
            <li> The first clipper I owned lasted for twenty five years.</li>
            <li> gets to hot after u use it for like 5 or 10 min</li>
            <li> The Oster is powerful and cuts my hair much faster than off the shelf brands.</li>
            <li> After 15 minutes is was hot as hell, what a bunch of lairs oster team.</li>
            <li> Beast of a machine, cut&#x27;s through everything first time around -</li>
            <li> The kids remain cooperative through the entire cut, and results are much better and even looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident these will last for years since I&#x27;m using them at home and not in a shop.</li>
            <li> They stay cool and pretty quiet compared to my cheap pair I had.  </li>
            <li> i did a lot of research on different types of clippers and i am so glad that i chose this one.</li>
            <li> It zips through my husband&#x27;s hair like the proverbial hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> It also get really hot at times.  </li>
            <li> I use the #0A blade (which I got for an extra $22) and love this machine.</li>
            <li> The first set I bought was defective, I returned them without any issues.</li>
            <li> Just got this clipper a couple weeks ago and used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.</li>

            <li> (*)</li>
            <li> (*)</li>
            <li> (*)</li>
            <li> (*) The A6 does run cooler on the handle.</li>
            <li> The blade sure was, but that&#x27;s no different than my experience with the 76 (and why I bought some of Oster&#x27;s cooling</li>
            <li> (*)</li>
            <li> (*)</li>
            <li> Very durable and powerful machine.  </li>
            <li> Sure, the cord gets in the way occasionally, but not to a point of frustration.</li>
            <li> Love them and feel like I made a purchase that will last for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Detachable blades give much flexiblity for length of hair, which makes it great for cutting your own hair as I do.  </li>
            <li> Blades are somewhat expensive so it is probably best to get them on eBay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this one will last longer than I will.</li>
            <li> Very durable and worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> Not noisy or hot either.</li>
            <li> They work much, much better than the big box clippers and appear to be built to last for many years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are pretty beefy.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to have plenty of power.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one consistent cut length for each guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this will be the last pair of hair clippers</li>
            <li> If you experience the blade getting too hot try using some oil on the blade before you start it up.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re exactly what I was hoping for and needing.</li>
            <li> Especially if you trim your hair weekly or more</li>
            <li> Sad I missed out on the awesome mustache printed clippers.</li>
            <li> I believe this will last for many years.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I am so glad I finally made this purchase.  </li>
            <li> The difference between the quality of the Classic 76 and department store bought clippers is tremendous.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer itself does exhaust hot air, something the wahl never did.</li>
            <li> It is extremely smooth and quiet but does get warm after a very short period of use.</li>
            <li> And finally I love the old fashioned fantastic quality of the 76 and I expect it to last for the rest of my life and turning 73 this month</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first one I ordered got almost too hot to hold.  </li>
            <li> Pretty sealed off in that I don&#x27;t have to worry about hair going inside the housing.</li>
            <li> if you want a better cut and a clipper that will last longer, get these.</li>
            <li> to clean&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot.  </li>
            <li> I decided to step up to a \\&quot;hopefully\\&quot; longer lasting better quality clippers.</li>
            <li> They melted away the hair on my head like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been kicking myself for not purchasing these two clippers sooner, but I&#x27;m glad that I finally stumbled upon them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There were times when I wanted to place it on Ebay to sell it because I have been lugging it around all my life in all the various cities/states that I lived in and can say that I am glad it kept it even though I haven&#x27;t owned a dog for over 8 years.  </li>
            <li> I love the clippers, however, they only lasted about a year.</li>
            <li> They run quite hot and snag the hair in spite of cleaning and oiling.</li>
            <li> More tricky is the Oster T-finisher tool, sold separately, because the T-finisher tool can cut the skin if not used properly.</li>
            <li> The motor is fast and powerful.</li>
            <li> As a fifteen year vet of the industry, I suppose I have the chops to weigh this pretty</li>
            <li> meaning...if you invest in the metal blades in different sizes, your cuts will be much more polished, fades look immaculate.</li>
            <li> It cuts through hair like a hot knife through butter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really nice having actual blades of different sizes to change out instead of the cheap flimsy plastic clip on combs.</li>
            <li> The blades are a bit expensive but you WILL get a perfect cut every time.</li>
            <li> The motor does get hot after a while, however.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought more then 10 clippers so when my last walmart whal died i decided to bite the bullet and get something</li>
            <li> but I recommend using clippers that are more geared toward fades such as the Wahl Five Star Seniors or Andis Masters (without the fade blade as the fade blade pulls and bites your skin).</li>
            <li> I noticed this the first time I used the clippers.</li>
            <li> I had an old pair of cheap ones that I purchased at Walmart and when they broke, I decided to make the investment in a nicer pair.  </li>
            <li> The first Oster I bought was in 1962.  </li>
            <li> Others have said they get hot.  </li>
            <li> Like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li> I made sure they were properly oiled and greased, but they still run hot after about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> The casing does get hot, which I was not accustomed to this heat.</li>
            <li> This clipper can stand haircut after haircut without getting hot.  </li>
            <li> They can get a bit hot if you use them for a while</li>
            <li> Well, it is a lot heavier than my last Wahl clipper, that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li> Overall this is an outstanding product</li>
            <li> Wish I never wasted money and time on all those cheap models before getting these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> the dog)&lt;br /&gt;My main issue is how insanely hot the clippers get, and how quickly.</li>
            <li> addition, the clippers, themselves, are hot to hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it still runs hot.  </li>
            <li> : I still love this clipper and I use it regularly.  </li>
            <li> They looked just like the ones I had seen at my barber shop(probably the exact same in all reality), It had great weight to it, the blades looked to be a giant leap over the Wahl and the whole thing</li>
            <li> I powered it up and turned it on, it vibrated at such a higher speed that I could feel it was going to cut much better.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The clipper does not begin to get hot in that amount of time.  </li>
            <li> I was aware of</li>
            <li> but you would expect a product to last for more than 3 months.</li>
            <li> , the clipper gets EXTREMELY HOT while in use.</li>
            <li> We tried plugging the clippers into many outlets in our home, but the same issues occur at each outlet.  </li>
            <li> We are totally dissatisfied and will not be buying any more Oster products, hair clippers or otherwise.</li>
            <li> No issues from the begining, i use it every WE since the first day.</li>
            <li> This product is great and will last a LONG time.</li>
            <li> It broke after first use.</li>
            <li> They are solid and plan on using them for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t become hot on the portion that you hold, if well lubricated.</li>
            <li> but they are pretty noisy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades do warm up, but that is to be expected, they don&#x27;t get too hot to touch by any means.&lt;br</li>
            <li> fan is attached to the motor which circulates air through it, the motor does not get hot.</li>
            <li> My kids have been using it almost daily for more than a year</li>
            <li> I have been doing this for almost 2 years and in that time, this is the 3rd pair of clippers I have had, graduating to better quality each time.</li>
            <li> husband started shaving the first time</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it would be if I had to cut a lot of hair in a day but only having to shave my husband</li>
            <li> It also gets extremely hot.  </li>
            <li> This is not difficult.  </li>
            <li> the higher the number the longer the cut.  </li>
            <li> Came in on time and works exactly as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> and it went threw it like a hot knife threw butter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you need anything higher than the 3/4&#x27;s inch blade cause</li>
            <li> the cheap department store clippers and these are a long ways from the cheap vibrating motor clipper.  </li>
            <li> The blades are a different story, they work ok but within a year ull have to replace them.</li>
            <li> they would produce better results and last longer.</li>
            <li> I am the first person to use the spare pair of clippers the salon just bought.</li>
            <li> Does a better job in one pass than cheaper clipped do in multiple passes.</li>
            <li> Larger and heavier than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; clippers, but worth it for an easy cut</li>
            <li> my 10 year old daughter who is very artistic plus these Oster 76 clippers (and a set of Oster Fast Feeds....</li>
            <li> It is quiet when it is running and the blades are super smooth.</li>
            <li> When I got the Oster Classic 76&#x27;s, needless to say the service was great but the product its self was outstanding.</li>
            <li> Another positive aspect of these that is worth the price -- no crappy plastic guards are necessary, you can just get easily interchangable blades.  </li>
            <li> My impression is that the electric motor is larger and more powerful, but that it also operates at a lower RPM giving it a different sound.</li>
            <li> I spent most of that time buying a new set of the cheapest clippers available and running them into the ground, which only took about a year for most.</li>
            <li> After years of clipping my own hair with a consumer-grade Oster clipper, I finally plunged into the realm of pure clipping bliss with my new toy...</li>
            <li> A little loud, but great.</li>
            <li> It seems to work better than the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; attachments to boot&lt;br /&gt;6)Speaking of the combs, I ordered those too and they are far better than average.  </li>
            <li> After seeing my boys, several family and friends have asked me to cut their hair, too, so I can only figure I am doing a pretty good</li>
            <li> It got warm, but not hot.  </li>
            <li> Gets real hot and reminds me of old BMW or Mercedes motor.</li>
            <li> Strong motor, sharp blades and provides a smooth even trim everytime.</li>
            <li> Very precise and made to run for long time.  </li>
            <li> In practical terms, that means that on a single pass, you&#x27;re getting even, smooth cuts saving you significant amounts of time.</li>
            <li> A great choice for a serious pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> They are truly professional in that they cut cleanly and effortlessly to exacting lengths.</li>
            <li> It is indeed far superior to the previous set of $30 clippers I had from Walmart, and well worth the $125</li>
            <li> The Oster Classic 76 Pro Hair Clipper is not disappointing in any way.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several different makes and models but yet to find a good clipper.</li>
            <li> The cut is much smoother and done in one pass versus multiple passes with the many cheaper models I have used.  </li>
            <li> After having gone through about five of these kits in the last 10 years, I finally decided to get a good set of clippers.</li>
            <li> The 000 blade it comes with is good, but not low enough for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on a cheap product you&#x27;ll have to replace yearly (or more).</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair in a simple military style so what I want from a clipper is reliability, sturdiness, a quiet motor and, most importantly, a smooth and even clip.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and quit running for such a powerful machine.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money for a high quality product.</li>
            <li> My hair never grows long enough to find out if it is way more powerful than a cheap one.  </li>
            <li> and I mean MANY MANY YEARS.</li>
            <li> after many years of cutting my own hair with $30-ish clippers....i finally decided to get a professional clipper.. for those of you that cut your own hair...throw or give away those cheap clippers.</li>
            <li> They are extremely loud and get hot a bit to quick.  </li>
            <li> I AGREE WITH ALL OF THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ON THIS CLIPPER.</li>
            <li> The A6 seems to vibrate a bit more in my hand than the 76, but I think it&#x27;s that it vibrates at a different frequency (similar to the sound).</li>
            <li> (*) The A6 doesn&#x27;t require (or really allow) you to periodically replace grease.</li>
            <li> The A6 seems to vibrate a bit more in my hand than the 76, but I think it&#x27;s that it vibrates at a different frequency (similar to the sound).</li>
            <li> (*) The A6 doesn&#x27;t require (or really allow) you to periodically replace grease.</li>
            <li> This clipper will cut hair pretty fast.</li>
            <li> &quot; buy periodically replacing my failing cheap&#x27;ohs with other cheap&#x27;ohs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think they are pretty much just junk.</li>
            <li> All said, the Oster 76 makes the clippers you find at most department store retailers seem like toys, and because spare parts are readily available for this model, there&#x27;s no reason why they shouldn&#x27;t last a lifetime if you properly maintain them.</li>
            <li> I would also strongly recommend purchasing a tube or bottle of the Oster Lubricating Oil to keep them sharp and use the included brush to clean them thoroughly after each use.</li>
            <li> it pretty much just feels like you are brushing your hair the clippers.</li>
            <li> it was exactly how it was described and fast delivery</li>
            <li> For my purposes the \\&quot;000\\&quot; is OK, but I&#x27;ll have to buy the \\&quot;00000\\&quot; before long.  </li>
            <li> the clippers arrived two weeks ago and tried working with it twice, the body and blade (the whole thing) gets hot after 4-minutes</li>
            <li> Thanks so much, Oster!</li>
            <li> Cuts a lot better than WA__ _ now lets see for how long .</li>
            <li> Having said that, I find the cut (when clippers are working properly) to be far superior to other brands.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oster Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper to replace a cheap model from Wal-Mart that broke.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews on this clipper and others, it was obvious that the Oster Classic 76 is the Cadillac of clippers, so I bit the bullet and bought them.  </li>
            <li> The A6 is a more rounded shape, but it&#x27;s not that much smaller than the Classic 76.</li>
            <li> As many have stated, Classic 76 will be your last home hair clippers!</li>
            <li> a lot of haircuts later and am so pleased I purchased the Classic 76.  </li>
            <li> With the 3/4 inch and the 1/2 inch combs (VERY easy to change), I can cut my hair myself with a definite professional look.</li>
            <li> Gets a little warm but not uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It works just like I thought it would will be using it for a very long time gladly recomend it</li>
            <li> Most quality magnetic clippers could last 15 years without even replacing or sharpening the blades if well maintained and if the operator cuts only clean hair.</li>
            <li> It comes with two different blades and they are really easy to interchange.    </li>
            <li> They are easy to maintain, built to last, and cut hair with ease.</li>
            <li> The Classic 76 clippers are smooth, relatively quiet, and powerful.  </li>
            <li> especially how easily they cut my hair.  </li>
            <li> I can easily see this lasting a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have two American Cocker Spaniels and this product efficiently and easily cuts through their hair in no time, reducing the time and stress put on them.  </li>

            <li> she&#x27;s had the same set of these clippers for over 5 years now and they are still going strong.</li>

            <li> be sure to only put a new blade on when the clippers are turned on or you could ruin them</li>
            <li> It was pure smoooooothness; the motor hummed steadily and effortlessly; and there were no missed hairs!</li>
            <li> Easy to switch them out and much more reliable than plastic guards, at least in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other clippers in the past and this has certainly worked the best.  </li>
            <li> It works fine for me though as I only use it to cut my hair and trim my beard once every two weeks.</li>

            <li> the Oster Classic 76!    </li>
            <li> Her first cut come out decent...</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have written on Amazon, but I felt compelled to report my dissatisfaction with the Oster Classic 76 clippers and Oster&#x27;s customer service.  </li>
            <li> The quality of these Oster 76 Classic clippers was evident the moment I picked them up out of the well packed box.</li>
            <li> Blades are very high quality.</li>
            <li> Very high quality piece made in the USA.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the package recommendations, Make certain the cord is straight...</li>
            <li> but if you cut your own, like I do, then you would like it to be a little lighter.</li>
            <li> Body of the unit gets a little warm after 10 mins or so but head/blade assy does not.</li>
            <li> Sturdy little machine with nice heft.</li>
            <li> so it takes a little getting used to, if you clip your own hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off, the clipper itself retail for as high as $200 depending on the distributor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this clipper to anyone looking to start shaving their head for the first time or just to replace the clipper they already have.</li>
            <li> They are a little more but its your hair and its worth it.    </li>
            <li> Ive had these clippers for a little while now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut easy and clean.</li>
            <li> The clippers are a little heavy, but you can feel that they have a lot of power, and they cut perfectly.</li>
            <li> One minor concern I have is, when I tried to replace the comb, the blade easily came off clipper and it wasn&#x27;t easy to put it back.</li>
            <li> The blades are super sharp and do a FAR better job then</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy duty, easy to clean, convenient for changing blades and basically indestructible.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really well built</li>
            <li> My wife has been cutting my hair with this (using a comb set) and it has been great!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> i am very picky when it comes to the things that i purchase</li>
            <li> These clippers are the real deal.</li>
            <li> My wife used to cut my hair with the cheap, generic clipper we got from department stores, and it kept pulling on my hair.  </li>
            <li> SO much easier than using hand</li>
            <li> This is a relevant point with regards to the overall appraisal of the Oster 76 hair clipper.     </li>
            <li> We got them to replace the Wal-Mart brand ones which have to be replaced very often.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping...  </li>
            <li> and I have saved so much money by doing so.</li>
            <li> This clipper cuts fast, close and doesn&#x27;t clog up.</li>
            <li> Never realized how much time I was wasting before.  </li>
            <li> This was confirmed by our local barber.</li>
            <li> And to think, we spent $125 (with shipping) to still not be able to cut hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Fading is easily accomplished.</li>
            <li> So I went and paid for this real clipper an a 000 blade to do it myself.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Thanks Oster company for offering online 15 min.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny, if you want to save your time and money and give yourself a professional look this is a must have.</li>
            <li> i use this product regularly at work so it is important to have a quality tool and not to go with out it also.</li>
            <li> It cuts very well , I just wish that it would have included the # 2 metal guard :</li>
            <li> really like it though.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Also, I found it much easier to handle than some of the reviews suggested.    </li>
            <li> Cuts and cleans with no problems and is always ready for me, my brother, or my dad to use when needed.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon  Heather</li>
            <li> but it is definitely heaver than cheap plastic ones.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my hair with clippers for almost 10 years now and this is the BEST clipper I ever had.</li>
            <li> it can get away from you fast.</li>
            <li> So much so that I have been told this by a barber.</li>
            <li> This clipper works very well.</li>
            <li> As I know how to fix clippers I pulled out the guts gently to see what the problem was.</li>
            <li> Thanks a lot dudes.</li>
            <li> Spend the money, get what real barbers use.</li>
            <li> I used the 00000 blades that I bought separately for $20 and they shave very close.</li>
            <li> really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well you might say, $120 is a bit much for a hair clippe, and I would say, lets talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With these I can literally goes as fast as I want.</li>
            <li> I like this replacement very well.  </li>
            <li> This is the Harley Davidson of hair clippers: old fashioned, sturdy, and outrageously powerful.</li>
            <li> Definitely a real machine and No wonder</li>
            <li> In summary, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;--They cut the hair like butter, they cut fast and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;--Powerful mortar that works</li>
            <li> He really loves them.</li>
            <li> then you really just need one.</li>
            <li> The cut is much smoother and quicker than with the cheaper units.</li>
            <li> so I told her if she messed up, I&#x27;ll just shave my whole head...</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re doing fades without a Fast Feed you&#x27;ll want the 0A blade also at a minimum.</li>
            <li> So finally the light came on</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like I getting much of the lubricant (provided) into the tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I prefer the length of a #2 size blade, which is available, but will set you back another $25 or so, sold separately.</li>
            <li> And very durable....</li>
            <li> Get the job done fast if you know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> clippers come with a very generous tube of oil for the blade and a tube of grease for the motor.</li>
            <li> Very efficient and one swipe does it.</li>
            <li> Cuts fast and thorough.</li>
            <li> I would suggest to Oster that they come out with a 000000 blade to accomodate those of us who are seeking a very close cut.</li>
            <li> I can now cut my hair much faster.  </li>
            <li> but they worked really well.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Got here fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not noisy and the iron clipper are very durable.</li>
            <li> After much research I ended up with this 76 model.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was much quieter too.</li>
            <li> The blades are excellent and the cutting effortless.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say it made it much easier for me.</li>
            <li> three &amp; often a whole collection are sold together.</li>
            <li> I highly recomend these over the $20 ones that you have to replace every year!</li>
            <li> bought a size 00000 blade also so to get a very close cut (almost shaved but not quite).  </li>
            <li> I thought they would blow through the hair much easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering getting #0000 or #00000 blades as I like it real close (waited to see how close the #000 blade that comes with the set was).</li>
            <li> STILLLL cuts my head smooth bald with no problem...very quiet and never had any problems at all..</li>
            <li> Even my clients noticed the difference, said the clipper cut was much smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bald and like to wear the hair I do have very close to the scalp, like .5-1.0mm, so I trim it weekly.</li>
            <li> After much thought and research (and a $100 Amazon gift card from my mother-in-law), I went with the Oster 76.</li>
            <li> Purchased there clippers to give myself a buzz cut two years ago and they are still cutting awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my home to last longer than the cheap ones.  </li>
            <li> They have plenty of power and produce a very even cut.</li>
            <li> and he is very satisfy with it</li>
            <li> and it was ready for use which I used for a non-profit fundraiser.  </li>
            <li> I use the 00000 blade and it cuts really close.</li>
            <li> He really loves them.  </li>
            <li> My husband has been using this hair clipper now for some months, really likes it  and finds it very durable.  </li>
            <li> The one 1 blade and the triple 000 blade are equivalent to the adjustable clipper in the opend and closed position respectfully.  </li>
            <li> Very powerfull like I said.</li>
            <li> I really like the changable blades vs putting a plastic piece over the blade.</li>
            <li> this my choice to use as this brand is very affordable and dependable</li>
            <li> Should have bought one years ago, fooled around with cheaper clippers that never lasted or worked very well.</li>
            <li> VERY WELL BUILT, WORKS LIKE A CHARM, VERY SATISFIED!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> , they&#x27;re user serviceable (let&#x27;s face it: if you can&#x27;t repair your own clippers you probably shouldn&#x27;t be cutting your own hair anyway</li>
            <li> I only wish there was a step by step pamphlet that came with this and all the multiple trimmer attachments on how to use it effectively.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has anything negative to say about these clippers has no clue what there complaining about, I read a review that stated that these clippers are too pricey and are not as good as clippers a barber would use.</li>
            <li> It is heavy and nicely built.  </li>
            <li> If I had listened to reviewers who said it was heavy, and this and that, I would have missed out in acquiring a nice clipper for my family&#x27;s use, when we can&#x27;t make it to the barber.</li>
            <li> Does get warm after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> It is really good for thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The 76 might hold up better over a long period of time because you can do maintenance on it, but I like the thought of not having to put in new grease -</li>
            <li> The 76 might hold up better over a long period of time because you can do maintenance on it, but I like the thought of not having to put in new grease -</li>
            <li> I find it stays cool and comfortable throughout my cut and that clippings load up less than on the clipper</li>
            <li> My wife used the first one for over 20 years, with no problems, and just wanted a new one.</li>
            <li> Electric cord is about 6 ft long and flexible so it is easy to maneuver with it.</li>
            <li> Well, let me say that after purchasing these clippers it quickly became apparent that these were what I had been searching for after years of frustration.</li>
            <li> 3 stars because my plastic screw part on the left side of the clipper look like someone had tampered other than that the clippers are good but just be care when buying from Amazon..</li>
            <li> and I have on mine, even just using it every other week or so on myself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The A6 doesn&#x27;t seem to cut any better or worse than the Classic 76, but the cooler handle and the (to me) more enjoyable noise level give it the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have on mine, even just using it every other week or so on myself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The A6 doesn&#x27;t seem to cut any better or worse than the Classic 76, but the cooler handle and the (to me) more enjoyable noise level give it the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its only been a few weeks since I&#x27;ve owned it, but it runs quiet, cool and has great torque.</li>
            <li> The clipper was smaller than my mental impression from reading others&#x27;reviews; it fit in my hand nicely, and I liked the little extra heft.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clipper compare with other brands and models.  </li>
            <li> We originally bought \\&quot;cheap-o\\&quot; clippers from a local department store and struggled using them twice.  </li>
            <li> Other than that I was pleased.</li>
            <li> The blade it came with cuts extremely well and for that I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> The #1 mostly for summer, and the #3 for all the other seasons.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always get excited when I seem then in a barbershop which I next to never do unless I want a fade or/and change in contrast.</li>
            <li> opinion is that it is not loud, however, it does sound different than the cheap clippers.  </li>
            <li> Costs 4 times more than other clippers, cuts 10 times faster.&lt;br /&gt;Real</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;d done this originally I would&#x27;ve saved myself the cost of countless haircuts plus the $120.00</li>
            <li> Do not pay attention to most of these other reviews, these people have no idea what they are talking about.</li>
            <li> They seem to be completely rebuild-able if they wear out or break down and they have great solid feel to them.</li>
            <li> As a self-buzzer for nearly 20 years, if I live but one more year, this clipper will essentially pay for itself.  </li>
            <li> No more ear plugs required :) It cost about twice what we paid for the Sassoon clipper, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a easy buzz cut on top, fade in back, with a heavy trim on the ears and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> once i know how to take everything apart and clean it and put it back together ,it has been heaven .</li>
            <li> My Andis T Outlinner cuts much closer than the Oster Classic 76.</li>
            <li> As far as some of the negitive reviews, they are not as loud as the cheap $30 ones, yes they have a little more weight to them</li>
            <li> other thing I like is that this product is still made in USA - thanks Oster.&lt;br /&gt;Please create more jobs back in the USA by bringing more of your manufacturing in China back to North America.</li>
            <li> It is superior to the standard buzzers with combs that one buys for less price.</li>
            <li> The metal blade guides are a huge step up from the cheap plastic guides and dull blades and replacement blade sets are reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I really like the Classic 76 and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Changing guides on a 000 blade - cheaper but not nearly close or accurate of a cut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They operate smoothly and they have a long cord.</li>
            <li> I had been using cheap clippers in the $50 range for a long time.</li>
            <li> The clipper is professional quality and it is exactly what my barber uses.  </li>
            <li> I have cut my own hair for several years and after using an inexpensive Wahl clipper I decided to spend the extra money on a professional clipper.  </li>
            <li> A true standard prized by barbers and stylists alike.</li>
            <li> imagine the opening Basic Training haircut scene from Full Metal Jacket.....</li>
            <li> If you are putting off the purchase because you are not sure about the quality of the clipper or the ease of use or what you will look like with this kind of \\&quot;haircut,\\</li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t used professional clippers before (this is my first time), follow these tips:&lt;br /&gt;Do</li>
            <li> Now when I cut my hair, I get that consistent, even professional look that would get from coming out of the barber shop.</li>
            <li> Well first off the oster Is defenitly louder however it&#x27;s not overly loud.</li>
            <li> Use it regularly for full body trimming/grooming.  </li>
            <li> So for about $150 I can cut my hair whenever I want with great equipment that will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I thought it worked better than the cheap ones you buy in local stores but a little to high in price.</li>
            <li> It can get warm, again to be expected but nothing that would cause concern or have you stop to wait for cool down.</li>
            <li> The Classic 76 appears to be a real solid clipper and is probably great for many hair cutting tasks.</li>
            <li> I have had other popular brand name clippers that didn&#x27;t last long and became misaligned easily.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little on the heavy side, but you can tell these clippers are built with incredible quality.</li>
            <li> As this was my first hair clipper I reviewed the many reviews made by purchasers of both other brands and their models as well as Osters models and found the Classic 76 to have the best reviews with the least negative reviews.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Got this for my other half on his bday and he loves it, this is a great gift for a man.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast brand new in box</li>
            <li> /&gt;It continues to run like it&#x27;s new to this very day.&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> Sure, you can buy four pairs of cheap clippers for the same price, but they won&#x27;t work anything like these or last very long.</li>
            <li> Used it 2 more times, sound got worse.</li>
            <li> Oh wait maybe, hot is relative, i can feel it hot</li>
            <li> The Oster Classic 76 is the \\&quot;Cadillac\\&quot; of clippers.</li>
            <li> Finally, unlike most magnetic clippers, the Oster 76 clipper has parts that wear with regular use and must be replaced:</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands of clippers and have been totally spoiled with these!  </li>
            <li> After some research (looking to see what the barber was using, and reading reviews), I bought a classic 76.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> /&gt;Some things that stood out to me after getting the A6 and comparing it to the Classic 76:&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> We reviewed some consumers appraisal&#x27;s on the Oster Classic 76 and decided to bite the bullet and spend the money for the Oster.  </li>
            <li> The Oster Classic 76&#x27;s cut through hair like butter.</li>
            <li> All in all, this was an expensive initial purchase, but the money and time savings are priceless.</li>
            <li> 5 years ago I switched to the Oster Classic 76.</li>
            <li> With Oster Classic, the guards are steel.</li>
            <li> I received the Classic 76 hair clipper.</li>
            <li> Manufactured to feel and work like the classic 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s clippers.</li>
            <li> And now that im older</li>
            <li> Bought an Oster 76 Classic clipper, along with a #1.5 and #2 blade for haircut purposes.  </li>
            <li> only downside to these clippers that I can see is that they are substantially larger and heavier than most hair clippers, so if you work with them for a prolonged period, I can see how these might become fatiguing.</li>
            <li> the package for which blades come with the Classic 76.</li>
            <li> I wanted a clipper to buy to replace my older cheaper ones.  </li>
            <li> The Classic is a must have.</li>
            <li> For the Classic 76</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s extremely expensive hairdresser described these clippers as \\&quot;the best money can buy.\\&quot;  Enough said.</li>
            <li> Well, it applies to the Oster Classic 76 clipper.</li>
            <li> Even worse, in order to get a good clean cut, I had to go over the same spot so many times that it could end up taking a half hour to clip my hair.  </li>
            <li> With proper maintenance &amp; cleaning I can tell they will last many years to come.</li>
            <li> a quick cut, small dog, or not a close cut, these are fine.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try the Oster Classic 76</li>
            <li> This oster classic motor clipper worked wonders for me.</li>
            <li> After so many years with cheap buzzers, I didn&#x27;t even realize how poorly they cut.</li>
            <li> Since I save so much cutting my own hair, I decided to invest in a better clipper.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Oster Classic 76</li>
            <li> I am able to cut my hair with the smaller blade while I cut my son&#x27;s hair with the larger blade.  </li>
            <li> These are Classic Oster 76 Clippers..........</li>
            <li> I guarantee you wont regret buying the oster classic 76</li>
            <li> Gave  his older clippers to our brother in law</li>
            <li> Terrific and does not overheat quickly using the blade cooler lubricant.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a Classic.  </li>
            <li> My barber had been using the Classic 76</li>
            <li> also purchased a Wahl Echo trimmer as a companion to the Classic 76 (facial hair, quick neck trims, etc.)</li>
            <li> Classic 76 was about $100, Wahl Echo was $42 and the 0000 blade was $20.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my hair since I was in Jr. High School (over 20 years), and the Oster Classic 76 is by far the best set of clippers I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Oster Classic 76.</li>
            <li> (This is good as unfortunately these clippers do got hot to the touch much faster than cheaper models as well.)&lt;br /&gt;Time</li>
            <li> You can tell they are very high quality clippers ... very strong sharp blades that will last forever...</li>

            <li> It runs a bit hot and can be loud, and it&#x27;s not a small set of clippers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for nearly a year now, after using cheap ones previously, and these are worth every cent.  </li>
            <li> They seemed to work fine, but having nothing to compare it to the blades seemed to move at a slower speed than I expected from the appearance of the motor.  </li>
            <li> well done guys easy fast reliable just back when needed again,, hopefully furthest possible</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re all done in little more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I feel that in my situation, going to any of the box-store hair places is of little value for the price that you pay for the service and the tip on top of it.</li>
            <li> It is a little heavier than most because the motor is heavy-duty and won&#x27;t overheat.  </li>
            <li> This thing is a beast, and is probably a little overkill for most people including me.  </li>
            <li> The cutters are sharp and can be easily replaced.</li>
            <li> This clipper goes through my tough beard like a hot knife through warm butter.  </li>
            <li> The Oster76 clipper is easy to operate, the blades are easy to change and it is very efficient and powerful when it comes to cutting hair.</li>
            <li> The unit is very sturdy--a professional unit of high quality, and you get what you pay for.  </li>
            <li> The standard #00 and #1 blades that come with the clippers are great, but both are a little too short for my liking.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this, the interchangeable blades are key for me and the little bit of maintenance I will need to do over the long-term will be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The Oster 76 is very powerful and is very effective at removing lots of hair fast without bogging down and seizing up like some magnetic clipper will when over tasked with thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> large and a bit heavy; the size doesn&#x27;t bother me, but most female stylists avoid these due to wrist strain.&lt;br /&gt;--color scheme; they are called classic for a reason, but that burgundy is not my favorite  NOTE:</li>
            <li> though no where near as much as it took me to maintain my straightedge).</li>
            <li> My fiancé likes them so much that he tossed his old beard trimmer and just uses this.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent on cheap clippers over the years.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money, especially if you cut/</li>
            <li> Its a bit more heavy, than the $29 brand, thats</li>
            <li> Normally it would take me 30 to 40 minutes to cut my hair and beard then shave the remaining stubble</li>
            <li> Normally my wife is the hair cutter.  </li>
            <li> From the moment you plug and click on this product, listsen to it&#x27;s motor, you began to regret all the dollars wasted on cheaper versions, you deserve better, you deserve Rolls Royce.    </li>
            <li> Ive been cutting my own hair for a few years now and owned andis masters which are pretty good also,and</li>
            <li> Would have been better off buying a few cheaper&lt;</li>
            <li> I shave my whole head and like it pretty short</li>
            <li> Rarely have to go over the same spot twice with these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped it more than a few times, and it keeps on running.</li>
            <li> The only better one that I&#x27;m aware of is essentially the same machine in a metal case.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m critical and Five Star reviews are rare.  </li>
            <li> Some have said that it is heavy, but I don&#x27;t think it is any heavier than a Mopar gear reduction starter :-) .  </li>
            <li> is this normal?</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t think this is a normal feature...</li>
            <li> Why doesn&#x27;t Oster make the gear out of a more heavy duty plastic or metal?</li>
            <li> The cord is heavy duty and should last long, the retro style is just beautiful.</li>
            <li> Iw on&#x27;t waste my money on cheap clippers again!</li>
            <li> You get better at it once you&#x27;ve done it a few times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did get too hot to the touch once, so we just put it down, let it cool off for a hour, and resumed the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only use them for myself and they make the job so easy I actually have fun giving myself basic haircuts.</li>
            <li> These clippers show up the other day, heavy, which is good, soundly constructed, will more than likely work till I&#x27;m way past the need for them, and made in the USA.</li>
            <li> They do give you a perfect clip without the dumb little plastic combs.</li>
            <li> I have an Oster classic that&#x27;s over 15 years old!</li>
            <li> There are other models, from Oster and others, in this same price range that might be more appropriate for the average person.</li>
            <li> easy to use, cutting my own hair for the 1st time in my life</li>
            <li> This cut my home haircutting time by more than half compared to my old clippers.</li>
            <li> clip my own hair and the only issue that is a slight hassle is the cord getting in the way.&lt;br /&gt;As for noise.  </li>
            <li> It is seriously solid and will easy last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel the motor was strong enough to the point where I couldn&#x27;t properly maintain my grip.  </li>
            <li> personal/home use its probably a little too much; in retrospect I should have focused on something more portable and easier to manage, as I just use it to shave my own head (and face, when I&#x27;m too lazy to properly shave).&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> So, recently I purchased the #2 blade and it is just about right.    </li>
            <li> I have ended up throwing them away after a short time, they just quit or do not cut my hair right anymore.  </li>
            <li> I can put this right next to my ear</li>
            <li> I bought an extra set of brushes right off the bat for a couple bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Very solid construction, clean cutting lines and great steel</li>
            <li> The Oster 76 is the only hair clipper I would use, I have tried many others but the Oster provides a better cut with less maintenance than any other clipper</li>
            <li> Fit right in the hand, not that big like other mention.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After finding the manufacturer&#x27;s full retail price online, we then shopped around locally and found the local retail stores including a &#x27;discount hair supply store&#x27; were selling ABOVE the full retail price.</li>
            <li> I used to cut my hair with #2 blades on all sides for the longest time (7+ years), then about 3 months ago, I decided to let my hair grow a bit and get a professionally done haircut(short on sides, a bit long on the top), I had to get that same haircut once a month</li>
            <li> Not a buzzing \\&quot;hum\\&quot; like the other cheap versions, but a machine-like whirl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other machines and even when they work just as well, they somehow manage to feel cheap.</li>
            <li> I also like looking pretty much the same all the time as far as the length of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I cut my own hair and ask my wife to trim up the back a little afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Clippers are new as stated..  </li>
            <li> and it was brand new.</li>
            <li> The new set cuts like butter</li>
            <li> I live in Calgary, Alberta Canada and they sell this clipper here for $269 so way cheaper to purchase it on line.</li>
            <li> when new.    </li>
            <li> I should probably look into buying a new set, but why would I bother when they are still working?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> you get a new one</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s like new until the motor goes on you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product was delivered on time via Canada Post and with no added cost even though I live in Canada</li>
            <li> have it break and then have to spend 145.00 for a new one.</li>
            <li> you, I bought these clippers brand new</li>
            <li> And now I have to buy a new pair.</li>
            <li> The clippers arrived on time and brand new, just as described.  </li>
            <li> If you drop it, don&#x27;t screw around - just buy a new blade.</li>
            <li> I live on 240v so have to run through a converter</li>
            <li> received the new clippers and upon taking them out of the box I knew they were quality.</li>
            <li> But when it started to wear out, I decided to get a new unit instead of just replacing the blades.</li>
            <li> The clippers were new in a sealed box.</li>
            <li> Leave the clipper running to snap the new clipper head into place</li>
            <li> Everyone I work with that use wahls or andis are having to buy new clippers twice as often.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the new 76.</li>
            <li> new-</li>
            <li> came to the reviews section to verify that the retailer was legit and clippers were brand new.</li>
            <li> I have coarse hair and the detachable gaurds are a huge plus for low haircuts.</li>
            <li> With my husband in the military and my son wanting the same haircut as his dad, we&#x27;ve gone through many sets of drug store clippers.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of a time when American products were built to last,  a time before light weight plastic and flimsy imports were the norm.&lt;br</li>
            <li> fast shipping;does a great job on cutting hair.</li>
            <li> It is also more quiet than I expected for a plug-in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found myself having to constantly go over the same spots with the cheap clippers.</li>
            <li> B00070E8LA Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper]]</li>
            <li> I have used the oster classic 76 hair clipper for years , it holds up to every day professional use.  </li>
            <li> Have been using cheap clippers for years of cutting my own hair, should have stepped up to this sooner.</li>
            <li> THAT SAY THIS CLIPPER IS VERY LOUD.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a professional device and is high quality.</li>
            <li> A very professional set of clippers.  </li>
            <li> the very near future.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the blades are easy to change and last a long time.</li>
            <li> I expected more power would mean more noise, but I was happily surprised that these clipppers are actually far quieter than the old ones I had been using.</li>
            <li> I researched for a long time trying to decide on which pair of clippers was worth the investment.  </li>
            <li> Secondly, the machine gets extremely hot, to the point where I&#x27;m scared of holding it.  </li>
            <li> Wow!     </li>
            <li> After getting tired of spending more on my dogs than my whole family for haircuts, I decided to purchase a real clipper and see if I could groom the dogs myself.  </li>
            <li> it simply doesn&#x27;t matter... like a hot knife through butter, but easier than that.  </li>
            <li> I finally decided to try a higher end model to see what the difference would be.</li>
            <li> Glad I took the more expensive plunge finally!</li>
            <li> If you look for a really short hair cut, this machine is pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s hardly a substitute for a skilled barber&#x27;s haircut, but using the Oster Classic 76 is as close to it as you can get.</li>
            <li> After my first cut, I wanted my hair to grow back, just so I could do it again.</li>
            <li> You can tell from the first cut that these are well above the rest in quality and reliability.  </li>
            <li> Over the past 30 years I have used many cheaper sets of hair clippers...</li>
            <li> and it actually cuts better than the other brand did when it worked.</li>
            <li> This is the exact same size as my $20 clipper was.</li>
            <li> Perhaps should have sent it back for an exchange as it gets hot.</li>
            <li> but I saw it running into the same issues as the first set</li>
            <li> Sure it is no where around the $30 price tag like other machines, but it will last you a life time if you take care of it.</li>
            <li> only reason I gave this thing 3 stars is because it gets REALLY hot after 5-10 minutes of use.</li>
            <li> My dad bought a 76 several years ago before they started to put CLASSIC 76 in big bold letters and the thing is indestructible, its been used and dropped and used again and it still works.</li>
            <li> I bought my first pair two years when I began working at the salon, along with the necessary blades.</li>
            <li> I usually shave my head and wear a +/-3 day beard most of the time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend replacing all your blades when you buy a new clipper because in my experience the old blades make the new clipper wear out faster.</li>
            <li> Now, on to the brief review: The Classic 76 in our household has been running for over three years now, without so much as a hiccup.</li>
            <li> I only used the 000 to clean up my neck, back, butt...</li>
            <li> My older former Marine coworker also bought a pair at my recommendation and he absolutely loves them.  </li>
            <li> so those cheap clippers would always bog down but not the Oster.  </li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve purchased -- and only because the one I originally purchased in 1988 finally gave up the ghost (my own fault -- I twisted &amp; folded the power cord one too many times and it eventually split open).  </li>
            <li> The Oster classic 76 is an amazing pair of clippers like others I&#x27;ve purchased previous clippers from the big retailers for between $30 and $50 only to have to replace after a couple years because they are warn out or just don&#x27;t cut anymore.  </li>
            <li> though I don&#x27;t know how warm relative to other clippers, this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Over that decade, Wahl&#x27;s manufacturing standards dropped dramatically, and the brand new one wasn&#x27;t even close to the old one.</li>
            <li> Using the blades (instead of combs) yields a very smooth-looking cut that does not pinch the hair as long as one doesn&#x27;t slide the buzzer too fast.</li>
            <li> This clipper should last you a lifetime, a true commercial grade clipper.</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you are at the point that you would choose to now go and have it all at one size, your hair, then this is breat, just get a detachable blade, a size that you like, try Andis since they also make sizes that apparently are not available by Oster, and just make sure that it fits, and then you can save yourself anywhere between $5-20 per cut, so if you go once a month to a barber</li>
            <li> I was worried about this when I first got the 00000&#x27;s, but the only time I&#x27;ve cut myself is when I ran the clippers directly into my ear.  </li>
            <li> Every year I buy at least two cheap hair clippers that end up burning out - I live in a large household that uses them a lot.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed by how much faster my hair cut went, no more running over the same area over and over to make sure it looks even.  </li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and this is my 2nd pair in 25 years just love oster clippers they last a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this trimmer will last at least 10 years.</li>
            <li> Its a little heavier than the cheap Wahl units but not excessively so</li>
            <li> Average clippers come with a magnetic motor which, when activated, generate the familiar clipper &#x27;hum&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It gets hot after a few minutes of use, but that&#x27;s pretty normal for clippers.</li>
            <li> These are heavy and the switch may be fragile, but the motor is powerful and the blades run cool.  </li>
            <li> I found that it is not very hard to self-administer the cut.</li>
            <li> The ONLY challenge is to slightly taper the 1/2 inch sides with the 3/4 inch top</li>
            <li> I attribute this less to my skills and more to the fact that the Oster 76 and the blades work terrific.  </li>
            <li> note is that this clipper would be very hard to use if I was trying to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> Very easy to change cutting blade and clean after using.</li>
            <li> They slice through our hair with ease and only require minimal oiling maintenance to keep them going strong thus far.  </li>
            <li> Certainly a tier above the cheapo $20 hair clipper sets you see.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although they certainly aren&#x27;t the quality they used to be the Oster 76&#x27;s are still the standard in the barber business.</li>
            <li> My next purchase in this category will certainly be a battery-option.</li>
            <li> The cheap ones always seemed to break after little use.  </li>
            <li> I think the key to keeping this thing going for a long time is to clean it often and add in plenty of lubricant to protect it from rust and wear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Blades are super sharp and the hair falls away with no resistance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking like your arm will be tired, more a little more cumbersome.  </li>
            <li> but they are professional, and finally the do get a little warm, but not enough to bother or concern me.  </li>
            <li> Works great for cutting hair.</li>
            <li> These clippers are smooth running, quiet, and super clean cutting.  </li>
            <li> After 10 minutes it will become warm but not so much that will feel uncomfortable on your skin.</li>
            <li> The cord or plug is clearly defective.  </li>
            <li> Flip the heavy-duty ON switch and the difference is clear.</li>
            <li> They are clearly quality through and through.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s being used in professional barber shops.</li>
            <li> This is by far a must for all barbers.</li>
            <li> The attachment system, for attaching different size clipper blades works very well, just pull up in the clipper blade(s) and then remove.</li>
            <li> This is obviously professional grade.  </li>
            <li> Loud?</li>
            <li> Another disadvantage the Oster 76 is that the blade attachments cut at a fixed length and are not adjustable like the Andis Master ML or the Wahl Senior.</li>
            <li> The only downside is they don&#x27;t really work as a beard trimmer</li>
            <li> I have gone thru dozens of $30 to $40 clippers over the years and finally invested in the real deal.</li>
            <li> From the time I&#x27;ve owned this clipper, I would have replaced 2 or 3 cheaper ones, which would bring me to nearly the price of one of these.</li>
            <li> It was loud and pulled hair from the get go.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quieter than my old ConAir clipper.  </li>
            <li> That box will be well out of the way if you use this professionally, though&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a blade swing out accidentally on my 76, but I can imagine a clipper getting bumped during professional use, so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a blade swing out accidentally on my 76, but I can imagine a clipper getting bumped during professional use, so</li>
            <li> These are professional hair clippers and quality made.</li>
            <li> You have to make sure you maintain it properly with oil and brushing and such, but it&#x27;s not much.</li>
            <li> We had also purchased a set of the plastic guide combs at the same time, which work very well.</li>
            <li> Undoubtedly a King of all clippers and professional barbers recommended.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money in cheap plastic clippers.</li>
            <li> If you want a professional hair cut you have to use a professional&#x27;s tools.</li>
            <li> Oster is fundamental to producing professional hair cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plastic</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste money on cheap models that will wear out too soon.    </li>
            <li> Professional grade and</li>
            <li> Effortless, I cut my hair in a fraction of the time it took me with my old clippers.</li>
            <li> Also, since these are professional clippers, you must maintain them and keep the blades lubed at all times.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give the 5 stars is styling (it must really have been designed in 1976) and weight.</li>
            <li> I had a pair identical to these in the early sixties .</li>
            <li> is like having a professional at home.</li>
            <li> Finally bought this clipper about 4 mos ago after going through a couple of cheap Wahl clippers ($30 clippers) over the last several yrs.</li>
            <li> I thought they could be fixed with clipper grease.</li>
            <li> 24 months is just the amount of time of the old phone plans, so thats it</li>
            <li> I think it was designed using the old Harley Davidson theory of engineering.</li>
            <li> The old one I had tended to jerk out a whisker every now and then causing me to yelp like a puppy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They can get hot to hold when on for long periods of time.  </li>
            <li> and it is not overly loud like others i have used that scare the hell out of my son.</li>
            <li> My old Oster electrical cord quit working</li>
            <li> And I really expect these to last longer than I do.  </li>
            <li> Those didn&#x27;t cut nearly as well as these, and didn&#x27;t have replaceable blades, so they didn&#x27;t cut as close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The buzzer is fairly loud with the fan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1)The \\&quot;76\\&quot; is far quieter and smoother than any of the others</li>
            <li> The blade I use for shaving: Oster Professional 76918-006 Replacement Clipper Blade, Size 00000</li>
            <li> This clipper is a professional tool.  </li>
            <li> No doubt professional quality.</li>
            <li> It works seamless.</li>
            <li> but its mostly the center where above the handle and below the actual razor heads</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the clipper of choice.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time on those cheap buzzers .In</li>
            <li> They seem about the same as my last pair of cheap clippers, actually.  </li>
            <li> So far, these clippers are everything that they claim to be.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> and I want the closest cut I can get from a trimmer as my skalp is too sensitive for a blade or an electric face shaver.</li>
            <li> the years I&#x27;ve invested in Oster stainless steel blades (9 different blades).&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> No hair-salons, no wasted time, no fuss.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to go over thek same areas as much to get</li>
            <li> professional quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i would recommend it to anyone for home or professional use.</li>
            <li> This is a professional piece of gear - and it shows.</li>
            <li> Maybe it would be in continuous, professional use.  </li>
            <li> but if I were a professional I&#x27;d be buying these.</li>
            <li> and it is a truly a professional hair clipper.</li>
            <li> you know that they are professional grade.</li>
            <li> I returned to oster under warranty and they fixed it.</li>
            <li> If you are looking a clipper for home or professional use</li>
            <li> It may be loud for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Get one professional grade clipper</li>
            <li> Pull the trigger on the Professional comb set while you&#x27;re at it.</li>
            <li> One thing with professional clippers like these is that the blades are wider than what I was used to with cheaper clippers/trimmers, so they don&#x27;t seem to &#x27;hug&#x27; your head as well while clipping, but you can get used to it.</li>
            <li> Wow, compared to the Store brand models this thing can cut.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Those reviews however are completely mistaken.</li>
            <li> When I go into the barbers my hair will jam up their clippers.. which always causes them to go \\&quot;wow</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a professional stylist</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been clipping my hair pretty short for the past 8 years or so, always using a set of cheap Wahl clippers.</li>
            <li> But the first look in the mirror revealed the quality I&#x27;ve been wanting for so long.</li>
            <li> This is a professional quality clipper.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I decided to stop spending money to have my dogs hair cut by a professional and do it myself.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny,my hair cant grow fast enuff, want to use them everyday.</li>
            <li> it was well worth the money I spent on it.</li>
            <li> I know they are a bit more expensive than others, but trust me, they are well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money spent.  </li>
            <li> My husband cuts his own hair once a week and his facial hair at least twice a week.  </li>
            <li> , they are on the more expensive side, but the quality is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> They are big and noisy, but that is because they need to be powerful, They last for years and years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They mostly just pulled my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> def worth every penny and saved me money over the long run from having to constantly buy cheap broke down clippers..</li>
            <li> They cut through my hair so smoothly and quickly that at first I didn&#x27;t think they were cutting at all.</li>
            <li> They are large though, so if you&#x27;re using them on your own, be prepared for some awkward angles/configurations because they&#x27;re pretty big to control with one hand while looking in a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a lot of Wahls over the years, but decided to take a new approach after the last one broke with less than a year of light use.</li>
            <li> I expect it to last forever but even if it doesnt the extra cost is worth it if for no other reason than saving the aggrivation of using the cheap retail models which get stuck and jammed and are hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I normally never write reviews about a product, but have to say that I had this clipper since I was 22 years (1992) old for my first dog and wanted to save money on grooming.  </li>
            <li> My 7-year-old son was unhappy to get his buzz cut from a standard buzzer with combs, but he&#x27;s happy to get his hair cut now with the Oster Classic 76.</li>
            <li> After a few years of use, the cable broke internally because you had to kink it at one particular spot every time you wanted to fit it in the provided case.</li>
            <li> The previous Oster cool vibes just didn&#x27;t perform.</li>
            <li> They are very heavy and bulky, and get very HOT when used for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I decided to ante up for the Osters after going through at least one set of cheap clippers a year with pretty low usage.</li>
            <li> They get hot a little to fast though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey when compared to other clippers but its worth the investment.</li>
            <li> exhaust fan, powerful, and extremely user-friendly.  </li>
            <li> I have lots of thick hair and the cheap clippers just bind up, get hot, make a ton of noise, and constantly miss hair.  </li>
            <li> On first use, no more than 15 minutes in, the motor started sounding funny.</li>
            <li> After 40 years of trimming hair and beard wth the 20.00 cheapies Finally bought a Pro trimmer Oster Classic 76.  </li>
            <li> Buy the Oster Classic 76 and have a lasting product.</li>
            <li> After years of paying a barber to cut his hair, my husband gave in to the chidings of his brother and a friend to buy the same clipper used by barbers, the Oster Classic 76, to begin using it to cut his hair at home.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re newer to cutting hair and it takes you a while to get the job done, be warned that these clippers do get pretty warm.  </li>
            <li> My Classic 76 has already paid for itself in the short time I have had it.  </li>
            <li> After Years of riding the fence, I finally made the plunge and bought the Classic 76 series.</li>
            <li> I researched high and low and finally bought the Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 clippers about 2 years ago</li>
            <li> Not long ago, I got a new clipper for my dog</li>
            <li> My previous several years experience with cheap $30-$40 clippers was that they were always the exact opposite of the Oster&#x27;s current performance.</li>
            <li> Cut clean and without having to do another pass over that I would have to do because my other clippers would have left some stays standing.  </li>
            <li> Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It made such a high pitched whine</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers because they had such high ratings.  </li>
            <li> This is the same clipper my barber used when I was in high school and college</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these clippers for home and of course commercial use.</li>
            <li> In comparison to other clipper sets I have owned, the Oster Classic has an easy &#x27;flip open&#x27; blade holder that facilitates simple cleaning without having to unscrew a back plate.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d have plunked down the $100-ish dollars the first time!  </li>
            <li> Although it is more expensive than some other hair clippers, we both appreciate the quality of the product, the fact that it&#x27;s US made and how easy it is to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To me, the lower pitch noise, cooler running handle, added button for blade release, and no need to grease it put the A6 a bit ahead of the Classic 76 to me - but not so far that I&#x27;d highly recommend one model over the other.  </li>
            <li> To me, the lower pitch noise, cooler running handle, added button for blade release, and no need to grease it put the A6 a bit ahead of the Classic 76 to me - but not so far that I&#x27;d highly recommend one model over the other.  </li>
            <li> It was barely hanging on and fell completely off when I tried to turn he unit off.</li>
            <li> Also do not plan on traveling with these, they weight a ton and are way to big for normal use.</li>
            <li> This was a pretty big initial money layout, but has saved me several hundred dollars thus far on haircuts for my three young boys.  </li>
            <li> Like many people here I have been cutting my own hair for a few years and using clippers from Walmart with the plastic</li>
            <li> On the first pass I didnt even realize I had cut anything as there was absolutely no resistance.</li>
            <li> Because of the long hours, a new baby, and little free time we bought these so my wife could do my weekly haircuts</li>
            <li> had 2 little wires holding the blade on and they snapped quickly.</li>
            <li> I like my hair as short as possible without shaving and this certainly does the trick.  </li>
            <li> I finally spent a little more money for the Oster 76.  </li>
            <li> It is a little heavier than the cheap clippers and it does have a larger circumference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Classic 76 flat out gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> Also, all my inexpensive clippers worked via a vibrating magnet drive, which would hold a good setting for a little while, but then drift off and either stop cutting or get super loud.    </li>
            <li> After using the cheap clippers from the local drug store, not to mention having to buy new ones every year, I finally broke down and spent the money on some real clippers.</li>
            <li> I recently acquired a new puppy (Yorkie) and I am planning to groom her myself again.  </li>
            <li> However I live out of the country and don&#x27;t want to take it back and forth with me when I return to the States, so I decided to buy another pair to keep there.</li>
            <li> Second pair , this new one is the Strongest clipper ive ever had&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It is obviously very durable and the blade lasts a very long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several sets of cheap $30 to $40 clippers, but all of them died after a few years.  </li>
            <li> the only part that worries me a little is that the clippers get really hot really fast.</li>
            <li> Only downside is that they do get pretty warm after continuous cutting 30 plus minutes.</li>
            <li> And, as in the tradition of the Tool Man, I promptly unplugged it and took it all apart to get a glimpse of the source of its apparent power and precision buzz!</li>
            <li> The major difference between these is the motor type.</li>
            <li> This is not a small clipper but you will appreciate its power and simple design.</li>
            <li> the less I would still rate it as 5 stars experience because so far the product is exactly as claimed.</li>
            <li> The motor is plenty strong; it does not slow down even a little when in use on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It will pay for itself in a few haircuts and you will be happy that you spent the extra few dollars.</li>
            <li> The housing is plastic, but does feel beefy, and hope to get many years out of it.&lt;br /&gt;However, there were three things that prevented me from giving a 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;First, the instruction manual that comes with clipper is very poor.</li>
            <li> Thus, if you purchase this clipper, you should keep in mind that there will only be rare instances where the Oster 76 outshines all other clippers.</li>
            <li> That thing is heavy, it is ok if you cut other peoples hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at several other brands, including Andis, Wahl and Panasonic and several other models in this brand and went with this because it seemed to be a middle-of-the-road standard kind of unit that I could probably sell if I didn&#x27;t like it.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as everyone describes - far and away a &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; above Wahl and other lower-class clippers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Heavier and a little thicker than the cheaper models I&#x27;m used to but definitely worth their weight.</li>
            <li> I have bought other clippers in the past but none have had the same kind of power this one does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been clipper cutting my own hair for over 15 years now, and I used these Oster Classic 76 for over two years.</li>
            <li> As I said earlier, the Oster Classic 76 clipper is very solid</li>
            <li> One that cuts smooth doesn&#x27;t pull hair and one that can be sharpened or parts replaced if they become dull.  </li>
            <li> The A6 is quieter on low and medium speeds, but it&#x27;s about the same as the 76 on high speed.</li>
            <li> Feels a little heavy after a while, but is nicely balanced and does heat up quite a bit after continuous use (15-20 minutes); but again, not that big a deal.  </li>
            <li> it is a little big, but aren&#x27;t they all - at least the good ones</li>
            <li> Other limited edition shades are available (for a different price)&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cut is very tight and quick to finish.</li>
            <li> Will never consider those Dollar General clippers ever again.</li>
            <li> family has complained about the sound.  </li>
            <li> I took off a huge thick beard the either day</li>
            <li> We finally got around to using the clippers (unfortunately past the return date) and found that the #000 blade that came with it doesn&#x27;t fit this product.</li>
            <li> They are  very sturdy and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> With these clippers, I think I can get there over the next couple of years - with the old clippers, the kids we rebelling.</li>
            <li> Expect it to last nearly forever.</li>
            <li> the strength of the motor frequently changes as it was running and at one point, the blade actually stopped moving.</li>
            <li> Also when using the #00000 blade, it will cut the hell out of you if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews here, I expected as much.</li>
            <li> So far I used the clipper only once</li>
            <li> A professional grade clipper to last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old clipper finally gave up to justify the purchase.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it is a solid piece of  professional equipment.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the &amp;#34;Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb</li>
            <li> For years I have shaved my head, and for years I have used low quality clippers because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money of the professional stuff.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that loud, myself, but beware of the potential noise.  </li>
            <li> When I read reviews saying this was loud and big</li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially, I found the same clippers at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, but they were ridiculously marked up.  </li>
            <li> I have only used the clippers once so far</li>
            <li> I also bought Oster&#x27;s Professional 10 Universal Comb set to go with this unit.  </li>
            <li> Do not buy them for personal use if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing, again this is a professional clipper made specifically for professionals.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t think that you&#x27;d go wrong with either model.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t think that you&#x27;d go wrong with either model.</li>
            <li> but if you cut your own hair it is silly not to invest in something like this.</li>
            <li> For my small poodle, who gets a full body cut, it&#x27;s a two session job.</li>
            <li> The blade wash Oster sells is kind of expensive.</li>
            <li> a bit heavy but powerful and durable...</li>
            <li> This clipper classic 76 is not new to me, I&#x27;v used them before and have confidence in clippers and Oster company.</li>
            <li> And broke down and paid the higher price</li>
            <li> I had my last one for 4 years and the only reason I got a new one is because the on/off switch got faulty.  </li>
            <li> Not only that: I just recently had to purchase a new blade.</li>
            <li> All you do is turn the clippers off, push the current blade back, pop it up, put on a new one, push it in.    </li>
            <li> you can really feel that these will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> The power cord was similar to that of heavy duty workshop tools and the bold metal name plate/gear cover</li>
            <li> I previously owned a pair of clippers exactly like these, those lasted me five years.</li>
            <li> and it took about half the time to shave his head as it did the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only owned TWO clippers from two different brands prior to getting the Oster Classic 76.  </li>
            <li> The Classic 76 does require some minor maintenance, like oiling the blades, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.  </li>
            <li> This is a fairly large clipper, more suited to cutting someone else&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> We use the Oster Classic 76 for the main cutting and clean up the sideburns, back, and back of the neck with the Oster T-Finisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the Oster Classic 76 is sold in a combination pack with the Oster T-Finisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read</li>
            <li> The 76er is the real deal i dont think any other clipper can match it&#x27;s power and durability.</li>
            <li> These are so much nicer than any other clippers.  </li>
            <li> This will last you a long time, don&#x27;t waste your time buying a cheap one.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it works really well.</li>
            <li> Love it, but a little heavy...</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, and the cheap $30 clippers would always bog down if I tried to take too much in one cut.  </li>
            <li> Not a single problem.</li>
            <li> So when you have to take old shaggy down to \\&quot;High &amp; Tight\\&quot; this is your clipper.</li>
            <li> Great when they work, but when the worm gear goes bad, and you are in the middle of shaving your head...</li>
            <li> If you need to change them just pull the old ones away from Trimmer until the spring snaps open, then it&#x27;s simple no tools needed.</li>
            <li> These are solid and much quieter than I expected.</li>
            <li> I have thick straight hair and this machine cuts without any pulling no matter how fast I go.</li>
            <li> The Oster Classic 76 are high quality clippers, expensive, but will pay for themselves quickly, and should last forever with home use.  </li>
            <li> It runs a little hot</li>
            <li> I am a bit concerned that they run a little hot.</li>
            <li> Gets a little hot</li>
            <li> I thought the 45 watt Oster classic 76 should have no trouble at all, NOT TRUE.  </li>
            <li> You will literally have to rest your arms after cutting for a while.&lt;br /&gt;2-They get too hot very quickly (after 15 minutes).  </li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve have bought them first and saved myself the price of a half dozen lesser quality clippers.</li>
            <li> B001T0HHB0 Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb Set Specially Designed to Fit Oster Clippers]] which is way less expensive than buying all the different cutters.</li>
            <li> I went from using a cheap clipper to this one, why did I ever waste time and energy with any other clippers?</li>
            <li> It does tend to get a bit hot after heavy use (10+ minutes), but nothing that will hinder its performance or your comfort.</li>
            <li> First, a disclaimer: We did not purchase this through Amazon, as they were not available at the time.</li>
            <li> However, it does make a lot of noise, is heavy, gets hot, and doesn&#x27;t have an ergonomic design.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty heavy, but that just means it&#x27;s well built.</li>
            <li> They are heavy and run hot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It takes a few tries to get used to holding the clipper correctly to take care of the whole head, especially while doing the back of the head, but it is not difficult.  </li>
            <li> cuts my thick hair better then any other clippers i tried with ease does not pull at all</li>
            <li> When a barber is telling you that you have thick hair you know it must be true.</li>
            <li> These clippers take down hair like butter and fast.</li>
            <li> in it can quickly damage or dull clippers.                      </li>
            <li> Also the blades change quick so even if one did rust or dull, for $20</li>
            <li> My husband likes to wear his hair in a \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; cut, just like those given to new military recruits.</li>
            <li> I got this clipper after previously owning the Oster fast feed clipper for years.</li>
            <li> Very precise,a little heavy, gets a bit hot towards the end of cut</li>
            <li> They always cut hair good the first few times, then eventually would pull my hair painfully or vibrate louder than a lightsaber on steroids.    </li>
            <li> Not any of those cheap $20-40 ones that ultimately break down and become crappy a few months to a year in.  </li>
            <li> If you compare the number 3,2, and 1 guards between the two clippers you will notice that the oster numbers are actually a little bit longer than the plastic guards, however because they cut so smoothly the hair actually looks a little shorter.</li>
            <li> The blades stay sharp and continue to cut as if they were new.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I&#x27;m the type of person that would buy a new pair of clippers every once</li>
            <li> The 76 Classic became a Classic Failure.  </li>
            <li> but I would certainly like to get a few years out of them before it becomes necessary.</li>
            <li> Cutting your hair with a Oster Classic 76 metal blades is really like a hot knife in butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Used this product for a while now and very much would recommend this to anyone who is interested in skipping the expensive barber</li>
            <li> I am well into my 2nd year with the new one and would never go back to some of the cheaper versions or other products I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> It will cut any kind of hair be it thick, tangled or wet without bogging down or stopping (ouch!).</li>
            <li> Where other clippers would simply bog down and stop cutting, these things effortlessly mow right through, like a knife through warm butter.</li>
            <li> These are amazing I bought them for my boyfriend because he enjoys cutting hair</li>
            <li> Changing blades was another task I expected to be more difficult, but unlike the old clippers I didn&#x27;t even need any tools to remove/replace the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The powerful motor cuts without a tortured squeal when it hits a patch of thick hair as well.    </li>
            <li> the same gear always go bad, I&#x27;ve had many of these over the years and usually I keep an extra gear which can be purchased here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OUV7Z8 - easy enough to replace</li>
            <li> After cutting hair for 2 people, the clipper is already running super hot.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like spending time with wet shaving and normal dry beard shavers</li>
            <li> Super thick, long cord.  </li>
            <li> My last pair was 12 years old, used daily at a salon for 6 years, and used weekly for the other 6 before giving up the ghost.</li>
            <li> Slide the new one in and pop back down into position.</li>
            <li> This is quieter than the clippers they use at the barbershop attached to the vacuum cleaner and even quieter than my electric</li>
            <li> While I was cutting my fathers hair the other day we were talking about how if these clippers were to break we would buy it again without complaining because it is so good</li>
            <li> After verifying allparts and lubrication were in order, I gave myself a high and tight....</li>
            <li> These are great, but heavy, not great for small hands.</li>
            <li> Sometimes if it is a little long the Wahl clippers really struggle and it takes forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews saying these are loud but to me they aren&#x27;t at all.  </li>
            <li> If a typical haircut would take about 20 minutes, this product was barely able to be held properly because of the excessive heat after less than 10 minutes of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I especially like the fact that it contained two clipper heads, one short and one long.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a basic quality piece of equipmet which will last a long time.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d spend the next several days having my wife cut the long hairs that the barber had missed.  </li>
            <li> I am not a professional barber but am a competitive swimmer and have used this product on a regular, nearly daily basis for well over 20 years.  </li>
            <li> The Classic 76 is heavy</li>
            <li> I was waiting impatiently for the classic 76 after hearing it described as the king of clippers.</li>
            <li> The hair on the back of my head is pretty thick</li>
            <li> And think about the $$ you&#x27;re saving in the long run if you&#x27;re cutting your own hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They could also easily jam with thick hair, so early passes had to be done slowly in order to avoid binding the clippers and pulling hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have problems getting the back all even due to the way clippers are shaped this is slightly worse at that becuase of its broad design, but with the extra time it is eaasy to just go over problemareas 2-3 times quickly.</li>
            <li> I use it slightly less often because my boys are old enough to go to the barber, but it still gets used plenty for grooming and touch-ups and it works as well as it did on day 1.</li>
            <li> If you experience too much trouble cutting your own hair, come in and see your barber!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a Forfex FX690cb because it seemed like a less expensive version of the 76&#x27;s but the only really good thing about it was the ceramic blades it came with.</li>
            <li> Overall, my general opinion is that most can get along without them they are not worth the trouble of frequent servicing, loud noise, and having to switch blade attachments to get any variation in cutting lengths.</li>
            <li> Some people have complained that this clipper gets hot.</li>
            <li> This clipper should last a long time.</li>
            <li> or so this thing will do the job in no time flat.</li>
            <li> hope these clippers last a long time as I have heard they have.</li>
            <li> this is a heavy weight professional clipper which I expect will last and last.  </li>
            <li> , it will last me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> It is a quality product and will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long they last.</li>
            <li> I had decided about a year ago to just buzz my hair when I noticed it wasnt going to be long till I had none left.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but I can tell it is going to last for years and years.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, and have cut my own hair for years with wahl and other similar $30-$60 clippers, and I always have to go slow</li>
            <li> These are pretty serious clippers and it really only takes one swipe to cut evenly and it doesn&#x27;t pull at all!  </li>
            <li> The clipper is a little heavy but worth it for the results.</li>
            <li> Few cons: wish it came with a blade that was between the two that came with the buzzer, so will probably have to buy a new size.</li>
            <li> Since I need a new set every few years, I decided to bite the bullet and get these....and let me say, they are not run of the mill.  </li>
            <li> Since the brushes in the motor are replaceable,  these clippers should last me for a VERY long time.</li>
            <li> and they confirmed that something was wrong and to send it back.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That&#x27;s really the only complaint I have about this clipper is the heat.  </li>
            <li> And it is not even half as loud.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only noy necessary, it&#x27;s much harder to do.</li>
            <li> If you take care of them they will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> heavy duty, few hair cuts and you get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li> If you are cutting somebody&#x27;s hair, no problem, but it&#x27;s a little more difficult to cut your own.  </li>
            <li> These are heavy duty, professional clippers that will plow through hair like a laser beam!</li>
            <li> The thing is totally servicable so if parts wear out you can replace them same with the clipper head if it becomes dull just buy a new one which run around $20 or so.  </li>
            <li> After repeatedly forgetting in which house I left my old clippers whenever I got the urge to tame my hair, I decided to just get another one</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m emphasizing my poor care of this product in order to highlight just how much higher quality it is than &amp;#34;that other brand.&amp;#34;  Prior to splurging on this Oster 76 Classic in 2010, I was going through another of  &amp;#34;that other brand&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The revolutions don&#x27;t run tight it runs like an old sewing machine motor.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these clippers to anyone who regularly shaves their head -- they may seem expensive when compared to a $30 set from Walmart, but after you use them just one time you&#x27;ll realize that the cheapie ones are actually far more expensive.</li>
            <li> As a regular head-shaver, I will NEVER go back to any other brand of buzzer, do your research Oster 76 is KING.</li>
            <li> 120 dollars for home use will last you a lifetime and for any barber this clipper will outlast any other clipper in your drawer when taking care of properly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Whether you&#x27;re cutting other people&#x27;s hair or shaving your own head, these clippers are the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 45 watt Oster Classic 76 is not much better.  </li>
            <li> Cutting ones own hair is not easy (especially the back).  </li>
            <li> barbers who are good with mirrors or work on other family members can find a quality range of clip-on guides to help in tapering cuts or in cutting styles to a few (still relatively short business-cut) lengths.</li>
            <li> It was hard to even consider spending so much on a set of clippers</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, the clipper does run a little hot on the handle where you grip it, after a few minutes of use.</li>
            <li> This is the top of the line in hair cutting.</li>
            <li> clipper is fantastic, but expensive.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my family&#x27;s hair for more than 20 years.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t plan on doing that for a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair WAS about 4 inches long and it was cut like butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read before I bought them that they are heavy and loud</li>
            <li> One pair I took to a repair shop that went bankrupt and closed before I could get them back.</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT LOUD AT ALL.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the military and just upgraded from the local superstore cheapo brand.  </li>
            <li> I know this one will always stay aligned and I am hoping it lasts long.</li>
            <li> A sturdy and heavy &#x27;old school&#x27; clipper, it is not water proof, not cordless</li>
            <li> Minor nit -</li>
            <li> and I use clippers all day long.</li>
            <li> i purchased this item a few weeks ago and im like re united with and old dependable friend.</li>
            <li> For $120 I expected them to last longer.</li>
            <li> All of the parts are serviceable and replaceable meaning it will be around for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just kicking myself for waiting this long before getting these.</li>
            <li> Heavy Duty in all respects, professional, maybe</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- supple, long cord &lt;br</li>
            <li> and I think as long as I don&#x27;t drop this</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a professional hair clipper, you have no idea what you&#x27;re missing.</li>
            <li> Hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> Lofty cost, overly loud buzz, and uncommonly heavy weight may put some users off, but that&#x27;s the price I do not regret paying.</li>
            <li> A trained monkey could do it...</li>
            <li> Not much to look at, but solid as a rock.  </li>
            <li> This will save you money in the long run.</li>
            <li> It may wear out but at the rate I&#x27;m using it, its going to take a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a professional barber</li>
            <li> I have been buzzing my head for roughly 10 years with Walmart clippers and have gone through several pairs.</li>
            <li> These clippers are heavy duty and cut like a knife through soft butter.</li>
            <li> If there is a minor downside, I think Oster ought to allow one to pick one or two blades at purchase, rather than packing it with the \\&quot;000\\&quot; and \\&quot;OA\\&quot; types.  </li>
            <li> It is a simple, rotary motor and some heat is expected.  </li>
            <li> a long, long time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> I found them a bit heavy compared to our old clippers</li>
            <li> In the end they just don&#x27;t cut it (if you will excuse the pun)</li>
            <li> I guess if you&#x27;re going to use it all day long</li>
            <li> Comes with a long chord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have maintained the clippers carefully, and they have been used only 6-7 times since being purchased.</li>
            <li> This is the cleanest haircut I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
            <li> After spending $120 on this i expected it to be a pro level hair clipper that will last.</li>
            <li> This hair clippers is simply a heavy duty professional hair cutter.  </li>
            <li> I have not had them long</li>
            <li> They work as expected for a commercial clipper.</li>
            <li> Just as expected arrived earlier than planned</li>
            <li> Will be a fan of this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I waited so long.</li>
            <li> Been cutting hair since college... (not professionally)  Have used Wahls most of the time.  </li>
            <li> does all that is was advertised to do, however, can be very noisy and slow at times.</li>
            <li> Blade moves to slow I can&#x27;t work as fast as I&#x27;m use to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review at a later point and give the low down on that experiment...</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a replacement to a different big brand that let me down in under eight haircuts.</li>
            <li> It is much better than the less expensive rechargeable clippers.  </li>
            <li> I hope they last a long time due the price.</li>
            <li> The included #1 clipper blade that comes with this seems much shorter than other #1 blades I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re serious about cutting your own hair (preferably a buzz cut around size 000), then these clippers are for you !  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this bad boy will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> They are a little awkward for buzzing your own hair.</li>
            <li> give you two oils, but I know that one of the them needs to be applied to the actual clipper portion, but I don&#x27;t know where the other oil is supposed to be applied.  </li>
            <li> As the other reviewers mentioned, this clipper runs quiet and cuts with no problems whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is not even in the same league as the trimmers that you get at Walmart or other stores.</li>
            <li> The construction is solid and the blades will last forever as long as they&#x27;re resharpened every few years.</li>
            <li> Other than that - they are fairly quiet and cut well.</li>
            <li> Maaan, why did I wait so long?!?</li>
            <li> The is low of this item compare to other website</li>
            <li> do not glide smoothly  -Clunky and awkward with a big grip  -Are</li>
            <li> My head was completely dry</li>
            <li> that I have the Classic 76 clipperws, I will never own another pair.  </li>
            <li> If you want a lightweight trimmer for occasional use, stay away - this thing is big, heavy and has an industrial strength AC cord.</li>
            <li> ...after the last few clipper cuts he gave me left me with patches of hairs longer than the others.</li>
            <li> This workhorse of the professional barbershop has everything I need, particularly in this simple package with lubricant and an extra cutting blade.  </li>
            <li> Overall I would recommend this product if you are looking for a reliable heavy duty clipper and don&#x27;t mind the extra size and weight.</li>
            <li> There is not much I can say about this clipper that hasn&#x27;t been said before.&lt;br /&gt;It is heavy, I don&#x27;t think it is all that loud.  </li>
            <li> Cons: can feel a bit heavy after extended hair cutting sessions, and can also get quite warm -</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews say the clippers are to heavy for cutting your own hair</li>
            <li> The one thing to watch for, as in my case, if cutting your own hair, after just finishing cutting my hair myself, my wife walks in and of course notices a mohawk line of hair right down the middle of the back of my head</li>
            <li> The only drawback is its bulkiness which becomes a bit tiresome after long use and the on/off switch is definitely a little on the cheap side that I could see breaking off if I dropped it at some point.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve kept track of how often we&#x27;ve used them, and at this point we&#x27;re past break-even on price considering how much haircuts would have cost, and they show no sign of slowing down.  </li>
            <li> and I had to pay $25 every single time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve not had a single problem in 2 months.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t purchased any additional changeable blades, but purchased some Andis (Nano Single Magnet 66345 set) comb guides</li>
            <li> I have been slightly balding over the last few years and have taken on the task of cutting my own hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i spent the extra money to buy this bad boy.</li>
            <li> I have had Norelco and Panasonic clippers in the past years, both of which have proved to be far inferior compared to this product.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if there is a solution to that, and I doubt I already need parts for it considering I use it for personal use not a professional that uses it daily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much larger and heavier than your average hair clipper</li>
            <li> These clippers are professional clippers but they are now in the hands of an amateur.  </li>
            <li> #1 and #000 detachable Croygen-x blades, blade guard, blade oil, clipper grease, cleaning brush and instruction sheet) and of course the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that prevented the experience from being perfect is that the polystyrene foam packaging was broken and it was very difficult to get rid of the small particles which insisted on sticking to my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My son would always complain that the other clippers hurt or were pulling his hair no matter how slow or gentle I was.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty thin hair</li>
            <li> I tried to find a replacement part, but it&#x27;s a victim of throw-away culture</li>
            <li> You can do a really tight buzz cut or cut your hair long enough</li>
            <li> On the down side, you will need to purchase additional blades or plastic guards since only two blades come with the set.</li>
            <li> After going through our fourth pair of clippers purchased from a store, hubby put his foot down and said we were going to invest in a quality pair of clippers this time.</li>
            <li> and it basically the next size down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the quality that will last decades and be passed down to my children.</li>
            <li> The product is not too heavy or large for me, with small hands, to operate.</li>
            <li> Also the clippers are rather large and bulky, which is a little awkward at first.</li>
            <li> The On/Off switch is a little strange, but positioned on the back where it is less likely to be accidentally tripped.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;2)The \\&quot;76\\&quot; blades are sharp precise cutting instruments that actually cut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> By the way, this clipper is not loud like the cheap home cutting kits that are sold by Wahl or Andis.</li>
            <li> Wet, dry...</li>
            <li> These things: wet, dry it don&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also less convenient to shave as the Oster 76 is very big.</li>
            <li> so I will use them twice a month same as I did with my previous clippers.</li>
            <li> These almost always left me disappointed, and often times in pain since they tend to pull out more hair than they cut.  </li>
            <li> I bought them from Sally&#x27;s, just out of needing them ASAP for a gift, but when I got home and found the same clippers online for over $100 less, I placed my order on with Amazon and returned my purchase from Sally&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> They are so quiet compared to my previous buzzer clippers.</li>
            <li> I have gone through 3 different clippers; Conair lasted less than one month-</li>
            <li> After having owned countless economy clippers that barely make a dent in thick hair I decided to go with these.</li>
            <li> Time spent actually doing the job is also cut down.</li>
            <li> Only bad part is I didn&#x27;t get them sooner and struggled using the cheap ones for so long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;these clippers are so weak that when I try to cut my hair with the grain it doesnt do much</li>
            <li> The down side would be that they are a bit heavy if you are cutting your own hair.  </li>
            <li> Using the typical \\&quot;Brand X\\&quot; type clippers you see in the drug store has been a frustrating experience to say the least, and I&#x27;ve probably tossed 5 of them in as many years.  </li>
            <li> Holding them felt about the same to me, with the A6 being just a little easier&lt;br</li>
            <li> YOU SHOULD DISH OUT A LITTLE EXTRA FOR THE OSTER</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bigger than I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> I have not had a single pull and no heating of the motor or blades which occurred with every other clipper I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cant describe how much I love these bad boys.</li>
            <li> ,only one bad thing is that they dont come with storage box to keep secure when not in use,other then that i recomend this product.</li>
            <li> considering my cheap clippers have lasted longer, it is disappointing.</li>
            <li> though they would take at least a couple drops though, being professional quality.</li>
            <li> Every professional barber owns at least one of these.</li>
            <li> this had been one of my few concerns based on prior reviews ... not to worry.  </li>
            <li> This clipper will pay for itself in not much time.</li>
            <li> A bit heavy, but looks like it should last.  </li>
            <li> This Oster clipper, which I believe is used by military barbers, is a marvel.</li>
            <li> I spent the money</li>
            <li> When I paid over 100 dollars for this, I expected perfection.</li>
            <li> Even though a heavy duty case would have rounded out the ensemble, it remains the only gripe I have with this package.    </li>
            <li> Item was delivered as expected.</li>
            <li> Pays for itself in just a few cuts and will last years.</li>
            <li> Pro unit, solid a bit heavy</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> 3 years of occasional use, perhaps once a month, and this clipper is dead.</li>
            <li> without the guards these clippers SUCK, like trying to low without the guards will leave a bunch of uneven hair spots.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pros use them all day everyday and the last forever.</li>
            <li> Because my hair was wet and $20 Wahl&#x27;s just suck, it kept pulling, tugging, and hurting my noggin.</li>
            <li> Quality not what expected</li>
            <li> How to attach blades, and how to maintain the clipper, is not very well explained in the manual.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I expected to not have some of these issues at that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a completely different ball game with the capability of using different sized blades, rather than plastic guards for different lengths.</li>
            <li> As expected.  </li>
            <li> is that the clippers are heavy, but this property is an obvious testimony to its quality.  </li>
            <li> I know they are expensive , but they are worth every penny By the way, buy them here on Amazon .</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy but it does the job for my grandson who has hair enough for two people.  </li>
            <li> Got tired of the $20 clipper you’d find anywhere and paid the price of some real clippers.  </li>
            <li> Only reason I did not do the five stars is that the item is quite heavy to work with.</li>
            <li> the individual blades are not cheap ($20-25 each) but think of it as an investment).</li>
            <li> These were ordered for my military son.</li>
            <li> and it was just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> : They are heavy and only have an on/off</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s short, but I&#x27;ll get the #0000 in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Not only was it so loud that we both had to wear ear plugs, it didn&#x27;t cut well, pulling his hair and leaving sprigs and gaps behind.</li>
            <li> so it was the fact that there were some unknowns that maybe held me back from buying it - didn&#x27;t want to waste $120 on an unknown product.  </li>
            <li> The 76 cools the motor by flowing air from the base to two vents on the sides, and the warm air blows on me (or your clients) while clipping&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does get a little warm, however the noise is not that bad like some other reviews stated.</li>
            <li> but I can only imagine that with the right blade, you can probably get crazy close.</li>
            <li> Prior to this purchase, I&#x27;ve gone through at least four other lesser clippers.</li>
            <li> It was a little bit awkward to use to groom my mustache at first but after a few attempts it became much easier.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cord is stiffer than some electrical cords but that is also something I got used to - have to kind of deal with the stiff cord with one hand and run the clipper with the other - and I take that overbuilt quality to mean that the whole unit is tough and will last a long time - heavy duty cord, heavy duty motor and sharp, professional heavy metal cutting blade.  </li>
            <li> the blade wash is nearly identical at least from my perception of the smell, chemical reaction to rust and other surfaces, and it&#x27;s consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> They can shave my monkey in less than five minutes without any tugging on his hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blades are easy to change, but the additional blades are very expensive, at $20-30ea.</li>
            <li> I could scarcely tell they were cutting due to being so sharp and the guides so smooth.</li>
            <li> The brushes of the motor, the things that make contact with with electric motors, on higher quality motors are designed to be replaced since they are usually the first thing that will go bad due to friction.</li>
            <li> WHEN I GET OUT OF THE SHOWER I DRY OFF IN HALF THE TIME.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s probably the only minor negative</li>
            <li> : It is a little heavy and a little loud</li>
            <li> Blade changing is simple and this unit requires very little to maintain.  </li>
            <li> but for you it&#x27;s not hot.</li>
            <li> Clipper warms up but is never uncomfortably hot (of course, I do not use it all day but still).</li>
            <li> Hair with foreign debris (sand, metal shavings, wood chips, etc.)</li>
            <li> This purchase has already outlasted my other clippers 5 fold and has not even hinted at needing repairs.</li>
            <li> Other complain about the noise, but I don&#x27;t think they are any louder than any other clipper.</li>
            <li> Found this online, read the other reviews, and bit the bullet.     </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Once the word got out, other family members wanted to stop by and get their hair cut, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are a bit cumbersome to use by yourself due to there size and weight</li>
            <li> the product is actually dark \\&quot;blood\\&quot; red, not bright red as the picture may lead you to believe.     </li>
            <li> expect these clippers will last quite a bit longer than the other ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Only thing I am not sure about is proper cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Other blades are sold</li>
            <li> With other clippers, you have to unscrew this and unscrew that</li>
            <li> Pick up other detachable blades according to your preference for the cut and you can start fades off.</li>
            <li> The video said this is usually due to a lack of lubrication.</li>
            <li> I was tired of owning several cheaply /less expensive clippers.</li>
            <li> Before I held it I thought people were strange for saying it was heavy...</li>
            <li> You get more than you pay for with these, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and oh, what an improvement over the &#x27;other&#x27; brand/motor type of clipper.  </li>
            <li> what other reviewers were talking about.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use osters clipper oil before and after each cut so the blades stay sharp, don&#x27;t rust, and</li>
            <li> I can do a line of hair in one go, unlike any other clipper I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I will on the other hand not shop with Amazon anymore.</li>
            <li> The blades were sharp.</li>
            <li> The other advantage to the oster Is that it cuts the hair while you pull the clipper away from the head so blending the hair is easier then the plastic attachments of the whal.</li>
            <li> then other hopping</li>
            <li> I bought a second pair this past December, and a couple weeks ago</li>
            <li> They ONLY thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s a little heavy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive but worth the investment.</li>
            <li> The clippers are big and a little heavy</li>
            <li> blade is very wide</li>
            <li> word of caution - if you use the 00000 blade be VERY CAREFUL.</li>
            <li> The woman on the phone had such a thick accent and poor English skills that I could barely understand what she was saying.  </li>
            <li> My husband has very thick hair and went through multiple clippers in the last three years.  </li>
            <li> Does what I need it to, sounds happy doing it, and I don&#x27;t have to pay $30 to singe my nostrils smelling awful perfume while making idle chatter with a lady at a salon every few weeks.  </li>
            <li> They probably saved my 10 to 15 minutes in cutting time, and I do not have to go over the same area as much.  </li>
            <li> I like the quick change system that Oster has designed for the cutting blades.</li>
            <li> They are a bit heavy and maybe even a little hard to use if cutting your own hair</li>
            <li> I still remember the very first time I tried cutting my hair with a $20 Wahl Clipper from some store.</li>
            <li> very hot when using  -Have to shave very slowly to avoid cutting your self and or experiencing pain (not useful for someone who shaves head frequently)  </li>
            <li> A little heavier than expected.</li>
            <li> While it is a little pricy I cut my, and others, hair roughly every 2-3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Even if it&#x27;s a little wet.</li>
            <li> If you want a pair of clippers that are going to last and give you all the cutting power you could need or want buy the Oster Classic 76.</li>
            <li> I can cut my hair in less than 10 minutes, and it never gets stuck, I see from other reviews that some people complain about the heating and the weight.</li>
            <li> no nicks or cuts and hardly ever any red marks on my neck.</li>
            <li> There is hardly even a comparison between these and the $25 - $50 pairs you find at local stores.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with a classic!</li>
            <li> It should at least withstand a fall that low.  </li>
            <li> They are however, a bit cumbersome when trying to cut the back of your hair by yourself (at least for me).</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper ten years ago, and use it at least twice a month.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only mention that because it is the one complaint</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid and clearly well built, without being overly heavy or difficult to hold/manipulate.</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least 6 different hair clippers for 30 or 40 dollars and they do not cut at all compared to this piece of art.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
            <li> Made in China of course, wish Amazon would display where all of the products that they offer are manufactured, I have thrown away more made in China crap than I care to remember.</li>
            <li> reason why I am giving these clippers a 1 star is because they are advertised as being able to cut through any type of hair, had I known that these clippers were not particularly good at cutting black hair</li>
            <li> If you are like me and you just want to remove all hair from your head down to a millimeter length</li>
            <li> You wont need someone to tell you that you missed a spot because this thing will mow down all of your hair, if you pass it over your head the hair will be gone.</li>
            <li> The reason why I bought this was because it does save some time when taking down hair</li>
            <li> AND I SHAVE FROM NECK DOWN.  </li>
            <li> (where I would practice doing fades then just buzz down my hack job one clipper size for an even cut)</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve passed the return policy, thats 100$ down the drain.</li>
            <li> I will try to breack down the differences between the two.</li>
            <li> There is no bogging down with this clippers.  </li>
            <li> Still as sharp as the day I bought them!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend these to anyone who is sick of the cheap $20-$30 clippers you find in stores.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and even cuts.</li>
            <li> (they come with the #1 blade and the #000 blade attachments, and perhaps buy a few other blades separately</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time buying other brands or models.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp, and the clipper body feels heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> Although it is a bit heavy, so is a Rolls Royce when compared to other cars.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Blades are very sharp, motor is powerfull.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some people have said it is heavy in other reviews, but I did not find that to be the case.</li>
            <li> It fell about less than a foot and the plastic on/off</li>
            <li> After having gone through 3 of the typical clippers one finds in Target, WalMart, etc (wahl, remington, take your pic)  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s much less noisy.</li>
            <li> By the way, that is the only con I could come up with because this is seriously</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit less abrasive to me</li>
            <li> In less than 5 minutes and three passes I clipped my hair like a pro.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re just cutting your own hair at home it might be a less expensive alternative to the 76&#x27;s</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- slight smell of electric motor/oil &lt;br</li>
            <li> Actually a larger issue was finding the time in the schedule for my husband to go to the barber shop when they were open and when it jived with his schedule, which was getting difficult with my husband&#x27;s work hours.</li>
            <li> and I have had it less than a year.</li>
            <li> Given that a typically haircut is about $12-15 plus tip, these clippers have already paid for themselves.  </li>
            <li> It now takes me half the time to shave my head and it never misses a hair.</li>
            <li> This product broke less than 6 months after purchase.</li>
            <li> I used the product less than 10x in 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a black man, it works well on my head and face.</li>
            <li> Smooth cutting through thick hair.  </li>
            <li> going to want to pick up the 3 and a half blade, the 2 blade and the one and a half blade for the oster.</li>
            <li> So let&#x27;s say after you use the one and a half blade on the oster.</li>
            <li> The last one lasted 8 years for an estimated 280 total haircuts before the motor seemed to fail.</li>
            <li> This can be difficult when cutting your own hair sometimes.</li>
            <li> All in all it was not worth it for my purposes but for someone else who cuts thick long hair often it might be.</li>
            <li> You can tell that it is barely working, even to cut through my very thick hair.</li>
            <li> price reminded me why I started cutting my hair by myself in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After being consistently disappointed with the cut produced from the cheap clippers I decided to take a look around.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant because of previous knock off brands that was corrupting the market.  </li>
            <li> They go through my hair and never get bogged down.</li>
            <li> this thing, I can keep my hair extremely tight all the time without having to leave the house.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used them I was a little afraid, they seem like they could shave the wool off a heard of sheep.  </li>
            <li> Tried it on my uncle&#x27;s hair, which is very afro like, and every other clipper failed, but the Oster 76 nailed it, cut through it like butter!</li>
            <li> this is little over a 4 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Also, the Oster 76 clipper is a little bulky and cumbersome when compared to comparable magnetic clippers.</li>
            <li> I this little beauty is $219 at Sally&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who doesn&#x27;t like it is either too weak to hold it and or doesn&#x27;t know how to properly fade with it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will need a #2 clipper when I want to leave my hair a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> take me little while to figure out how to change the blade but youtube teach you everything .</li>
            <li> The air pushing out of the little two slits on the sides are like little furnaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All of the little adjustments and tricks I had to learn on magnetic motor clippers weren&#x27;t needed.</li>
            <li> Its a little thing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit aggressive when I try to man scape my pubes.</li>
            <li> Instead of sounding and feeling like a mini weed whacker, this guy whirrs with little vibration.</li>
            <li> little practice</li>
            <li> It takes a little getting used to when you switch.</li>
            <li> I came across these and did a little research.</li>
            <li> A little.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have extra thick hair or anything special, and it fails every 3-6 months without fail.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty and cuts through even thick or wet hair without even slowing down.</li>
            <li> No surprises...  A little heavy.</li>
            <li> They are a little heavy</li>
            <li> A little on the heavy side</li>
            <li> The main points that I took from my phone call to Oster were: (1) the clippers are only warrantied for 12 months, (2) since it has been 13 months since my purchase, we are on the hook for the repair, (3) there are no authorized service centers within 100 miles of our home in Rhode Island, and (4) we&#x27;d need to send the clippers to Oster in Tennessee where the repair would cost $59.38.  </li>
            <li> The clippers are heavy / large / and sometimes awkward to handle (everyone else has said this too;</li>
            <li> Bottom line - money well spent!!!  </li>
            <li> Took me a little practice to get used to, but it&#x27;s really not all that difficult for a simple fade.  </li>
            <li> I rarely lubed the blades, which may have caused it to struggle and go bad sooner?</li>
            <li> Disappointing since this type of clipper is widely used by professional barbers.  </li>
            <li> Several years ago, I decided to start cutting my hair very short.  </li>
            <li> they would last around 2 or 3 years and then break in the middle of cutting my hair.</li>
            <li> When you do men&#x27;s cuts 40% of your day, you&#x27;ll need a heavy duty clipper and this one does the job.  </li>
            <li> Even one handed behind my back, I can just buzz away and be done in minutes.</li>
            <li> I have had a few cuts because of these clippers.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered longer blades (not cheap) and will continue to use.  </li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of shaving my head with a razor, the way I shave my face.</li>
            <li> Cord is heavy duty.  </li>
            <li> this one is almost a one pass cut with virtually nothing left behind</li>
            <li> and I used quite a few.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing all those years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, cuts well but is heavy.  </li>
            <li> You can tell just from how heavy they are.</li>
            <li> There reliable, heavy duty and give the cleanest cut.</li>
            <li> I would not have wasted money on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is heavy, but been around for years</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are heavy and bulky, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me once I used them a few times and got used to their heft.  </li>
            <li> Buy the metal blades and a few of the plastic combs.  </li>
            <li> It is heavy and bulky.</li>
            <li> This clipper may feel a bit heavy to some.</li>
            <li> These clippers are so heavy duty that I feel like I should wear safety glasses while operating.</li>
            <li> I would recommend you buy a few blades in the sizes you cut your hair.  </li>
            <li> I imagine the clippers could get heavy if you use them all day, but since I&#x27;m not a pro, I don&#x27;t notice the weight.  </li>
            <li> Why did I waste my time with inferior alternatives (some of which came with tons of accessories) when this was what I was looking for all along?</li>
            <li> /&gt;1-They are bulky and heavy.  </li>
            <li> Should not have to worry these clippers are heavy and well built.</li>
            <li> I also at that time decided I didnt need to pay $20+ for a haircut every few weeks or month when I could do it</li>
            <li> It is hefty and there is no doubt it is a professional grade unit not a \\&quot;consumer\\&quot; device that will break or fail in a year or two.  </li>
            <li> I now consider all of them years a waste of my life.</li>
            <li> There were reviews that said it was heavy</li>
            <li> Have had these for a few months</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers for my son who uses them everyday.  </li>
            <li> I actually used the clippers with the broken switch, plugging the clippers in to turn and unplugging to turn off.  </li>
            <li> They are heavy</li>
            <li> Only issue is this hair clipper is heavy and holding over 10 or 15 minutes your wrist will get tired.</li>
            <li> Other reviews have stated that these clippers are bulky and are hard to use if you are giving yourself the trim.</li>
            <li> In the past, he has used just about every other brand of non-professional hair clippers (usually the ones they sell at Target, Ulta, etc), and they have not held up like the Oster Clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought it as my other clippers were turning dull and pulling out hair.</li>
            <li> and he would charge $5 fpr a plain buzz, so</li>
            <li> -- I keep my head tight usually with no guard which always pinched, scraped, or nicked my head.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t struggle with hair, cuts easily, no pulling.</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t pack the cutting power that the Classic 76 does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using the Classic 76 for about 2 months, cutting my hair about every 4-5 days</li>
            <li> After plugging it in and powering it on, I couldn&#x27;t help but let out a few little Tim-the-Tool-Man grunts, &#x27; ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh!&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I tried to change the blade, it was difficult, if not, impossible to do.  </li>
            <li> Reviewers caution about the strong motor and how it can possibly be difficult to manage while cutting.  </li>
            <li> These clippers made it possible to move quickly though very nasty mats of dog hair.  </li>
            <li> Powerhouse, Heavy and not justified for the home trimmer!</li>
            <li> Bought these because I was tired of paying $15+ for a simple haircut every month that would only turn out mediocre.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult around the chin and upper lip, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Con is only because I have little hands and it can be difficult to use.</li>
            <li> No more pulling, no more uneven lines or untrimmed sections.  </li>
            <li> The only way that the motor will turn on is if you hold the base of the cord near the plug at a crimped, 90-degree angle.  </li>
            <li> This worm screw gear wore down to the point of failure after 2 months of weekly use to shave my head.</li>
            <li> It was a little bit hard to swallow the price tag</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used the store bought novice clippers and usually need to replace every few years from the blades going dull or motor frying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We started cutting hair at home during our early years of marriage when we had very little.</li>
            <li> no more cheapie hair clippers for me.</li>
            <li> I have small hands, but don&#x27;t find this clipper to be unwieldy or too heavy to use in the least.  </li>
            <li> No more hair pulling.</li>
            <li> so when i usually cut my hair with a wahl clipper it would leave patches every where,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on anything else!</li>
            <li> I was done shaving my head faster than usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also used to moving reasonably slowly to avoid pulling or uneven cut.</li>
            <li> I am a woman with small hands</li>
            <li> no more barber shop...</li>
            <li> The directions are very Simple and Leave you confused about how to swap the Blades!</li>
            <li> I shave my head with these every 3 or 4 days, usually, and it works out</li>
            <li> how heavy could a hare clipper be?!  </li>
            <li> I have had 2-3 of the cheapo Wahl style clippers in the past.</li>
            <li> These clippers are mammoth in size, so if you have small hands you may have difficulty using them.  </li>
            <li> A few have noted (complained?)</li>
            <li> cut&#x27;s through hair like it is made for it,&lt;br /&gt;total different than the 10$ useless products</li>
            <li> Just past the return date to amazon so stuck with it.</li>
            <li> A small amount of oil and grease come with the unit.  </li>
            <li> I have been cutting hair as a professional barber since 2002</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for professional level hair cutting equipment, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about small cuts to my head like I have had with others.</li>
            <li> and they are not cheap!</li>
            <li> He said the ones he purchased in the past weren&#x27;t up to the job.</li>
            <li> and no more blades falling off.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems to be a very heavy duty and well constructed clipper.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of the poor performance and short life of the clippers that you can purchase in the chain stores.</li>
            <li> The cord is stiff so it has a tendency to sweep things off of the counter (goodbye dixie cup holder!).</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s frustrated that he&#x27;s spent so much money over the years trying the Wally World versions only to be disappointed about how dull they become and how under powered they are.</li>
            <li> They are heavy, and while I&#x27;m not a professionally licensed barber, I&#x27;ve been cutting my family&#x27;s hair for 23 years.</li>
            <li> I cut hair all the time and found it hard to keep even with no guards.</li>
            <li> This little gizmo is heavy and expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had at least two pair of these clippers.</li>
            <li> A couple years ago my wife started cutting mine and my sons hair regularly to save $$.</li>
            <li> It gives me the impression that if I have kids later on in life, I might be cutting their kid&#x27;s hair with this clipper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for 25+ years and have always used one of those big box store kits with the plastic guards.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my hair for over ten years and believe me</li>
            <li> Lately I&#x27;ve been using these clippers on my face also, instead of shaving with a blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About a week ago I decided it was time to upgrade since my Wahl didnt seem to be cutting as short as I needed and the blade seemed to have shifted again.</li>
            <li> You can imagine my disappointment when I opened the box to discover it came with the 2 standard blades.</li>
            <li> If you are going to do years of cutting, spend the extra amount for this unit.  </li>
            <li> I purchase this at least once a year as I am a stylist (of 8 years)and</li>
            <li> Not only am I saving money by cutting my hair myself I&#x27;m saving lots of time.</li>
            <li> AT LEAST once/year.  </li>
            <li> I had Andis (Master) with 15 watt motor but had difficulty clipping my son&#x27;s thick hair.  </li>
            <li> They cut though my sons thick hair like a knife thu butter.  </li>
            <li> Plus it would start out slow and then ramp up the longer</li>
            <li> This clipper just mows through even thick hair with no problem.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair.</li>
            <li> My son has a thick bush hair and it cuts his hair with ease.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got tired of spending $11 every two weeks for my cuts....plus wasted time waiting for those cuts...</li>
            <li> The clippers I had before would struggle to cut thick hair, but these guys don&#x27;t tug or pull at all.</li>
            <li> have thick hair and the take-down power of this clipper</li>
            <li> My thick unwieldy locks never stood a chance against these clippers.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> not that they probably wouldn&#x27;t keep on working, but you just might crack the thick plastic housing</li>
            <li> These things seem like they will cut through thick hair with no problem.</li>
            <li> It was a well balanced heft and it humbly lets you know that it is a serious tool and not a dime-a-dozen gadget!</li>
            <li> I mean quality.</li>
            <li> There is no comparison between this thing and the less expensive ones you can find in stores.</li>
            <li> Made from serious materials too, not</li>
            <li> seriously.</li>
            <li> These clippers are serious stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a serious clipper.  </li>
            <li> also way less expensive.</li>
            <li> But like I said he was a little sad that it didn&#x27;t come with the #2 metal guard.</li>
            <li> the only bad thing about it .....  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing is the clipper takes some getting used to when working fades.  </li>
            <li> , my wife does my haircuts, she likes these and does not find them heavy or difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> We bought the product below as part of a kit, back in 1986, at a small drugstore in Dumfries, VA, just off base at Quantico, VA.</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s a little ball port on the side that your supposed to use to lubricate the motor, It seems like a very poor design to me, and could be improved.</li>
            <li> Cutting hair with this, even the oily, unwashed, dirt and stick-filled manes of active kids, is a breeze.</li>
            <li> thing is heavy, it feels poorly built, the hanging loop was installed wrong</li>
            <li> Now my hair cutting time is half what it use to be.</li>
            <li> Tough as nails.</li>
            <li> Blades don&#x27;t grab the hair and can handle very thick hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who has very, very thick and curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I have no clue if the product came to me broken, but I purchased it off amazon</li>
            <li> cause the motor is heavy duty and the cutting blades are quality.  </li>
            <li> I went through two sets of cheapo wahl trimmers before I was finally fed up with the piece of crap plastic combs before I decided to get this.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Negatives: [ minor ] &lt;br</li>
            <li> The on-off switch was broken.</li>
            <li> Got tired of buying the wahls from walmart every 9 months or so.  </li>
            <li> These are a game changer.  </li>
            <li> Still, if your arm gets tired using this then you need help with your life.  </li>
            <li> I assume the broken switch was caused by a packaging problem.</li>
            <li> I was tired of having to replace home use grade clippers year after year.</li>
            <li> i can bye again from you when needed and sorry for responding so late and have a MERRY CHRISTMAS</li>
            <li> Poor attention to detail in their design.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this oster clipper.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this one because I was sick and tired of my hair being pulled and other problems.  </li>
            <li> So I moved into the bathroom to finish my cut and it would do nothing but pull my hair, cutting very little.  </li>
            <li> The barber (plus tip) will drain the monthly base pay of every military member.  </li>
            <li> The casing is thick and sturdy and the cutting power is phenominal.  </li>
            <li> Also use these in the spring when I trim my winter beard, has no issue cutting through thick hair.</li>
            <li> I called Oster&#x27;s customer service number just now (800-830-3678), and I left very frustrated.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, me using them ONCE a WEEK, shortened their lifespan and slowly they stopped cutting hair and began PULLING them</li>
            <li> It would be tough to hold this thing all day cutting hair.</li>
            <li> Seems silly that NO guide combs come with it at that price soooo</li>
            <li> The last haircut with those was awful.</li>
            <li> Speaking of expensive the Oster 76 clipper is just that.</li>
            <li> The Oster 76 is an expensive option for a number of reasons.</li>
            <li> However...it&#x27;s not perfect.</li>
            <li> For a product this expensive, the blades should change themselves.  </li>
            <li> -Expensive  -They</li>
            <li> Oster has videos on youtube that describe how to maintain the 76 and as a bonus they are hilariously cheesy.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is expensive and the blades are too</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t be careless and drop it like I do once a year,</li>
            <li> something was wrong.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a 30-day return policy and I am unable to return the defected product.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive...</li>
            <li> I know they make gears to fail in case</li>
            <li> You WILL NOT be sorry if you buy these clippers</li>
            <li> (sorry, pun intended).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this was not the case</li>
            <li> , it wasn&#x27;t that difficult</li>
            <li> I believe there is something wrong with where the wire connects to the clipper-</li>
            <li> Expensive?</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a terrible product for the money i spent on it.</li>
            <li> It sometimes took up to an hour to finish cutting his hair, and even then I had to cut stragglers with scissors.</li>
            <li> i bought this crazy oster and its overheating all the time</li>
            <li> I found myself having to go over spots because the handle is awkward and the blade would stick to my head.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered the 00000 size cutting blade attachment to get an even closer cut.</li>
            <li> I have owned these since 2007, and the blades that came with it are still cutting quite well.</li>
            <li> I use the 76 as a finishing tool when cutting my hair in conjunction with the Oster #00000 blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are saving money cutting hair at home instead of paying the barber&#x27;s fee plus tip</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my son and fiancé&#x27;s hair for years now.  </li>
            <li> Also someone mentioned cutting themselves with the 00000 blades.  </li>
            <li> I save alot of money by cutting my hair, my father&#x27;s hair and my sons hair.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed that they weren&#x27;t cutting like they used to.  </li>
            <li> Do get the Oster cutting attachments, but ignore the instructions about putting them on while the clipper is running.</li>
            <li> Cutting my hair is a snap now.</li>
            <li> Now I am frustrated, because I am not going to return the clippers because it came with the wrong blades.</li>
            <li> It feels like your cutting butter with a heat knife.</li>
            <li> yet they keep stopping while I am cutting.</li>
            <li> Upon arrival imagine my dismay to find the plastic on/off switch broken off at the base.</li>
            <li> They may seem expensive, but they&#x27;ll pay for themselves within months!</li>
            <li> and i believe there&#x27;s something wrong with it!</li>
            <li> Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> After watching some \\&quot;how to\\&quot; YouTube videos, I attempted to use this bad boy myself and just after one pass with #1 blade</li>
            <li> Box is bad</li>
            <li> This bad boy has quite the motor in it.</li>
            <li> and you too will have nothing bad to say about the 76.</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> Oster&#x27;s customer \\&quot;service\\&quot; is about as bad as it gets.  </li>
            <li> Bought this because I was sick of replacing my \\&quot;el-cheapo\\&quot; ones from from department stores.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Cons:    (1)</li>
            <li> The unit itself comes with two interchangeable, attachable blades:  (a) size 1 and (b) size 000 (triple Zero)    (4)</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed....</li>
            <li> not thinking that I would have a problem :(</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed to noticed that in using it with the \\&quot;0\\&quot; or \\&quot;1\\&quot; blade would catch and pull on my hair.</li>
            <li> what a stupid product is this dont buy it .........</li>
            <li> STUPIDLY</li>
            <li> drawer is an idiot.</li>
            <li> I hate these clippers and would never buy them if I was not required to.</li>
            <li> That was a real disappointment for me.  </li>
            <li> I hated it.</li>
            <li> i must say i am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!!!</li>
            <li> Step up in class, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> and those do an awful job at cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> easy to use, cutting my own hair for the 1st time in my life, I&#x27;m 55, should have started this way sooner, looks  and feels as good as the $30 cut I&#x27;ve been getting for  years</li>
            <li> I also believe this piece was used and repackaged. I have had multiple people recommend this product, and my barber is a big fan of Oster products. On first use, no more than 15 minutes in, the motor started sounding funny. Used it 2 more times, sound got worse. Returned it.</li>
            <li> Powerful! Perfect for any type of hair. The available blade assortment is superb</li>
            <li> Great product. Well built. It&#x27;s being used in professional barber shops.</li>
            <li> Tends to heat up too quickly.</li>
            <li> Wish we had bought these sooner. Now my husband loves getting his hair cut! Quick, easy to use, easy to clean. POWERFUL. I&#x27;d buy it again in a heartbeat, but it&#x27;s really well built so I don&#x27;t plan on doing that for a long time.</li>
            <li> Bought this is little over a 4 years ago.  Been using them regularly (about once every 1.5 months).  They perform and function well.  Been oiling them after each use.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> The Oster 76 is not the slimmest of the trimmers but its quite a powerful unit that gets the job done.  I use mine for depilling fabric on used office chairs, and it works great w the optional 0000 blade.  The only drawback is its bulkiness which becomes a bit tiresome after long use and the on/off switch is definitely a little on the cheap side that I could see breaking off if I dropped it at some point.  But it would be fairly easy to switch it out for a higher quality metal toggle.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with mine.  Had it for about 2 months now.</li>
            <li> Used Oster products for many years. This is one of the best clippers.The first clipper I owned lasted for twenty five years.</li>
            <li> It fell about less than a foot and the plastic on/off switch broke off easily.  Disappointing since this type of clipper is widely used by professional barbers.  It should at least withstand a fall that low.  My dad use to own one of this model and it has the metal switch.</li>
            <li> I buzz my head every 3 days, no doubt this will be the last clipper I ever have to buy. Definitely on the larger side compared to my Andis, but overall all not a big deal. It came with &amp;#34;0000&amp;#34; blade but I purchased the &amp;#34;00000&amp;#34; for the almost bald buzz.</li>
            <li> is a nice machine the only bad thing about it .....  gets to hot after u use it for like 5 or 10 min</li>
            <li> These are heavy duty, professional clippers that will plow through hair like a laser beam! Blades are super sharp and the hair falls away with no resistance. This is a fairly large clipper, more suited to cutting someone else&#x27;s hair. They are a little awkward for buzzing your own hair.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m only giving it 1 star because I haven&#x27;t gotten to use it yet. Seems silly that NO guide combs come with it at that price soooo I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use it!</li>
            <li> After having gone through 3 of the typical clippers one finds in Target, WalMart, etc (wahl, remington, take your pic)  I finally spent a little more money for the Oster 76.  The Oster is powerful and cuts my hair much faster than off the shelf brands.</li>
            <li> After 15 minutes is was hot as hell, what a bunch of lairs oster team. Oh wait maybe, hot is relative, i can feel it hot but for you it&#x27;s not hot. Will oster read this comment?  Maybe not So, let&#x27;s talk for amazon folks then.&lt;br /&gt;Get your own oster can put it to the test if you don&#x27;t like it, ask for your money back. That&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Beast of a machine, cut&#x27;s through everything first time around - you won&#x27;t need to go for a second pass with this machine. Doesn&#x27;t matter what angle you go at either. This thing is robust too, don&#x27;t drop it, weighs a lot, but you can tell it&#x27;s quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your cash and buy this instead of the cheap 40-50$ ones.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning and receding in the front. I&#x27;m not ready to go completely bald, so I use this with the 000 blade that comes with it, to keep my hair low enough not to notice.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband Christmas 2012.  He still loves this. My husband has very thick hair and went through multiple clippers in the last three years.  After 1.5 years and weekly shavings, these Clippers work like it did the day we purchased it. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> My wife has been cutting my hair with this (using a comb set) and it has been great! Certainly a tier above the cheapo $20 hair clipper sets you see. Pros: excellent build quality and cutting ability, cuts swiftly and cleanly. Cons: can feel a bit heavy after extended hair cutting sessions, and can also get quite warm - though I don&#x27;t know how warm relative to other clippers, this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> There is no comparison between this thing and the less expensive ones you can find in stores. Cutting hair with this, even the oily, unwashed, dirt and stick-filled manes of active kids, is a breeze. Where other clippers would simply bog down and stop cutting, these things effortlessly mow right through, like a knife through warm butter. Haircuts take a fraction the time, with no hair pulling or yanking. The kids remain cooperative through the entire cut, and results are much better and even looking. Given the price of haircuts at commercial venues, I reckon it will take me maybe 8- 9 haircuts to break even on this purchase. With these clippers, I think I can get there over the next couple of years - with the old clippers, the kids we rebelling. If you&#x27;re on the fence, my recommendation is to step up and get these - you&#x27;ll be glad you did.</li>
            <li> it is good, I thought that my hair was going to almost or close to bald and it is not like that, even with the 00000 razon that you buy apart&lt;br /&gt;I am still using it but i am shaving now sometimes&lt;br /&gt;good but not like advertised.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd pair of this Trimmer that I bought.  I used the first one on a weekly basis for many years.  The wire finally got frayed out which is why I bought the second set.  It is obviously very durable and the blade lasts a very long time.  This is an excellent pair of clippers and I would highly recommend it to anyone from a novice to a professional.</li>
            <li> At $20/haircut, these clippers pay for themselves in a matter of weeks! They are truly professional in that they cut cleanly and effortlessly to exacting lengths.</li>
            <li> I bought this while I was deployed over seas and cut my own hair and the hair of many other Marines. These clippers worked great right out of the box and after 5 months of 10+ haircuts a week they are still working great. If you want a pair of clippers that are going to last and give you all the cutting power you could need or want buy the Oster Classic 76.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for a few years and really don&#x27;t like them.  They are extremely loud and get hot a bit to quick.  I don&#x27;t recommend them especially when cost is considered. Mine for for sale and I&#x27;m buying Andis.</li>
            <li> This clipper is one of the best.  When you do men&#x27;s cuts 40% of your day, you&#x27;ll need a heavy duty clipper and this one does the job.  I had my last one for 4 years and the only reason I got a new one is because the on/off switch got faulty.  I know I could of had it repaired (and still will) but needed one immediately.  Great product overall!</li>
            <li> Best ever Clipper I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve been using clippers (this is my third) for over 8 years.  Excellent product ... cuts through my sons&#x27; hair like a hot knife slicing through soft butter.  Surprisingly quiet ... this had been one of my few concerns based on prior reviews ... not to worry.  Feels a little heavy after a while, but is nicely balanced and does heat up quite a bit after continuous use (15-20 minutes); but again, not that big a deal.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> This is by far a must for all barbers. Ordered on amazon and item came in within days of purchase. Very happy</li>
            <li> This machine is a great product. It cuts like a knife through butter and is easy to clean and change blades.</li>
            <li> I am not a hairdresser by trade, but I do cut a lot of the men&#x27;s hair in our family.  I researched for a long time trying to decide on which pair of clippers was worth the investment.  I decided on the Oster professional clippers and have been a happy clipper since.  I was tired of the poor performance and short life of the clippers that you can purchase in the chain stores. I am pleased with the product and would recommend it to others.  I would buy from the seller again.</li>
            <li> this is hands down the best hair clipper i&#x27;ve ever owned. no more cheapie hair clippers for me. hopefully the last one i ever buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple of different clippers over the years and I find the Oster 76 to be an incredible product.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and relube.  I do many clipper cuts in a week and my 76 is a workhorse.  I have small hands, but don&#x27;t find this clipper to be unwieldy or too heavy to use in the least.  I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> As described and on time</li>
            <li> This clipper should last a long time. It is solid (and rather heavy)and seems to have a great motor. The attachment system, for attaching different size clipper blades works very well, just pull up in the clipper blade(s) and then remove. Oster makes some spring loaded plastic extensions for various lenghts. These extensions work well and have a secure fit on the clipper. They are however, a bit cumbersome when trying to cut the back of your hair by yourself (at least for me). This clipper will pay for itself in not much time. I don&#x27;t know what the price of a haircut is nowadays. If you have a family, they should be a given.&lt;br /&gt;Update: Aug. 30,2013: It runs a little hot (you can feel it on your hands)if it is run for a length of time.</li>
            <li> After 40 years of trimming hair and beard wth the 20.00 cheapies Finally bought a Pro trimmer Oster Classic 76.  What a vast wonderful improvement in performance.plus the blades are replaceable and the motor is repairable, Smart Choice</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful clipper!  I used to cut my hair with #2 blades on all sides for the longest time (7+ years), then about 3 months ago, I decided to let my hair grow a bit and get a professionally done haircut(short on sides, a bit long on the top), I had to get that same haircut once a month and I had to pay $25 every single time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That price reminded me why I started cutting my hair by myself in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only owned TWO clippers from two different brands prior to getting the Oster Classic 76.  Both clippers were great! (considering their price).  Unfortunately, me using them ONCE a WEEK, shortened their lifespan and slowly they stopped cutting hair and began PULLING them instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking for \\&quot;best clippers\\&quot;, I found the Oster Classic 76 and considering the great reviews this product has received, I decided to give them a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man!  This is the best clipper I have ever used!  My hair WAS about 4 inches long and it was cut like butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do not like about the 76 is that it heats up pretty quickly, it&#x27;s like having a portable Heater in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I guess that&#x27;s the result of a bigger motor working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the \\&quot;noise\\&quot; some people have mentioned,  it is not very noticeable (call me deaf if you wish).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have loved to use the #2 blades with it, but it never arrived with my order (another story for another day).  The #1 blades worked just fine! Although, my hair looks a bit too short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great product! I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> very nice clipper. works better than anything you can get at wally world. its a pro style clipper perfect for trimming the kids hair or buzzing your own.</li>
            <li> After several years of giving myself \\&quot;buzz-cuts\\&quot; I decided to go for a quality set of clippers. I had been using one of those kits which included all of the plastic guards etc. which fell in the $30 price range at Target. There is NO comparison. The Oster Classic 76 is the \\&quot;Cadillac\\&quot; of clippers. From the moment you turn them on, you can tell by the smoothness and power of the motor that you have stepped up to top quality clippers. They come with a [1] blade and a [000] blade. I purchased a [0000] which is great for real close shaves or fades. I&#x27;m confident these will last for years since I&#x27;m using them at home and not in a shop. I would definitely buy this brand again !</li>
            <li> Bought this unit to replace a Wahl clipper that would not stay aligned.  This is obviously professional grade.  A bit heavy, but looks like it should last.  I like the replaceable blade design.  Would have been nice to include the combs directly in the kit...</li>
            <li> I have used the Oster clipper before and knew that it was a great clipper.  I found the clipper add on Amazon and the price was unbeatable. It was the price that prompted me to buy Amazon.  I am very happy with the product and the price.</li>
            <li> With my husband in the military and my son wanting the same haircut as his dad, we&#x27;ve gone through many sets of drug store clippers. The last haircut with those was awful. The clippers were ripping the hair off my son&#x27;s head. So, I gritted my teeth and paid for these. I don&#x27;t regret it at all. They are wonderful! I also got the universal comb attachments and I can give my son a great &#x27;High Regulation&#x27; haircut with ease! They may seem expensive, but they&#x27;ll pay for themselves within months!</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my hair since I was in Jr. High School (over 20 years), and the Oster Classic 76 is by far the best set of clippers I have ever owned.  I have gone through several cheaper pairs of clippers (i.e. Wahl which you can purchase at Target or Walmart) over the years.  The Oster Classic 76 makes fading very easy, and there is no vibration in the unit.  I wish I would have purchsed this unit so much earlier on in my life.  Definitely worth the money, especially if you cut/fade your hair every week or 2 weeks (salon charges $55 a cut and Super Cut charges +-/ $20 a cut).</li>
            <li> This clipper is the smoothest clipper out there.  I like my hair as short as possible without shaving and this certainly does the trick.  I&#x27;ve tried other clippers in the past and this has certainly worked the best.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey when compared to other clippers but its worth the investment.</li>
            <li> My wife has been clipping my hair for years with cheap clippers. I think we&#x27;ve gone through several $30 pairs in 10 years. I&#x27;ve had these Oster clippers for about 2 years and I think they are excellent. They never get clogged and they don&#x27;t pull any hairs like the cheaper ones. Time spent actually doing the job is also cut down. I read before I bought them that they are heavy and loud - I think that&#x27;s because they are well put together and well suited to do the job.</li>
            <li> been using this for about a year - it is a great piece of machinery  I use it once a week with the 000 blade to keep my head almost razor blade length. no nicks or cuts and hardly ever any red marks on my neck. it is a little big, but aren&#x27;t they all - at least the good ones</li>
            <li> This is a great hairclipper. Heavy duty and cuts through even thick or wet hair without even slowing down. I&#x27;ve never been in the army but I would guess they would use something like this to cut their hair during boot camp. Powerful, and easy to maintain. I expect it to last forever but even if it doesnt the extra cost is worth it if for no other reason than saving the aggrivation of using the cheap retail models which get stuck and jammed and are hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I used to use the $50 pair of clippers and they would last about a year or so.  But they always got clogged up and they were a pain to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have the Classic 76 clipperws, I will never own another pair.  The quick disconnect blade is so perfect for cleaning and switch lengths in a flash.  I use the to cut my hair and my beard.  They stay cool and pretty quiet compared to my cheap pair I had.  Since the brushes in the motor are replaceable,  these clippers should last me for a VERY long time.</li>
            <li> Bought this to cut my hair and it works well. This should be the last pair of clippers I ever purchase. I am always looking for quality products when I buy tools and \\&quot;toys\\&quot;. I think if it is good enough for the professional barber it is good enough for me. There are many different attachments available too. I like how the 2 blades are easily switched out for the different types of blades available. I will be purchasing the 0000 size soon because I like a closer hair cut.</li>
            <li> this is the dopest pair of clipper i have ever used. i did a lot of research on different types of clippers and i am so glad that i chose this one. if its industrial you want this is the clipper for you. if you are second guessing this purchase let me put confidence in your choice. i am very picky when it comes to the things that i purchase and i only purchase the best quality to get the biggest bang out of my buck. i hope this review helps you guys out. also think why do barbers use this clipper? cuz its the best. BUY IT!!! peace.......B</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several clipper sets that cost between 10 and 40 dollars.    Compared to the Oster they were junk!    I routinely use these clippers with a quintuple zero 00000 blade.  The cut is very tight and quick to finish.</li>
            <li> Great product and I chose the free delivery which eludes you to believe the product will take forever to arrive...well it took approx 3 days which was awesome. These clippers are the real deal.</li>
            <li> I simply love it.  My wife used to cut my hair with the cheap, generic clipper we got from department stores, and it kept pulling on my hair.  This Oster Classic 76 clipper, however, cuts through the hair crisply.  No more hair pulling.</li>
            <li> I just love these clippers. I put the 000 blade in place (pain to do and I needed a screwdriver to keep the springy hinge open when inserting the blades, but I had no idea what I was doing... Heh!). With the 3/4 inch and the 1/2 inch combs (VERY easy to change), I can cut my hair myself with a definite professional look. My hair is a lot shorter than I used to cut it but it is worth it as the clippers do such a nice job. Even one handed behind my back, I can just buzz away and be done in minutes. The ONLY challenge is to slightly taper the 1/2 inch sides with the 3/4 inch top but I mastered that the third time I tried.&lt;br /&gt;  I did my son&#x27;s curly hair and again, went very quickly and with a precise hair length. SO much easier than using hand tapering.&lt;br /&gt;  Very sharp and even cuts. I have NO idea how anyone can find fault with the way it cuts. The 000 trims the back like a scalpel and can be used to shave the hair off of the back of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;  Negatives? The cord is stiff so it has a tendency to sweep things off of the counter (goodbye dixie cup holder!). Loud? Quieter than my old clippers, that&#x27;s for sure. Clipper warms up but is never uncomfortably hot (of course, I do not use it all day but still). Switch is on the bottom so it take two hands to turn off. My one and only blade change was a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Great clippers, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My husband likes to wear his hair in a \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; cut, just like those given to new military recruits. For several years, I cut his hair with a \\&quot;Vidal Sassoon\\&quot; clipper purchased at Wal-Mart. I hated it. Not only was it so loud that we both had to wear ear plugs, it didn&#x27;t cut well, pulling his hair and leaving sprigs and gaps behind. It sometimes took up to an hour to finish cutting his hair, and even then I had to cut stragglers with scissors. This Oster clipper, which I believe is used by military barbers, is a marvel. It zips through my husband&#x27;s hair like the proverbial hot knife through butter. We&#x27;re all done in little more than 5 minutes. It has some heft to it, but it cuts so quickly that the weight is not a problem. And it&#x27;s much less noisy. No more ear plugs required :) It cost about twice what we paid for the Sassoon clipper, but it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> This clipper classic 76 is not new to me, I&#x27;v used them before and have confidence in clippers and Oster company. Most of all, Amazon made it so easy to acquire the clipper, better than any other sites. They were very fast in encouraging me to buy from them and at a very reasonable price. I wish more companies were like this. Thank you, JAG</li>
            <li> The Next day delivery was perfect since I needed these for a client. This is the best deal you will find for this model.</li>
            <li> Best clippers ever......hands down!</li>
            <li> Best I have ever owened. I spent the money and I know this will last the rest of my life. I shave my head &amp; body once a month.</li>
            <li> I had Andis (Master) with 15 watt motor but had difficulty clipping my son&#x27;s thick hair.  I thought the 45 watt Oster classic 76 should have no trouble at all, NOT TRUE.  The 45 watt Oster Classic 76 is not much better.  I have tried several different makes and models but yet to find a good clipper.</li>
            <li> Speaking of expensive the Oster 76 clipper is just that. I&#x27;ve had at least two pair of these clippers. One pair I took to a repair shop that went bankrupt and closed before I could get them back. This is a relevant point with regards to the overall appraisal of the Oster 76 hair clipper.     The Oster 76 is an expensive option for a number of reasons. First off, the clipper itself retail for as high as $200 depending on the distributor. That&#x27;s just the beginning. Should you, as I did, opt to buy additional clipper blade attachments; be prepared to spend $25 to $40 for each attachment. These attachments allow you to vary the length at which the hair is being cut by the Oster 76 clipper. Finally, unlike most magnetic clippers, the Oster 76 clipper has parts that wear with regular use and must be replaced: which is why I lost a pair to a repair shop that went out of business while giving my Oster 76 clippers an overhaul. Most quality magnetic clippers could last 15 years without even replacing or sharpening the blades if well maintained and if the operator cuts only clean hair. Hair with foreign debris (sand, metal shavings, wood chips, etc.) in it can quickly damage or dull clippers.                      The Oster 76 motor driven clipper is like a lawn mower for hair. The Oster 76 is very powerful and is very effective at removing lots of hair fast without bogging down and seizing up like some magnetic clipper will when over tasked with thick coarse hair. So when you have to take old shaggy down to \\&quot;High &amp; Tight\\&quot; this is your clipper. Otherwise, the power is overkill for most haircutting applications. Also, like a lawn mower, the Oster 76 clippers are very loud when compared to most magnetic clippers. Also, the Oster 76 clipper is a little bulky and cumbersome when compared to comparable magnetic clippers. Another disadvantage the Oster 76 is that the blade attachments cut at a fixed length and are not adjustable like the Andis Master ML or the Wahl Senior.While I&#x27;ve know an exceptional barber who uses the Oster 76 clipper exclusively; I seldom use mine. Overall, my general opinion is that most can get along without them they are not worth the trouble of frequent servicing, loud noise, and having to switch blade attachments to get any variation in cutting lengths. Thus, if you purchase this clipper, you should keep in mind that there will only be rare instances where the Oster 76 outshines all other clippers.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews on this clipper and others, it was obvious that the Oster Classic 76 is the Cadillac of clippers, so I bit the bullet and bought them.  It is indeed far superior to the previous set of $30 clippers I had from Walmart, and well worth the $125 or so I paid for them.  I am an Army Reservist, and my wife gives me a close cut every two weeks or so. These clippers are smooth running, quiet, and super clean cutting.  They come with two blades (#1 and #000 if I am not mistaken), which is all we need.  I expect to have these clippers for years and years.  With the cost of a haircut about $15 plus the gas to drive to a barber and back, these will pay for themselves in about 5 cuts.</li>
            <li> These have been great. We got them to replace the Wal-Mart brand ones which have to be replaced very often.  We&#x27;ve had these for over a year now, and they are as good as the day we got them. I&#x27;ve kept track of how often we&#x27;ve used them, and at this point we&#x27;re past break-even on price considering how much haircuts would have cost, and they show no sign of slowing down.  Also, the haircut process is much more pleasant with no tugging/pulling like is common from the cheap brands. I know the price can be daunting at first, but if you cut your hair every couple of weeks you&#x27;ll be past break even within the year.  It&#x27;s all about saving money.</li>
            <li> This product works great and worth the money. trimmed up my dog with it and it worked perfect.</li>
            <li> came exactly as ordered and works great</li>
            <li> Fast shipping...  Clippers are new as stated..  Recommend seller to others....  Thanks!</li>
            <li> It does well overall, but I don&#x27;t like the fact that you can adjust any settings.  It also get really hot at times.  It does cut well, but probably not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> why say anything else .... except the best</li>
            <li> worked perfect for me and my kids hair. an shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big, powerful, heavily built and does an excellent job. If you&#x27;re going through one of those \\&quot;drug store brand\\&quot; trimmers every year and want something that will hold up to daily use, this is the one. If you want a lightweight trimmer for occasional use, stay away - this thing is big, heavy and has an industrial strength AC cord. Parts and extra blades in many sizes and types are easily available and professional repair is available in most areas. Expect it to last nearly forever.</li>
            <li> New to Amazon, I was a bit apprehensive to buy something with a reasonably large price tag, BUT this clipper is amazing. It doesn&#x27;t struggle with hair, cuts easily, no pulling. If only it had an adjustment lever... but I guess you can&#x27;t get everything. Tried it on my uncle&#x27;s hair, which is very afro like, and every other clipper failed, but the Oster 76 nailed it, cut through it like butter! Its only been a few weeks since I&#x27;ve owned it, but it runs quiet, cool and has great torque.</li>
            <li> After having owned countless economy clippers that barely make a dent in thick hair I decided to go with these. It will cut any kind of hair be it thick, tangled or wet without bogging down or stopping (ouch!). Only downside is that they do get pretty warm after continuous cutting 30 plus minutes.</li>
            <li> This clipper in my opinion is the best clipper on the market.  I have coarse and wavy hair so when i usually cut my hair with a wahl clipper it would leave patches every where, but with the 76er it gives u a nice  clean cut and wont leave any patches.  The 76er is the real deal i dont think any other clipper can match it&#x27;s power and durability.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of cheap clippers from the drug store and were looking for what your barber would use, look no further.    I was amazed by how much faster my hair cut went, no more running over the same area over and over to make sure it looks even.  The powerful motor cuts without a tortured squeal when it hits a patch of thick hair as well.    Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This is the best set of hair clippers I have ever owned. Strong and built to last. You are not wasting your money here!</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and this is my 2nd pair in 25 years just love oster clippers they last a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my head for about 10 years now. These clippers are the best thing that ever touched my head.</li>
            <li> These are so much nicer than any other clippers.  We have been buying cheaper brands/styles for years and finally decided to take the plunge.  Totally worth it.  These are the best clippers EVER.  The only downside is they don&#x27;t really work as a beard trimmer so we had to buy a separate beard trimmer.  Otherwise they rock.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great, smoothest shave I&#x27;ve had with clippers. They just need to be maintained and cleaned and they will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> I was one of those people who constantly bought clippers from places like Target/Wal-Mart. Do yourself a favor and buy an Oster. This purchase has already outlasted my other clippers 5 fold and has not even hinted at needing repairs. Keep it oiled and it will keep you cut. I am a male whom has cut his own hair since I was 17 and I have saved so much money by doing so. These clippers were a god send and well worth the price. Quality product.</li>
            <li> I have gone thru dozens of $30 to $40 clippers over the years and finally invested in the real deal. It was a great move. I have had these Oster 76 Clippers for 7 months now and use it every week to cut my hair. I use the #0A blade (which I got for an extra $22) and love this machine. No complaints at all. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great product. Built to last. So precise and on point. Good stuff. Great for trimming beard. Good idea to buy this instead of buying others for around $50 every year or two. This one will last and works great. Made from serious materials too, not flimsy plastic like others.</li>
            <li> Upon minutes of use, the machine started making loud/odd noises. the strength of the motor frequently changes as it was running and at one point, the blade actually stopped moving. I have no clue if the product came to me broken, but I purchased it off amazon and it was brand new. Secondly, the machine gets extremely hot, to the point where I&#x27;m scared of holding it.  When I paid over 100 dollars for this, I expected perfection.</li>
            <li> The first set I bought was defective, I returned them without any issues. The new set cuts like butter and it&#x27;s great to have a pair of clippers with a motor from a classic muscle car in your hand.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I was sick of replacing my \\&quot;el-cheapo\\&quot; ones from from department stores. The cheap ones always seemed to break after little use.  I decided to spring for this barber shop quality clipper and I&#x27;ve been very impressed.  Although it was pretty $$$, it was very worth it. From the time I&#x27;ve owned this clipper, I would have replaced 2 or 3 cheaper ones, which would bring me to nearly the price of one of these. It works great and I expect it last for years to come.   I highly recommend this clipper. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny,my hair cant grow fast enuff, want to use them everyday.The sound of the motor is music to my ears.</li>
            <li> The best hair cut u will ever get........  The motor is sooooooo smooth, and the cut will be even ever time, I really really Love them........</li>
            <li> This clipper cuts fast, close and doesn&#x27;t clog up. My previous several years experience with cheap $30-$40 clippers was that they were always the exact opposite of the Oster&#x27;s current performance. The spring set up on the plastic combs means that the won&#x27;t wear out like the chesp snap on inferior combs. Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I previously owned a pair of clippers exactly like these, those lasted me five years. The blades stay sharp and continue to cut as if they were new. This is why I did not hesitate to buy another pair. Shipping was quick and I received the package within five days of ordering. Very pleased with this product!!!</li>
            <li> After 20 years using lower grade clippers (and being relatively satisfied) I purchased these hoping for an improvement.  I  was not disappointed.  The cut is much smoother and done in one pass versus multiple passes with the many cheaper models I have used.  (This is good as unfortunately these clippers do got hot to the touch much faster than cheaper models as well.)&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell in terms of value/longevity but in terms of performance these easily exceed the cheap models.</li>
            <li> I would never buy a 50 dollar pair of clippers again</li>
            <li> Sweet, J\just what I ordered</li>
            <li> This has been great, no issues and it has been more than a year.</li>
            <li> i like it cut very good  it a 5 stars clipper</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands of clippers and have been totally spoiled with these!  I only cut my own families hair, but these clippers are amazing!  They do not come with attachments, so be sure to buy you some!  P.S.  I this little beauty is $219 at Sally&#x27;s.  I&#x27;m checking my reciept and might return them and buy these on Amazon!  Great price!</li>
            <li> This is the top of the line in hair cutting. I&#x27;ve had several cheaper clippers, and they just don&#x27;t compare to the Oster 76. It cuts easy and clean. Its a bit more heavy, than the $29 brand, thats cause the motor is heavy duty and the cutting blades are quality.  It will pay for itself in a few haircuts and you will be happy that you spent the extra few dollars. Its worth it, faster too.  This is the one you see in barber shops everywhere.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast brand new in box</li>
            <li> Worth the money.  Will last forever with the proper care.</li>
            <li> The Oster 76 replaced a worn out Wahl trimmer.  I was pretty pleased w/ the Wahl but decided to purchase this trimmer based upon its reputation as an industry standard and great reviews.  I was not disappointed.  This clipper goes through my tough beard like a hot knife through warm butter.  There is no comparison in terms of cut or quality w/the Wahl.  Sure its more than twice as much but I feel the quality is 3 or 4 times the Wahl. It&#x27;s got a kind of old school look about it.  It won&#x27;t win any beauty contests but I&#x27;m not that anal. I wish I had purchased this clipper sooner.  Big time saver too.  Makes quick work of my beard.  Never realized how much time I was wasting before.  Step up in class, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> I AGREE WITH ALL OF THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ON THIS CLIPPER. I DO NOT KNOW AGREE WITH REVIEWERS THAT SAY THIS CLIPPER IS VERY LOUD. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. IT IS NOT LOUD AT ALL.</li>
            <li> After years of clipping my own hair with a consumer-grade Oster clipper, I finally plunged into the realm of pure clipping bliss with my new toy... the Oster Classic 76!    After repeatedly forgetting in which house I left my old clippers whenever I got the urge to tame my hair, I decided to just get another one so there&#x27;s one in each home. As you may already have read, many folks commented on the size and weight of the clippers, the noise and heat it produced, and the seemingly retro styling of the unit. Well, here&#x27;s my experience and thoughts after I received mine in the mail....    The clipper was smaller than my mental impression from reading others&#x27;reviews; it fit in my hand nicely, and I liked the little extra heft. It was a well balanced heft and it humbly lets you know that it is a serious tool and not a dime-a-dozen gadget! The power cord was similar to that of heavy duty workshop tools and the bold metal name plate/gear cover lets you know that it meant business and was proud of its heritage. The feel of the blade attachments were that of quality craftsmanship and precision. Even though a heavy duty case would have rounded out the ensemble, it remains the only gripe I have with this package.    After plugging it in and powering it on, I couldn&#x27;t help but let out a few little Tim-the-Tool-Man grunts, &#x27; ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh!&#x27;. And, as in the tradition of the Tool Man, I promptly unplugged it and took it all apart to get a glimpse of the source of its apparent power and precision buzz! I wanted to know how it worked, how it was put together, and, most importantly, how to keep it perpetually giddy, too, with grease and oil and all the TLC it deserved. I&#x27;ve got to say... the paperwork that came with the clippers were dismal!!! I got my guidance on maintenance via YouTube.... Do a search for \\&quot;Oster 76 Maintenance with David Guerin the Style Renegade\\&quot;, and you&#x27;ll also be a pro at maintaining your own 76 in 8 minutes and 37 seconds flat!    After verifying allparts and lubrication were in order, I gave myself a high and tight.... From the first gliding pass, I was wide-eyed giddy! It was pure smoooooothness; the motor hummed steadily and effortlessly; and there were no missed hairs! Wow!     It took all of my will to not shave off the top of my head! lol!    Alas, when my girlfriend came home from work, I just had to share my joy!.... As a result, I ended up zipping all of my hair off!    Did I say it was heavenly already?... :)</li>
            <li> i bought this crazy oster and its overheating all the time what a stupid product is this dont buy it .........</li>
            <li> While these clippers might be great for the professional, trying to use them yourself can be quite a task.  They are very heavy and bulky, and get very HOT when used for more than a few minutes. Also when using the #00000 blade, it will cut the hell out of you if you&#x27;re not careful.  I have had a few cuts because of these clippers.  Also do not plan on traveling with these, they weight a ton and are way to big for normal use.</li>
            <li> It has been more than a year that I have had this.  This is by far the best hair clipper that I have owned.  The quality is amazing.  While I was cutting my fathers hair the other day we were talking about how if these clippers were to break we would buy it again without complaining because it is so good (it doesn&#x27;t look like it will break anytime soon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They give you two oils, but I know that one of the them needs to be applied to the actual clipper portion, but I don&#x27;t know where the other oil is supposed to be applied.  There was no instruction that I found in the package it came with.  By the way, that is the only con I could come up with because this is seriously amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t comment on my purchases but I was so impressed by these clippers I&#x27;m making an exception. I have been shaving my head for over 20 years and in that time I&#x27;ve gone through many clippers some cheap some not so cheap and these clipper blow everyone one of them away. Normally it would take me 30 to 40 minutes to cut my hair and beard then shave the remaining stubble but with these clippers I was done in 10 minutes. They are so pleasant to use no pulled hairs, no going over the same area many times and the best thing no loud buzzing motor just a nice gental hum. It was a little bit hard to swallow the price tag but after using them I would have paid even more there just that good. The build quality is excellent you can really feel that these will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Just got this clipper a couple weeks ago and used it for the first time. Well worth the money for a high quality product. I live in Calgary, Alberta Canada and they sell this clipper here for $269 so way cheaper to purchase it on line. The blades that come with it are great and I like my head shaved close. Would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This clipper is everything that it promises to be and more.  I have been using them now about 4 months.  Normally my wife is the hair cutter.  Her grip isn&#x27;t as big as mine and has no problem with the weight or holding on to it.  It is powerful and cuts clean.  It comes with two different blades and they are really easy to interchange.    At the same time I purchase the Oster comb attachments for different styles and lengths.  They work like a well matched piece of equiment and recommend those over the generic brand.  They are a little more but its your hair and its worth it.    You can even cut your own hair with the tried and trued Classic 76 if no one around to cut it for you.  Its really pretty easy.  Just make sure you use the attachment combs.  It is almost fool proof system (see next paragraph, if the shoe fits I wear it sometimes).    The one thing to watch for, as in my case, if cutting your own hair, after just finishing cutting my hair myself, my wife walks in and of course notices a mohawk line of hair right down the middle of the back of my head I missed.  Thank goodness for wives!    Highly recommend.  Spend the money!  These clippers will last you a life time and pay you back over and over.</li>
            <li> I love this hair clipper compare with other brands and models.  It is powerful and the motor just keeps going and going.  Only issue is this hair clipper is heavy and holding over 10 or 15 minutes your wrist will get tired.</li>
            <li> A couple years ago my wife started cutting mine and my sons hair regularly to save $$. I bought a $50 dollar ConAir clipper. It was loud and pulled hair from the get go.  My son tolerated the hair cuts but would rather go to the barber.  After some research (looking to see what the barber was using, and reading reviews), I bought a classic 76.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using these clipper for four months now.  I love these clippers.  No pulling what so ever.  Blades are easy to change out. They cut though my sons thick hair like a knife thu butter.  Other complain about the noise, but I don&#x27;t think they are any louder than any other clipper. It&#x27;s quieter than my old ConAir clipper.  Love the fact that they are MADE in the USA.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for. works well. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The last clipper you&#x27;ll ever need! I use it to shave my beard and head and it does its job well. Few things are more satisfying than shaving your own head and going through your mane with ease, especially after a No Shave marathon. It does tend to get a bit hot after heavy use (10+ minutes), but nothing that will hinder its performance or your comfort. Highly recommended, though it does take a bit of maintenance to keep it in tip-top shape (though no where near as much as it took me to maintain my straightedge).</li>
            <li> This thing is a horse and I am so glad I bought it. I have been giving myself haircuts for almost 10 years and have always used the \\&quot;StoreMart\\&quot; brand clippers that come in a $20 kit. After having gone through about five of these kits in the last 10 years, I finally decided to get a good set of clippers. Found this online, read the other reviews, and bit the bullet.     I have to say that this thing is amazing. When you turn it on, the first thing you notice is the sound. Not a buzzing \\&quot;hum\\&quot; like the other cheap versions, but a machine-like whirl. After reading that these are used for all day salon use, I think it will hold up to my head twice a week.     I wish it had come with a protective case or pouch, but I&#x27;ll get over it.</li>
            <li> From the moment you plug and click on this product, listsen to it&#x27;s motor, you began to regret all the dollars wasted on cheaper versions, you deserve better, you deserve Rolls Royce.    I used it on myself,  and didn&#x27;t at all find the wieght to be an issue, it was over emphasized on some of the others reviews.</li>
            <li> Product is solid and cuts well.  Blades are very short, and will not be for everyone.  I have ordered longer blades (not cheap) and will continue to use.  Cutting ones own hair is not easy (especially the back).  Hope I will improve with time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been clipper cutting my own hair for over 15 years now, and I used these Oster Classic 76 for over two years. I really like the Classic 76 and highly recommend it. It has a lot of power and cuts hair easily, and it&#x27;s an outstanding clipper. The detachable metal blades are much more comfortable to me than the plastic guides that you can buy, too. However...it&#x27;s not perfect. It runs a bit hot and can be loud, and it&#x27;s not a small set of clippers. The newer A6 (marketed for pet grooming, but great for human hair) is slimmer, quieter, and cooler running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are already many, many review for the Classic 76.  Like I said already, it&#x27;s a great set of clippers.  I&#x27;d just like to give you some info about the A6 to maybe help you choose between them.  After getting the A6, I stopped using the 76.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things that stood out to me after getting the A6 and comparing it to the Classic 76:&lt;br /&gt;(*) The A6 is a more rounded shape, but it&#x27;s not that much smaller than the Classic 76. Holding them felt about the same to me, with the A6 being just a little easier&lt;br /&gt;(*) The cord on the A6 is nice and long, but Oster added a transformer box that hangs about a foot away from the outlet. That box will be well out of the way if you use this professionally, though&lt;br /&gt;(*) The A6 has three speeds versus one speed on my 76&lt;br /&gt;(*) The A6 is quieter on low and medium speeds, but it&#x27;s about the same as the 76 on high speed. It is a lower pitch, though, which I happen to prefer. It&#x27;s a bit less abrasive to me&lt;br /&gt;(*) The A6 does not vent air out the sides - which is excellent! The 76 cools the motor by flowing air from the base to two vents on the sides, and the warm air blows on me (or your clients) while clipping&lt;br /&gt;(*) The A6 does run cooler on the handle. After using it for a good 20 minutes, the handle wasn&#x27;t even warm. The blade sure was, but that&#x27;s no different than my experience with the 76 (and why I bought some of Oster&#x27;s cooling spray)&lt;br /&gt;(*) The A6 requires you to depress a button before the blade will swing out - that&#x27;s nice. I&#x27;ve never had a blade swing out accidentally on my 76, but I can imagine a clipper getting bumped during professional use, so the added locking mechanism is a nice addition&lt;br /&gt;(*) The A6 seems to vibrate a bit more in my hand than the 76, but I think it&#x27;s that it vibrates at a different frequency (similar to the sound). It&#x27;s definitely not so bad that I don&#x27;t want to use it, but it is noticeable&lt;br /&gt;(*) The A6 doesn&#x27;t require (or really allow) you to periodically replace grease. As a non-professional user, I like that. The 76 might hold up better over a long period of time because you can do maintenance on it, but I like the thought of not having to put in new grease - and I have on mine, even just using it every other week or so on myself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The A6 doesn&#x27;t seem to cut any better or worse than the Classic 76, but the cooler handle and the (to me) more enjoyable noise level give it the edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think both models are great clippers.  To me, the lower pitch noise, cooler running handle, added button for blade release, and no need to grease it put the A6 a bit ahead of the Classic 76 to me - but not so far that I&#x27;d highly recommend one model over the other.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t think that you&#x27;d go wrong with either model.A6 requires you to depress a button before the blade will swing out - that&#x27;s nice.

            <li> Very durable and powerful machine.  I&#x27;m in the military and just upgraded from the local superstore cheapo brand.  What a difference.  This thing eats hair.  Usually only takes one pass to catch everything.</li>
            <li> Like many others, I have a whole drawer full of $20 clippers.  After getting tired of spending more on my dogs than my whole family for haircuts, I decided to purchase a real clipper and see if I could groom the dogs myself.  I cannot believe how well these clippers handled the matted hair of my dogs.  Right out of the box, these worked great, giving the dogs a nice even cut.  I used them for 90 minutes and there was no problem at all.  Definitely a great purchase!</li>
            <li> Made in the USA and built like a tank. I love these clippers. I decided to ante up for the Osters after going through at least one set of cheap clippers a year with pretty low usage. They seem to be completely rebuild-able if they wear out or break down and they have great solid feel to them. They can shave my monkey in less than five minutes without any tugging on his hair.</li>
            <li> I have been slightly balding over the last few years and have taken on the task of cutting my own hair. I feel that in my situation, going to any of the box-store hair places is of little value for the price that you pay for the service and the tip on top of it. Therefore, a couple months back I purchased the Oster Pro 76 clippers. They are great!! The blades are super sharp and do a FAR better job then any inexpensive clipper set could ever do. The standard #00 and #1 blades that come with the clippers are great, but both are a little too short for my liking. So, recently I purchased the #2 blade and it is just about right.    Other reviews have stated that these clippers are bulky and are hard to use if you are giving yourself the trim. I found that it is not very hard to self-administer the cut. Sure, the cord gets in the way occasionally, but not to a point of frustration. After switching from my cheap, $50 clippers with the plastic guards, the time that it took to cut my own hair was \\&quot;cut\\&quot; in half. I highly recommend these clippers. They are well worth the money and have already paid for themselves in the savings from not having to visit a barber or stylist. One flaw maybe is that Oster doesn&#x27;t include any sort of storage or carrying case.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different clippers, and these are the best. I highly recommend these to all the do it your self ers out there.</li>
            <li> It was hard to even consider spending so much on a set of clippers but when I do the math of replacing cheaper versions and the number or cuts per year it makes sense.  These things are amazing and feel like the could scalp you if you slip.  Love them and feel like I made a purchase that will last for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> We finally got around to using the clippers (unfortunately past the return date) and found that the #000 blade that came with it doesn&#x27;t fit this product. This was confirmed by our local barber. What a rip off! We specifically bought these for their close/bald shaving performance. Now we have to spend more money to buy the correct blade. What a hassle! And to think, we spent $125 (with shipping) to still not be able to cut hair. What a shame!</li>
            <li> I have owned Oster products before and thought this would be a good buy.  Unfortunately, when I tried to change the blade, it was difficult, if not, impossible to do.  The instruction manual obviously doesn&#x27;t expect blade changes on the fly because there are no diagrams.  I now have a product that is just sitting dismantled and have no way of getting it back together.  I will be calling OsterPro and letting them know of my displeasure.  For a product this expensive, the blades should change themselves.  I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love Oster machines. Amazon sent it just as described.It came with two agIon blades.Some sellers lie, Amazon does not. Love it. Thing seems like it&#x27;s made to last. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I only paid for the cheapest shipping rate which was 5 to 7 business days but i received the product in 2 days. I was very pleased.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair easily and efficiently.  Detachable blades give much flexiblity for length of hair, which makes it great for cutting your own hair as I do.  Fading is easily accomplished.</li>
            <li> What can I say. These are professional hair clippers and quality made. If your going to spend 50 or 60 dollars on something cheaper it doesn&#x27;t make sense. Buy the Oster Classic 76 and have a lasting product.</li>
            <li> These are the same type of clippers my barber has used on my head for years. I decided to save some money and do my own hair. I keep it one length so its easy to do myself. These clippers are a breeze. They cut smoothly and precisely. They cut as close as you want and the blade change is very easy to do, yet secure. I am a black guy and it cuts my hair perfectly.  I have tried a few others but these are by far the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> As others have said.....these are great clippers. They are easy to maintain, built to last, and cut hair with ease.</li>
            <li> after many years of cutting my own hair with $30-ish clippers....i finally decided to get a professional clipper.. for those of you that cut your own hair...throw or give away those cheap clippers. this will be the only 1 you will ever need!!</li>
            <li> If the $50 clippers from wally world are the Yugo of hair clippers this is the $2M Italian handmade sports car of clippers. There is no comparison. This thing DESTROYS hair. Hair doesn&#x27;t stand a chance. It&#x27;s like hair genocide or something.  If you are like me and you just want to remove all hair from your head down to a millimeter length or so this thing will do the job in no time flat.You wont need someone to tell you that you missed a spot because this thing will mow down all of your hair, if you pass it over your head the hair will be gone.</li>
            <li> I have bought cheap clippers from department stores for years.  I have ended up throwing them away after a short time, they just quit or do not cut my hair right anymore.  None have ever cut my hair like this one  -even when new.    These Oster clippers are the best I have ever used, like at the barber shop.  The cost is well worth the quality!!</li>
            <li> Good clipper for taking down hair. This clipper will cut hair pretty fast. That being said you will need to be somewhat &amp;#34;experienced&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;skilled&amp;#34; to use this clipper and its blades (that you will need to buy separately) for blending or fading. All around good clipper. I give it 4 stars for its power and ability to cut through any thickness of hair with ease. The reason I did NOT give it 5 stars is because of the price of the machine and also the price of the blades that are not all included. In my opinion you can get the same results from buying a better quality NON detachable clipper like an Andis Master, Oster Fast feed, or a Wahl senior for a more reasonable price. The reason why I bought this was because it does save some time when taking down hair and also I like to use and collect different clippers and challenge my skills as an up and coming barber.</li>
            <li> I use so many types hair clippers,but this one Best I ever used. Very good Service and Price. Thank You.</li>
            <li> THIS REVIEW IS FOR SOMEONE LOOKING FOR CLIPPERS TO SHAVE THEIR HEAD ONLY.  This is not a comprehensive review on the overall usefulness of the Oster 76!     I bought the Oster 76 clippers to shave my head.  I shave my head about once/twice a week.      Pros:     -Cut well  -Built well  -Comes with 2 blades    Cons:    -THESE CLIPPERS HURT IF YOU ARE SHAVING YOUR HEAD  -Get very hot when using  -Have to shave very slowly to avoid cutting your self and or experiencing pain (not useful for someone who shaves head frequently)  -Expensive  -They do not glide smoothly  -Clunky and awkward with a big grip  -Are not battery operated...plug in only.  Not convenient for a quick grab and shave  -No carrying case or any type of storage for that matter    I found myself having to go over spots because the handle is awkward and the blade would stick to my head.  My head was completely dry and I wasn&#x27;t doing anything out of my daily routine.    Final verdict:  I am returning these and would not recommend for someone looking to shave their head often.  Instead I would prefer a smoother gliding blade that was chargeable and a bit smaller.    To each his own!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 6 months now and find it to be a very good clipper.  I use it to shave my head and needed to get a 00000 blade to cut as close as I wanted to. The 000 blade it comes with is good, but not low enough for me. It is very easy to change and clean blades. The two blades are fused into one unit so they stay perfectly aligned. I have had other popular brand name clippers that didn&#x27;t last long and became misaligned easily. I know this one will always stay aligned and I am hoping it lasts long. It is well made and should last longer than the others. I am very impressed with how well it is designed and can understand why it is a favorite of barbers. Blades are somewhat expensive so it is probably best to get them on eBay.</li>
            <li> This is a great pair of clipper</li>
            <li> We originally bought \\&quot;cheap-o\\&quot; clippers from a local department store and struggled using them twice.  They mostly just pulled my thick hair.  We reviewed some consumers appraisal&#x27;s on the Oster Classic 76 and decided to bite the bullet and spend the money for the Oster.  Bottom line - money well spent!!!  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on anything else!</li>
            <li> I should have purchased this item years ago. Even though it&#x27;s a little bulky, the clipper does a good job. Prior to this purchase, I&#x27;ve gone through at least four other lesser clippers. I&#x27;m sure this one will last longer than I will.</li>
            <li> Out of all the researching i had done, the Oster Classic 76 came out on top! My sister loves it and i will now have free haircuts FOREVER with these clippers! It cuts with ease through my hair which clogs most other clippers and also leaves a nice clean finish (no clipper streaks or stripes).</li>
            <li> I decided to get rid of all my hair, and didn&#x27;t want to keep paying barbers to shave my head. I also didn&#x27;t want to go through the trouble of shaving my head with a razor, the way I shave my face. So I went and paid for this real clipper an a 000 blade to do it myself. It&#x27;s already paid for itself considering I haven&#x27;t been to a barber since. You have to make sure you maintain it properly with oil and brushing and such, but it&#x27;s not much.</li>
            <li> 30 bucks for a haircut and shampoo at supercuts. 30 + for a rubbish pair of clippers ,,, for me is was time to grow up and buy these with  1A clip.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to compliment my Oster Fastfeed clippers.&lt;br /&gt; The Oster Classic 76&#x27;s cut through hair like butter. The are not heavy(too me) and they fit my hands perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> This works great but it gets very hot when using</li>
            <li> Ive been cutting my own hair for a few years now and owned andis masters which are pretty good also,and im here to say that these by far are the best clippers ive ever cut hair with. I know the price will make you hesitate like I did,but im here to say they will pay for themselves. My faids are allot better now. GO BUY THEM!!!!</li>
            <li> Item was delivered as expected. Works very great. I under estimated this clipper. This clipper cuts super. I am not a barber, but I bought it to cut my own hair and my two sons. This is a must have clipper. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the clipper for about 6 months.  It cuts nicely.  Very durable and worth the investment.  They ONLY thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s a little heavy and I often have to take a \\&quot;hand break.\\&quot;  Other than that, it&#x27;s worth it.  If you Google\video search this clipper, there are videos on how to use it and care for it.</li>
            <li> Great product, speedy delivery</li>
            <li> ...after the last few clipper cuts he gave me left me with patches of hairs longer than the others. Figured I could handle a clipper with guides to get my buzz cut on, and I can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing has the feel of a good solid machine. After reading the reviews here, I expected as much. It gives me the impression that if I have kids later on in life, I might be cutting their kid&#x27;s hair with this clipper some day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality is worth the price. Don&#x27;t waste your money on a cheap product you&#x27;ll have to replace yearly (or more).</li>
            <li> i recently trashed my Remington clippers that I bought from Amazon, they worked for a short period of time, then totally quit. Made in China of course, wish Amazon would display where all of the products that they offer are manufactured, I have thrown away more made in China crap than I care to remember. These clippers show up the other day, heavy, which is good, soundly constructed, will more than likely work till I&#x27;m way past the need for them, and made in the USA. Kudos to Oster!</li>
            <li> Pro barbers around the world use this clipper. This clipper should last you a lifetime, a true commercial grade clipper.</li>
            <li> Wish I had bought these 15 months ago when my wife began giving me monthly buzz cuts. The previous Oster cool vibes just didn&#x27;t perform. Thanks Oster company for offering online 15 min. maintenance video.&lt;br /&gt;. Yes, these aren&#x27;t cheap, but  after 30 seconds, 59 year old wife liked how easily they cut and performed. Not noisy or hot either. As many have stated, Classic 76 will be your last home hair clippers!</li>
            <li> Heavy duty clippers, great for shaving my own head. I&#x27;m sure this bad boy will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I shave my head twice a month (#1)... have been using a Conair, Wahl and Norelco $35-$50 kit type clippers over the last 10 years...(IDIOTIC!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had only known how superior a good pair of clippers (either these OR the Andis BRC), I&#x27;d have plunked down the $100-ish dollars the first time!  STUPIDLY I&#x27;ve tried to \\&quot;save money\\&quot; buy periodically replacing my failing cheap&#x27;ohs with other cheap&#x27;ohs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These quite literally fall through your hair while removing it.  Wet, dry... it simply doesn&#x27;t matter... like a hot knife through butter, but easier than that.  They do get warm when doing your whole head, but not hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THESE NOW!</li>
            <li> First, a disclaimer: We did not purchase this through Amazon, as they were not available at the time. Now, on to the brief review: The Classic 76 in our household has been running for over three years now, without so much as a hiccup. We had also purchased a set of the plastic guide combs at the same time, which work very well. At this point, the set of clippers has already paid for itself multiple times over. If you figure you spend $20 on a haircut every month, that works out to be $240 a year. In my case, I was getting my hair cut every three weeks or so (buzz cut) -- so that&#x27;s even more of a long-term savings. Once the word got out, other family members wanted to stop by and get their hair cut, too. We&#x27;ve even had people in the grocery store ask who our barber is. All in all, this was an expensive initial purchase, but the money and time savings are priceless. Just remember to sanitize the blades and guides (they make an aerosol spray for this), and lube the blades periodically to maximize your investment.</li>
            <li> Best clippers I have ever owned!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Awesome clipper. So easy to use. The trunk can quickly become too hot to handle. However, It gives amazing cut at first attempt.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair in a simple military style so what I want from a clipper is reliability, sturdiness, a quiet motor and, most importantly, a smooth and even clip.  This workhorse of the professional barbershop has everything I need, particularly in this simple package with lubricant and an extra cutting blade.  In comparison to other clipper sets I have owned, the Oster Classic has an easy &#x27;flip open&#x27; blade holder that facilitates simple cleaning without having to unscrew a back plate.  I find it stays cool and comfortable throughout my cut and that clippings load up less than on the clipper I&#x27;m replacing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Home barbers who are good with mirrors or work on other family members can find a quality range of clip-on guides to help in tapering cuts or in cutting styles to a few (still relatively short business-cut) lengths.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this item is one of my most productive purchase in years. A sturdy and heavy &#x27;old school&#x27; clipper, it is not water proof, not cordless but this is the most powerful and perfect clipper I have ever had. I have had Norelco and Panasonic clippers in the past years, both of which have proved to be far inferior compared to this product. Comes in a box with two blades #1 and #000, clipper grease and clipper oil with a brush.     I have attempted to cut my own hair and almost always needed my wife&#x27;s help. After watching some \\&quot;how to\\&quot; YouTube videos, I attempted to use this bad boy myself and just after one pass with #1 blade I was startled with the results. In less than 5 minutes and three passes I clipped my hair like a pro. It is easy to clean and store.    Undoubtedly a King of all clippers and professional barbers recommended. It is worth every penny, if you want to save your time and money and give yourself a professional look this is a must have. Don&#x27;t waste your money in cheap plastic clippers. This is a durable pro clipper that you will never regret.    I just wish this came with a storing bag and some guiding comb.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS EVERY MONTH OR TWO FOR A FULL SHAVE.. I STAND IN FRONT OF MIRROR AND I SHAVE FROM NECK DOWN.  I STAY COOLER.. WHEN I GET OUT OF THE SHOWER I DRY OFF IN HALF THE TIME.  I DON&#x27;T NEED TO SPEND FOREVER DRYING MY CHEST AND LEGS.. FULL BODY SHAVE AND I AM HAPPY. GREAT ITEM</li>
            <li> great product. quick shipping. amazing price.  very happy.  i use this product regularly at work so it is important to have a quality tool and not to go with out it also. this company and amazon did a great job keeping me satisfied. i will shop here again.</li>
            <li> It cuts very well , I just wish that it would have included the # 2 metal guard :(&lt;br /&gt;I really like it though. My bf was very happy. But like I said he was a little sad that it didn&#x27;t come with the #2 metal guard. Thank you so much. Enjoy your day :)</li>
            <li> If Milwaukee made hair clippers instead of power tools this is what they would be. This isn&#x27;t a pair of hair clippers, it&#x27;s an industrial piece of equipment. They work much, much better than the big box clippers and appear to be built to last for many years.  I like the fact that parts are available from the manufacturer (rare these days and getting more rare every year), they&#x27;re user serviceable (let&#x27;s face it: if you can&#x27;t repair your own clippers you probably shouldn&#x27;t be cutting your own hair anyway; maybe let your girlfriend fix them instead), and they&#x27;re designed to be maintained rather than thrown away. The metal blade guides are a huge step up from the cheap plastic guides and dull blades and replacement blade sets are reasonably priced. I grabbed a #2 set from Amazon for the price of a disposable set of clippers from China Mart.  Sure, you can buy four pairs of cheap clippers for the same price, but they won&#x27;t work anything like these or last very long. This is a very nice tool for the toolbox and a lifetime purchase. If you&#x27;ve got the cashola and are committed to cutting your own hair often enough to offset the purchase price, do it.</li>
            <li> Not Strained, time tested and properly balanced. A well thought out system that will work with its many accessories. Hopefully they stay with this product rather than as most companies try to reduce the quality while increasing the price.</li>
            <li> I like them.&lt;br /&gt;They are pretty beefy.&lt;br /&gt;Seems to have plenty of power.&lt;br /&gt;They are a bit cumbersome to use by yourself due to there size and weight but I can get it done.&lt;br /&gt;Easy blade change with quick detach.&lt;br /&gt;Standard blade works for trimming eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;I hope these clippers last a long time as I have heard they have.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t confuse this product with the Wahl and Conair buzzers you may have bought from the drugstore. It&#x27;s a totally different tool. Very durable, easy to use, fantastic quality, worth every penny. Don&#x27;t expect the \\&quot;buzz\\&quot; sound as you cut your hair, it just cuts. Also, I found it much easier to handle than some of the reviews suggested.    Few cons: wish it came with a blade that was between the two that came with the buzzer, so will probably have to buy a new size. Minor nit - the product is actually dark \\&quot;blood\\&quot; red, not bright red as the picture may lead you to believe.     Overall, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I can see why professionals love this clipper. It ain&#x27;t messing around!&lt;br /&gt;For personal/home use its probably a little too much; in retrospect I should have focused on something more portable and easier to manage, as I just use it to shave my own head (and face, when I&#x27;m too lazy to properly shave).&lt;br /&gt;But you cannot deny it is a great set of clippers- don&#x27;t have to run over the target area more than once.</li>
            <li> Very solid, very quiet. Great performer. I&#x27;ve had it for a year and believe I will have it for the rest of my life. The Oster blades are incredibly well built.</li>
            <li> Love everything about it... exhaust fan, powerful, and extremely user-friendly.  Cord is heavy duty.  Only thing about it is no case. Box is bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for 25+ years and have always used one of those big box store kits with the plastic guards. My fades were never as good as the barber&#x27;s fades. 5 years ago I switched to the Oster Classic 76. It made all the difference in the world. If you want a professional hair cut you have to use a professional&#x27;s tools. Oster is fundamental to producing professional hair cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plastic guards flex and bend when you apply pressure (not to mention they fall off and shave bald spots in your head). Every flex and bend produces a different cut length. The result is a patchy looking hair cut/fade. With Oster Classic, the guards are steel. They don&#x27;t bend.  It&#x27;s one consistent cut length for each guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you go Oster you&#x27;ll never go back.</li>
            <li> Uh... this is the Rolls Royce of hair clippers. As a regular head-shaver, I will NEVER go back to any other brand of buzzer, do your research Oster 76 is KING.</li>
            <li> I received the Classic 76 hair clipper. This hair clipper is by far the best set I have owned. I have been cutting my hair for over ten years and believe me, I know a good pair of clippers. I used the 000 size blade attachement that comes with the Clippers without a problem. The clippers zipped through with no problem. I was done shaving my head faster than usual. I just ordered the 00000 size cutting blade attachment to get an even closer cut. I am impressed. By the way, this clipper is not loud like the cheap home cutting kits that are sold by Wahl or Andis. Another bonus of owning this hair clipper is that the internal and external components can be replaced just by ordering through the Oster company. I&#x27;m sure this will be the last pair of hair clippers I&#x27;ll ever have to buy.</li>
            <li> Awesome Product. Classic 76 Professional is a very good product.  Quality design and construction.  I purchased 2 of them.  Great.</li>
            <li> Good manufacturing very well made, a bit heavy, which means it has a very strong motor.  Easy to handle chasis, easy to grip, good length extention cord. Manufactured to feel and work like the classic 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s clippers.</li>
            <li> Should have bought this years ago. The cheap ones just aren&#x27;t worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I have owned these since 2007, and the blades that came with it are still cutting quite well. I should probably look into buying a new set, but why would I bother when they are still working?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 11/25/14&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong. Not only that: I just recently had to purchase a new blade. I definitely have gotten what I paid for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a barber by trade and I use clippers all day long. I have used an Oster 76 for over 25 years. In the \\&quot;old days\\&quot; the quality of Osters were much better than they are today but, even though they don&#x27;t last as long as I think they should, I still use one because I think it is the best for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can afford it I would recommend replacing all your blades when you buy a new clipper because in my experience the old blades make the new clipper wear out faster. But if you just use it at home for your own haircutting, this clipper should last you a lifetime, unlike the drug store brands. If you experience the blade getting too hot try using some oil on the blade before you start it up. If you experience too much trouble cutting your own hair, come in and see your barber!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a Forfex FX690cb because it seemed like a less expensive version of the 76&#x27;s but the only really good thing about it was the ceramic blades it came with. It made such a high pitched whine I couldn&#x27;t stand using it all day. Plus it would start out slow and then ramp up the longer it was on. I think they are pretty much just junk. If you&#x27;re just cutting your own hair at home it might be a less expensive alternative to the 76&#x27;s but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although they certainly aren&#x27;t the quality they used to be the Oster 76&#x27;s are still the standard in the barber business.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my hair off and on for about 10 years now, and had always done so with cheaper clippers. There is hardly even a comparison between these and the $25 - $50 pairs you find at local stores. They&#x27;re exactly what I was hoping for and needing.</li>
            <li> i purchased this item a few weeks ago and im like re united with and old dependable friend.I used these clippers back in my younger days when i was a prison barber.I used them all day almost every day and never had any problems.And now that im older i decided to go with the best,only one bad thing is that they dont come with storage box to keep secure when not in use,other then that i recomend this product.</li>
            <li> I had these clippers for 2.5 years and used them about once a month. The plastic housing broke just by wear and tear. For $120 I expected them to last longer. Other than that I was pleased. I would recommend them with that warning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic, what can I say? I have never had a trimmer this well built before. Cuts and cleans with no problems and is always ready for me, my brother, or my dad to use when needed. I bought the spray and some barbicide to keep all my tools clean and I&#x27;ve not had a single problem in 2 months. I&#x27;m pretty sure this trimmer will last at least 10 years. Also the blades change quick so even if one did rust or dull, for $20 you get a new one and it&#x27;s like new until the motor goes on you. It&#x27;s about twice the weight of a walmart brand trimmer, but as long as you&#x27;re ok with that it&#x27;s perfect (other than the high price).    Buy this and you won&#x27;t regret it. Especially if you trim your hair weekly or more like I do.</li>
            <li> this clipper seem to be so much better than my old wahl clipper i had. this one is almost a one pass cut with virtually nothing left behind</li>
            <li> Work great! Exactly what I was looking for and at a great price after doing some research! Sad I missed out on the awesome mustache printed clippers.</li>
            <li> You have to buy all attachment blades seperate...</li>
            <li> Best Clippers!  Great price!</li>
            <li> It is very challenging to find a product that feels durable and performs well.  This trimmer is the rare exception.  Reminds me of a time when American products were built to last,  a time before light weight plastic and flimsy imports were the norm.&lt;br /&gt;It cuts hair with ease and precision.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This was a GREAT price for these clippers! They are easy to use and provide excellent results for my dogs.</li>
            <li> So far I used the clipper only once but I can say for certain this is by far the most powerful machine I have ever used and I used quite a few.  It was easy to clean after use, and it seems pretty simple to switch blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was delivered on time via Canada Post and with no added cost even though I live in Canada (same product on amazon.ca was CAD$100 more).&lt;br /&gt;In the box I found all that was promised (size #1 and #000 detachable Croygen-x blades, blade guard, blade oil, clipper grease, cleaning brush and instruction sheet) and of course the clipper.&lt;br /&gt;One thing that prevented the experience from being perfect is that the polystyrene foam packaging was broken and it was very difficult to get rid of the small particles which insisted on sticking to my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None the less I would still rate it as 5 stars experience because so far the product is exactly as claimed.</li>
            <li> Great clippers.... easy to use!!!</li>
            <li> Real quick- I researched high and low and finally bought the Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 clippers about 2 years ago and they are fantastic.      Yes, they are over $100, but they are worth every dollar.  Don&#x27;t waste money on cheap models that will wear out too soon.    I use the clippers every week to trim my own hair and I&#x27;m quite satisfied.  I decided to write a review as I&#x27;m about to buy a few more attachments as I will also trim my dog (or at least try) instead of paying $100 every time he gets a bath and haircut.  I&#x27;ll update this review at a later point and give the low down on that experiment...</li>
            <li> The Oster76 clipper is easy to operate, the blades are easy to change and it is very efficient and powerful when it comes to cutting hair.</li>
            <li> Bought an Oster 76 Classic clipper, along with a #1.5 and #2 blade for haircut purposes.  This was a pretty big initial money layout, but has saved me several hundred dollars thus far on haircuts for my three young boys.  I have no formal barber training and after several rounds of practice (where I would practice doing fades then just buzz down my hack job one clipper size for an even cut), I got quite good at the fade and can now give barber shop quality haircuts to my three boys.  I attribute this less to my skills and more to the fact that the Oster 76 and the blades work terrific.  The 76 feels very substantial and durable, with a strong, quiet, motor that cuts extremely smooth.  Blade changing is simple and this unit requires very little to maintain.  What you see in the picture is what you get delivered.  The clipper is professional quality and it is exactly what my barber uses.  I believe this will last for many years.&lt;br /&gt;At $15+tip/haircut x 3 boys x 12 months &#x3D; $720/year, this system has more than paid for itself.  Plus, it is kind of fun giving haircuts.  After seeing my boys, several family and friends have asked me to cut their hair, too, so I can only figure I am doing a pretty good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 9/2017:  This clipper is still going strong.  I use it slightly less often because my boys are old enough to go to the barber, but it still gets used plenty for grooming and touch-ups and it works as well as it did on day 1.</li>
            <li> This bad boy has quite the motor in it. Tough as nails. American made quality. However, it does make a lot of noise, is heavy, gets hot, and doesn&#x27;t have an ergonomic design. It would be tough to hold this thing all day cutting hair. It works fine for me though as I only use it to cut my hair and trim my beard once every two weeks.</li>
            <li> I have cut my own hair for several years and after using an inexpensive Wahl clipper I decided to spend the extra money on a professional clipper.  I am so glad I finally made this purchase.  I love using these clippers.  The difference between the quality of the Classic 76 and department store bought clippers is tremendous.  The Classic 76 has the power to give you a comfortable and effortless haircut.  No binding or catching hair.  This clipper just mows through even thick hair with no problem.  The Classic 76 does require some minor maintenance, like oiling the blades, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.  Oster has videos on youtube that describe how to maintain the 76 and as a bonus they are hilariously cheesy.  If you cut your own hair don&#x27;t hesitate.  Buy these clippers!</li>
            <li> It is big but does the job.  I especially like the fact that it contained two clipper heads, one short and one long.</li>
            <li> A professional grade clipper to last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re ready to step up from the cheap disposables most people try to get by with, the Classic 76 is worth considering. All of the parts are serviceable and replaceable meaning it will be around for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said... these are huge clippers - and whether you can adjust to that or not, the size is still less than ideal. There are other models, from Oster and others, in this same price range that might be more appropriate for the average person.</li>
            <li> Very good, its brand new n cuts like it says , its my favourite item . Thank you very much</li>
            <li> Everything my friends said it would be and shipped a lot quicker than they said it would.  A great choice for a serious pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> I went through two sets of cheapo wahl trimmers before I was finally fed up with the piece of crap plastic combs before I decided to get this. This trimmer is so much better it is not even a fair comparison. The metal blades cut perfectly. They are easy to clean and change, and they don&#x27;t fall off!!! The trimmer itself does exhaust hot air, something the wahl never did. I am guessing because this motor is vented and built to last instead of just burnout. The trimmer is expensive and the blades are too but if you cut your own hair it is silly not to invest in something like this. Pays for itself in just a few cuts and will last years.</li>
            <li> This has got to be one of my best investments. This cut my home haircutting time by more than half compared to my old clippers.</li>
            <li> I shave my own head about every 2 weeks, and I have been doing so for almost 10 years now. I spent most of that time buying a new set of the cheapest clippers available and running them into the ground, which only took about a year for most. I finally decided to try a higher end model to see what the difference would be. I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing all those years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was that these clippers were much more substantial than the cheap ones I had been using. It has more heft, the cord is thicker and more substantial, even the blades appear much tougher. I expected more power would mean more noise, but I was happily surprised that these clipppers are actually far quieter than the old ones I had been using. Changing blades was another task I expected to be more difficult, but unlike the old clippers I didn&#x27;t even need any tools to remove/replace the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of that is nice, but what really struck me is just how much better these clippers cut my hair. The hair on the back of my head is pretty thick and I&#x27;m used to making multiple passes to get all of it cut. I&#x27;m also used to moving reasonably slowly to avoid pulling or uneven cut. These clippers need none of those precautions. They cut through my hair so smoothly and quickly that at first I didn&#x27;t think they were cutting at all. So far I have found that these clippers produce a perfectly even cut the first pass every time, this cuts down on the time it takes to cut my hair and it also reduces wear on the motor. I have not had a single pull and no heating of the motor or blades which occurred with every other clipper I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect these clippers will last quite a bit longer than the other ones I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. I&#x27;m just kicking myself for waiting this long before getting these.</li>
            <li> I use the 76 as a finishing tool when cutting my hair in conjunction with the Oster #00000 blade. It is extremely smooth and quiet but does get warm after a very short period of use. This is not a problem for me as I only use it for myself. It was a little bit awkward to use to groom my mustache at first but after a few attempts it became much easier.&lt;br /&gt;  As this was my first hair clipper I reviewed the many reviews made by purchasers of both other brands and their models as well as Osters models and found the Classic 76 to have the best reviews with the least negative reviews.&lt;br /&gt;  My only wish is that they would offer blade protecters on all their blades for storage purposes. And finally I love the old fashioned fantastic quality of the 76 and I expect it to last for the rest of my life and turning 73 this month I have no doubt it will.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting one of these for many years.  My old clipper finally gave up to justify the purchase.  Of course this clipper pays for itself quite quickly if compared to the cost and inconvenience of going to a barber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one I ordered got almost too hot to hold.  I called Oster customer service and they confirmed that something was wrong and to send it back.  Two days later I got the second clipper.  I let it run for a solid 10 minutes.  It got warm, but not hot.  Of course Amazon customer service is great and the replacement was quick and easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is excellent quality.  I gave myself a very nice cut.  I purchased the 00000 size blade in addition to those that come with the clipper so that I can shave off my beard easily when called for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Love it. Pro unit, solid a bit heavy but that&#x27;s to be expected. Pretty sealed off in that I don&#x27;t have to worry about hair going inside the housing. It can get warm, again to be expected but nothing that would cause concern or have you stop to wait for cool down. Very easy to switch the blades and it does a great job if you&#x27;re looking for a clean and tight cut. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have cut my own hair since high school and have always used the run of the mill clippers.  Since I need a new set every few years, I decided to bite the bullet and get these....and let me say, they are not run of the mill.  These are industrial grade.  The body cavity is bigger and heavier than the kind you get at the pharmacy, Target or Walmart.  If you are cutting somebody&#x27;s hair, no problem, but it&#x27;s a little more difficult to cut your own.  I&#x27;m not talking like your arm will be tired, more a little more cumbersome.  If you need to set speed records, you are better off going with a cheaper grade.....if you want a better cut and a clipper that will last longer, get these.</li>
            <li> I have no issues to report with this clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have relatively large hands so I don&#x27;t have any issues gripping this.&lt;br /&gt;I clip my own hair and the only issue that is a slight hassle is the cord getting in the way.&lt;br /&gt;As for noise.  This is quieter than the clippers they use at the barbershop attached to the vacuum cleaner and even quieter than my electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot.  Though I am in it for the quick buzz cuts I haven&#x27;t had the thing running for more than 20min tops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I am not sure about is proper cleaning.  The instructions aren&#x27;t as helpful as I would of liked.</li>
            <li> I did some research before purchasing this product. Professional grade and it was well worth the money I spent on it. Works great!</li>
            <li> After going through several 15-30 dollar clippers. I decided to step up to a \\&quot;hopefully\\&quot; longer lasting better quality clippers. I was not denied. These clippers are awesome! They melted away the hair on my head like a hot knife through butter. Effortless, I cut my hair in a fraction of the time it took me with my old clippers. Smooth and quit running for such a powerful machine.</li>
            <li> I have been out of Barber School for a year, I was told about the clippers and thought their was no way the clippers could be that good..Boy was I wrong!!! The best money can buy...The motor is very strong, easy to handle. Product was at my door within 2 days.. Amazon had the best price on the clippers.I recevied as a christmas gift  Thanks Amazon  Heather</li>
            <li> a classic,always good.Just don&#x27;t be careless and drop it like I do once a year, have it break and then have to spend 145.00 for a new one.But yes ,its a great professional machine!</li>
            <li> High quality product, comes with &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; length blades. After 10 minutes it will become warm but not so much that will feel uncomfortable on your skin. Electric cord is about 6 ft long and flexible so it is easy to maneuver with it. It doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy but it is definitely heaver than cheap plastic ones. Did not regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best set of clippers I have ever used.  At first I balked at paying the price since they&#x27;re just for home use, but I would do it again in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a lot of Wahls over the years, but decided to take a new approach after the last one broke with less than a year of light use. After searching for what barbers and stylists were using, I noticed that the Oster 76 model kept reappearing in discussions of \\&quot;must own\\&quot; clippers. Although it was a bit more expensive than what I wanted to pay, I realized that I was also wasting money purchasing clippers that only worked a couple of years. Well, let me say that after purchasing these clippers it quickly became apparent that these were what I had been searching for after years of frustration. Not only are they efficient, but they cut very accurately and cleanly. I haven&#x27;t purchased any additional changeable blades, but purchased some Andis (Nano Single Magnet 66345 set) comb guides and they work flawlessly together. I&#x27;ve been so pleased with these clippers, that I also purchased the Oster T-Finisher as well. These too are high quality clippers making trimming quick and accurate. I&#x27;ve been kicking myself for not purchasing these two clippers sooner, but I&#x27;m glad that I finally stumbled upon them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to these clippers that I can see is that they are substantially larger and heavier than most hair clippers, so if you work with them for a prolonged period, I can see how these might become fatiguing. Also, since these are professional clippers, you must maintain them and keep the blades lubed at all times. All said, the Oster 76 makes the clippers you find at most department store retailers seem like toys, and because spare parts are readily available for this model, there&#x27;s no reason why they shouldn&#x27;t last a lifetime if you properly maintain them. I would also strongly recommend purchasing a tube or bottle of the Oster Lubricating Oil to keep them sharp and use the included brush to clean them thoroughly after each use.</li>
            <li> Heavy Duty in all respects, professional, maybe but motor does get warm after 5min use. Still, nothing to be too concerned about.</li>
            <li> The quality of the a classic 76 Universal Motor Clipped is very good.  I am extremely happy with the smooth and quiet operation of this clipped.</li>
            <li> 3 years of occasional use, perhaps once a month, and this clipper is dead. so much for heavy duty use.&lt;br /&gt;For the price i paid i must say i am very disappointed. Would have been better off buying a few cheaper&lt;br /&gt;clippers.</li>
            <li> I normally never write reviews about a product, but have to say that I had this clipper since I was 22 years (1992) old for my first dog and wanted to save money on grooming.  I learned to groom my dog by myself.  I invested in a big clipper and this was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now 2013 and I still have it.  There were times when I wanted to place it on Ebay to sell it because I have been lugging it around all my life in all the various cities/states that I lived in and can say that I am glad it kept it even though I haven&#x27;t owned a dog for over 8 years.  I recently acquired a new puppy (Yorkie) and I am planning to groom her myself again.  This product is GREAT!!!!  I cannot say enough and happy with my investment.</li>
            <li> Beautyfull piece of equipement, just what i was looking for</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, cuts well but is heavy.  If I did this for a living I&#x27;d want something that was lighter.</li>
            <li> same old design but still maintain good quality. does all that is was advertised to do, however, can be very noisy and slow at times.</li>
            <li> There was an initial short circuit when I began using the clipper (the clipper turned off and on) and I thought nothing of it. I should have returned the clipper as soon as I noticed something was wrong. The clipper stopped working after a month of use. There&#x27;s a 30-day return policy and I am unable to return the defected product. I will continue to seek a product replacement or a refund for this defected product.</li>
            <li> Excellent great classic clipper</li>
            <li> I love the clippers, however, they only lasted about a year. I am sure I can get them repaired but considering my cheap clippers have lasted longer, it is disappointing. I don&#x27;t mind repairing a great product but I would certainly like to get a few years out of them before it becomes necessary. I won a second set of the same clippers and they, too, have had no longevity. They run quite hot and snag the hair in spite of cleaning and oiling. Having said that, I find the cut (when clippers are working properly) to be far superior to other brands. They give a nice, smooth finish and the triple zero blades give a nice high and tight. I haven&#x27;t used the quad zero blades but I can only imagine that with the right blade, you can probably get crazy close. As long as you don&#x27;t mind yearly maintenance, these are great.</li>
            <li> . &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now THAT&#x27;s what I call a clipper, baby... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;... and to think how long I&#x27;ve been getting by with the cheapy Walmart/ happy homeowner clipper brands. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Positives: &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- clean, fast, great cut and operation across the board. It brings two blade types - easily interchanged in seconds &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- you can feel the solidity and quality &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- supple, long cord &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- reminiscent of haircuts as a kid in the town&#x27;s corner barber shop [ where&#x27;s the Archie comics? ] &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Negatives: [ minor ] &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- the weight is noticable [ compared to homeowner brands ] but not objectionable &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- slight smell of electric motor/oil &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;- klunky shape/style - could use a modern-styled redesign</li>
            <li> This hair clipper is very good and looks like it will last for years. I have been cutting my hair with clippers for almost 10 years now and this is the BEST clipper I ever had. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give the 5 stars is styling (it must really have been designed in 1976) and weight. That thing is heavy, it is ok if you cut other peoples hair but if you cut your own, like I do, then you would like it to be a little lighter.</li>
            <li> QUIT WASTING YOUR MONEY ON CHEAPER CLIPPERS, IF YOU WANT ONE THAT WILL LAST, WON&#x27;T PULL THE HAIR, ETC BUY THIS ONE... MY SON-IN-LAW IS EXTREMLY HAPPY I GOT THESE FOR HIM FOR XMAS... FINALLY, HE HAS SOME GOOD CLIPPERS.</li>
            <li> The Bomb!  I couldn&#x27;t affird the individual blades so I purchased the clip ons.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oster Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper to replace a cheap model from Wal-Mart that broke.  What a difference!  My wife gives our sons and myself hair cuts.  These clippers make short work of the hair and with ease.  I would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> After years of paying a barber to cut his hair, my husband gave in to the chidings of his brother and a friend to buy the same clipper used by barbers, the Oster Classic 76, to begin using it to cut his hair at home. The others have both trained themselves to cut their own hair. In our family, I have learned to cut my husband&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are saving money cutting hair at home instead of paying the barber&#x27;s fee plus tip and we feel this justifies the cost of this clipper over time. Actually a larger issue was finding the time in the schedule for my husband to go to the barber shop when they were open and when it jived with his schedule, which was getting difficult with my husband&#x27;s work hours. Also there is no sitting and waiting for the next available barber when you cut your own hair at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a professional device and is high quality. The way the clipper is designed is safe to use. More tricky is the Oster T-finisher tool, sold separately, because the T-finisher tool can cut the skin if not used properly. We use the Oster Classic 76 for the main cutting and clean up the sideburns, back, and back of the neck with the Oster T-Finisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the Oster Classic 76 is sold in a combination pack with the Oster T-Finisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the package for which blades come with the Classic 76. My model number 76076-010 comes with a size 1 and size 000 blades. Other blades are sold separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After finding the manufacturer&#x27;s full retail price online, we then shopped around locally and found the local retail stores including a &#x27;discount hair supply store&#x27; were selling ABOVE the full retail price. We found the best price on Amazon.com so we bought it there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have been using this for about nine months.</li>
            <li> excellent  !!! The best clipper on the market for my money I had a pair identical to these in the early sixties . They finally gave out 3 weeks ago . 52 years of service.</li>
            <li> Use this for my sons and husband. Easy to use and clean. Best to use with clipper guard. I haven&#x27;t had to change the blade yet.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers to shave my face.  I get ingrown hairs a lot and a friend of mine used to use clippers and it helped his ingrown hairs.  I had to buy the 0000 blade to get a close shave but it does the trick.  Great Oster quality and the blades are easy to buy and swap out.</li>
            <li> I am a Marine. I wanted clippers that cut well. These cut well. Maintenance is simple. Here&#x27;re four more words.</li>
            <li> These clippers are well-made and powerful. You can tell just from how heavy they are. The motor is fast and powerful. The only downside is having to buy the attachments separately which run approx $20/each. Great set of clippers to have in your collection.</li>
            <li> is like having a professional at home. I bough it for my husband and so far works perfectly fine till now</li>
            <li> I am happy with this clipper.Good price and good quality</li>
            <li> I had this product for a month and I love it. Good for prefect cuts and I recommend this product</li>
            <li> The blade it came with cuts extremely well and for that I&#x27;m satisfied. Having the option to buy other attachable blades is wonderful if you know what you&#x27;re looking for. The clipper blade is extremely easy to remove. This enables it to be cleaned the right way. With other clippers, you have to unscrew this and unscrew that and then make sure you put the screws in a safe place to avoid losing them.</li>
            <li> The Oster Classic 76 is the best built clippers I have seen.  It is a little heavier than most because the motor is heavy-duty and won&#x27;t overheat.  It cuts better than others.  Very good performance on fine hair.  The On/Off switch is a little strange, but positioned on the back where it is less likely to be accidentally tripped.  Cord length is good.  Attachments can be purchased at your local beauty shop.  I threw away the box and keep the clipper and parts in a zippered pouch (not included).  This is a quality USA-made product (don&#x27;t buy a China-made clipper!)  Care instructions in several languages.  This product won&#x27;t disappoint.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> this is a heavy weight professional clipper which I expect will last and last.  I only wish there was a step by step pamphlet that came with this and all the multiple trimmer attachments on how to use it effectively.</li>
            <li> As a fifteen year vet of the industry, I suppose I have the chops to weigh this pretty decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros-&lt;br /&gt;Heavy- duty clipper...with proper care, this thing will outlast that car in your driveway...no kidding.&lt;br /&gt;Mows through the thickest, toughest hair effortlessly.&lt;br /&gt;Clipper blades are interchangeable...meaning...if you invest in the metal blades in different sizes, your cuts will be much more polished, fades look immaculate. If you can&#x27;t do the metal blades, then there are plastic options. Keep in mind they won&#x27;t cut nearly as clean, but nice for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;Heavy duty is great if you have the hand size and the wrist power to use it ALL DAY. I am a woman with small hands and I can&#x27;t get my fingers all the way around it...thus it can be cumbersome after a while.&lt;br /&gt;The noise...imagine an electric hedge trimmer....seriously. I still get remarks about it at work!&lt;br /&gt;For beginning stylists...beware...it can get away from you fast. Peel and half peel are what it does best...it takes MUCH practice to fine tune your results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a solid piece of  professional equipment. A true standard prized by barbers and stylists alike. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Very good professional clipper for the price.  My wife and I use it for our two boys and it works like a champ.</li>
            <li> I thought it worked better than the cheap ones you buy in local stores but a little to high in price. I will see how it out last the others like Wahl.</li>
            <li> These are the industry standard clipper. My last pair was 12 years old, used daily at a salon for 6 years, and used weekly for the other 6 before giving up the ghost.</li>
            <li> So far they are working just fine. Love them. I will recommend these clippers to a friend yesterday and today.</li>
            <li> I have extremely thick hair. So much so that I have been told this by a barber. I take it as a complement since I will never have to worry about losing my hair. Still, it can be a hassle when looking for a clipper that can cut my hair efficiently. Glad I bought this!</li>
            <li> Anyone who has anything negative to say about these clippers has no clue what there complaining about, I read a review that stated that these clippers are too pricey and are not as good as clippers a barber would use. I am a licensed nys barber and any barber out there who doesn&#x27;t have this tool in there drawer is an idiot. There reliable, heavy duty and give the cleanest cut. 5 zero-31/2 blade sizes are all perfect blades and once you learn how to use this clipper which does take some time, your haircuts will be 3x tighter and done in 3/4 of the time. 5 stars all the way. 120 dollars for home use will last you a lifetime and for any barber this clipper will outlast any other clipper in your drawer when taking care of properly. Anyone who doesn&#x27;t like it is either too weak to hold it and or doesn&#x27;t know how to properly fade with it. Practice and get used to it and you too will have nothing bad to say about the 76.</li>
            <li> i like it, it works as advertised, wish i had t pulled the trigger on this purchase a lot earlier.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair, so far this thing has paid for it&#x27;self and I have had it less than a year.</li>
            <li> There is not much I can say about this clipper that hasn&#x27;t been said before.&lt;br /&gt;It is heavy, I don&#x27;t think it is all that loud.  It cuts through hair like a hot knife through butter.&lt;br /&gt;It seems well constructed and I think as long as I don&#x27;t drop this, it will last me a long time.&lt;br /&gt;One note is that this clipper would be very hard to use if I was trying to cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> Finally bought this clipper about 4 mos ago after going through a couple of cheap Wahl clippers ($30 clippers) over the last several yrs. I buzz my hair and my sons hair every couple weeks. These clippers do an awesome job! Really nice having actual blades of different sizes to change out instead of the cheap flimsy plastic clip on combs. Blades are very high quality. Additional blades of varying sizes are $20-30/ea but you probably won&#x27;t buy that many or replace them very often. Body of the unit gets a little warm after 10 mins or so but head/blade assy does not. Its a little heavier than the cheap Wahl units but not excessively so and I feel sure the heft is oweing to its better construction with higher quality motor and other parts. Glad I took the more expensive plunge finally!</li>
            <li> This clipper works very well. Solid construction. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this Oster product. As the other reviewers mentioned, this clipper runs quiet and cuts with no problems whatsoever. You may want to get the clipper heads offered if you want to get fancier cuts as this only comes with a \\&quot;0\\&quot; and \\&quot;1\\&quot; blade.</li>
            <li> I did my homework and this is the one you want. It cuts great, keeps cool, and it is very durable. Since it is the \\&quot;standard\\&quot;, you can find parts everywhere - replacement and add-ons. This will last you a long time, don&#x27;t waste your time buying a cheap one.</li>
            <li> Use for home haircuts, works like butter, but it does take a minute to get used to where it  actually cuts, since if you use the various sizes of blades as I do, it&#x27;s definitely different then the Conair with the changeable guards I have been getting from Target for 10 years</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used a professional hair clipper, you have no idea what you&#x27;re missing. Sturdy little machine with nice heft.</li>
            <li> I like to cut my hair with the grain and keep it about at a 2 length&lt;br /&gt;these clippers cannot do that, even with the guard combs I also ordered the &amp;#34;Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb Set&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Mind you, I bought these clippers brand new&lt;br /&gt;these clippers are so weak that when I try to cut my hair with the grain it doesnt do much it pretty much just feels like you are brushing your hair the clippers. The only way it can cut my hair is if I go against the grain which does not look as good on me.&lt;br /&gt;Even without the guards these clippers SUCK, like trying to low without the guards will leave a bunch of uneven hair spots.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly you can get a better cut with some cheap walmart clippers take your pick on the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can take a picture of what I use, if you cant see I use the 0 blades that come with the clippers and the 1/16 guard combs because those are the only ones that can even touch my hair. and those do an awful job at cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only reason why I am giving these clippers a 1 star is because they are advertised as being able to cut through any type of hair, had I known that these clippers were not particularly good at cutting black hair I would not have wasted money on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it should be noted that these clippers get hot VERY quickly.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even give any stars if I could. I ordered these clippers 3 months ago and right off the bat I was having issues. I thought they could be fixed with clipper grease. When I went to grease the gears, I realized they had been soaked in grease that had hardened. I cleaned it out and applied my own. They worked for a month and then fried. As I know how to fix clippers I pulled out the guts gently to see what the problem was. I found it entirely coated in hardened grease as well and realized they sold me a pair of clippers that had been sitting for years. Now that I&#x27;ve passed the return policy, thats 100$ down the drain. And now I have to buy a new pair. Thanks a lot dudes.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper 5 years ago for keeping my head shaved and its still going strong. I bought a replacement blade and haven&#x27;t touched it yet. I couldn&#x27;t recommend this enough</li>
            <li> Is a good cliper to own if your a real pro. This cliper you just gotto have ! The best. :)</li>
            <li> Simply the best clippers you can purchase. The blades are a bit expensive but you WILL get a perfect cut every time. I use them once a week and expect them to last a lifetime. Pros use them all day everyday and the last forever. My use is nothing in comparison.  Spend the money, get what real barbers use. You won&#x27;t be dissappointed.</li>
            <li> For years, I used to buy the cheapy clippers that you would pay about $20 for, in places like Target.  These clippers put all of those cheap clippers to shame!  Reviewers caution about the strong motor and how it can possibly be difficult to manage while cutting.  I didn&#x27;t feel the motor was strong enough to the point where I couldn&#x27;t properly maintain my grip.  The motor does get hot after a while, however.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving my head for 10+ years. I have used many $30-$100 clippers and this is by far the best. I used the 00000 blades that I bought separately for $20 and they shave very close. I would not say it is next day stubble like most people are saying it is more like 2 days. I did watch the maintenance video from Oster about this clipper and they state that if the handle gets warm it needs oil. Well it got warm / hot right out of the box, so I oiled it exactly the way the video showed, and no change. So we will see if it is going to die / overheat or not.</li>
            <li> Whether I use it on my head or shave with it, does a great job with the 00000 blade. kjigg</li>
            <li> fast shipping;does a great job on cutting hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought more then 10 clippers so when my last walmart whal died i decided to bite the bullet and get something really good.&lt;br /&gt;This clipper is fantastic, but expensive.</li>
            <li> Well you might say, $120 is a bit much for a hair clippe, and I would say, lets talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it a hair clipper, it is also a beard trimmer, thats right, two in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also if you are at the point that you would choose to now go and have it all at one size, your hair, then this is breat, just get a detachable blade, a size that you like, try Andis since they also make sizes that apparently are not available by Oster, and just make sure that it fits, and then you can save yourself anywhere between $5-20 per cut, so if you go once a month to a barber and he would charge $5 fpr a plain buzz, so in 24 months it shall pay for itself, also there is the beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And 24 months is just the amount of time of the old phone plans, so thats it then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EnjoyM</li>
            <li> These clippers are a must have for anyone, whether you&#x27;re a barber or you cut your own hair, these clippers are awesome.I primarily use these as my &amp;#34;take down&amp;#34; clippers. I keep my hair short--I use a #1 blade all over. These clippers take down hair like butter and fast. Pick up other detachable blades according to your preference for the cut and you can start fades off. You can blend the fade with these clippers but I recommend using clippers that are more geared toward fades such as the Wahl Five Star Seniors or Andis Masters (without the fade blade as the fade blade pulls and bites your skin).</li>
            <li> This item was DOA(Dead on Arrival). The on-off switch was broken. I noticed this the first time I used the clippers. It was barely hanging on and fell completely off when I tried to turn he unit off. Stuff happens...anyway, it didn&#x27;t have the adjustable blade and lever, which I need. At this point I&#x27;ll probably get the Wahl Senior Clipper.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting my family&#x27;s hair for more than 20 years. These are the best clippers I have ever used. Note that I have only used for 1 haircut, so I can&#x27;t comment on reliability.They cut well, are well balanced, and quiet enough. Weight is not an issue and I have some arthritis in my hand.</li>
            <li> These clippers made it possible to move quickly though very nasty mats of dog hair.  If you need power and strength, these seem to be perfect!  The old school look is nice and sleek.  I used for a total of 2 hours, stopping every 20 minutes or so to let the dog and clippers rest.  There is a smell of oil with these as they are prelubricated during assembly. Looking like a sound purchase at a great price!</li>
            <li> Works great, clean cut. A little heavier than expected.</li>
            <li> The best purchase I&#x27;ve bought all year. I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t know about these earlier</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  I &#x27;shave&#x27; (blade 000) my head weekly and this is way better than buying a cheapo from walmart.  Worth the money I hope.  Had the product for approx. 6 months with no issues.  Cuts my hair with one pass, even if my hair is filthy/greasy.  It&#x27;s pretty heavy, but that just means it&#x27;s well built.</li>
            <li> I am a non barber who uses this product to shave my head approx once a week. At the 15 dollars that I used to pay for a haircut, I&#x27;m am now at the break even point and I feel like I can give an honest review. This trimmer is not even in the same league as the trimmers that you get at Walmart or other stores. It comes with a 000 and a 1 size blade but I bought a 2 and &amp;#34;000000 (Andis),&amp;#34; blade which I use on my head and for trimming. For anyone looking for a product they will last a lifetime if you take care of it, this is one of those products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This also comes with clipper lube, clipper grease, and a brush and they are all very useful. I highly recommend to watch the YouTube video by oster on this product by the guy with the werewolf looking sideburns for an awesome tutorial on the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a hair stylist, is great. Does a great job, easy to clean, and will last a long time. A little loud, but great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my son and fiancé&#x27;s hair for years now.  I had an old pair of cheap ones that I purchased at Walmart and when they broke, I decided to make the investment in a nicer pair.  I am SO happy that I did!  My son would always complain that the other clippers hurt or were pulling his hair no matter how slow or gentle I was.  These are pretty serious clippers and it really only takes one swipe to cut evenly and it doesn&#x27;t pull at all!  If you&#x27;re newer to cutting hair and it takes you a while to get the job done, be warned that these clippers do get pretty warm.  My fiancé likes them so much that he tossed his old beard trimmer and just uses this.  It is heavy and nicely built.  You won&#x27;t regret spending the extra money on these, I guarantee it!</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a beast and will last me the rest of my life. I think it was designed using the old Harley Davidson theory of engineering. If it breaks make it twice as big. It&#x27;s a bit heavy. I do like that I can order parts for it should anything ever give out. It&#x27;s made here in Tennessee. My favorite thing about it? It actually CUTS my beard. The old one I had tended to jerk out a whisker every now and then causing me to yelp like a puppy. Get the comb set when you order the trimmer as it doesn&#x27;t come with any.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair, and have cut my own hair for years with wahl and other similar $30-$60 clippers, and I always have to go slow so they don&#x27;t pull my hair. With these I can literally goes as fast as I want. Also, while incurring more upfront cost, the blade system is  FAR superior the plastic guards of most store bought clippers.</li>
            <li> Great product so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these clippers for about 2 years now.  Not a single problem. While it is a little pricy I cut my, and others, hair roughly every 2-3 weeks.  Given that a typically haircut is about $12-15 plus tip, these clippers have already paid for themselves.  I&#x27;m very meticulous about cleaning/lubricating them and making sure the cord doesn&#x27;t kink.  If you can manage that, I see no reason these clippers can&#x27;t last 10-20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They can get hot to hold when on for long periods of time.  Avoid covering the vent slits with your hand when in use.  Also, I would have liked to see a better cleaning brush or brush set included.</li>
            <li> Go and save money....no more barber shop...it so nice ...a little costly though by its worthy ,my husband love it</li>
            <li> it was exactly how it was described and fast delivery</li>
            <li> This is the same one as the barber uses. Its high quality and top notch quality. The clipper blades pop on and off the clipper.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best. Solid machine. Sounds awesome.</li>
            <li> This Clipper is the real deal, Salon quality and it cuts incredible, it is a bit heavy but with weight come quality.  I wanted a clipper to buy to replace my older cheaper ones.  One that cuts smooth doesn&#x27;t pull hair and one that can be sharpened or parts replaced if they become dull.  This is the right one! This clipper has a history of being durable.  A great buy.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers, I use them on my husband and 2 1/2 yr old son. They don&#x27;t hurt my hand like some others have and it is not overly loud like others i have used that scare the hell out of my son.</li>
            <li> I have barbered my kids and grandkids hair for many years.  My old Oster electrical cord quit working and I could not find anyone to fix it.  I like this replacement very well.  The first Oster I bought was in 1962.  Hope this one lasts as long.</li>
            <li> Very precise,a little heavy, gets a bit hot towards the end of cut</li>
            <li> This is the Harley Davidson of hair clippers: old fashioned, sturdy, and outrageously powerful. It survived me forgetting it outside under the downpour (do NOT repeat at home!!), and keeps killing my facial hair off with the same timeworn efficiency. Lofty cost, overly loud buzz, and uncommonly heavy weight may put some users off, but that&#x27;s the price I do not regret paying.</li>
            <li> Got this for my other half on his bday and he loves it, this is a great gift for a man.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for people who want a quality tool to cut their hair with. They operate smoothly and they have a long cord. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> The Classic is a must have.</li>
            <li> Powerhouse, Heavy and not justified for the home trimmer! Motor cooling vents are near top so if you are a self trimmer you will have your hand wrapped around the hot vents!  It&#x27;s heavy The directions are very Simple and Leave you confused about how to swap the Blades! If you need to change them just pull the old ones away from Trimmer until the spring snaps open, then it&#x27;s simple no tools needed. Definitely a real machine and No wonder it is the standard for professionals! I don&#x27;t mind overkill for the homeowner but I may switch back to the Cordless remington some day for the light easy self trim. Want the best buy one of these but It may not work as well for the non pro and self trimmer! They are heavy and run hot. I would not return them Because I can tell they are well made and very powerful! Maybe I&#x27;ll just get used to the weight, Cord and heat!</li>
            <li> Very Satisfied with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I had several clippers, and this one is by far the best and well worth the money. I can cut my hair in less than 10 minutes, and it never gets stuck, I see from other reviews that some people complain about the heating and the weight. I don&#x27;t find either one to be an issue at all. In summary, I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> heavy duty, few hair cuts and you get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li> This clipper is fantastic. I am so glad i upgraded from the ones I used in beauty school because quite honestly you cant even compare the two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;--They cut the hair like butter, they cut fast and efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;--Powerful mortar that works consistently&lt;br /&gt;--They are durable; I&#x27;ve inly had mine for about a year, but I know stylists who have owned the same pair for 15 years and still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;--Comes with two attachment blades; 1 and 000 (probably standard)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;--Very large and a bit heavy; the size doesn&#x27;t bother me, but most female stylists avoid these due to wrist strain.&lt;br /&gt;--color scheme; they are called classic for a reason, but that burgundy is not my favorite  NOTE: Other limited edition shades are available (for a different price)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its a great tool, one of the best in the industry, and will suite your needs whether you are looking to purchase it for professional or personal use.</li>
            <li> Great Clippers...Well worth the money! Larger and heavier than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; clippers, but worth it for an easy cut</li>
            <li> Bought for my brother, he says it works great. Just comes in one length though. So it will cost more for the attachments to change the degress of hair length thats being cut.</li>
            <li> Love it so far.  Got tired of buying the wahls from walmart every 9 months or so.  Hopefully this one lasts me for many years to come.</li>
            <li> He loves these clippers. He has wanted them for awhile. They were affordable and with amazon prime the shipping was free. He uses them weekly and has had no problems. He really loves them.</li>
            <li> Works great this is the second one I purchased, it&#x27;s for my dad and he loves it. Is fast easy to clean and you get the barber shop professional cut without their price</li>
            <li> I been obsessing over these clippers for YEARS and I mean MANY MANY YEARS. Finally pulled the trigger and bought them and do NOT regret it one bit. They are everything I ever remembered, and puts any Wahl clippers I ever used to shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two ways to adjust the length of the cut:&lt;br /&gt;1. Changing blades - costs more but a closer/better cut&lt;br /&gt;2. Changing guides on a 000 blade - cheaper but not nearly close or accurate of a cut&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blades use and changing on these are quite easy, but make sure you keep oil handy. I always oil before, during, and after. I prefer the spray oil/cleaner over the kind that comes out in drops. I have and used the #1 and I loved it but I wanted to experiment with different lengths and not spend a fortune so I bought the after market guides which was quite affordable. After using those on and off for a year or more; don&#x27;t do it. For the Classic 76 it&#x27;s a benefit to the user/consumer to buy the metal blade lengths (not the plastic guides). Also, if you find a length that keeps you happy then you really just need one. I am tinkerer so now I have 3, and the #3 and #1 are my two primaries. I only used the 000 to clean up my neck, back, butt...yes my butt, and so on. The #1 mostly for summer, and the #3 for all the other seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does get warm/hot. I am not sure if there is a solution to that, and I doubt I already need parts for it considering I use it for personal use not a professional that uses it daily. But I also notice the heat issue hasn&#x27;t occurred recently which leads me to thinking one of two things:&lt;br /&gt;1. There is a break-in period&lt;br /&gt;2. Maybe I am being more efficient with it&lt;br /&gt;It did get too hot to the touch once, so we just put it down, let it cool off for a hour, and resumed the cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is heavy, but been around for years and I never seen a clipper cut as close as these do. I always get excited when I seem then in a barbershop which I next to never do unless I want a fade or/and change in contrast. I am not one of those that can do my own fade; when I do my home cuts it&#x27;s one level all around. I know of people that say they do their own fades, and I say more power to them. I am not one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutting, man these things can cut. I still remember the very first time I tried cutting my hair with a $20 Wahl Clipper from some store. Because my hair was wet and $20 Wahl&#x27;s just suck, it kept pulling, tugging, and hurting my noggin. These things: wet, dry it don&#x27;t matter. Cutting your hair with a Oster Classic 76 metal blades is really like a hot knife in butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seen the low reviews and based on what was said I can&#x27;t help but think the user&#x27;s were the reason for the issues, not the clippers. I do admit there are lemons in this world with any products, but considering the history of these clippers, and how they are still found in barbershops, it&#x27;s truly a no brainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned in life it&#x27;s better to spend the extra $$$ than to go cheap. There are somethings you can go cheap on; this isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li> Great set of clippers! Never need to purchase another set again.</li>
            <li> After using the cheap clippers from the local drug store, not to mention having to buy new ones every year, I finally broke down and spent the money on some real clippers. It now takes me half the time to shave my head and it never misses a hair. They&#x27;re a little on the heavy side, but you can tell these clippers are built with incredible quality.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s extremely expensive hairdresser described these clippers as \\&quot;the best money can buy.\\&quot;  Enough said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for over 20 years. I&#x27;ve used several cheaper clippers, you know, the ones with the plastic combs. This Classic 76 is the best I have ever used. The quality is unmatched. The cut is much smoother and quicker than with the cheaper units. The steel blades are quickly interchanged and provide a very smooth and comfortable cut, with that professional look I so wanted. I highly recommend the Oster Classic 76.</li>
            <li> These clippers are the best.  I&#x27;ve used them for nearly a year now, after using cheap ones previously, and these are worth every cent.  I used the supplied 000 blades for a while, but eventually bought the 00000 blades.  The 00000 blades are about like one day&#x27;s stubble after shaving with a blade, which is what most people are looking for.  I shave my head with these every 3 or 4 days, usually, and it works out great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are heavy and bulky, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me once I used them a few times and got used to their heft.  Others have said they get hot.  Mine get warm, but I wouldn&#x27;t say hot.  Also someone mentioned cutting themselves with the 00000 blades.  I was worried about this when I first got the 00000&#x27;s, but the only time I&#x27;ve cut myself is when I ran the clippers directly into my ear.  Don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In about 11 months, I&#x27;ve nearly saved the cost of these (minus the extra blades) over going to the barber.  And I really expect these to last longer than I do.  I did try a cheap pair first, to see if I could even shave my own head.  Those didn&#x27;t cut nearly as well as these, and didn&#x27;t have replaceable blades, so they didn&#x27;t cut as close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you&#x27;re cutting other people&#x27;s hair or shaving your own head, these clippers are the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE January 2015:&lt;br /&gt;Everything that I said in my original review stands. Lately I&#x27;ve been using these clippers on my face also, instead of shaving with a blade. Since October. It&#x27;s a little difficult around the chin and upper lip, but it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they are phenomenal on my head. If I had it to do over again, I would buy these. No question.</li>
            <li> A very professional set of clippers.  I don&#x27;t find them as noisy as some have claimed.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper. I was looking for a basic quality piece of equipmet which will last a long time. I used it already several times and think this might last a lifetime. My son has a thick bush hair and it cuts his hair with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing I like is that this product is still made in USA - thanks Oster.&lt;br /&gt;Please create more jobs back in the USA by bringing more of your manufacturing in China back to North America.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more then proud to be a classic 76 &#x27;er best tool I&#x27;ve held ever and I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair over 10 years don&#x27;t cheap out they are built to last</li>
            <li> If you look for a really short hair cut, this machine is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it gets too hot and also just come with 2 options os cut, if you want more you have to buy.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  I use these to cut my hair as well as my two sons.  I know they are a bit more expensive than others, but trust me, they are well worth it.  The quality of my cuts have gone up considerably and these things are built so much better than the others I always bought.  I also bought several of the metal blades.  If you can afford it, this is the way to go.  They cut exceptionally.  Buy the metal blades and a few of the plastic combs.  With this combo, I can get from 1/16&amp;#34; up to 1 1/4&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Absolutely fantastic set of clippers. I got tired of spending $11 every two weeks for my cuts....plus wasted time waiting for those cuts...my time is worth more to me than waiting in line for a cut. Solution: my 10 year old daughter who is very artistic plus these Oster 76 clippers (and a set of Oster Fast Feeds....awesome too). I had her watch a YouTube video of Josh the Barber cutting his own temple fade. She was nervous about messing up so I told her if she messed up, I&#x27;ll just shave my whole head...no pressure. Her first cut come out decent...her second and third cuts were better than my barber! The Classic 76 is heavy but she didn&#x27;t seem to notice or mind. It comes with 000 and 1 blades. Make sure the unit is running when you slap the new blade on. I also picked up blades: 0000, 0A, 1A, and 1 1/2. If you&#x27;re doing fades without a Fast Feed you&#x27;ll want the 0A blade also at a minimum. The combs are good too. I use #0 1/16&amp;#34;, #1 1/8&amp;#34;, and #2 1/4&amp;#34;.  When using these combs I get the best results when they are over the 000 blade. Now instead of paying $286 a year for cuts, I pay her $5.....I&#x27;d have to give her money anyways so she gets to feel like she worked for it.....I love the Oster clippers....be sure to oil the blades before each use.</li>
            <li> The buzzer is fairly loud with the fan. It is heavy and bulky. It seems like it should last forever. Using the blades (instead of combs) yields a very smooth-looking cut that does not pinch the hair as long as one doesn&#x27;t slide the buzzer too fast. It is superior to the standard buzzers with combs that one buys for less price. I believe it is a valuable investment. My 7-year-old son was unhappy to get his buzz cut from a standard buzzer with combs, but he&#x27;s happy to get his hair cut now with the Oster Classic 76. Here&#x27;s a chart with the blade numbers you can buy, their lengths, and how many days of hair growth the length corresponds to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade - Length, days worth of hair growth:&lt;br /&gt;00000 - 1/125” , 10 hours&lt;br /&gt;0000 - 1/100”, 15 hours&lt;br /&gt;000 - 1/50”, 1 day&lt;br /&gt;0A - 3/64”, 2.5 days&lt;br /&gt;1 - 3/32”, 5 days&lt;br /&gt;1A - 1/8”, 1 week&lt;br /&gt;1.5 - 5/32”, 9 days&lt;br /&gt;2 - 1/4”, 2 weeks&lt;br /&gt;3.5 - 3/8”, 3 weeks&lt;br /&gt;3.75 - 1/2”, 4 weeks</li>
            <li> These are the best hair clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. Only bad part is I didn&#x27;t get them sooner and struggled using the cheap ones for so long.</li>
            <li> The gold standard for clippers. Reliable and has easily detachable blades. Unlike Andis, they haven&#x27;t made changes to the clipper that lowered the quality. No screwdriver is needed to change the blade, just flip it back and pull it off. Lots of blades are available with sizes that are easy to understand. The part number and actual size are on the blade. It comes with 2 blades, a &amp;#34;000&amp;#34; (0.5mm) and a &amp;#34;1&amp;#34; (2.4mm). I shave my whole head and like it pretty short so I have more time before I have to do it again. I ordered the shortest blade, &amp;#34;00000&amp;#34; (0.2mm), separately for this purpose.</li>
            <li> got here at perfect timing and in very good shape my boyfriend loved it and uses these all the time</li>
            <li> It works at its best , I use it professionally and I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with it&lt;br /&gt;I know it&#x27;s going to last me for a good time,</li>
            <li> I had been using cheap clippers in the $50 range for a long time. I finally pony&#x27;d up the money for a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; clipper and I could not be happier. I cut my own hair twice a week and this guy powers through my thick/coarse hair with ease and no issues. I wish I had bought this thing years ago. It has paid for itself in a month. Forget going to the barber. Do it yourself and buy these clippers!</li>
            <li> It is efficient but over heated.  However it does the job that I wanted to do.  The price is a too high for for it is .</li>
            <li> OK...so I pulled the trigger on the Oster \\&quot;Classic 76\\&quot; after throwing away the $25 type clippers more times than I care to remember.  Of course, Amazon had them to me in no time at all and in perfect shape, no surprise there!  Anyway, I cut my own hair and ask my wife to trim up the back a little afterwards.  Using the typical \\&quot;Brand X\\&quot; type clippers you see in the drug store has been a frustrating experience to say the least, and I&#x27;ve probably tossed 5 of them in as many years.  They may have a different brand name on them, but they&#x27;re all junk...period.  So finally the light came on and I figured...\\&quot;why not get the one that barbers often use?\\&quot;.  Well, I can say that the difference isn&#x27;t like \\&quot;night and day\\&quot;...it&#x27;s more like \\&quot;the dark side of the moon and a super nova\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)The \\&quot;76\\&quot; is far quieter and smoother than any of the others&lt;br /&gt;2)The \\&quot;76\\&quot; blades are sharp precise cutting instruments that actually cut.&lt;br /&gt;3)The size of the \\&quot;76\\&quot; is pretty perfect for my slightly larger than average hands, but I think most any adult wouldn&#x27;t have difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;4)The \\&quot;76\\&quot; is made in the USA, it&#x27;s good to know we still make something, and I gladly support an American company&lt;br /&gt;5)I also ordered the longest blade with the machine and it&#x27;s perfect for my sides.  It seems to work better than the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; attachments to boot&lt;br /&gt;6)Speaking of the combs, I ordered those too and they are far better than average.  The spring-action attachment is very secure and dead-easy&lt;br /&gt;7)Speaking (again!) of \\&quot;dead-easy\\&quot;, changing blades on the \\&quot;76\\&quot; couldn&#x27;t be any simpler.  A trained monkey could do it...really!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So how does it cut?  Like a hot knife through butter.  That translates into more confidence and a better/quicker haircut.  Not long ago, I got a new clipper for my dog (King Charles/Maltese mix) out of similar friustration.  While the clipper i got works well...I should have got another Oster because I bet this thing would be dandy on the dog as well!</li>
            <li> I went from using a cheap clipper to this one, why did I ever waste time and energy with any other clippers? This is the best,It cut&#x27;s hair quickly and so easily.  I love this thing.</li>
            <li> You know the saying: \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;? Well, it applies to the Oster Classic 76 clipper. If I had listened to reviewers who said it was heavy, and this and that, I would have missed out in acquiring a nice clipper for my family&#x27;s use, when we can&#x27;t make it to the barber. There&#x27;s hardly a substitute for a skilled barber&#x27;s haircut, but using the Oster Classic 76 is as close to it as you can get. Period!</li>
            <li> Quality not what expected</li>
            <li> I use this product for shaving my head and face. Cuts just close enough that I do not get razor burn. Blades are easily exchangeable but do get warm with use. This clipper may feel a bit heavy to some. The blade I use for shaving: Oster Professional 76918-006 Replacement Clipper Blade, Size 00000</li>
            <li> Flawless operation, week after week.  Not much to look at, but solid as a rock.  Easy to swap out blades.  Does get warm after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good quality clipper to be able to give myself my own haircuts. I did my research, and settled on this one.&lt;br /&gt;These clippers work very well, very smooth, effortless trimming. The housing is plastic, but does feel beefy, and hope to get many years out of it.&lt;br /&gt;However, there were three things that prevented me from giving a 5 star rating.&lt;br /&gt;First, the instruction manual that comes with clipper is very poor. If you never used a clipper (like myself) it can very very itimidating on your first use. How to attach blades, and how to maintain the clipper, is not very well explained in the manual.&lt;br /&gt;Luckily, there is a Youtube video the Oster company put out, that I would recommend to anyone who plans to buy and use this clipper.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the clipper does run a little hot on the handle where you grip it, after a few minutes of use. The video said this is usually due to a lack of lubrication. I lubricated mine the best I could, there&#x27;s a little ball port on the side that your supposed to use to lubricate the motor, It seems like a very poor design to me, and could be improved. It doesn&#x27;t feel like I getting much of the lubricant (provided) into the tool.&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the 2 blades in comes with are for if you want you hair either bald or very, very short. I prefer the length of a #2 size blade, which is available, but will set you back another $25 or so, sold separately.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use it. its clean, nice build. very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Very happy with Classic 76, precise cut.</li>
            <li> Strong motor, sharp blades and provides a smooth even trim everytime. I have thrown away a dozen or more of the cheaper models. This will save you money in the long run.</li>
            <li> My Classic 76 has already paid for itself in the short time I have had it.  I *love* this thing, I can keep my hair extremely tight all the time without having to leave the house.  Very happy, wish I&#x27;d have bought one years ago.  Anybody with a buzz cut should own one, these things are awesome.</li>
            <li> Short review.  This clipper is a professional tool.  It cuts evenly, I shave my head, and gives my hair a bounce when I&#x27;m done.  I also use it for my beard and the #1 blade gives it a perfect length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will need a #2 clipper when I want to leave my hair a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, when my favorite barber retired he told me to get a 76076 and a 1 and 2 clipper and do it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Oster</li>
            <li> Cons:    (1) The clippers tend to operate warm almost immediately after turning them on (this really isn&#x27;t a big deal).    (2) The clippers are heavy / large / and sometimes awkward to handle (everyone else has said this too; again, no big deal).    (3) A bit expensive...but you get what you pay for.    Pros:    (1) The power cord is very sturdy and never curls up around itself like the power cables for cheap clippers.    (2) Switching out new blades &#x3D; VERY EASY.  All you do is turn the clippers off, push the current blade back, pop it up, put on a new one, push it in.    (3) The unit itself comes with two interchangeable, attachable blades:  (a) size 1 and (b) size 000 (triple Zero)    (4) Most importantly, these clippers do a great job and cut through your hair like butter.  The unit is very sturdy--a professional unit of high quality, and you get what you pay for.  These will last forever, I imagine.  Performance is great unlike those cheap clippers you buy at Target with plastic attachments.  If you&#x27;re serious about cutting your own hair (preferably a buzz cut around size 000), then these clippers are for you !  Shell out the money for them (they come with the #1 blade and the #000 blade attachments, and perhaps buy a few other blades separately (I&#x27;d recommend the quadruple and quintuple 0&#x27;s, perhaps even the #0A as well, for good measure).</li>
            <li> I bought mine after reading all the reviews, this product and others. I have pretty thin hair so that is very easy to cut, but I like reliable tools. I also got [[ASIN:B001T0HHB0 Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb Set Specially Designed to Fit Oster Clippers]] which is way less expensive than buying all the different cutters. But it turns out I could have bought just a [[ASIN:B0012KKRBO Oster AgION clipper blade size 3.75 Full Tooth.]], plus the two a #1 and a #00000 that came with the kit. but now that I have the combs I&#x27;m set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife cuts my hair and we have easily saved more money than the cost of the cuts at a barber. I&#x27;m a easy buzz cut on top, fade in back, with a heavy trim on the ears and eyebrows. This cutter makes short work of it. It may wear out but at the rate I&#x27;m using it, its going to take a long time. I&#x27;ve volunteered to do the same and save big on my wife&#x27;s haircuts, but she&#x27;s not buying it. Oh well, I can&#x27;t do the color as well.</li>
            <li> No doubt professional quality. The clippers I had before would struggle to cut thick hair, but these guys don&#x27;t tug or pull at all. You could probably trim the hedges with these things. On the down side, you will need to purchase additional blades or plastic guards since only two blades come with the set. Also the clippers are rather large and bulky, which is a little awkward at first. Overall I would recommend this product if you are looking for a reliable heavy duty clipper and don&#x27;t mind the extra size and weight.</li>
            <li> This is the best clipper among a dozen that I tried. It&#x27;s a bit noisy in operation, but the overall quality is perfect. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Solid, reliable product. I use it once a week and couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. No problems whatsoever. Just very solid and dependable.</li>
            <li> Still using these after 3 years, they paid for themselves in the first month,  I still get fresh cuts at the house :)</li>
            <li> These clippers are serious stuff. I went from some no name brand to these. It was like jumping from a Moped to a Harley Davidson. I think I am in over my head, ha, ha. After 4 haircuts I am still not use to them. I am a bit concerned that they run a little hot. I made sure they were properly oiled and greased, but they still run hot after about 10 minutes. These clippers are so heavy duty that I feel like I should wear safety glasses while operating. The body of unit is a bit bulky especially with me holding the mirror and trying to switch from hand to hand. These clippers do what they are meant to do and it is not there fault that I do not know how to use them. I plan on using these for years to come and expect to get better with practice.</li>
            <li> Excellent clippers!&lt;br /&gt;These are really solid. They are heavy, and while I&#x27;m not a professionally licensed barber, I&#x27;ve been cutting my family&#x27;s hair for 23 years. I was tired of owning several cheaply /less expensive clippers. I just wanted one that would be solid enough to handle different styles and use. This set should outlast me!!</li>
            <li> The clippers arrived on time and brand new, just as described.  The casing does get hot, which I was not accustomed to this heat.</li>
            <li> Bought these because I was tired of paying $15+ for a simple haircut every month that would only turn out mediocre.  i&#x27;d spend the next several days having my wife cut the long hairs that the barber had missed.  These are a game changer.  I&#x27;ve cut my hair and my boys hair for the last couple of years and have safed a fortune.  Took me a little practice to get used to, but it&#x27;s really not all that difficult for a simple fade.  My wife will cut the back of my head to make sure I don&#x27;t butcher it, and I&#x27;m good to go for another month or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippers themselves are powerful and precise.  They slice through our hair with ease and only require minimal oiling maintenance to keep them going strong thus far.  Still as sharp as the day I bought them!  The only problem I had is that I dropped them from about 3 feet and the case cracked, but the clippers still work great.  That one is on me.  BUY THEM, you won&#x27;t regret it.  My older former Marine coworker also bought a pair at my recommendation and he absolutely loves them.  He&#x27;s frustrated that he&#x27;s spent so much money over the years trying the Wally World versions only to be disappointed about how dull they become and how under powered they are.</li>
            <li> gave as a gift to son who works at In-and-Out.  He loves it, uses it often.  Solid quality</li>
            <li> I bought for my husbands and he likes it especially that it comes with an extra blade he didn&#x27;t expect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my own hair for a few years now.  I finally upgraded to these clippers and it made a huge difference!  One or two passes is all it takes for a very clean cut.  There is a reason these clippers have been around for years!  I would recommend you buy a few blades in the sizes you cut your hair.  The combs work well but nothing beats a blade.</li>
            <li> This is it. Your last clipper. Boom. Stop wasting your time and get one.</li>
            <li> Great product, Hands Down. I&#x27;m not a professional barber but I plan to be, so I cute hair on the sides for friends and acquaintances. When I got the Oster Classic 76&#x27;s, needless to say the service was great but the product its self was outstanding. I used them the same day and performed a great Fade haircut on a friend. This was definitely worth the investment.</li>
            <li> After going through our fourth pair of clippers purchased from a store, hubby put his foot down and said we were going to invest in a quality pair of clippers this time. Oh wow, the difference is astounding! these clippers cut every hair and don&#x27;t require you going over it a hundred times. Not to mention you can just replace parts. I cant describe how much I love these bad boys. yeah, they are like holding a car motor in your hand and it is sweet. Buy these, you wont regret it!</li>
            <li> It works seamless. I used to buy cheaper clippers that lasted for short time and did not do the job well. This is a must have for parents who do not want to visit a barber every couple of weeks. I have it for more that two years and use it almost once every week. A drop of oil that came with it is the only maintenance I do.  Love It!.</li>
            <li> My wife is a hairdresser, with over 40 yrs experience, and she is the one who uses this clipper in her work.  I am just repeating her comments.  This clipper can stand haircut after haircut without getting hot.  The reason is the rotary motor inside.  Most clippers have a vibrator inside, not rotary.  The rotary motor, besides being stronger, allows the inclusion of a fan in the body of the clipper, which circulates filtered air inside.  This clipper has been available for many years, and repair parts are available for it.  My wife used the first one for over 20 years, with no problems, and just wanted a new one.</li>
            <li> cuts my thick hair better then any other clippers i tried with ease does not pull at all just get the guides or blades for the length you want</li>
            <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. I bought them to shave my head and these things go right through the hair the first time. Rarely have to go over the same spot twice with these. They can get a bit hot if you use them for a while but its mostly the center where above the handle and below the actual razor heads so it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I&#x27;d recommend them for sure. On a side note: My mother is a hair dresser and she recommended them to me... she&#x27;s had the same set of these clippers for over 5 years now and they are still going strong.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Great Cut!</li>
            <li> Before I held it I thought people were strange for saying it was heavy...how heavy could a hare clipper be?!  Well, it is a lot heavier than my last Wahl clipper, that&#x27;s for sure.  Still, if your arm gets tired using this then you need help with your life.  I cut my own hair and this works great.  Super thick, long cord.  Interchangeable blades.  And I picked up the 10 piece comb set to go with it.  Does what I need it to, sounds happy doing it, and I don&#x27;t have to pay $30 to singe my nostrils smelling awful perfume while making idle chatter with a lady at a salon every few weeks.  For saving me from that, it paid for itself on its first use!</li>
            <li> I have had 2-3 of the cheapo Wahl style clippers in the past. I cut my own hair - always trimming it and my beard short to what would be a no. 1 or 2 attatchment. Sometimes if it is a little long the Wahl clippers really struggle and it takes forever. Not so with this monster. It plows through anything - with the grain /against the grain doesn&#x27;t matter at all. It takes me about 1 /10th the time it used to take me to trim now which is a huge quality of life improvement. If you have problems getting the back all even due to the way clippers are shaped this is slightly worse at that becuase of its broad design, but with the extra time it is eaasy to just go over problemareas 2-3 times quickly.</li>
            <li> I have been purchasing barber supplies for years.  This is, by far, the clipper of choice.  It&#x27;s durable, reliable and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> About time .I guess I finally woke up. Don&#x27;t waste your time on those cheap buzzers .In this case you definitely get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I am a barber/stylist and theses are the best clippers. They are  very sturdy and last a long time.  If they stop working just replace the carbon brushings and they are up and running again.</li>
            <li> This is a serious clipper.  I&#x27;ve gone through several sets of cheap $30 to $40 clippers, but all of them died after a few years.  Even worse, in order to get a good clean cut, I had to go over the same spot so many times that it could end up taking a half hour to clip my hair.  That&#x27;s about what it took to drive to a local barber, get a haircut, and drive back.  They could also easily jam with thick hair, so early passes had to be done slowly in order to avoid binding the clippers and pulling hair.  Also, all my inexpensive clippers worked via a vibrating magnet drive, which would hold a good setting for a little while, but then drift off and either stop cutting or get super loud.    The Classic 76 clippers are smooth, relatively quiet, and powerful.  One pass and the hair is perfect, no matter how thick it is.  Switching blades is quick and easy, and the results are better than I&#x27;ve ever gotten with comb attachments.    Some reviewers complain about the heft and noise, but I can&#x27;t see what they are talking about.  I imagine the clippers could get heavy if you use them all day, but since I&#x27;m not a pro, I don&#x27;t notice the weight.  They seem about the same as my last pair of cheap clippers, actually.  They are no louder than the clippers I&#x27;ve had before, and are definitely a lot quieter than vibration-drive clippers that aren&#x27;t in perfect adjustment.    They aren&#x27;t cheap, but I can&#x27;t imagine being happier with a set of clippers.</li>
            <li> Why did I waste my time with inferior alternatives (some of which came with tons of accessories) when this was what I was looking for all along? I can finally cut my son&#x27;s hair without him screaming that I am pulling on it. Don&#x27;t waste your time buying other brands or models. Skip the headaches and buy this one. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my own hair for 18 yrs now. I&#x27;ve always used the store bought novice clippers and usually need to replace every few years from the blades going dull or motor frying. Glad I bought this, the interchangeable blades are key for me and the little bit of maintenance I will need to do over the long-term will be worth it.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair and the take-down power of this clipper is awesome.  To achieve a good fade it takes some trial and error with the different blade sizes, but I have it figured out now.  It is a bit bulky to handle, again I&#x27;ve got used to it and it&#x27;s a non issue.</li>
            <li> As good as advertised. Able to cut hair just as good as a professional.  Recommend these to all wanting to cut hair and get a precise and flawless cut.</li>
            <li> As a barber, I have used the Oster Model 76 clippers for years and they give you good service. The price was a good deal.</li>
            <li> Make no mistake about it, this machine is incredibly powerful. I have thick straight hair and this machine cuts without any pulling no matter how fast I go. The construction is solid and the blades will last forever as long as they&#x27;re resharpened every few years. I&#x27;ve tried other machines and even when they work just as well, they somehow manage to feel cheap. I would highly recommend this set of clippers.</li>
            <li> Best Clippers I have ever purchased. I have been buzzing my head for roughly 10 years with Walmart clippers and have gone through several pairs. If you are debating upgrading to this motor from cheaper clippers you will be more than happy once you use these. They truly are the Mercedes of clippers. You get more than you pay for with these, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product replaced a set of $25 Wahl clippers.  It was purchased in Oct 2011  Over the years I have cut my own hair at home with many brands of home hair clippers, mostly from the Wahl brand.  They always cut hair good the first few times, then eventually would pull my hair painfully or vibrate louder than a lightsaber on steroids.    PROs:  CUTS EVENLY.  Didn&#x27;t have to keep going over the same spots for a nice close even cut.  POWERFUL &amp; STURDY.  The motor is made well and is up to the job for many haircuts.  NOISE.  No louder than the cheaper clippers.  SAVES MONEY.  The barber (plus tip) will drain the monthly base pay of every military member.  EXTRA BLADE.  Comes with an extra blade if you want to cut closer.  CONs:  PRICE.  $117.90 is a lot more than other brands but quality costs more.  SIZE.  These clippers are mammoth in size, so if you have small hands you may have difficulty using them.  Overall this is an outstanding product and I recommend them.  With proper maintenance &amp; cleaning I can tell they will last many years to come.</li>
            <li> Everything you&#x27;d expect it to be.  And very durable....I&#x27;ve dropped it more than a few times, and it keeps on running.</li>
            <li> Great clippers. Get the job done fast if you know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as everyone describes - far and away a &amp;#34;cut&amp;#34; above Wahl and other lower-class clippers.</li>
            <li> So far, these clippers are everything that they claim to be.&lt;br /&gt;My top concern was that they were going to be too bulky (I had always only used Andis Masters up until that point), but that wasn&#x27;t the case, they fit nicely and feel awesome.</li>
            <li> excellent not one of the cheap vibrator models</li>
            <li> Solid clippers. Wish I never wasted money and time on all those cheap models before getting these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also invest in the various blades. Cuts smooth and no need for many passes like cheaper clippers.</li>
            <li> I have this for several years, and it works great.  Smooth, quick, but heats up quickly. I use it to  cut my husband&#x27;s and boys hair.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers because they had such high ratings.  I put them on my wish list and they went on sale so I purchased them. I would go with another brand if I had to make the purchase again.  However, they are good clippers and I am not dissatisfied.  The draw backs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-They are bulky and heavy.  You will literally have to rest your arms after cutting for a while.&lt;br /&gt;2-They get too hot very quickly (after 15 minutes).  If you are a barber don&#x27;t get these because you will be able to cut one head then have to let them cool off.&lt;br /&gt;3-The clippers must stay plugged in at all times (no battery).&lt;br /&gt;4-They cost over $100 dollars and I expected to not have some of these issues at that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They good news:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-They cut great.&lt;br /&gt;2-They are quiet.  They sound more like a well oiled bicycle chain instead of a buzz saw like most clippers.&lt;br /&gt;3-The blades can be switched out without unscrewing screws.&lt;br /&gt;4-The blade is very wide so it covers a lot of surface area.&lt;br /&gt;5-The clippers come with a #1 and a #000 blade.  This extra blade is a $20 value.&lt;br /&gt;6-The clippers come with a very generous tube of oil for the blade and a tube of grease for the motor.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product! I was confident the product was brand new because each part was wrapped in plastic and the box was undamaged. It was delivered on time as well. My boyfriend loves it. I would recommend this company to anybody.</li>
            <li> Works great. Gets a little hot</li>
            <li> good purchase.  just what I ordered and I am very happy with it. would tell all to buy it and try it</li>
            <li> Cant do a good haircut without good equipment there clippers are awesome</li>
            <li> I Can&#x27;t thank Oster enough ! I wanted to cut my husband&#x27;s hair myself. what do I know anything about clipper. Sales from hair product store recommended this. take me little while to figure out how to change the blade but youtube teach you everything . and we have been saving money ever since for me to shave his head! once i know how to take everything apart and clean it and put it back together ,it has been heaven . easy to use. very safe. never hurt him in anyway. they say this will last for lifetime which I believe. happy customer .</li>
            <li> The Product trims nicely when using an attached blade. (I&#x27;ve learned the universal sets, just get caught in hair and pull and upset the dog)&lt;br /&gt;My main issue is how insanely hot the clippers get, and how quickly. I have to trim the dog in two stages or the blade actually burns his belly or legs...&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the clippers, themselves, are hot to hold.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the package recommendations, Make certain the cord is straight... Nothing helps.&lt;br /&gt;For a quick cut, small dog, or not a close cut, these are fine. For my small poodle, who gets a full body cut, it&#x27;s a two session job.</li>
            <li> These clippers are heavy duty and cut like a knife through soft butter. Very efficient and one swipe does it. Solid purchase no doubt!</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve purchased -- and only because the one I originally purchased in 1988 finally gave up the ghost (my own fault -- I twisted &amp; folded the power cord one too many times and it eventually split open).  I am not a professional barber but am a competitive swimmer and have used this product on a regular, nearly daily basis for well over 20 years.  It&#x27;s heavy duty, easy to clean, convenient for changing blades and basically indestructible.  The blades retain their edge well and are easy to service when they need sharpening.  I am well into my 2nd year with the new one and would never go back to some of the cheaper versions or other products I&#x27;ve purchased.  This thing lasts forever -- I expect to get another 20-30 years out of this one (it will probably out-live me!)</li>
            <li> I cut hair all the time and found it hard to keep even with no guards. This clipper eliminates the need for guards and cuts even every time. I recommend the different blades over the guard combs. It&#x27;s a little expensive but worth the investment. A lot of reviews say the clippers are to heavy for cutting your own hair and I disagree. I use it all the time for my own hair. Purchase a pair of Andis T trimmers and you are in business!</li>
            <li> Cuts fast and thorough. Amazing quality cuts at home just make sure that your metal blades are greased properly or else your hair will snag. Well worth the high price!!!</li>
            <li> Nice clippers that can cut any thickness of hair.  The way the blade move is really smooth and it&#x27;s effortless gliding the clippers across the head.  The material and quality of the parts seems good and seems like it will last for a long time.  I think the key to keeping this thing going for a long time is to clean it often and add in plenty of lubricant to protect it from rust and wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: It is a little heavy and a little loud (I guess you got to have it that way if you want thicker plastic and a strong motor).  After cutting hair for 2 people, the clipper is already running super hot.  You have to hold it at the end so as to not burn your hand.  I have added plenty of clipper oil to all of the joints and moving parts and it still runs hot.  The air pushing out of the little two slits on the sides are like little furnaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s really the only complaint I have about this clipper is the heat.  It is a quality product and will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have an Oster classic that&#x27;s over 15 years old! It&#x27;s a retired barbershop pair of clippers. It has a 000 blade, cuts my hair every week and is still going strong.  However I live out of the country and don&#x27;t want to take it back and forth with me when I return to the States, so I decided to buy another pair to keep there. Upon arrival imagine my dismay to find the plastic on/off switch broken off at the base. I can&#x27;t quite understand how this happened, nor can I understand why Oster would use a cheap plastic on/off switch on such a beautiful heavy duty pair of clippers. Oster are you reading this? I assume the broken switch was caused by a packaging problem. I have had no issues with my current pair including the on/off switch, so maybe it&#x27;s stronger than it looks. Bottom line, I recommend without reservation.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and a great price!</li>
            <li> My thick unwieldy locks never stood a chance against these clippers.  They zipped through my hair with ease while clipping the sad and thinning hair on top.  The blade is very easy to exchange.  I purchased a couple sets of guides that fit these clippers depending on the blades attached.</li>
            <li> super nice close shave with the 000 blades</li>
            <li> The Classic 76 appears to be a real solid clipper and is probably great for many hair cutting tasks. However, I purchased it for one very specific purpose and it did not measure up. I keep my head shaved clean and I want the closest cut I can get from a trimmer as my skalp is too sensitive for a blade or an electric face shaver. The reviews indicated that with the 00000 blade you will get the closest to a razor that you can get from a clipper/trimmer. Not so. I was disappointed. My Andis T Outlinner cuts much closer than the Oster Classic 76. If you want a clean bald look then I would recommend the Andis T Outlinner over the classic 76. I would suggest to Oster that they come out with a 000000 blade to accomodate those of us who are seeking a very close cut. As I said earlier, the Oster Classic 76 clipper is very solid and I would love to keep it if they make a closer blade for it.</li>
            <li> This little gizmo is heavy and expensive.  IMO it is also worth every cent.  I&#x27;ve had it for ~~ three weeks, used it several times with the \\&quot;000\\&quot; blade set and oh, what an improvement over the &#x27;other&#x27; brand/motor type of clipper.  As a self-buzzer for nearly 20 years, if I live but one more year, this clipper will essentially pay for itself.  Five Stars is appropriate here, for a genuine, professional quality machine.  The only better one that I&#x27;m aware of is essentially the same machine in a metal case.  If there is a minor downside, I think Oster ought to allow one to pick one or two blades at purchase, rather than packing it with the \\&quot;000\\&quot; and \\&quot;OA\\&quot; types.  For my purposes the \\&quot;000\\&quot; is OK, but I&#x27;ll have to buy the \\&quot;00000\\&quot; before long.  For any committed self-cutter, this IS the machine of choice.  Tip: Keep it clean and well oiled.  If the blades are lightly oiled after every use, they should cut one or two heads virtually forever. 06-18-2014 Update: I still love this clipper and I use it regularly.  Once one obtains the correct blade head, 0000 for me, sadly not included in the original kit, it as close to ideal as once can get. A few have noted (complained?) the it gets too warm.  It is a simple, rotary motor and some heat is expected.  It is not designed for continuous use, but regular, periodic use. Professionals would be pleased with this clipper and for this self-cutter, it is ideal.  One tip if I may:  Keep it clean, well oiled and rig a large rubber band to hold the blade guard in place.  If you drop it, don&#x27;t screw around - just buy a new blade. I&#x27;m critical and Five Star reviews are rare.  This Oster clipper is worth five, IMO.  Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> The Oster 76 is the only hair clipper I would use, I have tried many others but the Oster provides a better cut with less maintenance than any other clipper</li>
            <li> Oster 76 was just what I hoped it would be. Cuts great and is quieter than noted in the description. I wish it would have come with more attachments as I had to reorder a 1 1/2 blade. Other than that I&#x27;m very happy wiht my purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great So far. Get the job done fast and easy! I hope they last a long time due the price.</li>
            <li> These work great! We&#x27;ll see how long they last. I was tired of having to replace home use grade clippers year after year. It&#x27;s a completely different ball game with the capability of using different sized blades, rather than plastic guards for different lengths. Now I just need a 00000 sized blade for a razor close shave!</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper ten years ago, and use it at least twice a month.&lt;br /&gt;It continues to run like it&#x27;s new to this very day.&lt;br /&gt;Over the years I&#x27;ve invested in Oster stainless steel blades (9 different blades).&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;ve settled on 0A as my default blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have saved thousands of dollars in haircuts over the years!&lt;br /&gt;My wife helps me with the haircuts - I think I&#x27;ll keep her too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a mainstay in my grooming routine and hope to keep it until I no longer need haircuts.&lt;br /&gt;(hopefully a long, long time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in America and smacks of old fashioned quality!&lt;br /&gt;Americans build the best products-hopefully this clipper stays American-made.</li>
            <li> As expected.  No surprises...  A little heavy.</li>
            <li> Simply the best. Wouldn&#x27;t cut hair without it!!</li>
            <li> The Oster Classic 76 Pro Hair Clipper is not disappointing in any way.  A quality piece of machinery and easy to use.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  The clippers are excellent.  The blades are sharp, and the clipper body feels heavy duty.  That&#x27;s probably the only minor negative is that the clippers are heavy, but this property is an obvious testimony to its quality.  I definitely recommend the clippers to someone who is looking for clippers of great quality.</li>
            <li> These clippers are probably the best clippers ever made.  The casing is thick and sturdy and the cutting power is phenominal.  The motor runs smoothly and, while it does get hot evetually, it takes a while for it to heat up.    Although it is a bit heavy, so is a Rolls Royce when compared to other cars.  This is the same clipper my barber used when I was in high school and college and I can now get the same results.  He never used comb attachments, therefore, invest in more blades if you want to decrease the cut or invest in another set of clippers if you need an huge guard for your hair.  The only thing though is that if you search throughly on Amazon you will find that some merchants price is lower than Amazon&#x27;s, even including shipping and handling. Also, when you purchase this you might want to consider purchasing the [[ASIN:B000UE0VI2 Oster Clipper Essentials kit.]] as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for all-head shaving, including beard. I don&#x27;t like spending time with wet shaving and normal dry beard shavers don&#x27;t work for me. I like to have the same hair length (as short/bald as possible) everywhere. No hair-salons, no wasted time, no fuss. Bought this as a replacement for Andis 04710. Got the Oster in combination with the 00000 blade, as I thought it would be shorter than the Andis. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s also less convenient to shave as the Oster 76 is very big. The Andis is the best for fast short head and face shaving I&#x27;ve come across, and it&#x27;s cheaper.</li>
            <li> Like many people here I have been cutting my own hair for a few years and using clippers from Walmart with the plastic combs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper came with an all metal #1 blade attached, which is the length I use, without the need for a plastic comb.  I can now cut my hair much faster.  I don&#x27;t need to go over thek same areas as much to get every hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be a very heavy duty and well constructed clipper.  Some have said that it is heavy, but I don&#x27;t think it is any heavier than a Mopar gear reduction starter :-) .  It is a little heavier than the cheap clippers and it does have a larger circumference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My opinion is that it is not loud, however, it does sound different than the cheap clippers.  My impression is that the electric motor is larger and more powerful, but that it also operates at a lower RPM giving it a different sound.</li>
            <li> it is a good quality as much as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is going to be used many years..</li>
            <li> Best investment for a clipper; works great..no grabbing or pinching; top quality...go to youtube for help with all types of cuts. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Over the last several years, I&#x27;ve bought my share of clippers, the extra-cheap models, the mid-priced models, and finally these. I&#x27;ll say without a doubt that you are getting what you pay for with these. The major difference between these is the motor type. Average clippers come with a magnetic motor which, when activated, generate the familiar clipper &#x27;hum&#x27;. These don&#x27;t hum. They use a pivot motor, meaning that you can&#x27;t just put your thumb on the moving blade to stop it moving. For all intents and purposes, this is a hair saw. In practical terms, that means that on a single pass, you&#x27;re getting even, smooth cuts saving you significant amounts of time. They will take a bit of training to get used to using them, but they&#x27;re easy to learn. After my first cut, I wanted my hair to grow back, just so I could do it again. All of the little adjustments and tricks I had to learn on magnetic motor clippers weren&#x27;t needed. Just a smooth perfect cut the first try.</li>
            <li> Have to be the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever own. Will never consider those Dollar General clippers ever again. Should not have to worry these clippers are heavy and well built.</li>
            <li> Great purchase.  I save alot of money by cutting my hair, my father&#x27;s hair and my sons hair.  I wish I invested in these year ago.  I recently purchase the blades to go with - and now can cut hair with barbershop precision.  Best on the market.</li>
            <li> My barber (me) loves it.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Product was in brand new condition and works great!  It is the best hair clipper I have used.</li>
            <li> My husband used these clippers and loved them!  I found them a bit heavy compared to our old clippers but they worked really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this clipper for a couple of months. It works very well. I&#x27;ve very satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different clippers on the market, some cheap some not so cheap but on special so at the price I thought they were good quality. In the end they just don&#x27;t cut it (if you will excuse the pun) These things are fabulous. I live on 240v so have to run through a converter but they work as good as gold. I have had them now for a couple of years and they are as good as new whereas the others were ready to throw out by now, mainly because the blades blunt. What good is a set of clippers with a great motor but no replacement blades. These things have been around FOREVER and so there is NO problem with replacements and you can get them in any size you want. Just click buy and stop wasting your time getting your hair cut right.</li>
            <li> Hello, I received the hair clipper in perfect condition. Works perfectly. Good Buy. Got here fast. I am satisfied and would recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much, Rosanna</li>
            <li> My husband has very thick hair, and after going through 2 much cheaper Wahls within a month each, we decided that this might be our best bet.  Two haircuts a month, and two years later, these still run like the day we got them.  They cut quickly and well, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the motor dying on me or the blades not being able to handle that amount of hair like I did with the cheaper clippers I had purchased.</li>
            <li> Great clippers. Cut great and are very smooth.  Only thing is they do heat up toward end of hair cut. Keep lubed and clean and they will work awesome</li>
            <li> thank you very much it is good i can bye again from you when needed and sorry for responding so late and have a MERRY CHRISTMAS</li>
            <li> I just finished using these great clippers.  was cleaning up when they fell off the cabinet.  1sst time using them outta the box.  The body of the clippers broke right below the blades.  DONE.  THEY are finished.  I thought i could have these for years to come.  THey fell onto a marble floor.  i dont think it is a manufacture defect. its my fault.  i though they would take at least a couple drops though, being professional quality.</li>
            <li> Ive had these clippers for a little while now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cut easy and clean. I highly recommend these. Probably one of the best sets IVe ever had.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.... I have coarse hair and the detachable gaurds are a huge plus for low haircuts. Must buy.</li>
            <li> Costs 4 times more than other clippers, cuts 10 times faster.&lt;br /&gt;Real professional quality.&lt;br /&gt;Y&#x27;know how you have to go over your head 50 times to get an even cut and nail all the stragglers?&lt;br /&gt;Not with this puppy.&lt;br /&gt;Just imagine the opening Basic Training haircut scene from Full Metal Jacket.....</li>
            <li> I just owned them a short while but so far I&#x27;ve been impressed with how smooth this clipper operates. It cuts quickly and evenly. It is also more quiet than I expected for a plug-in.</li>
            <li> The oster 76 is worth every dollar it cost.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s US made, and it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;Blades are very sharp, motor is powerfull.&lt;br /&gt;It cut&#x27;s through hair like it is made for it,&lt;br /&gt;total different than the 10$ useless products&lt;br /&gt;made in China.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my oster hair clipper after 31 years of use.  I replaced it with this NEW oster hair clipper and like mY original oster this new oster is a very fine high qualitY product.  well made and powerful.  GREAT MACHINE</li>
            <li> I purchased these clippers to replace a set that I owned for over 15 years.  I was a little hesitant because of previous knock off brands that was corrupting the market.  The price was perfect and when I got them home to use, I was amazed at how effortless and perfect they worked. This is a great product for the working professional or anyone that maintains their appearance on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Great product, Oster Clasic 76 is the best hair clipper ever for home and professional hair cut. It&#x27;s not noisy and the iron clipper are very durable.</li>
            <li> These clippers are the best.  I bought some Whals a year ago and I noticed that they weren&#x27;t cutting like they used to.  I&#x27;m no barber and I cut my own hair so I did not use them as often as a barber would.  Maybe once ever 1 1/2 to 2 weeks.  When I first used these clippers I was in love.  Just the way the sound and especially how easily they cut my hair.  I use the 000 blade and I cut even all around.  They probably saved my 10 to 15 minutes in cutting time, and I do not have to go over the same area as much.  I would highly recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li> Gets real hot and reminds me of old BMW or Mercedes motor. The revolutions don&#x27;t run tight it runs like an old sewing machine motor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably good to shave the head.</li>
            <li> Comes with only two blades. I suggest buying the comb set as well. Works excellent.</li>
            <li> the clippers arrived two weeks ago and tried working with it twice, the body and blade (the whole thing) gets hot after 4-minutes and i believe there&#x27;s something wrong with it! what should i do? should i return it? is this normal? i don&#x27;t think this is a normal feature...</li>
            <li> This unit is excellent with true professional qualities inlcuding an excellent motor and clippers that are professional grade.  i would recommend it to anyone for home or professional use.</li>
            <li> Love it, but a little heavy...</li>
            <li> I bought these over a year ago...a lot of haircuts later and am so pleased I purchased the Classic 76.  Excellent quality that is sure to provide many years of trouble-free service.  I highly recommend these clippers for home and of course commercial use.</li>
            <li> Oster makes a great set of clippers.  This was a gift so I have not used them myself.  Was a good deal</li>
            <li> Works great for cutting hair. Easy to use and clean. Multiple guides make styling easy and length of cut easy. Would buy again</li>
            <li> These clippers get the job done every time!!!! Would definitely recommend these to anyone looking to purchase a great set of clippers!!!!!</li>
            <li> I had decided about a year ago to just buzz my hair when I noticed it wasnt going to be long till I had none left. You know, the ladies dig the Jason Statham look, so just go for it. I also at that time decided I didnt need to pay $20+ for a haircut every few weeks or month when I could do it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up one of those beginner package Wahl clippers with the 10 additional size clips and stuff for under $30. I didnt know any better so I started using that. After giving the clipper a good cleaning the first time, I noticed the blade was off a bit. I undid the screws and tried to realign the blade and it was better but not perfect. I did some research and it seems that happens if the unit has been dropped. I figured it was inexpensive enough that I didnt care at the time and just kept using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a week ago I decided it was time to upgrade since my Wahl didnt seem to be cutting as short as I needed and the blade seemed to have shifted again. After much research I ended up with this 76 model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the new clippers and upon taking them out of the box I knew they were quality. They looked just like the ones I had seen at my barber shop(probably the exact same in all reality), It had great weight to it, the blades looked to be a giant leap over the Wahl and the whole thing just exuded a premium feel. Even the power cord is thicker and seems like it would last a lot longer. One nice thing I liked is the little metal hanger on the bottom so I can hang it from the wall. Its a little thing but it keeps it off my countertop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I powered it up and turned it on, it vibrated at such a higher speed that I could feel it was going to cut much better. It was much quieter too. On the first pass I didnt even realize I had cut anything as there was absolutely no resistance. It went through like butter and the only way I knew it had cut a nice swath of hair is all the shavings that fell in the sink.I continued along the rest of my scalp it was fantastic. Very easy to use and I didnt find the weight of it or shape to be of any difficulty to use. I guess if you&#x27;re going to use it all day long thats a different story. I used it for about 5 minutes and I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I also really liked is the ease of changing blades. Just pull back on the blade and slide it out. Slide the new one in and pop back down into position. Brilliant and solid!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly can&#x27;t imagine how much better(or what would make it better) the clippers that sell for twice the price of this. I highly recommend this clipper to anyone looking to start shaving their head for the first time or just to replace the clipper they already have. This one, if treated properly it seems, will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> The Oster classic 76 is an amazing pair of clippers like others I&#x27;ve purchased previous clippers from the big retailers for between $30 and $50 only to have to replace after a couple years because they are warn out or just don&#x27;t cut anymore.  I can already tell that with these the ending will be much different.  The thing is totally servicable so if parts wear out you can replace them same with the clipper head if it becomes dull just buy a new one which run around $20 or so.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews saying these are loud but to me they aren&#x27;t at all.  You can tell from the first cut that these are well above the rest in quality and reliability.  I use these for personal use cutting my own hair as well as my sons so I will use them twice a month same as I did with my previous clippers.</li>
            <li> Over the past 30 years I have used many cheaper sets of hair clippers... I finally decided to take the plunge and spend the money on a good set! What a huge difference!!! I wish I had done this years ago... It would have saved a great deal of tears and money!!! ;)</li>
            <li> This is a professional piece of gear - and it shows. The blades are excellent and the cutting effortless. Blade change is easy. Comes with a long chord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of caution - if you use the 00000 blade be VERY CAREFUL. This blade will cut through skin just as easily as it cuts through hair. I went back to the 000 blade and that works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this purchase. Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I am using this product at home and it is only being used on one person - me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clipper is as described.  Heavier duty than I need but certainly does the job.  It is hefty and there is no doubt it is a professional grade unit not a \\&quot;consumer\\&quot; device that will break or fail in a year or two.  I probably could have got by with a cheaper device but this one sure is nice.  As some others have said - Cadillac Quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a few tries to get used to holding the clipper correctly to take care of the whole head, especially while doing the back of the head, but it is not difficult.  My wife would have done it for me but my goal was to simplify and speed up the hair-cutting process so that means doing it myself. The cord is stiffer than some electrical cords but that is also something I got used to - have to kind of deal with the stiff cord with one hand and run the clipper with the other - and I take that overbuilt quality to mean that the whole unit is tough and will last a long time - heavy duty cord, heavy duty motor and sharp, professional heavy metal cutting blade.  I use the #1 size blade.  The motor is plenty strong; it does not slow down even a little when in use on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the clipper about 2 - 3 times a week before I get in the shower to maintain a uniform appearance.  It only takes about 2 minutes each time.  The clipper does not begin to get hot in that amount of time.  Heat is not a problem at all for me.  Maybe it would be in continuous, professional use.  I only mention that because it is the one complaint I was aware of before I got mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am saving money on haircuts and I am saving time by doing it all at home without driving or making an appointment or having to wait for my stylist to be available.  It is possible that I will buy a rechargeable battery-powered unit for convenience but that is not at all a criticism of this unit.  I had never held one of these or had this kind of all-clipper haircut before I bought this one so it was the fact that there were some unknowns that maybe held me back from buying it - didn&#x27;t want to waste $120 on an unknown product.  I sincerely wish now I had bought it 10 years ago.  \\&quot;Haircuts\\&quot; by this method are now so quick and easy I don&#x27;t even think about and I guess I am saving more than the cost of the unit every year.  If you are putting off the purchase because you are not sure about the quality of the clipper or the ease of use or what you will look like with this kind of \\&quot;haircut,\\&quot; just go ahead and get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at several other brands, including Andis, Wahl and Panasonic and several other models in this brand and went with this because it seemed to be a middle-of-the-road standard kind of unit that I could probably sell if I didn&#x27;t like it.  It turns out I didn&#x27;t need interchangeable blades but I didn&#x27;t know at the time which blade I would need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I exercise and perspire and this kind of haircut is the easiest and quickest for cleaning up and taking care of after exercise.  I also like looking pretty much the same all the time as far as the length of my hair.  I never go around looking like I need a haircut.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  After running through two sets of cheap shears, I decided to step up and buy there.  These are designed to be used by barbers giving multiple hair cuts every day.  By that measure, and given my one cut a month, these should last me forever.</li>
            <li> These clippers are barber shop quality clippers.  They get the job done!  The down side would be that they are a bit heavy if you are cutting your own hair.  Took me a while to get used to holding the bigger heavier clippers while buzzing my own head.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a replacement to a different big brand that let me down in under eight haircuts. So I decided to try the Oster Classic 76 and it actually cuts better than the other brand did when it worked. I can absolutely recommend these if you are looking for a reliable easy to use set of clippers. I purchased these for personal use but if I were a professional I&#x27;d be buying these.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Just as described. Work great!</li>
            <li> Went through 2 of these this year. Great when they work, but when the worm gear goes bad, and you are in the middle of shaving your head...&lt;br /&gt;And the same gear always go bad, I&#x27;ve had many of these over the years and usually I keep an extra gear which can be purchased here http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OUV7Z8 - easy enough to replace but you would expect a product to last for more than 3 months. Why doesn&#x27;t Oster make the gear out of a more heavy duty plastic or metal? I know they make gears to fail in case something jams and its better to strip a gear vs burn the motor but the strength of this gear is laughable. I don&#x27;t have extra thick hair or anything special, and it fails every 3-6 months without fail. Just strips the gear.</li>
            <li> Good investment; get the 00000 attachment</li>
            <li> Had this for awhile now and it is a truly a professional hair clipper. I&#x27;m glad I purchased this Oster hair clipper. Pays for itself in no time.</li>
            <li> This product broke less than 6 months after purchase. The power button broke off. I used the product less than 10x in 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, the clipper gets EXTREMELY HOT while in use. It happens very fast as well. If a typical haircut would take about 20 minutes, this product was barely able to be held properly because of the excessive heat after less than 10 minutes of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a terrible product for the money i spent on it.</li>
            <li> Holy smokes, this thing is a Cadillac compared to my cheap clippers that my wife has trimmed my hair with for 10 years. Super happy with these.</li>
            <li> HAVE ALWAYS USED OSTER CLIPPERS WHEN I WAS BARBERING AND WAS NEVER DISSAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best Hair Clipper out there. This is what most professionals use on their hair salons.</li>
            <li> Way better then the cheap ones!</li>
            <li> The best hair clipper i&#x27;ve ever had, and i&#x27;ve been through many. It may not be the most ergonomic clipper but it sure makes up for its akwardness through its shear power and accuracy. This thing will cut every hair the same uniform length. it is a great product and I can see why many people give this thing 4/5 stars. Would give it 5/5 if they improved the design for better grip.</li>
            <li> This is the first review I have written on Amazon, but I felt compelled to report my dissatisfaction with the Oster Classic 76 clippers and Oster&#x27;s customer service.  I purchased the clippers on Amazon in December 2010 for $124.42.  Now thirteen months later, in January 2012, the clippers have stopped working properly.The only way that the motor will turn on is if you hold the base of the cord near the plug at a crimped, 90-degree angle.  My husband cuts his own hair and cannot hold the plug in this jury-rigged position to operate clippers.  We have maintained the clippers carefully, and they have been used only 6-7 times since being purchased. We tried plugging the clippers into many outlets in our home, but the same issues occur at each outlet.  The cord or plug is clearly defective.  I called Oster&#x27;s customer service number just now (800-830-3678), and I left very frustrated.  The woman on the phone had such a thick accent and poor English skills that I could barely understand what she was saying.  The main points that I took from my phone call to Oster were: (1) the clippers are only warrantied for 12 months, (2) since it has been 13 months since my purchase, we are on the hook for the repair, (3) there are no authorized service centers within 100 miles of our home in Rhode Island, and (4) we&#x27;d need to send the clippers to Oster in Tennessee where the repair would cost $59.38.  I asked the customer service representative if the fee would still be the same if Oster verified that the defect was in the manufacturing, and she said that it will be $59.38 no matter what.  We are totally dissatisfied and will not be buying any more Oster products, hair clippers or otherwise.</li>
            <li> Turned it on to test it. Cut great was happy. A week later went to use for an actual haircut and wouldn&#x27;t turn on. NOTHING!!! Just past the return date to amazon so stuck with it. Really feel burned on this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Wow really happy with amazon! Within 24 hours of leaving this review I received an email that they will refund the full amount. This was the first issue I had with an Amazon product and it is great they went out of their way without me having to call around. I was planning on calling Oster today but Amazon took care of my problem. Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> You can tell they are very high quality clippers ... very strong sharp blades that will last forever... the motor gets very hot though...</li>
            <li> If I could rate these clippers a 10, I would!!! I cut my hair every week, and went through countless cheaper clippers that pulled my hair and would take all day to cut my hair.From the moment you turn these clippers on, you can tell they are unlike any others you may have tried. It takes me no time to cut my hair now. I know they are expensive , but they are worth every penny By the way, buy them here on Amazon . At Sally&#x27;s, they are more than $200. You WILL NOT be sorry if you buy these clippers</li>
            <li> It live up to my expectation i love it keep up the good word wonderful love it love it  love it</li>
            <li> This oster classic motor clipper worked wonders for me. As a balding person, it really helped me clip the sides of my head for a smooth shave. Used this product for a while now and very much would recommend this to anyone who is interested in skipping the expensive barber shops!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Very solid construction, clean cutting lines and great steel components.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: You need to use the power cord for it to work. This can be difficult when cutting your own hair sometimes. My next purchase in this category will certainly be a battery-option.</li>
            <li> These are great, but heavy, not great for small hands.</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy but it does the job for my grandson who has hair enough for two people.  Save me a lot of time, very, very good.</li>
            <li> Works great on my head. It&#x27;s a little bit aggressive when I try to man scape my pubes. I recommend something smaller for man scaping.</li>
            <li> Unclear how to change out the blades.  If you have better instructions on how to change out and install the blades I sure would like to have them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;boseimmp@msn.com</li>
            <li> Best made, always reliable, company always improving it&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;We started cutting hair at home during our early years of marriage when we had very little.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with a classic! I wish they would have come with their own guards and not just the 000 and 1 guard. Other than that - they are fairly quiet and cut well. I had to adjust to the added weight and the motor puts out a lot of wind which can blow the clippings around.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers but they are no joke hardcore.  The first time I used them I was a little afraid, they seem like they could shave the wool off a heard of sheep.  This thing is a beast, and is probably a little overkill for most people including me.  They do give you a perfect clip without the dumb little plastic combs. One length at a time, no adjustment.  You have to buy and switch out blades for differnt hair lengths.  The blades included with the clipper 1 and 000 are skinhead boot camp army style short, so buy a bigger blade, 3 3/4 blade worked great for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend Oster&#x27;s fast feed clippers over these, I have them too,  if you want to cut your own hair... much more home user friendly.  also way less expensive.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaver. Definitely meets expectations. No plastic parts.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Seems well built. Runs warm. Leaves lots of hairs sticking up for me.</li>
            <li> Good product for grooming.</li>
            <li> WHY YOU SHOULDN&#x27;T BOTHER WITH A CHEAP BUZZER:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through two Wahl clippers, each bought for $30-40. The first set was fairly well made and lasted a good 10 years. But when it started to wear out, I decided to get a new unit instead of just replacing the blades. Over that decade, Wahl&#x27;s manufacturing standards dropped dramatically, and the brand new one wasn&#x27;t even close to the old one. After a few years of use, the cable broke internally because you had to kink it at one particular spot every time you wanted to fit it in the provided case. Poor attention to detail in their design. I tried to find a replacement part, but it&#x27;s a victim of throw-away culture manufacturing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY YOU SHOULD DISH OUT A LITTLE EXTRA FOR THE OSTER 76:&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the box, you can tell that the Oster 76 is a cut above the rest (sorry, pun intended). It&#x27;s solid and clearly well built, without being overly heavy or difficult to hold/manipulate. The mechanism for swapping different length blades is well designed. The power cable has double insulation where it meets the clipper, to avoid breaking like my Wahl. Flip the heavy-duty ON switch and the difference is clear. Instead of sounding and feeling like a mini weed whacker, this guy whirrs with little vibration. After so many years with cheap buzzers, I didn&#x27;t even realize how poorly they cut. The cheap ones pull as much as they cut, require many passes, and still miss plenty of &#x27;rogue&#x27; hairs. This is the cleanest haircut I&#x27;ve had in a long time. And if somehow, after years of use, some part wears out or breaks, just look it up on the full schematic and order a replacement PART and fix it yourself. It&#x27;s a shame that the ability to repair something has become so rare that it&#x27;s a selling point, but there you have it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oster 76 + attachment guides will pay for themselves in under a year and I suspect they&#x27;ll last a lifetime. So if you&#x27;re waffling, just do it. You&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li> Very good clippers.  However, for the price it would be nice to get a storage case and blade holder with it.  The Oster name on the name plate wore off after a year of use.</li>
            <li> 3 stars because my plastic screw part on the left side of the clipper look like someone had tampered other than that the clippers are good but just be care when buying from Amazon..</li>
            <li> The moment you put these clippers in your hand you know that they are professional grade. They are a bit heavy and maybe even a little hard to use if cutting your own hair but that&#x27;s the sacrifice you make for a great quality cut. I would recommend these to anyone who is sick of the cheap $20-$30 clippers you find in stores.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about 1 1/2  years ago.  After about 12 haircuts, it stopped working.  You could hear the motor, but the blades would not rotate.  The 76 Classic became a Classic Failure.  If this is what the pros use, they are going through a lot  of them.</li>
            <li> Got tired of the $20 clipper you’d find anywhere and paid the price of some real clippers.  I have thick hair so those cheap clippers would always bog down but not the Oster.  Cut clean and without having to do another pass over that I would have to do because my other clippers would have left some stays standing.  Worth the investment!</li>
            <li> These clippers are great until they break. Which has now happened twice for me.    The problem is that oster clippers use a plastic worm screw gear to drive the head. This worm screw gear wore down to the point of failure after 2 months of weekly use to shave my head. I returned to oster under warranty and they fixed it. A month later, same problem.    After spending $120 on this i expected it to be a pro level hair clipper that will last. Unfortunately this was not the case and I now have to put up with constantly fixing for 20 bucks for the parts each time after my clippers break mid haircut or wait a month for Oster to fix it. Unacceptable!</li>
            <li> It made it easier for my husband to be well groomed at all times.  Guess who was his hairdresser?  Let&#x27;s just say it made it much easier for me.</li>
            <li> They cut smoothly and don&#x27;t push the hair like cheaper clippers that you by in department stores.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is heavy, it feels poorly built, the hanging loop was installed wrong and I had to fix it. The included #1 clipper blade that comes with this seems much shorter than other #1 blades I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> nice clean cut very strong clippers</li>
            <li> I use this every week end since i bought it - strong and sturdy - no failure REMARKS An air blower would be a nice thing to have for maintenance. Good unit 08-02-2017 UPDATE. No issues from the begining, i use it every WE since the first day. Just oil the blades. Amazing product</li>
            <li> Only reason I did not do the five stars is that the item is quite heavy to work with. It is of great quality though. I already knew I had to purchase the plastic clipper covers separate. I liked this actually as I only needed three &amp; often a whole collection are sold together. I went to a local beauty shop that sells them, to purchase only what I needed. They sold the Oster for much more money, so this is a great site for a better deal!</li>
            <li> This hair clippers is simply a heavy duty professional hair cutter.  Not any of those cheap $20-40 ones that ultimately break down and become crappy a few months to a year in.  This product is great and will last a LONG time.</li>
            <li> It broke after first use. Think it was defected. Not satisified with this purchase at all and I threw out the box not thinking that I would have a problem :(</li>
            <li> I went to barbering school and this is the Gold Standard of clippers. This machine blends hair better than ANY machine out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Spend the money...go for quality.</li>
            <li> I bought these a month or so ago because I have been shaving my head for over 2 years now and I needed to upgrade to good clippers. It was the best move I could have made. These are solid and much quieter than I expected. They go through my hair and never get bogged down. They are solid and plan on using them for many years to come.</li>
            <li> This clipper is built to last so you&#x27;ll get your monies worth. If you are looking a clipper for home or professional use this is it. You&#x27;ll be pleased with the fell and the outcome. This is my second set and I&#x27;ll stick to this brand from here out.</li>
            <li> They are great, I should have gotten them years ago. When you turn them on you can fell the difference.</li>
            <li> The clippers are a little heavy, but you can feel that they have a lot of power, and they cut perfectly. I highly recomend these over the $20 ones that you have to replace every year! great product!</li>
            <li> Several years ago, I decided to start cutting my hair very short.  I bought a cheap clipper made by GE at Walmart. I \\&quot;thought\\&quot; it did a good job until it broke and needed to get a new clipper.  Since I save so much cutting my own hair, I decided to invest in a better clipper.  I bought the Oster Classic 76 and I LOVE it. It cuts easily for a perfect cut.  Often, as you may know, you do not know how good something is until you have something to compare it to.  Some people have said it is heavy in other reviews, but I did not find that to be the case. (fyi...the individual blades are not cheap ($20-25 each) but think of it as an investment).</li>
            <li> Received this thing as a gift and I&#x27;ve never gotten a better one. I&#x27;ve been shaving my head using them wussy products you get at Target or Wal-mart or whatever for about ten years. I now consider all of them years a waste of my life. You can hear the difference the moment you turn it on, it means business and it lets you know. This thing works so well I sometimes shave 2 or 3 times a week with it. Keep your enemies close and your hair closer. Buy this thing now. I came here to buy the 00000 blade just for the fun of it and decided to leave a review. I love this product and so will you.</li>
            <li> For years I have shaved my head, and for years I have used low quality clippers because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money of the professional stuff.  What a mistake.  These clippers, while a bit large and unwieldy, are an incredible pleasure to use.  I have lots of thick hair and the cheap clippers just bind up, get hot, make a ton of noise, and constantly miss hair.  These clippers don&#x27;t even change sound when I swamp it with my hair.  Another positive aspect of these that is worth the price -- no crappy plastic guards are necessary, you can just get easily interchangable blades.  I highly recommend these clippers to anyone who regularly shaves their head -- they may seem expensive when compared to a $30 set from Walmart, but after you use them just one time you&#x27;ll realize that the cheapie ones are actually far more expensive.</li>
            <li> I use it for cutting my own hair.  I go for a close buzz cut.. bought a size 00000 blade also so to get a very close cut (almost shaved but not quite).  I had become discouraged with the cheap clippers I&#x27;d bought over the years (eventually breaking or not cutting very well with use).  Reviews said these last so I decided to give them a try.  I have not had them long but they feel durable and I find the performance is top notch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heavier and a little thicker than the cheaper models I&#x27;m used to but definitely worth their weight.</li>
            <li> I recommend this Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper because it is great at trimming the head and beards. I have bought other clippers in the past but none have had the same kind of power this one does. Really worth the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a year now. It still works as good as the day I bought it. I can easily see this lasting a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great for shaving, trimming beard and neck, and even body hair.</li>
            <li> Some people have complained that this clipper gets hot. I found that too until I used the blade wash to remove the protective grease it&#x27;s shipped with. Now it runs, gives great results and is a joy to use, though it does take a little practice to get good with it. Do get the Oster cutting attachments, but ignore the instructions about putting them on while the clipper is running. It&#x27;s not only noy necessary, it&#x27;s much harder to do. They go on just fine with the clipper turned off.</li>
            <li> I love this device,...I should have bought one these years earlier! Now that I own one I will advise friends and family members.</li>
            <li> These are professional-grade and it shows in the cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smooth operator and definitely makes a difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They say the hairstylist knows all the secrets and this is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little practice and you could actually began charging folks.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I&#x27;m the type of person that would buy a new pair of clippers every once and a while at Walmart/Costco/etc.  I always give myself a buzzcut so I can&#x27;t justify paying someone to cut my hair - I cut my own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found myself having to constantly go over the same spots with the cheap clippers. These clippers give a great cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family has complained about the sound.  They claim it sounds like a dentist drill and they want me to warn them before I use it.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that loud, myself, but beware of the potential noise.  It may be loud for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t used professional clippers before (this is my first time), follow these tips:&lt;br /&gt;Do not use a screwdriver to remove disassemble the blade.  I thought that&#x27;s what you had to do, but the blade components are preassembled.  You have to take the top blade part of in once piece.  Please read the directions or look for a youtube video.  The directions kind of suck.&lt;br /&gt;You absolutely need a blade wash to make sure these work properly.  The blade wash Oster sells is kind of expensive. You probably will only get 5-6 washes out of it.  I&#x27;d suggest using WD40 because I swear...the blade wash is nearly identical at least from my perception of the smell, chemical reaction to rust and other surfaces, and it&#x27;s consistency.&lt;br /&gt;Also be sure to only put a new blade on when the clippers are turned on or you could ruin them (there&#x27;s this pin that has to line up). You can take the blades off when the clippers are off.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also suggest a lubricant as well.</li>
            <li> I got this clipper after previously owning the Oster fast feed clipper for years. This one definitely has more heft to it and a lot more power. Detachable blades make clipping go a lot faster. Very easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> These are amazing I bought them for my boyfriend because he enjoys cutting hair they help him on every type of air that he comes across and now all we need to do is buy extra blades.</li>
            <li> This the best to knock down hair</li>
            <li> Great professional clippers for personal style!! Would recommend to anyone, great quality, ease of use, and a great price online!</li>
            <li> My husband loves these clippers. He has cut hair for years and enjoys great clippers to upkeep his own hair and these fit the bill.</li>
            <li> After burning through 4 consumer grade clippers I finally had an epiphany. Get one professional grade clipper&lt;br /&gt;and be done with it. If I&#x27;d done this originally I would&#x27;ve saved myself the cost of countless haircuts plus the $120.00 +/-&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent on cheap clippers over the years. These are powerful, the quality is evident the moment you begin using&lt;br /&gt;them. Pull the trigger on the Professional comb set while you&#x27;re at it. It&#x27;s the last set of clippers you&#x27;ll likely ever need.</li>
            <li> After throwing away the last $30 clipper from a department store I got this clipper. Works like the barber shop clippers. I took off a star because the head does get warm after about 5 minutes of use. Besides that it cuts the hair like a pro.</li>
            <li> excellent, machine, smooth running and powerful.</li>
            <li> Did not include size #000 blade, oil, grease, or cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> Very powerful clippers.  The product is not too heavy or large for me, with small hands, to operate.</li>
            <li> My favorite clippers.</li>
            <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned and I&#x27;ve had a lot over the last ten years. Well worth the money spent.  Cutting my hair is a snap now.</li>
            <li> We bought the product below as part of a kit, back in 1986, at a small drugstore in Dumfries, VA, just off base at Quantico, VA. I was stationed there during my service in the Marine Corps. Because of the long hours, a new baby, and little free time we bought these so my wife could do my weekly haircuts and I would not have to rush out to try to get my haircut. Semper Fidelis. USMC, SGT&lt;br /&gt;Oster Adjustable clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Service Number: 606 OIE</li>
            <li> This is a great product, i&#x27;ve cut my own hair since 10 years now and I must that this is the best one I used so far. Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap like the one you buy for 50-60$. Some may say it&#x27;s exagereted to buy a professionnal unit to cut your own hair, but i&#x27;ve spent more on cheap unit. Fit right in the hand, not that big like other mention. Doesn&#x27;t become hot on the portion that you hold, if well lubricated. The cord is heavy duty and should last long, the retro style is just beautiful. It&#x27;s the first time in my life i was exited to open the box of a hair clipper lol. The blade are excellent quality (size 0 and 1). I also got the plastic adapter which work great and also feel like good quality.</li>
            <li> I do love how fast and powerful they are but they are pretty noisy. It was a good investment other than that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cut my husband&#x27;s hair for over thirty years and this is without a doubt the best, easy to use clipper ever.  Only problem is you cannot buy tapered combs for around the ears for this model - bummer.</li>
            <li> These clippers do a pretty good job, but aren&#x27;t what I expected. Everybody says these clippers are great, but you still have to keep going over and over your hair. I thought they would blow through the hair much easier. Not as great as they are cracked up to be. Probably worth $70-80.</li>
            <li> well made tool, recommend</li>
            <li> Great price on a great product!</li>
            <li> These clippers are exceptional!  As someone who shaves his head weekly and has given himself haircuts his entire life, i can&#x27;t say enough how important it is to invest in good clippers.  Before i had purchased these, i had been buying the cheaper versions available in department and drug stores.  These almost always left me disappointed, and often times in pain since they tend to pull out more hair than they cut.  They just don&#x27;t pack the cutting power that the Classic 76 does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these back in 2010 and still use them today (weekly in fact).  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s definitely worth the extra money to invest in a good pair if you are going to be using them on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> cuts everything is beautiful</li>
            <li> These clippers will stop at nothing to cut through hair. My last two or three clippers/trimmers eventually wore out to where they were snagging/pulling on hairs. I like the quick change system that Oster has designed for the cutting blades. One thing with professional clippers like these is that the blades are wider than what I was used to with cheaper clippers/trimmers, so they don&#x27;t seem to &#x27;hug&#x27; your head as well while clipping, but you can get used to it. I&#x27;m considering getting #0000 or #00000 blades as I like it real close (waited to see how close the #000 blade that comes with the set was). These clippers are large...I hope I don&#x27;t ever drop them, not that they probably wouldn&#x27;t keep on working, but you just might crack the thick plastic housing some what.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit for my kids hair cuts.  Wow, compared to the Store brand models this thing can cut.  It is really good for thick hair.  The only bad thing is the clipper takes some getting used to when working fades.  I would recommend another smaller set to handle the fading portion.  Otherwise though this thing will last forever if you take care of it.</li>
            <li> if you need a hair clipper...his is the best i have ever used...a bit heavy but powerful and durable...worth the money...</li>
            <li> STILLLL cuts my head smooth bald with no problem...very quiet and never had any problems at all..def worth every penny and saved me money over the long run from having to constantly buy cheap broke down clippers..I cut my hair and face with these and it leaves both looking smooth</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this oster clipper. I always wanted this and finaly got this and you know what? what a piece of junk. after 10 mins of using its burning hot ! I am returning this</li>
            <li> When I read reviews saying this was loud and big I was apprehensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those reviews however are completely mistaken. This is the exact same size as my $20 clipper was. And it is not even half as loud. I can put this right next to my ear and it&#x27;s like a whisper. I have no idea what other reviewers were talking about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are easy to change, but the additional blades are very expensive, at $20-30ea. Since I got this just to easily cut my own hair I got combs at $20 for all sizes: [[ASIN:B001T0HHB0 Oster Professional 10 Universal Comb Set Specially Designed to Fit Oster Clippers]] which are very high quality and are spring loaded to snap onto the blades the come with this. You can do a really tight buzz cut or cut your hair long enough so it&#x27;s not even spikey with the 2-inch comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This motor is high quality. You can tell that it is barely working, even to cut through my very thick hair. When I go into the barbers my hair will jam up their clippers.. which always causes them to go \\&quot;wow your hair is thick\\&quot;. When a barber is telling you that you have thick hair you know it must be true. Anyway, this motor does not struggle at all. I can go full speed whisking this thing through my hair and it doesn&#x27;t even stutter. I use osters clipper oil before and after each cut so the blades stay sharp, don&#x27;t rust, and the motor has it easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades do warm up, but that is to be expected, they don&#x27;t get too hot to touch by any means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fan is attached to the motor which circulates air through it, the motor does not get hot. The brushes of the motor, the things that make contact with with electric motors, on higher quality motors are designed to be replaced since they are usually the first thing that will go bad due to friction. I bought an extra set of brushes right off the bat for a couple bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> Comes highly recommended and it does the job,  Sturdy construction although a bit bulky and warm to the touch after extended use</li>
            <li> Clippers are ok,. They get hot a little to fast though. I would recommend them to others to use instead of buying clippers with guard combs</li>
            <li> Very nice clippers...the only part that worries me a little is that the clippers get really hot really fast. I dont know if it is built to be able to handle the heat, but I get worried that it is going to overheat. Other than that, it works really well.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best clippers I&#x27;ve had. I&#x27;m a professional stylist so I&#x27;ve tried a lot and waited a while before committing to these because they cost more. I should&#x27;ve have bought them first and saved myself the price of a half dozen lesser quality clippers. They are a little heavy but it&#x27;s worth it. Even my clients noticed the difference, said the clipper cut was much smoother.</li>
            <li> Perhaps should have sent it back for an exchange as it gets hot. Not sure if they all get this warm but if using a great deal might be to warm to hold</li>
            <li> I just bought these clippers and have just begun using them. I have always bought the 20-30 dollar ones from Walmart, Target or wherever and over the years have bought more than I care to mention. I took care of them -- oiled -- greased -- void of hairs and they all have ended up in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 76 is a beast -- I keep my head tight usually with no guard which always pinched, scraped, or nicked my head. I have been using the 000 with no issues. It&#x27;s a little bigger than I&#x27;m used to so I&#x27; m learning how to hit all the angles and I will be ordering the 00000 in the very near future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are considering an upgrade just buy it you&#x27;ll feel the difference as soon as you take it out of the box</li>
            <li> These were ordered for my military son. His wife loves using them because of the quality of clippers. My son gets his cut and is happy.</li>
            <li> This hair trimer is outstanding!  I tried the Whal brand, they never worked good for me.  These clippers are the very very best!  I am stationed overseas and needed something really good to keep my hair trimmed.  This is it!</li>
            <li> My kids have been using it almost daily for more than a year and they are very happy with the results</li>
            <li> After Years of riding the fence, I finally made the plunge and bought the Classic 76 series. Maaan, why did I wait so long?!? These clippers are as good as I remember them to be. Now when I cut my hair, I get that consistent, even professional look that would get from coming out of the barber shop. If you cut your own hair, or your children&#x27;s hair often, make the investment and by the Oster Classic 76. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I can do a line of hair in one go, unlike any other clipper I&#x27;ve used.  Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Best in class. If you&#x27;re just starting out, this is NOT for you. But if you want a reliable powerful blade system, the 76 is IT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m bald and like to wear the hair I do have very close to the scalp, like .5-1.0mm, so I trim it weekly. I have been doing this for almost 2 years and in that time, this is the 3rd pair of clippers I have had, graduating to better quality each time. The first I had was a $25 Wahl set from Walmart which kind of sucked out after awhile. I had to do numerous passes to get all the hair, even though I sharpened the blades. I went onto another Wahl set, a $50 model with a more powerful motor. Up until yesterday, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d been using for the last year. It&#x27;s okay but I saw it running into the same issues as the first set and I figured that since I clip my hair weekly, it made sense to invest in the best. After much thought and research (and a $100 Amazon gift card from my mother-in-law), I went with the Oster 76. I have only used them once but so far, I am impressed with the speed and ease with which it cut through my hair, requiring only two passes...one to get all the hair and the second one being my anxiety and wanting to just make sure. I also noted the ease of use with the detachable blade system. It came with two blades but I ordered two more for tapering. Easy to switch them out and much more reliable than plastic guards, at least in my opinion. Also, this baby is built solid. A little on the heavy side but if you drop it, it&#x27;s casing looks to be unbreakable. I can&#x27;t wait until next week to use this thing again. I&#x27;m just a regular middle-aged bald guy who cuts his own hair at home. If that sounds like you or someone you know, I suggest you give this beast a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. Do some research like I did, you&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> The problem I had with this product is that about after 15-20 minutes of use it got really hot, I&#x27;m not sure if it was just the one I got or do they all do this but I have owned many clippers and never have had this happen. I guess I&#x27;m just going to stick with buying Wahl brand clippers. I returned them and Amazon promptly refunded me. Kudos to Amazon, they get 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair clipper for my husband after reading a lot of different reviews. Although it is more expensive than some other hair clippers, we both appreciate the quality of the product, the fact that it&#x27;s US made and how easy it is to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband started shaving the first time and I had to help him with the back. There were reviews that said it was heavy and I&#x27;m sure it would be if I had to cut a lot of hair in a day but only having to shave my husband, it wasn&#x27;t that difficult and I&#x27;m a tiny person. By the second use I became quite proficient at it and it took about half the time to shave his head as it did the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this hair clipper.</li>
            <li> I was waiting impatiently for the classic 76 after hearing it described as the king of clippers. I was disappointed to noticed that in using it with the \\&quot;0\\&quot; or \\&quot;1\\&quot; blade would catch and pull on my hair. Does this happen to anyone else?</li>
            <li> Hello everyone. I want to compliment Oster on such a well built machine. It has unmatched power for a pair of electric hair clippers. I do want to let everyone know that the item description is incorrect. I was exited to be getting the two agion blades as stated in the product information. Amazon had the best price if it had indeed came with the 2 agion blades. You can imagine my disappointment when I opened the box to discover it came with the 2 standard blades. Now I am frustrated, because I am not going to return the clippers because it came with the wrong blades. I will on the other hand not shop with Amazon anymore. I do not like dishonesty, so I will be taking my business elsewhere! I hope this review helps someone else from making a mistake with this purchase.[[ASIN:B00070E8LA Oster 76076-010 Classic 76 Professional Hair Clipper]]</li>
            <li> Purchased there clippers to give myself a buzz cut two years ago and they are still cutting awesome. I clean out the hairs and add some clipper oil before and after each use. These are quality clippers.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers.  My hair is thick, and the cheap $30 clippers would always bog down if I tried to take too much in one cut.  Not with the Oster clippers.  Now my hair cutting time is half what it use to be. As far as some of the negitive reviews, they are not as loud as the cheap $30 ones, yes they have a little more weight to them but they are professional, and finally the do get a little warm, but not enough to bother or concern me.  I have to say these are by far the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Nice set of clippers, you can tellits high quality.  They get pretty warm if you use longer than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  This product came with 2 blades of different sizes.  I am able to cut my hair with the smaller blade while I cut my son&#x27;s hair with the larger blade.  As a black man, it works well on my head and face.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my home to last longer than the cheap ones.  Every year I buy at least two cheap hair clippers that end up burning out - I live in a large household that uses them a lot.  But the cost didn&#x27;t leave me ecstatic about them - although I thought it would be worth it.  The problem is they do not cut as close as the cheap ones do.  I use it to shave my head.  That was a real disappointment for me.  It also gets extremely hot.  My hair never grows long enough to find out if it is way more powerful than a cheap one.  All in all it was not worth it for my purposes but for someone else who cuts thick long hair often it might be.</li>
            <li> Been cutting hair since college... (not professionally)  Have used Wahls most of the time.  Nothing beats this unit.  Gets a little warm but not uncomfortable.  I use it to cut my sons hair every two weeks.  Blades are great and fit the way they are supposed too.  Very good unit.  Worth every cent...</li>
            <li> My husband cuts his own hair once a week and his facial hair at least twice a week.  In the past, he has used just about every other brand of non-professional hair clippers (usually the ones they sell at Target, Ulta, etc), and they have not held up like the Oster Clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, I found the same clippers at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, but they were ridiculously marked up.  I bought them from Sally&#x27;s, just out of needing them ASAP for a gift, but when I got home and found the same clippers online for over $100 less, I placed my order on with Amazon and returned my purchase from Sally&#x27;s.  The shipping time was outstanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves them and the maintenance on them is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, they are on the more expensive side, but the quality is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought it as my other clippers were turning dull and pulling out hair. WHAT A DIFFERENCE. It feels like your cutting butter with a heat knife. It is a quality product. You can feel it just by taking it out of the box. Sure it is no where around the $30 price tag like other machines, but it will last you a life time if you take care of it. Think of it as a investment and you will never have to buy another set of clippers again.</li>
            <li> The clippers were new in a sealed box. The blades were sharp. They work as expected for a commercial clipper.</li>
            <li> I have only used the clippers once so far but I am very pleased with the results. They have plenty of power and produce a very even cut. Iw on&#x27;t waste my money on cheap clippers again!</li>
            <li> This are the best clippers he ever had my man said it works perfectly and he is very satisfy with it</li>
            <li> Just as expected arrived earlier than planned</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get the clipper guards with this set, so I just went back on Amazon and got the sizes that I needed. It gets hot after a few minutes of use, but that&#x27;s pretty normal for clippers.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Very quiet.  Smooth cutting through thick hair.  HIGHLY recommend to all.  Amazon had a great price.  Also, I&#x27;m using a Keter 18in for storage.  Works great for all the different blades and clipper, cape, etc.</li>
            <li> Cuts fast and cleanly. I replaced a low cost clipper I bought at sAMS.  No comparison.  No issues at all.</li>
            <li> I have used an Oster 76 before and wasn&#x27;t reluctant to buy one for myself.  I was able to order one on-line and it was just what I expected.  The box was the same as the one  at Sally&#x27;s and it was ready for use which I used for a non-profit fundraiser.  It came in the day just before the event and I was able to use it, just like I had planned.  Thank you Amazon you truly saved the day!!</li>
            <li> These are Classic Oster 76 Clippers..........enough said now go buy! Invest in yourself! Your Image!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use them for myself and they make the job so easy I actually have fun giving myself basic haircuts.</li>
            <li> The Oster Classic 76 are high quality clippers, expensive, but will pay for themselves quickly, and should last forever with home use.  Have had these for a few months, my wife does my haircuts, she likes these and does not find them heavy or difficult to use.  I bought an extra blade (size 1 1/2) and that is the only blade I use, so no plastic guides.  It seems there is a better cut when using the bare blade.  The blades on this Oster are mechanically reciprocating (not just vibrating like the cheap clippers).  The instructions said &amp;#34;Professional Use Only&amp;#34; and I thought maybe I gone too far in the search for high quality clippers, but they are nice for home use too.  There is a nice video on the Oster website that will show you how to grease the mechanism and other useful tips.</li>
            <li> These clippers will change your look and your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Less hair looks better, feels better, and offers the benefits of being a bit butch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They cut SUPERBLY!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Splurge on yourself.</li>
            <li> Wonderful clippers.  Well built.  Go to the Oster styling site to see how to maintain these clippers. Clipper heads are machined and not stamped like cheaper models.  Clipper heads change out easily since  the head is on a snap pivot.  Leave the clipper running to snap the new clipper head into place so the power mechanism can self seek to connect.  Buying this unit you will need to buy oil to keep it lubricated.  A small amount of oil and grease come with the unit.  You will need to grease this unit once a year.  This is not difficult.  Go to Oster styling&#x27;s site to see how.&lt;br /&gt;This box set had an extra clipper hear for doing fine clipping on the neck and around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I bought this clipper is that I noticed that many of the cheaper units sold started pulling hair after six months to  a year.  If something happens to the clipper head, buy another head for around $20.00.  These are well built and precisely made.  I doubt if a clipper head will give you problems, unless you drop it.  I also bought Oster&#x27;s Professional 10 Universal Comb set to go with this unit.  I am glad I did.  This makes clipping easy ----- the higher the number the longer the cut.  If you are going to do years of cutting, spend the extra amount for this unit.  You will be glad you did.  This is a quality product.</li>
            <li> ok this trimmer reminds me of a truck or a harley davidson. It is seriously solid and will easy last a lifetime. Best trimmer I ever had.</li>
            <li> Simple.  Basic.  Reliable.  This is my second Oster product.  I highly recommend this product.Easy to maintain (see youtube video). John</li>
            <li> This product works great and gives a professional haircut.  Came in on time and works exactly as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Great item! My BF loved it very very much! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought these two years ago and wish I had invested in a good pair 20 years ago. I started out with the whal clippers at walmart for about 30 dollars. they would last around 2 or 3 years and then break in the middle of cutting my hair. I cut my hair once a week and these things rock. they have tons of power and don&#x27;t ever pull my hair. the blades are easy to change and last a long time. Make sure to oil the blades everytime and grease the inside once a year. watch youtube for easy instructions. I use the 00000 blade and it cuts really close. I guarantee you wont regret buying the oster classic 76</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves it and so far, the best investment considering that he cuts his hair every ten days :)</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers for my son who uses them everyday.  Because he&#x27;s gone through so many, all of minimal quality, I bought the Oster Classic 76 for him knowing they were top of the line and hoping he&#x27;d love them.  So far, very, very good.  He really loves them.  No more pulling, no more uneven lines or untrimmed sections.  We&#x27;re both very pleased and would highly recommend them to anyone.  Thanks so much, Oster!</li>
            <li> Works great, very powerful and smooth.</li>
            <li> This clipper really does a great job. You can tell by how smooth the unit works. The clipper is a little heavy but worth it for the results.</li>
            <li> Very happy witj my clippers and new blades so glad i ordered these. Never used this kind before so very happy .</li>
            <li> was damaged in shipment, the power switch broke.  I did not like any of the options, which all involved waiting for a refund, so I purchased a switch from another vendor on amazon.  I actually used the clippers with the broken switch, plugging the clippers in to turn and unplugging to turn off.  I still liked them, although inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After replacing the switch, I love it!  There are four boys and a me that get hair cuts every three weeks or so.  These are the best I have used, including professional clippers from wahl and andis.  These are heavy and the switch may be fragile, but the motor is powerful and the blades run cool.  maintenance is super easy, as is changing the blades.  awesome.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this hair clipper now for some months, really likes it  and finds it very durable.  It cuts so nice and short.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for at-home haircuts. My purchase decision was based on input from barbers/salon workers. For months, I would quietly ask barbers/stylists what type of equipment they recommended. The vast majority--maybe 95-100%--recommended Oster for trimmers like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but I can tell it is going to last for years and years. Build quality is great, and it just feels like a professional gadget when you hold it in your hand. Does a very nice job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been clipping my hair pretty short for the past 8 years or so, always using a set of cheap Wahl clippers. They always did they job and would only occasionally give me a problem. One day, for some reason, I decided to research hair clippers and soon learned that the Classic 76 was considered one of the best. It seems this is popular with hair stylists because of it&#x27;s durability, quality and power. So on a whim I just decided to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s constructed well and I like the blade system they use, and the fact that it is serviceable is great. These things seem like they will cut through thick hair with no problem. It&#x27;s much larger and heavier than your average hair clipper so it takes a little getting used to, if you clip your own hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this thing 3 stars is because it gets REALLY hot after 5-10 minutes of use. I&#x27;ll probably just use my Wahl&#x27;s from now on.</li>
            <li> VERRY VERRY GOOD &amp; THE PRICE WAS RIGHT.</li>
            <li> Blade moves to slow I can&#x27;t work as fast as I&#x27;m use to, I should of got the one w the adjustable speed. Other than that works fine good price</li>
            <li> best clipper ever ! the last one you will ever need to buy !</li>
            <li> Outstanding cut. quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Much better than the cheaper sets we use to buy. Does get a little warm, however the noise is not that bad like some other reviews stated.</li>
            <li> I have been cutting hair as a professional barber since 2002 and I own my own barbershop. I have allways used the whal senior clippers also know as an adjustable clipper for all of my clipper haircutting. These clippers (the oster) is know as a detachable blade clipper because the actual blade comes on and off. I will try to breack down the differences between the two. Well first off the oster Is defenitly louder however it&#x27;s not overly loud. If you compare the number 3,2, and 1 guards between the two clippers you will notice that the oster numbers are actually a little bit longer than the plastic guards, however because they cut so smoothly the hair actually looks a little shorter. It doesn&#x27;t miss anything. It takes a little getting used to when you switch. But it&#x27;s worth learning. When doing skin length fades it&#x27;s better to work longer to shorter. One thing I miss is the adjustable lever of the whal clipper. I end up still using both. The one 1 blade and the triple 000 blade are equivalent to the adjustable clipper in the opend and closed position respectfully.  Your def. going to want to pick up the 3 and a half blade, the 2 blade and the one and a half blade for the oster. The one and a half blade is perfect for clipper over comb work. Even the thickest hair is no match for the oster. Even if it&#x27;s a little wet. I took off a huge thick beard the either day and it went threw it like a hot knife threw butter. Very powerfull like I said. The other advantage to the oster Is that it cuts the hair while you pull the clipper away from the head so blending the hair is easier then the plastic attachments of the whal. I don&#x27;t think you need anything higher than the 3/4&#x27;s inch blade cause after that you can just use sissor over comb and it comes out mint. All in all I&#x27;m very happy. Worth the money. But I recommend using both clippers. The adjustable clipper is still good for around the ears tapering. So let&#x27;s say after you use the one and a half blade on the oster. You canswitch to the wahl clipper and open the lever up and it basically the next size down. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> The quality of these Oster 76 Classic clippers was evident the moment I picked them up out of the well packed box. They are clearly quality through and through. If you&#x27;re looking for professional level hair cutting equipment, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come with two tubes of lubricant, one grease and one oil. A guard for the blades and two sets of blades, a 000 and a 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my own hair and I like it short. As soon as I got these, I put on the 000 head and the #0 guard and went to town. They are so quiet compared to my previous buzzer clippers. I could scarcely tell they were cutting due to being so sharp and the guides so smooth. But the first look in the mirror revealed the quality I&#x27;ve been wanting for so long. Nice smooth even cut with no stragglers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the quality that will last decades and be passed down to my children.</li>
            <li> These clippers are professional clippers but they are now in the hands of an amateur.  I have always had the cheap department store clippers and these are a long ways from the cheap vibrating motor clipper.  When you turn them on you hear the sound of a quality motor.... and the blade action is smooth as silk.  I expect these babies will last and be part of my estate that will be fought over.  Be prepared to buy the extra comb set and or additional blades.  It is nice that that blades pop off with no tools for cleaning and lubrication.  The clippers are big and a little heavy but they are powerful.  I should have bought a set of these years ago.</li>
            <li> I have purchased at least 6 different hair clippers for 30 or 40 dollars and they do not cut at all compared to this piece of art.  There is no bogging down with this clippers.  Very precise and made to run for long time.  Of course they are more expensive than the cheaper ones, but the difference is no comparison.  There is no going back and forth trying to catch every last hair because it gets them all.  I am a carpenter and know what a quality tool feels like and this is it, only more precise.  I am very happy for this purchase because I can cut my hair on my time without appointments.  You get better at it once you&#x27;ve done it a few times.</li>
            <li> Cuts a lot better than WA__ _ now lets see for how long .</li>
            <li> Good product very pleased.</li>
            <li> The is low of this item compare to other website that&#x27;s why my wife is happy with this.</li>
            <li> does what they are suppose to do... it was nice to have the extra razor in the package</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been doing hair for over 10 years and have not found a clipper of better quality. This clipper will take your men&#x27;s haircuts to the next level. You can blend so much better. I have been using these for 8 years and just has to replace mine that broke. Still love them</li>
            <li> If you ever need replacement parts, good luck.  Oster&#x27;s customer \\&quot;service\\&quot; is about as bad as it gets.  It seems they despise their customers.</li>
            <li> works just like I&#x27;m at the barbershop</li>
            <li> Buying the same model again. I have a number of blades already. The last one lasted 8 years for an estimated 280 total haircuts before the motor seemed to fail. I rarely lubed the blades, which may have caused it to struggle and go bad sooner?</li>
            <li> This is a professional quality clipper.  It is much better than the less expensive rechargeable clippers.  Very easy to change cutting blade and clean after using.</li>
            <li> The definitive set of clippers. What more can be said.</li>
            <li> I placed an order for these clippers, but got trimmers instead!?!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to get my new clippers, I&#x27;d considered this purchase for a year or two.  I took it strait out of the box, lubed up the blades a bit and cut one side of my head.  They seemed to work fine, but having nothing to compare it to the blades seemed to move at a slower speed than I expected from the appearance of the motor.  So I moved into the bathroom to finish my cut and it would do nothing but pull my hair, cutting very little.  I called Oster hoping for a quick fix only to be told that the techs go home at 2:30!?  Back to Amazon these will go, haven&#x27;t decided if I&#x27;ll try another set or another brand yet.  Very frustrating!</li>
            <li> I do 15 to 20 clipper cuts a day. Powerful accurate operation. Performs best when you have all the blades and guards. Lasted 10 months before it needed repair. Replaced all the worn parts from Amazon for about $30. Works perfect again. Everyone I work with that use wahls or andis are having to buy new clippers twice as often. These are what you want.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the new 76. My dad bought a 76 several years ago before they started to put CLASSIC 76 in big bold letters and the thing is indestructible, its been used and dropped and used again and it still works. The blades are a different story, they work ok but within a year ull have to replace them.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews here I purchased this clipper for my personal use. I have already used it up to 5 times and it works great. One minor concern I have is, when I tried to replace the comb, the blade easily came off clipper and it wasn&#x27;t easy to put it back. I had a Wahl clipper before and in comparison the difference in performance is significance. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband received the clippers for Christmas. Most satisfied with the purchase.  He tested them out that evening&lt;br /&gt; Gave  his older clippers to our brother in law</li>
            <li> Clippers put streaks in my hair.....Save your money it&#x27;s not worth it</li>
            <li> My wife cut&#x27;s my hair and over the years we have gone through too many clippers.  I decided to buy this one because I was sick and tired of my hair being pulled and other problems.  I wish I had bought this thing to begin with.  It does a better job, does it faster, is easier to clean and to top it off I&#x27;ve yet to have my hair pulled.  Sometimes you actually do get what you pay for and this is one of them.</li>
            <li> This thing is the Cadillac of clippers that I have used. For years I have shaved my head with cheap $20-$30 all in one sets sold and big box stores. After being consistently disappointed with the cut produced from the cheap clippers I decided to take a look around. I came across these and did a little research. And broke down and paid the higher price then other hopping they would produce better results and last longer. What I found is these are well made. Look like something produced decades ago when things were built right. They are heavy but it&#x27;s not a concern to be because the quality makes up for this big time. The cut produced is well above anything else I have tried. The cutters are sharp and can be easily replaced. I don&#x27;t have to worry about small cuts to my head like I have had with others. These things are quality I mean quality. They are made so you can replace parts of need be. I plan on following the maintenance schedule the manufacture follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the best part is the cut it provides is the best</li>
            <li> We are required to use these clippers at the salon I work for. I bought my first pair two years when I began working at the salon, along with the necessary blades. Even with regular cleaning and maintenance, the blades constantly pull and fall apart. I maintain the clippers as required, and they constantly shake, the blades do not close all the way, the face plate falls off, etc. I bought a second pair this past December, and a couple weeks ago the same thing began happening. So now I have 2 pairs of clippers I need to send in for repair- and they are not cheap! I am the first person to use the spare pair of clippers the salon just bought. They are brand new- yet they keep stopping while I am cutting. I believe there is something wrong with where the wire connects to the clipper- and no we do not wrap the wire up. I hate these clippers and would never buy them if I was not required to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for a couple of months now and I still can&#x27;t get over how easy and quick it is to trim my hair now. The machine does make a lot of noise and does get hot after a while, but I&#x27;m usually don&#x27;t within 5 - 10 minutes, so this is definitely not a problem for me.</li>
            <li> The is the GOLD standard. Used in the world over. I would purchase again and again. Great price. This is not a small clipper but you will appreciate its power and simple design.</li>
            <li> I first tried these on  my dog who has incredibly thick and fine hair,  and they worked superbly. After a through cleaning I tried them on myself and was thrilled at the ease of the cut and the fact that I was able to clean up my very short haircut without a trip to the barber.</li>
            <li> Works good but getting very hot very soon</li>
            <li> I love my new clippers.  They are very quiet compared to my last clippers.  I have used Oster for over 20 years and they have a great product.  I really like the changable blades vs putting a plastic piece over the blade. It&#x27;s too easy for that plastic to fall off.  Will be a fan of this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> It works just like I thought it would will be using it for a very long time gladly recomend it</li>
            <li> Have had this over a year now.  Very high quality piece made in the USA.  My uncle used to cut my hair with one just like it 50 years ago.  His still works...</li>
            <li> I purchase this at least once a year as I am a stylist (of 8 years)and this my choice to use as this brand is very affordable and dependable</li>
            <li> These truly are the Cadillac of Hair Clippers. I had been using cordless clippers for years. On recommendation of a co-worker I finally splurged on these. I cannot believe I waited so long. These things get all the hair in one pass without leaving stragglers! I recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Second pair , this new one is the Strongest clipper ive ever had&#x27;. Hope it holds up for many years!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I decided to stop spending money to have my dogs hair cut by a professional and do it myself.  The Classic 76 flat out gets the job done.  I have two American Cocker Spaniels and this product efficiently and easily cuts through their hair in no time, reducing the time and stress put on them.  Great product, well done Oster !!!!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing these clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Pro; These are solid clippers.&lt;br /&gt;Con: They are heavy and only have an on/off switch.&lt;br /&gt;The Con is only because I have little hands and it can be difficult to use. However, I cut my husband&#x27;s hair and he recieved compliments. I definitely would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I usually shave my head and wear a +/-3 day beard most of the time. if I let my stubble or hair on my head grow out for more than a week, I&#x27;ll give it a buzz with these. Also use these in the spring when I trim my winter beard, has no issue cutting through thick hair. Works like a charm every time, don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever have to buy another pair of clippers. They are large though, so if you&#x27;re using them on your own, be prepared for some awkward angles/configurations because they&#x27;re pretty big to control with one hand while looking in a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great quality, very durable.</li>
            <li> You can do some awesome clipper cuts with an Oster.  Clean and precise.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. It does get hot pretty quickly but still seems to work.</li>
            <li> Best clippers in the world.</li>
            <li> It broke on the first use!  These are supposed to be the best on the market.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrific and does not overheat quickly using the blade cooler lubricant.</li>
            <li> This is the Cadillac of hair clippers. Cuts hair beautifully. I use them in the salon and at home. If you take care of them they will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the money. It is quiet when it is running and the blades are super smooth. You can feel the quality when you are using it and it is made in America. I have gone through 3 different clippers; Conair lasted less than one month-had 2 little wires holding the blade on and they snapped quickly. This clipper has metal parts and when you take the blade off you can see how sturdy and well made it is. Blades don&#x27;t grab the hair and can handle very thick hair. Should last for quite awhile.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who has very, very thick and curly hair.  He said the ones he purchased in the past weren&#x27;t up to the job. This one works beautifully for him and his hair looks great.</li>
            <li> Should have bought one years ago, fooled around with cheaper clippers that never lasted or worked very well. This clipper is great. It&#x27;ll pay for itself before the year is up. Not only am I saving money by cutting my hair myself I&#x27;m saving lots of time. No driving to and from the barber, no waiting for my turn and it only takes like 5 minutes. I always thought my barbers were dragging out the cut to give the illusion that they were doing something involved. No one can tell that I&#x27;m cutting my own hair. In fact i&#x27;m doing a better job than the Barbers.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats this clipper. I love my wahls but the oster cut is so much more tight and clean without leaving those sprigs from split ends. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> 4 1/2 years.  Still going strong.  Use it regularly for full body trimming/grooming.  Have NEVER oiled it or done anything except pull clumps of hair out when accumulate under blade.  I&#x27;m emphasizing my poor care of this product in order to highlight just how much higher quality it is than &amp;#34;that other brand.&amp;#34;  Prior to splurging on this Oster 76 Classic in 2010, I was going through another of  &amp;#34;that other brand&amp;#34; AT LEAST once/year.  This Oster is the berries.</li>
            <li> well done guys easy fast reliable just back when needed again,, hopefully furthest possible&lt;br /&gt;a b c&lt;br /&gt;bye bye&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riccardo</li>
            <li> Excellent. Low noise. Low vibration. I am a balding guy who cuts his own hair once per week.  No comb-over, just the Mr. Clean look with the help of the Oster 76076.  High end product with low maintenance and a fair price. I used to pay $20 a week for a hair cut but I now pocket that extra change and let my Oster save me the time, money and hassle of going to the Barber Shop.</li>
            <li> Cuts Clean and easily. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a Classic.  The 9&#x27; Cord is the best no more looking for a closer outlet or extension cord. Great service great price.</li>
            <li> still works great, highly recommended.. this is what my barber uses as well.</li>
            <li> if you cut your own hair. I&#x27;ve had several hair clippers and this is the best. easy to use and no more blades falling off.</li>
            <li> CANT SAY ENOUGH ABOUT THIS PRODUCT. WORKS GREAT, VERY QUIET, WELL MADE, PRICED RIGHT,&lt;br /&gt;..... ... ...... ... ... ...</li>
            <li> I love it and it is still in use!  I use it my clippers often and I love them a lot!</li>
            <li> I have used the oster classic 76 hair clipper for years , it holds up to every day professional use.  I consider it the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i spent the extra money to buy this bad boy. I bought Wahl before, andy&#x27;s and norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A BADA$$ CLIPPER, VERY WELL BUILT, WORKS LIKE A CHARM, VERY SATISFIED!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPEND SOME EXTRA BUCKS AND BUY THIS ONE!!!</li>
            <li> Have been using cheap clippers for years of cutting my own hair, should have stepped up to this sooner. Does a better job in one pass than cheaper clipped do in multiple passes.</li>
            <li> Every professional barber owns at least one of these. They are big and noisy, but that is because they need to be powerful, They last for years and years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only came to the reviews section to verify that the retailer was legit and clippers were brand new. I received the clippers in perfect condition, and i&#x27;ve been using them 6 days a week for a couple of months without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend these for home use, but instead get the wahl seniors, or andis masters or better yet visit the barbershop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a must for barbers, stylists can get away without having them. Do not buy them for personal use if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing, again this is a professional clipper made specifically for professionals. Do not pay attention to most of these other reviews, these people have no idea what they are talking about.</li>
            <li> You know the deal: Haircuts were getting shorter and shorter and finally I decided to take the plunge and do it myself. My barber had been using the Classic 76 so that&#x27;s what I bought (after a ton of research). They are so easy to use, and do such a great job! Mine came with the #1 and #000 blade and I&#x27;ve been using the later. It&#x27;s short, but I&#x27;ll get the #0000 in a few weeks. Truthfully, this clipper is maybe overkill for once-a-week haircuts but it does SUCH a good job! No stray hairs, no gouges, just an overall great experience. Expensive? A little. But I&#x27;m convinced that with proper maintenance it will be decades before I need another clipper. Get this and enjoy! And think about the $$ you&#x27;re saving in the long run if you&#x27;re cutting your own hair!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using the Classic 76 for about 2 months, cutting my hair about every 4-5 days so I wanted to update this review and say I love the Classic 76 even more than when I first got it. Maybe the best $ I&#x27;ve ever spent for personal care. I used the 000 blade for about 3 weeks and it&#x27;s fine, but I sprung for the 0000 and it while it doesn&#x27;t seem a lot shorter on the initial cut, I notice that I can go an extra day or two before I&#x27;m compelled to cut my hair again. So the 0000 for me &#x3D; 4-5 days between cuts (6 maybe) rather than 3-4. May not sound like much but to me it&#x27;s worth it. I have no desire to go closer than the 0000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased a Wahl Echo trimmer as a companion to the Classic 76 (facial hair, quick neck trims, etc.) and while I&#x27;m no barber I can tell you this: for me this is a killer setup. Classic 76 was about $100, Wahl Echo was $42 and the 0000 blade was $20. So for about $150 I can cut my hair whenever I want with great equipment that will last a long, long time. I also use it to cut my toddler son&#x27;s hair so we&#x27;re saving a nice amount of money every month. Not to mention the convenience. If this is what you&#x27;re looking for I hope you have as good an experience as I&#x27;ve had. Highly recommend!d. Highly recommend!</li>
