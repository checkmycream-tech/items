    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>But for an office worker and mom--this works great for me.  </li>
            <li>great alternative to aluminum products....</li>
            <li>Well, I bought this after reading the good reviews and so thought it makes sense to put my word in based on what I think of it.</li>
            <li>Really good stuff</li>
            <li>and works good in all respects.  </li>
            <li>This powder contains no talc or synthetic fragrances and works effectively.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant nor does it even cover odor well on its own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also nice sprinkled liberally over the body.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell, easy to use, and you can put it wherever, not just armpits</li>
            <li>This deodorant has a pleasant, light scent.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t even apply it more than once a day.</li>
            <li>The product is okay but buy it from someone else.</li>
            <li>This has become a favorite product in my home.</li>
            <li>but I won&#x27;t tolerate commercial.poison that most products contain,</li>
            <li>I have tried many natural/organic brands.  </li>
            <li>Love this powder</li>
            <li>but this is so much better and sometimes lasts longer than talc.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff-</li>
            <li>it has a softer feel and has a more feminine scent than Pitstop powder.  </li>
            <li>This product is OK; keeps wetness away</li>
            <li>This product is superb and it keeps you dry all day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great mild product, but not quite good enough at keeping odor at bay.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t name them, but they are the ones most readily available in stores.  </li>
            <li>a great underarm solution if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Used a competitors brand and it didn&#x27;t do the job of masking the smell from my pits but this product really did a good job</li>
            <li>I must say that after nearly a week of using it, I find it to be very effective.  </li>
            <li>but it is easy to just reapply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, too.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this product because it works</li>
            <li>The smell is fabulous and there are not chemicals in this stuff.</li>
            <li>GREAT solution to red irritated skin.  </li>
            <li>I make most of my buying decisions based on the reviews and people had such good words about this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a very nice powder with simple ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if you do excessive activity or exercise, you may not be so impressed.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light and clean, a smidge sweet; not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking to switch to a dry, pleasantly fragranced deoderant-only powder, I recommend this.</li>
            <li>It extends the &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; of what you where and can also be used as a quick refresher when you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
            <li>I even tried making my own deodorant using coconut oil, essential oils, and baking soda.  </li>
            <li>This has a very pretty soft light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using this and love it.</li>
            <li>but I really like this on both armpits.</li>
            <li>works really well, with no reactions like itching.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I use a little more then a pea size.  </li>
            <li>Funny thing is it&#x27;s usually just my right arm pit with all deodorants while my left one is fine</li>
            <li>Considering it isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant, I was just very surprised not to find myself sweaty by mid-morning.  </li>
            <li>This was not a small amount.</li>
            <li>The faint fragrance is just that...faint and pleasant.</li>
            <li>I even tried baking soda alone and lavender and tea tree oils alone...a little better, but still not enough odor protection.  </li>
            <li>and it is not harsh.  </li>
            <li>I sweat a lot, and was worried about not using an antiperspirant, but it has been satisfactory so far.</li>
            <li>so I ordered a natural stick deoderant &amp; it should arrive tomorrow.</li>
            <li>I use this powder along with an oil based natural deodorant and the combination to the two will outstand just about anything.  </li>
            <li>I use it after I apply regular (natural) deoderant.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> but I still use conventional antiperspirant occasionally.</li>
            <li> It wont last all day if you are going to sweat but take some with you and reapply half way through your day.  </li>
            <li> Only one of the five days for some reason I was sweating extra hard and had B.O.</li>
            <li> This has become my go to for regular everyday use</li>
            <li> Other deodorants just add to my B.O. problem.  </li>
            <li> Also, its very rough to apply.</li>
            <li> You might think the powder application would be messy, but I simply apply some to a cotton round and dab under my arms after showering.  </li>
            <li> I bought four of this product and within the hour the price went down almost half---I contacted this seller regarding a refund for the difference and they didn&#x27;t even have the courtesy to respond.</li>

            <li> It really isn&#x27;t messy.  </li>
            <li> It was messy, not very effective and I smelled like an almond joy--until i started to sweat.</li>
            <li> It works but not as well as the pit powder I used in the past.</li>
            <li> I know talc is not good for us and so is aluminium based deodorants.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so hard to find anywhere else!  </li>
            <li> I ordered HoneyBee Gardens deodorant merely on a whim.  </li>
            <li> No patchouli scent at all (which I hated about another brand I tried).</li>
            <li> I stink bad!!</li>

            <li> this stuff works well. Pleasant smell, easy to use, and you can put it wherever, not just armpits ;)  It&#x27;s comfortable, too. Not gritty/clumpy.</li>
            <li> I bought this not knowing how well powder could work.  This product is superb and it keeps you dry all day.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice powder with simple ingredients.  Shipping was on time.  I enjoy using this product because it works and it is not harsh.  You need to reapply if you sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> Used a competitors brand and it didn&#x27;t do the job of masking the smell from my pits but this product really did a good job and I didn&#x27;t even apply it more than once a day.</li>
            <li> Works well and no discoloration under the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought four of this product and within the hour the price went down almost half---I contacted this seller regarding a refund for the difference and they didn&#x27;t even have the courtesy to respond. This was not a small amount. The total difference was approximately $16.00. The product is okay but buy it from someone else.</li>
            <li> This powder contains no talc or synthetic fragrances and works effectively.  This has become a favorite product in my home.</li>
            <li> This deodorant has a pleasant, light scent. No patchouli scent at all (which I hated about another brand I tried). I sweat a lot, and was worried about not using an antiperspirant, but it has been satisfactory so far. (We&#x27;ll see how I feel when the heat of summer hits).&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking to switch to a dry, pleasantly fragranced deoderant-only powder, I recommend this.</li>
            <li> Well, I bought this after reading the good reviews and so thought it makes sense to put my word in based on what I think of it. I make most of my buying decisions based on the reviews and people had such good words about this one.&lt;br /&gt;I still stink by the end of the day after using this and I do not even do anything that would make me sweat. Also, its very rough to apply. Just like applying baking soda to your armpits(DUH! it has baking soda in it). But if you are someone used to applying Talcum powder like I did in my childhood days, you would notice that its not at all silky textured like the talcum. I know talc is not good for us and so is aluminium based deodorants. Hence was looking for an alternative but this is not it. I stink bad!!</li>
            <li> This has a very pretty soft light fragrance.  I&#x27;ve used it five times now on my armpits.  I use a little more then a pea size.  Four of the days I used it, it lasted all day even after a 30 minute workout on an elliptical one day and a 45 minute bike ride in the sun another day.  Only one of the five days for some reason I was sweating extra hard and had B.O. but it is easy to just reapply. Other deodorants just add to my B.O. problem.  Funny thing is it&#x27;s usually just my right arm pit with all deodorants while my left one is fine but I really like this on both armpits. Really good stuff and there&#x27;s no drying time or stickiness.</li>
            <li> It works but not as well as the pit powder I used in the past. I want to get away from the powder all together so I ordered a natural stick deoderant &amp; it should arrive tomorrow. Even the pit powder would give out after 12 hours but I won&#x27;t tolerate commercial.poison that most products contain,</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a non-aluminum based deodorant for awhile.  I have tried many natural/organic brands.  I won&#x27;t name them, but they are the ones most readily available in stores.  I even tried making my own deodorant using coconut oil, essential oils, and baking soda.  It was messy, not very effective and I smelled like an almond joy--until i started to sweat. I even tried baking soda alone and lavender and tea tree oils alone...a little better, but still not enough odor protection.  I ordered HoneyBee Gardens deodorant merely on a whim.  I must say that after nearly a week of using it, I find it to be very effective.  Perhaps if you do excessive activity or exercise, you may not be so impressed.  But for an office worker and mom--this works great for me.  You might think the powder application would be messy, but I simply apply some to a cotton round and dab under my arms after showering.  You could even dab some on a washcloth and apply.  It really isn&#x27;t messy.  The faint fragrance is just that...faint and pleasant. Considering it isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant, I was just very surprised not to find myself sweaty by mid-morning.  It does seem to stop the sweat.</li>
            <li> Love this powder and it&#x27;s so hard to find anywhere else!  I use it after I apply regular (natural) deoderant.  It extends the &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; of what you where and can also be used as a quick refresher when you&#x27;re in a rush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently using this and love it. I used to use talc but this is so much better and sometimes lasts longer than talc.</li>
            <li> I use this powder along with an oil based natural deodorant and the combination to the two will outstand just about anything.  The smell is fabulous and there are not chemicals in this stuff.</li>
            <li> Honeybee Garden Deodorant Powder is part of my daily hygiene regimen.  The scent is light and clean, a smidge sweet; not overpowering.  It&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant nor does it even cover odor well on its own.  I use it in combination with unscented crystal rock deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also nice sprinkled liberally over the body.</li>
            <li> works really well, with no reactions like itching. great alternative to aluminum products....and works good in all respects.  try it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff- it has a softer feel and has a more feminine scent than Pitstop powder.  This has become my go to for regular everyday use but I still use conventional antiperspirant occasionally.</li>
            <li> a great underarm solution if you have sensitive skin.  It wont last all day if you are going to sweat but take some with you and reapply half way through your day.  GREAT solution to red irritated skin.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to replace Crystallux powder deodorant which is now discontinued.  This product is OK; keeps wetness away but I still smell at the end of the day.  (I never did with Crystallux!).  It&#x27;s a great mild product, but not quite good enough at keeping odor at bay.</li>
