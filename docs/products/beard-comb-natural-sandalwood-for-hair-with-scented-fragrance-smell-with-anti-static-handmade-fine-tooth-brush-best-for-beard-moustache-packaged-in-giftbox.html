            <li>and &amp;#34;I LOVE MY BEARD&amp;#34</li>
            <li>just so I have them, I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li>The beard comb comes in an elegantly packaged box.  </li>
            <li>In my eyes, I can safely say that without a question the comb I found inside, was a premium beard comb.  </li>
            <li>While holding it, I noticed it had a nice weight and smooth texture.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is very durable.</li>
            <li>I love the beard comb.</li>
            <li>i love this comb.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Firstly what stood out was the packaging – it is top notch.</li>
            <li>Much better than my crappy plastic comb.</li>
            <li>Really love that sandal wood smell.</li>
            <li>Just got my beard comb today and love it.</li>
            <li>Works really well with oils and balms, and hasn&#x27;t lost its great smell.</li>
            <li>probably more so than any beard comb out</li>
            <li>As soon as I got it I fell in love.</li>
            <li>Guess, I was expecting the comb to work better than a brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always a pleasant surprise when you receive something that looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Its a great comb for a classy beard.</li>
            <li>The comb does smell wonderful and is carefully constructed.</li>
            <li>easy to use, easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I use this comb every morning on my beard and  in my hair - it is sturdy and rigid and can easily get through my beard where others have struggled.</li>
            <li>Fits in a pocket easy.</li>
            <li>, the material feels good in the hand and smells masculine and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Great comb for my newly grown full beard.</li>
            <li>Solid product with beautiful craftsmanship.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s incredibly meticulous about his beloved beard, and was so happy with this, he&#x27;s gone through a few other beard combs and they all seem to break after a while or wear out, but this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great handy dandy little comb</li>
            <li>just wish it came with a pocket carry bag or case overall great buy .</li>
            <li>light but with some heft to</li>
            <li>Bought it for my boyfriend and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li>Great product wish I bought it earlier</li>
            <li>enjoy</li>
            <li>Solid wood, great sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li>It is substantial in the hand and does not feel cheap.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re getting a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>My beard had finally grown to a length to need a good beard comb, and I could not have picked a better one.</li>
            <li>The packaging is amazing and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and he is sooo excited to get it.</li>
            <li>Honestly I have no negative comments.</li>
            <li>at first the &amp;#34;wood&amp;#34; smell was a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li>At first I did not know how I was going to like the sandlewood smell, but now I love it.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with my beard comb, it&#x27;s got just enough weight to it that I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to break it, and the smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Like other reviewers said, this comb is beautiful.</li>
            <li>The weight of it in your hands lets you know you are holding something special.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to purchase this comb.</li>
            <li>Will be buying more very soon doesn&#x27;t pull out hair or snag on.</li>
            <li>It makes my beard nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I have a professional job which makes me keep my beard neat and tidy at all times.</li>
            <li>It looks cool.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this beard comb, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Nice little comb, looks well made, feels nice in the hand.</li>
            <li>The comb does have a pungent smell but, it fades away quickly, and is not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>Aside from the teeth issues I had, this comb is constructed super well.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it smells great and worth the money.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the sweet comb, bros!</li>
            <li>I love my new comb</li>
            <li>I would have liked one side to have teeth that were wider apart and the other side closer together, like they are on the comb, but overall a very nice comb.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!!</li>
            <li>Unlike plastic beard combs this fine tooth comb is great for grooming through my thick beard and doesn&#x27;t snag or bend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heavy beard and this is a great comb.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the $ plus</li>
            <li>I use it for my beard and hair fresh out of the shower.</li>
            <li>right on time.</li>
            <li>just the right size.</li>
            <li>One of the things I really enjoy about this comb is how solid it feels even though the teeth are fine.  </li>
            <li>This is a great solid quality product and he uses it daily.</li>
            <li>It looks very classy, the wood comb is just a fantastic piece of art .</li>
            <li>This arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>Very Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>Would love to see other scents available.</li>
            <li>First comb for beard.</li>
            <li>This is the best comb I&#x27;ve ever owned in my 5070 years of life, I&#x27;m going back to get a second or third</li>
            <li>Had a distinct smell out of the box, can&#x27;t say it smelled like sandal wood much.</li>
            <li>This one works perfectly and looks much more expensive than it actually is.  </li>
            <li>This beard comb is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have used many different ones and this takes the cake!!!  </li>
            <li>The only reason that I would not give it a 5 is that is doesn&#x27;t appear to be good for coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for good packaging, and they hooked me right away with theirs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The comb itself is exactly as described and is very resilient.</li>
            <li>The advertising copy might be a bit excessive, but this is a good, sturdy product.</li>
            <li>For me, the cost wasn&#x27;t worth the benefit, as I&#x27;m on a budget and for this price I need a beard comb that has both fine and wide teeth.</li>
            <li>I noticed how smooth and solid the comb felt.</li>
            <li>thanks to &amp;#34;Rocky Mountain Barber Co.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants a quality, well-made beard comb.  </li>
            <li>I will be ordering another for my Dad very soon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended for any real “Beardthusiast” out there</li>
            <li>Really like this beard comb.</li>
            <li>Rustic wood smell, very manly.</li>
            <li>Very well made, aesthetically pleasing product.</li>
            <li>This comb works very well on my shorter-length beard.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>Should you really spend 20 dollars on a comb?</li>
            <li>Smells very manly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Misread the description and thought this was fine tooth on one side and coarse on the other.&lt;br /&gt;Still, its a nice comb, the sandalwood scent is not overwhelming (might be stronger once the comb gets damp/oiled a bit from use)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not a wimpy comb like some other brands&#x27; reviews stated (i.e. cheap knock off competitors).</li>
            <li>Sure i can pull it out and start going at my beard without a glance, but I would rather have to look down at my comb before use so that i could choose the side i want to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent comb</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure he disposed of it :/</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>High quality product will recommend to all my bearded buddies</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this comb.</li>
            <li>One fine tooth side, one wide tooth.</li>
            <li>Despite the fact that my husband grumbled that he didn&#x27;t need &amp;#34;a special comb&amp;#34; for his beard, he uses it several times a day and actually told me that he really likes it.</li>
            <li>He is currently working on growing a beard, and it&#x27;s finally long enough for a nice beard comb.  </li>
            <li>The inside packaging has a “velvet” texture to it and the sandalwood comb has a “new shoe” type smell to it out of the box.</li>
            <li>It pulls through my beard easily, with less breakage and tangling.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>That said, i still give this comb five stars because i read multiple reviews and knew exactly what to expect.</li>
            <li>The quality of the comb I received far exceeded what I thought I had paid for!</li>
            <li>Also, the comb is significantly more comfortable to use as opposed to other plastic or metal bristle combs, and I can use it with my beard either wet or dry.</li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite pieces of my personal grooming kit, never again will I go back to those cheap plastic combs that are all too common.</li>
            <li>The quality is okay but not worth the extra price from something not made in America.</li>
            <li>straight up solid.</li>
            <li>The comb will actually works really well on hair as well</li>
            <li>Overall I really suggest this comb even if you don&#x27;t have a beard.</li>
            <li>The product made a great gift, my brother in law couldn&#x27;t stop using it, but only a week later, it got wet and turned green.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re trying to train your mustache, or just want to part in the middle and comb to either side, the style of this comb does not make it very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And just looks classy...</li>
            <li>(the smell will slowly fade in case you&#x27;re worried it&#x27;s very strong),  just as described will not snag or catch unless your beard is very coarse and tangled.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to actually make the purchase because i thought  $20+ for a comb was excessive; but i&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sandalwood has an earthy, smoky aroma that is eminently masculine and, while I am not sure the scent stays in my beard, makes me enjoy combing.</li>
            <li>I never typically leave Amazon reviews but just had to for this beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No pulling and my beard has straightened a ton after only a week of using this high quality wood comb.</li>
            <li>I have a relatively long beard and would like it if one side was more coarse than the other other side, maybe 1 or 2 less teeth, but overall i&#x27;m really pleased with the quality and performance of this</li>
            <li>The only real drawback is that the teeth of the comb are the same size on each side.</li>
            <li>Far from it actually...</li>
            <li>The presentation definitely added to my initial experience with unveiling my new purchase.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other sandalwood combs yet, but I absolutely recommend this one.</li>
            <li>if you comb straight down, then no biggie.</li>
            <li>The teeth are , as you can see, all grouped up tightly, making it incredibly easy to tame your mane.</li>
            <li>You will not be disappointed with this product - an EXCELLENT Father&#x27;s day gift (since its only a few days away).</li>
            <li>there&#x27;s my good and bad.</li>

            <li> gonna be using this for many years.</li>
            <li> and &amp;#34;I LOVE MY BEARD&amp;#34</li>
            <li> just so I have them, I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li> The beard comb comes in an elegantly packaged box.  </li>
            <li> In my eyes, I can safely say that without a question the comb I found inside, was a premium beard comb.  </li>
            <li> While holding it, I noticed it had a nice weight and smooth texture.</li>
            <li> It smells great and is very durable.</li>
            <li> I love the beard comb.</li>
            <li> i love this comb.</li>

            <li> Much better than my crappy plastic comb.</li>
            <li> Really love that sandal wood smell.</li>
            <li> Just got my beard comb today and love it.</li>
            <li> Works really well with oils and balms, and hasn&#x27;t lost its great smell.</li>
            <li> probably more so than any beard comb out</li>
            <li> As soon as I got it I fell in love.</li>
            <li> Guess, I was expecting the comb to work better than a brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a pleasant surprise when you receive something that looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> Its a great comb for a classy beard.</li>
            <li> The comb does smell wonderful and is carefully constructed.</li>
            <li> easy to use, easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I use this comb every morning on my beard and  in my hair - it is sturdy and rigid and can easily get through my beard where others have struggled.</li>
            <li> Fits in a pocket easy.</li>
            <li> , the material feels good in the hand and smells masculine and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Great comb for my newly grown full beard.</li>
            <li> Solid product with beautiful craftsmanship.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s incredibly meticulous about his beloved beard, and was so happy with this, he&#x27;s gone through a few other beard combs and they all seem to break after a while or wear out, but this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great handy dandy little comb</li>
            <li> just wish it came with a pocket carry bag or case overall great buy .</li>
            <li> light but with some heft to</li>
            <li> Bought it for my boyfriend and it works fantastic.</li>
            <li> Great product wish I bought it earlier</li>
            <li> enjoy</li>
            <li> Solid wood, great sandalwood scent.</li>
            <li> It is substantial in the hand and does not feel cheap.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re getting a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> My beard had finally grown to a length to need a good beard comb, and I could not have picked a better one.</li>
            <li> The packaging is amazing and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and he is sooo excited to get it.</li>
            <li> Honestly I have no negative comments.</li>
            <li> at first the &amp;#34;wood&amp;#34; smell was a bit overwhelming.</li>
            <li> At first I did not know how I was going to like the sandlewood smell, but now I love it.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with my beard comb, it&#x27;s got just enough weight to it that I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to break it, and the smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers said, this comb is beautiful.</li>
            <li> The weight of it in your hands lets you know you are holding something special.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to purchase this comb.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more very soon doesn&#x27;t pull out hair or snag on.</li>
            <li> It makes my beard nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I have a professional job which makes me keep my beard neat and tidy at all times.</li>
            <li> It looks cool.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this beard comb, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Nice little comb, looks well made, feels nice in the hand.</li>
            <li> The comb does have a pungent smell but, it fades away quickly, and is not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Aside from the teeth issues I had, this comb is constructed super well.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it smells great and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the sweet comb, bros!</li>
            <li> I love my new comb</li>
            <li> I would have liked one side to have teeth that were wider apart and the other side closer together, like they are on the comb, but overall a very nice comb.</li>
            <li> Thanks again!!</li>
            <li> Unlike plastic beard combs this fine tooth comb is great for grooming through my thick beard and doesn&#x27;t snag or bend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heavy beard and this is a great comb.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the $ plus</li>
            <li> I use it for my beard and hair fresh out of the shower.</li>
            <li> right on time.</li>
            <li> just the right size.</li>
            <li> One of the things I really enjoy about this comb is how solid it feels even though the teeth are fine.  </li>
            <li> This is a great solid quality product and he uses it daily.</li>
            <li> It looks very classy, the wood comb is just a fantastic piece of art .</li>
            <li> This arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> Very Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> Would love to see other scents available.</li>
            <li> First comb for beard.</li>
            <li> This is the best comb I&#x27;ve ever owned in my 5070 years of life, I&#x27;m going back to get a second or third</li>
            <li> Had a distinct smell out of the box, can&#x27;t say it smelled like sandal wood much.</li>
            <li> This one works perfectly and looks much more expensive than it actually is.  </li>
            <li> This beard comb is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have used many different ones and this takes the cake!!!  </li>
            <li> The only reason that I would not give it a 5 is that is doesn&#x27;t appear to be good for coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for good packaging, and they hooked me right away with theirs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The comb itself is exactly as described and is very resilient.</li>
            <li> The advertising copy might be a bit excessive, but this is a good, sturdy product.</li>
            <li> For me, the cost wasn&#x27;t worth the benefit, as I&#x27;m on a budget and for this price I need a beard comb that has both fine and wide teeth.</li>
            <li> I noticed how smooth and solid the comb felt.</li>
            <li> thanks to &amp;#34;Rocky Mountain Barber Co.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants a quality, well-made beard comb.  </li>
            <li> I will be ordering another for my Dad very soon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended for any real “Beardthusiast” out there</li>
            <li> Really like this beard comb.</li>
            <li> Rustic wood smell, very manly.</li>
            <li> Very well made, aesthetically pleasing product.</li>
            <li> This comb works very well on my shorter-length beard.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> Should you really spend 20 dollars on a comb?</li>
            <li> Smells very manly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Misread the description and thought this was fine tooth on one side and coarse on the other.&lt;br /&gt;Still, its a nice comb, the sandalwood scent is not overwhelming (might be stronger once the comb gets damp/oiled a bit from use)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not a wimpy comb like some other brands&#x27; reviews stated (i.e. cheap knock off competitors).</li>
            <li> Sure i can pull it out and start going at my beard without a glance, but I would rather have to look down at my comb before use so that i could choose the side i want to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent comb</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure he disposed of it :/</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High quality product will recommend to all my bearded buddies</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this comb.</li>
            <li> One fine tooth side, one wide tooth.</li>
            <li> Despite the fact that my husband grumbled that he didn&#x27;t need &amp;#34;a special comb&amp;#34; for his beard, he uses it several times a day and actually told me that he really likes it.</li>
            <li> He is currently working on growing a beard, and it&#x27;s finally long enough for a nice beard comb.  </li>
            <li> The inside packaging has a “velvet” texture to it and the sandalwood comb has a “new shoe” type smell to it out of the box.</li>
            <li> It pulls through my beard easily, with less breakage and tangling.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> That said, i still give this comb five stars because i read multiple reviews and knew exactly what to expect.</li>
            <li> The quality of the comb I received far exceeded what I thought I had paid for!</li>
            <li> Also, the comb is significantly more comfortable to use as opposed to other plastic or metal bristle combs, and I can use it with my beard either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It is one of my favorite pieces of my personal grooming kit, never again will I go back to those cheap plastic combs that are all too common.</li>
            <li> The quality is okay but not worth the extra price from something not made in America.</li>
            <li> straight up solid.</li>
            <li> The comb will actually works really well on hair as well</li>
            <li> Overall I really suggest this comb even if you don&#x27;t have a beard.</li>
            <li> The product made a great gift, my brother in law couldn&#x27;t stop using it, but only a week later, it got wet and turned green.</li>
            <li> However, if you&#x27;re trying to train your mustache, or just want to part in the middle and comb to either side, the style of this comb does not make it very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And just looks classy...</li>
            <li> (the smell will slowly fade in case you&#x27;re worried it&#x27;s very strong),  just as described will not snag or catch unless your beard is very coarse and tangled.</li>
            <li> It took me a while to actually make the purchase because i thought  $20+ for a comb was excessive; but i&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sandalwood has an earthy, smoky aroma that is eminently masculine and, while I am not sure the scent stays in my beard, makes me enjoy combing.</li>
            <li> I never typically leave Amazon reviews but just had to for this beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No pulling and my beard has straightened a ton after only a week of using this high quality wood comb.</li>
            <li> I have a relatively long beard and would like it if one side was more coarse than the other other side, maybe 1 or 2 less teeth, but overall i&#x27;m really pleased with the quality and performance of this</li>
            <li> The only real drawback is that the teeth of the comb are the same size on each side.</li>
            <li> Far from it actually...</li>
            <li> The presentation definitely added to my initial experience with unveiling my new purchase.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other sandalwood combs yet, but I absolutely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> if you comb straight down, then no biggie.</li>
            <li> The teeth are , as you can see, all grouped up tightly, making it incredibly easy to tame your mane.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this product - an EXCELLENT Father&#x27;s day gift (since its only a few days away).</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s my good and bad.</li>
            <li> The wood feels of a high quality and there is just a slight woodsy scent that it gives off.</li>
            <li> but it looks like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The subtle smell of sandlewood permeated the air and left a calming, relaxed feeling as I used the comb for the first time.  </li>
            <li> ; for having a launch promo on these combs or I&#x27;d still be pack&#x27;n around a plain old plastic comb!</li>
            <li> The teeth are deep enough for long beards but work just as well on short tight ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My beard is rather long</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27; t had it long</li>
            <li> To me, to have both sides the exact same was redundant and ultimately made the comb not a good</li>
            <li> Agree with other posters that being double-edged, would make sense to have two different densities for the teeth, but that doesn&#x27;t take away from either quality or value for my needs.</li>
            <li> I plan on purchasing the one with the wide teeth also.</li>
            <li> I will say that the teeth being the same on both sides is redundant.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> I only have 1 &#x27;complaint&#x27; and that&#x27;s that it&#x27;s a little too big to carry in my pocket in my work chinos.</li>
            <li> Prefer brushes due to yanking on tangles.</li>
            <li> Small enough to carry in your pocket if you want to.</li>
            <li> This is a hand me down quality comb.</li>
            <li> I thought it was odd that it had a scent</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few days you really start to notice the subtle smell of sandalwood resonating from the comb and can subtly smell it on your beard and hair.</li>
            <li> Even the craftsmanship of the product helps to nestle the comb close to the skin, while not being hindered by even the manliest jut of the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plain fact.</li>
            <li> It has managed to help tame my savage beard</li>
            <li> No snags and no static!</li>
            <li> It also fits in my pocket perfectly, not like a handle comb that needs adjusting every time I sit down.</li>
            <li> Bad ass solid wood.</li>
            <li> &gt;* Difficult for mustache grooming...</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a quality hand made in AMERICA comb... made in China :(</li>
            <li> buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> ...on the flip side, I definitely don&#x27;t hate this comb.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love it. easy to use, easy to hold. straight up solid.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this comb!  It is snag-free, which makes combing his beard comfy and soothing for him, and it leaves his beard smelling woodsy, which is good for me!</li>
            <li> Awesome packaging! Great pocket comb.</li>
            <li> It is a very good product. The comb does have a pungent smell but, it fades away quickly, and is not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> Excellent beard comb!!! My beard loves it. Thanks again!!</li>
            <li> This arrived very fast. It smells wonderful and is very durable. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Everything it shows in the description online</li>
            <li> I just got my comb and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Its a well made comb that doesn&#x27;t rip out your hair. My beard is rather long and I know my wife will be happy I&#x27;m not using her brush anymore.</li>
            <li> Wonderful comb with excellent quality, the material feels good in the hand and smells masculine and refreshing. The teeth are deep enough for long beards but work just as well on short tight ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love using this comb. It is one of my favorite pieces of my personal grooming kit, never again will I go back to those cheap plastic combs that are all too common.</li>
            <li> Good comb made of sturdy material. The only reason that I would not give it a 5 is that is doesn&#x27;t appear to be good for coarse hair. It is best for fine straight hair. In order for me to get it to go through my beard is to use some beard butter and comb it while damp.</li>
            <li> A must have for the beard lover in your life my husband hasn&#x27;t stopped combing his beard since he got it. I would give it more stars if Amazon would allow it :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for good packaging, and they hooked me right away with theirs. the comb itself is amazing, it fits nicely in my pocket yet it has a nice size that makes it easy to hold onto to. I thought it was odd that it had a scent but it&#x27;s a nice one, a lot better then some wooden combs that smell burnt. If you need a nice beard comb I recommend this. I plan on purchasing the one with the wide teeth also.</li>
            <li> First comb for beard. Prefer brushes due to yanking on tangles. Tried it for 4 days, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a quality hand made in AMERICA comb... made in China :( The quality is okay but not worth the extra price from something not made in America.</li>
            <li> Amazing comb!! Definitely worth the $ plus the smell is solid! Thanks and keep up the great products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great handy dandy little comb</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, smooth, straight teeth. Perfect size for ones pocket.</li>
            <li> Nice little comb, looks well made, feels nice in the hand. I haven&#x27; t had it long but it looks like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Husband loves the comb! Nicely made, doesn&#x27;t snag hair. Smells spicy in a woodsy way, very nice. We like it!</li>
            <li> Came on time, love the craftsmanship, love that it&#x27;s a solid piece of sandlewood and the smell, and it is awesome in the beard... gonna be using this for many years.</li>
            <li> Great item glad I ordered displays well and works great will definitely be ordering another.</li>
            <li> Great product, looks great, exactly what is shown. Happy with product!</li>
            <li> This thing is simply awesome. No pulling and my beard has straightened a ton after only a week of using this high quality wood comb. I&#x27;ve thrown away both plastic combs and will never use one again on my beard. You will not be disappointed with this product - an EXCELLENT Father&#x27;s day gift (since its only a few days away).</li>
            <li> Received my comb in excellent condition nice packaging sturdy comb with a nice look and feel.</li>
            <li> Their craftsmanship is excellent.</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional comb- well balanced and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;Its nice smell is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my Premium Sandalwood Beard Comb from Rocky Mountain Barber Co. for about 2 weeks now and it is beardtastic!&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the I noticed how smooth and solid the comb felt. It also fits in my pocket perfectly, not like a handle comb that needs adjusting every time I sit down. The sandalwood has a great scent on its own, and I&#x27;m guessing it will grow over time as it absorbs oils from use. It pulls through my beard easily, with less breakage and tangling. It&#x27;s a great alternative to a plastic comb. I have a relatively long beard and would like it if one side was more coarse than the other other side, maybe 1 or 2 less teeth, but overall i&#x27;m really pleased with the quality and performance of this comb.&lt;br /&gt;BIG thanks to &amp;#34;Rocky Mountain Barber Co.&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;I LOVE MY BEARD&amp;#34; for having a launch promo on these combs or I&#x27;d still be pack&#x27;n around a plain old plastic comb!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift to my Son and he loves it.  Very good craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> Great product great packaging best overall rated comb on the market.Will be buying more very soon doesn&#x27;t pull out hair or snag on. Hair when you comb your beard and great cedar wood smell . carry it every were i go just wish it came with a pocket carry bag or case overall great buy .</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as part of a father&#x27;s day gift. He&#x27;s incredibly meticulous about his beloved beard, and was so happy with this, he&#x27;s gone through a few other beard combs and they all seem to break after a while or wear out, but this doesn&#x27;t. This is a great solid quality product and he uses it daily. It smells great and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best comb I&#x27;ve ever owned in my 5070 years of life, I&#x27;m going back to get a second or third just so I have them, I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.  The beard comb comes in an elegantly packaged box.  The presentation definitely added to my initial experience with unveiling my new purchase.  Not being a beard aficionado, I can&#x27;t speak from experience about what a beard comb should be.  In my eyes, I can safely say that without a question the comb I found inside, was a premium beard comb.  The comb was sturdy and durable.  The subtle smell of sandlewood permeated the air and left a calming, relaxed feeling as I used the comb for the first time.  Even the craftsmanship of the product helps to nestle the comb close to the skin, while not being hindered by even the manliest jut of the chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you get this for yourself, or as a gift for your fellow bearded brethren, you are sure to make someone very happy.  I recommend this to anyone who wants a quality, well-made beard comb.  It has managed to help tame my savage beard and I hope it aids you in gaining control of yours.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he loves it. Uses it every day!</li>
            <li> A fantastically made product. A must have if you have a beard or a great gift for all the beards in your life!</li>
            <li> Wow! I got this beard comb for my husband on his birthday and he loves it! It&#x27;s absolutely beautiful and smells amazing. And he says it feels good when he combs his beard with it. I am very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> It took me a while to actually make the purchase because i thought  $20+ for a comb was excessive; but i&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comb works wonderfully with my beard and smells really nice (the smell will slowly fade in case you&#x27;re worried it&#x27;s very strong),  just as described will not snag or catch unless your beard is very coarse and tangled. The comb will actually works really well on hair as well (my wife really liked what id did for her&#x27;s) and is very pleasant to use: light but with some heft to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely purchase a present for Bearded friends/Family.</li>
            <li> I love this thing! Bought this about 4 months ago and use it regularly. Had a distinct smell out of the box, can&#x27;t say it smelled like sandal wood much. But after you let it air (like their customer service rep said) the chemical like smell does fade away. Very solid comb. Used to put it in my back pocket all the time and it went through it all like a champ. Use it on my beard and get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a pleasant surprise when you receive something that looks exactly like the picture. The comb smells woodsy and as described. I wish they made a hair comb for ladies like this. All comb teeth were uniform and nicely sized and cut. While holding it, I noticed it had a nice weight and smooth texture. The engraving is a nice touch. It made a wonderful gift for my fiance.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my boyfriend and it works fantastic. The packaging is amazing and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great comb, which arrived quickly in a wonderful gift box.</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers said, this comb is beautiful. The sandalwood has an earthy, smoky aroma that is eminently masculine and, while I am not sure the scent stays in my beard, makes me enjoy combing. Also, the comb is significantly more comfortable to use as opposed to other plastic or metal bristle combs, and I can use it with my beard either wet or dry. I haven&#x27;t tried any of the other sandalwood combs yet, but I absolutely recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This is a manly beast of a beard comb. The weight of it in your hands lets you know you are holding something special. It has the feel of a product made in a bygone time. A time of craftsmanship and quality.</li>
            <li> Great product wish I bought it earlier</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and I have yet to give it to him, but I DID send him a picture and he is sooo excited to get it. It smells great and is very durable. I read about how it&#x27;s great for combing your hair also, so I combed my hair with it this morning and I have to agree. And there&#x27;s just something about holding it... It feels so good!</li>
            <li> Heavy beard and this is a great comb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent comb but I&#x27;ve owned in 2 weeks and I&#x27;ve already had a tooth break on it. Other than that, it smells great and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Seems sturdy, smells good, keeps my hair looking nice.</li>
            <li> Misread the description and thought this was fine tooth on one side and coarse on the other.&lt;br /&gt;Still, its a nice comb, the sandalwood scent is not overwhelming (might be stronger once the comb gets damp/oiled a bit from use)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely not a wimpy comb like some other brands&#x27; reviews stated (i.e. cheap knock off competitors).</li>
            <li> One of the things I really enjoy about this comb is how solid it feels even though the teeth are fine.  Great sandal wood odor and nicely finished.  Would make an excellent gift!</li>
            <li> I love the beard comb. It doesnt get stuck on any hairs. It makes my beard nice and soft. Quality design as well. Thank you. I will be ordering another for my Dad very soon.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing brush! The fact it never snags on your beard when brushing is alone enough reason to buy! Than the natural smell of the comb not over baring just perfect. I would buy this again if I ever needed another but this is built to LAST!</li>
            <li> i love this comb. the smell is great and it runs through my hair very smoothly. i think i will get one for my dad for fathers day!</li>
            <li> its here. right on time. love it!</li>
            <li> Beautiful comb!  I got this as a gift for my husband.  He is currently working on growing a beard, and it&#x27;s finally long enough for a nice beard comb.  This one works perfectly and looks much more expensive than it actually is.  Despite the fact that my husband grumbled that he didn&#x27;t need &amp;#34;a special comb&amp;#34; for his beard, he uses it several times a day and actually told me that he really likes it.</li>
            <li> A beautiful edition to my beard grooming kit.&lt;br /&gt;The comb itself is exactly as described and is very resilient. It glides beautifully through both hair and beard and to this day the woodsy aroma has never faded.</li>
            <li> Beautifully crafted product.  I love the design and the sandalwood scent is a nice touch.  Would love to see other scents available.</li>
            <li> a great product , fits just right , outstanding quality&lt;br /&gt;well build wish i could find more products made by rocky mountain&lt;br /&gt;im very happy with the purchase , great gift fot the bearded man....</li>
            <li> WOW!!! I never typically leave Amazon reviews but just had to for this beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly what stood out was the packaging – it is top notch. The inside packaging has a “velvet” texture to it and the sandalwood comb has a “new shoe” type smell to it out of the box. I leave the box in my bathroom and put the comb back after each use cuz it&#x27;s so nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days you really start to notice the subtle smell of sandalwood resonating from the comb and can subtly smell it on your beard and hair. I use this comb every morning on my beard and  in my hair - it is sturdy and rigid and can easily get through my beard where others have struggled. Unlike plastic beard combs this fine tooth comb is great for grooming through my thick beard and doesn&#x27;t snag or bend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even my girlfriend uses this comb for her hair!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve already bought a second one for my dad for Father’s Day. Great gift for Birthday&#x27;s too! Packaging is so nice I don’t even need to wrap this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for any real “Beardthusiast” out there</li>
            <li> This beard comb is exactly what I was looking for. I have a professional job which makes me keep my beard neat and tidy at all times. This fits in my pocket perfectly and allows me to keep my beard groomed while at work. The wood feels of a high quality and there is just a slight woodsy scent that it gives off. 5 stars. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Good quality comb, nice packaging, but it smells synthetic and not like sandalwood at all.</li>
            <li> Great Comb. Fits in my shirt pocket easily enough. Much better than my crappy plastic comb. Really love that sandal wood smell. Overall I really suggest this comb even if you don&#x27;t have a beard.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and high quality.  Great scent too...buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> My husband says feels good smells great. He loves the product he got thank you!</li>
            <li> This comb is what any man needs when going on the beard journey, and did I mention it smells good! Great product !</li>
            <li> Really like this beard comb. The only real drawback is that the teeth of the comb are the same size on each side. I would have liked one side to have teeth that were wider apart and the other side closer together, like they are on the comb, but overall a very nice comb.</li>
            <li> Husband seems happy with this very fancy beautiful beard comb. Rustic wood smell, very manly.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day, and he really liked it. It smells nice!</li>
            <li> Just got my beard comb today and love it. High quality product will recommend to all my bearded buddies</li>
            <li> This comb is awesome. It looks cool. It arrives in nice packaging, fits in my pocket nicely, and smells fantastic in my beard! I will say that the teeth being the same on both sides is redundant. Sure i can pull it out and start going at my beard without a glance, but I would rather have to look down at my comb before use so that i could choose the side i want to use. You know?&lt;br /&gt;  That said, i still give this comb five stars because i read multiple reviews and knew exactly what to expect. Its a great comb for a classy beard. Hope this helps.&lt;br /&gt;  enjoy</li>
            <li> Solid product with beautiful craftsmanship.  I keep it in my shirt pocket every day.</li>
            <li> Great comb for my newly grown full beard. I only have 1 &#x27;complaint&#x27; and that&#x27;s that it&#x27;s a little too big to carry in my pocket in my work chinos. After saying that, it&#x27;s still a 5/5 star product. They gave me a 10% discount on my next purchase just for ordering the comb, and I&#x27;ll definitely be buying from them again. Thanks for the sweet comb, bros!</li>
            <li> The quality of the comb I received far exceeded what I thought I had paid for! This is the only beard comb I carry with me. Works really well with oils and balms, and hasn&#x27;t lost its great smell. This is a hand me down quality comb. Well done!</li>
            <li> Great comb and has a great scent</li>
            <li> My husband loves this comb. Smooth on his beard and smells great, too. Very well made, aesthetically pleasing product.</li>
            <li> This comb works very well on my shorter-length beard. Can&#x27;t speak for longer beards. Solid wood, great sandalwood scent. Love how its sturdiness allows it to get all the way to the skin, making it an excellent stimulator for the face under the beard. Small enough to carry in your pocket if you want to. Agree with other posters that being double-edged, would make sense to have two different densities for the teeth, but that doesn&#x27;t take away from either quality or value for my needs. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like it. It is substantial in the hand and does not feel cheap.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, I just stared at it. Very well made. Sandlewood is a dense wood, and makes great combs. Heirloom quality. Plain fact. Smells great to boot!</li>
            <li> Bad ass solid wood. fine toothed but not too fine, and smells great. just the best comb you can get.</li>
            <li> Should you really spend 20 dollars on a comb? Yes.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the box I could smell the sandalwood and immediately started grooming my beard, I find it relaxing to comb my beard and smelling the sandal wood made it even better!!</li>
            <li> Looks good and smells great.</li>
            <li> What a great beard comb. I like everything about it. It leaves my beard a lot neater than a regular comb.</li>
            <li> The advertising copy might be a bit excessive, but this is a good, sturdy product. Combs smoothly and looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing beard comb!</li>
            <li> What a great comb!! No snags and no static! Smells great and has a great feel in your hand!!</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with my beard comb, it&#x27;s got just enough weight to it that I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m going to break it, and the smell is fantastic!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re getting a fantastic product. The comb smells phresh , keeps your beard smelling like a gotdang forest . The teeth are , as you can see, all grouped up tightly, making it incredibly easy to tame your mane. It looks very classy, the wood comb is just a fantastic piece of art . Honestly I have no negative comments. This is the king of combs. The comb king. The poobah of combage. The sultan of stylin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> The product made a great gift, my brother in law couldn&#x27;t stop using it, but only a week later, it got wet and turned green. I&#x27;m pretty sure he disposed of it :/</li>
            <li> This comb was everything I thought it would be. The packaging is beautiful, the comb itself is of great quality and I loved the scent of the wood. I purchased this as a birthday gift and he loved it as well. Great gift!</li>
            <li> Great sturdy comb. I use it for my beard and hair fresh out of the shower. My wife loves the sandalwood smell.</li>
            <li> This comb is by far the best investment I have ever made in a grooming supply!!! Must have&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this beard comb, but I don&#x27;t. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Teeth on both sides are the same size...For almost $20 bucks, I would&#x27;ve liked a bit more grooming diversity. One fine tooth side, one wide tooth. To me, to have both sides the exact same was redundant and ultimately made the comb not a good investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Difficult for mustache grooming...if you comb straight down, then no biggie. However, if you&#x27;re trying to train your mustache, or just want to part in the middle and comb to either side, the style of this comb does not make it very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT...on the flip side, I definitely don&#x27;t hate this comb. Far from it actually...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The comb looks darn good. Aside from the teeth issues I had, this comb is constructed super well. It&#x27;s durable. Fits in a pocket easy. And just looks classy...probably more so than any beard comb out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It smells good...at first the &amp;#34;wood&amp;#34; smell was a bit overwhelming. But then I found myself totally drawn to it. Smells very manly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So there&#x27;s my good and bad. For me, the cost wasn&#x27;t worth the benefit, as I&#x27;m on a budget and for this price I need a beard comb that has both fine and wide teeth. If Rocky Mountain can pull that off, I&#x27;d definitely consider a re-purchase.</li>
            <li> Very Fast Shipping. As soon as I got it I fell in love. It rides nice and smells good. Great product that I would recommend to anyone. I got some nice volume out of mine with it.</li>
            <li> This comb is top notch!  I have used many different ones and this takes the cake!!!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Best comb I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to purchase this comb. My beard had finally grown to a length to need a good beard comb, and I could not have picked a better one. The design and construction is excellent, and it is just the right size to carry in my pocket. At first I did not know how I was going to like the sandlewood smell, but now I love it. I highly recommend this comb.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected. Guess, I was expecting the comb to work better than a brush. I guess I&#x27;m just a brush guy. The comb does smell wonderful and is carefully constructed. Just not for me. If you&#x27;re a comb guy, this would be the comb to purchase.</li>
            <li> Product  description  says it all.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I love my new comb the smell of the comb is awesome and it&#x27;s smooth and we&#x27;ll made.</li>
            <li> Really nice quality, nice grip on it... just the right size.</li>
