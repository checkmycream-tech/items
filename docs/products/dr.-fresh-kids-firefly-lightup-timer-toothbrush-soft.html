    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great, kids like them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>I know it will go great!</li>
            <li>Great idea reply helps encourage tooth care</li>
            <li>One didn&#x27;t work but still a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li>Grandchildren loved them.</li>
            <li>I loved the idea of these toothbrushes</li>
            <li>The light in the toothbrush is bright and the kids really enjoyed using them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d be ok for perhaps cleaning things, but I didn&#x27;t find that they were suitable for brushing my kids teeth.</li>
            <li>and they love lighting them up.</li>
            <li>My Kids love these and ask to use them.  </li>
            <li>They function ok as a toothbrush though.</li>
            <li>Great my son loves these, he even wants to share</li>
            <li>so my kids would brush the appropriate amount of time.</li>
            <li>The other is great- nice and bright.  </li>
            <li>I think the concept is very cool.</li>
            <li>I love the “stop light” feature on this brush.</li>
            <li>My 2 and 3 yr olds really love brushing their teeth with these light up toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>My 3 yo was loved the other working toothbrush and just loved the flashing light.</li>
            <li>About a month in, lights still work on both just fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy for a toddler to figure out how to turn on the light (just tap the bottom of the brush on the counter), but be aware there is no way to turn off the light once it starts flashing.</li>
            <li>Light flashes</li>
            <li>Got two, one light did not work</li>
            <li>my toddler enjoys this toothbrush for 2 reasons; 1st the light but also</li>
            <li>they light up and  flash  </li>
            <li>now adults get to have as much fun brushing as children do!</li>
            <li>I know the timer is supposed to be a \\&quot;minimum\\&quot; time for brushing teeth, but for my twin 3-year-olds (who would drag toothbrushing out forever if they could), it is a great product to get them to STOP brushing their teeth.</li>
            <li>I was excited with how fun</li>
            <li>makes it easier for us adults (ok, my husband) to make sure we are brushing the kids teeth enough!</li>
            <li>Adequate toothbrush, neither brush every lit up...</li>
            <li>And the blinking light it keeps them brushing the whole time!</li>
            <li>and I like that the flashing gives you a good sense of how long he should brush.</li>
            <li>The only bright side was that I didn&#x27;t spend much money on them.</li>
            <li>It sounds like a fun thing.</li>
            <li>But actually, I&#x27;ve bought this twice and each time one of the 2 toothbrushes didn&#x27;t work and tonight one more stopped working, sending my son into a screaming fit and ruining the night.</li>
            <li>One of the brushes didn&#x27;t work right out of the package.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel right to have my kid use them after the bristles started to come off, thinking that he&#x27;ll also be eating the glue that&#x27;s suppose to hold the bristles in place.  </li>
            <li>Since he&#x27;s is only 2.5 years old and still requires mommy&#x27;s help in brushing, I can appreciate the softer bristles because then he is more willing to let me brush!!!</li>
            <li>The light up portion works but the light was dim and the product didn&#x27;t live up to expectations.</li>
            <li>My daughter has been brushing her teeth since she got her first tooth at 6 months.</li>
            <li>We got her these around her first birthday</li>
            <li>and she FINALLY tries to brush her own teeth now.</li>
            <li>Now, to make sure the job actually gets done, I get \\&quot;Mommy&#x27;s turn\\&quot; to brush their teeth first (for one cycle of flashing), and then they get to do it themselves (for another cycle).</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t want to get too emotional about a toothbrush, but I love these.</li>
            <li>He no longer argues and actually just checks the color and keeps on brushing until the light turns off!</li>
            <li>One of the 2 tooth brushes stopped working after the first day.</li>
            <li>I sent them back for a refund, would be hesitant to buy anything that I couldn&#x27;t make sure was in working order first.  </li>
            <li>The first time we used it, my son was scared, but now he likes it.  </li>
            <li>I would love to write an exceptional review, but unfortunately I was sent a 2 pack with both toothbrushes having defective lights.</li>
            <li>I never had an issue with having her brush for long enough right now, but I imagine that as she gets older she won&#x27;t like brushing her teeth as much, so I am sure the light will help then.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s dim and shuts off quickly.  </li>
            <li>I only wish the light went on for longer.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush for little ones who don&#x27;t like to brush for very long.</li>
            <li>The light is helpful for me to know how long to brush for.</li>
            <li>Sometimes he get&#x27;s too focused on turning it on, but in general these are really fun toothbrushes and seem to work well.</li>
            <li>we first learned about  these when given one by a 3-year old.  </li>
            <li>Its a fun time with a little light show</li>
            <li>We dipped the toothbrushes in hot water briefly to sterilize when they first arrived, and maybe they aren&#x27;t meant to be sterilized, the bristles came out easily after that within just a few uses (probably the hot water melted the glue).  </li>
            <li>If you are on the fence about purchasing these brushes, then I highly recommend that you just save your money.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product for making bedtime routine go a little smoother than it would otherwise.</li>
            <li>My kids were real excited to try these out however when we went to use them both of these toothbrushes did not light up!</li>
            <li>The other toothbrush was fine.</li>
            <li>It helps with toddlers since we know to brush to brush until the light runs off and then the suction cup means I keep it held separately from the other toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 2 year old daughter who already loves to brush her teeth, and she loves them!</li>
            <li>our dentist says there&#x27;s nothing harmful about an adult&#x27;s using a child-size toothbrush, so we give them to everyone!  </li>
            <li>I bought it because we have a different firefly toothbrush that my son uses (the one with green, yellow, &amp; red lights) that works great.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap toothbrush that won&#x27;t last long, you&#x27;ve found them.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes came quickly enough, but as many other people posted:  one didn&#x27;t work!  </li>
            <li>And it cost too much to send back</li>
            <li>They are also just very cheaply made (not surprising given the cost).  </li>
            <li>However, this in turn resulted in major meltdown when it stopped working after about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>We actually have a pretty hard time getting him to brush his teeth for the right amount of time.</li>
            <li>We did keep one as a regular tooth brush for our toddler as the sizing is right for that after we cleaned it with peroxide, but it did not last long at all.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product for my 4 year old nephew to give him on his upcoming visit next month.  </li>
            <li>So, for now I am not sure how will it work or how long will continue working or whether it is worth that much money.</li>
            <li>I can barely get it going.</li>
            <li>either  the glue or tape was so old or had gotten so heated it just simply didnt hold anymore.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle to return the dead one</li>
            <li>The big drawback for me was that the part of the toothbrush you are supposed to push to activate the light was way too hard to push for my kids by themselves</li>
            <li>$4/brush is a bit much to pay when the gimmick is only half the package.  </li>
            <li>long enough for my son to fall in love with it only to find that it was broken by day 2.</li>

            <li> long enough for my son to fall in love with it only to find that it was broken by day 2.</li>
            <li> The other is hard to trigger the light.</li>
            <li> Only one of our two toothbrushes lit up and that&#x27;s not a good ratio when you have two kids that always want the same thing...poor quality control from Dr. Fresh.</li>
            <li> The light was almost impossible to get to turn on, and once it did, it would stay on for a few seconds sometimes, but never the full minute it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> The lightup factor didn&#x27;t last long at all!</li>
            <li> The light doesn&#x27;t blink long enough in my opinion, and my son was not impressed as I thought he would be.</li>
            <li> They let them know just how long to brush.</li>
            <li> The switch is difficult to use and stopped working inside a month for both brushes which kind of makes this product a failure in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It came on the fourth day but only green would lite up for 30 sec</li>
            <li> Total rip off too go down to target</li>
            <li> No thanks, not recommended.</li>
            <li> So, my daughter&#x27;s 4 and not really the biggest fan of brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> one arrived with very little battery life left-</li>
            <li> the bristles are softer than some of the other toothbrushes we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Usually he puts the brush in his mouth and about 20 seconds later he says he is done.</li>
            <li> However , it is very difficult to press the bottom for it to light up.</li>
            <li> Also, so affordable, I throw them out every 3 months when they get a little worn out.</li>
            <li> One of  the two toothbrushes did not light up.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if it makes tooth brushing time go more smoothly, unfortunately :(</li>
            <li> What a disappointment to me and my five year old daughter.</li>
            <li> Slow and costly shipping.  </li>
            <li> The broken one worked 1 time...</li>
            <li> so I had to keep the broken one.</li>
            <li> I found the Firefly toothbrushes at my local grocery store, but sadly, they stopped carrying it, so now I have to buy it on-line (and pay shipping). :-(</li>
            <li> Not impressed with these.</li>
            <li> it was going to be for my kid but turns out disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing purchase.</li>
            <li> This one was worthless.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> These have helped my kids to brush longer and they love lighting them up.</li>
            <li> One didn&#x27;t work but still a good deal for the price.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been brushing her teeth since she got her first tooth at 6 months. We got her these around her first birthday and she FINALLY tries to brush her own teeth now. Its a fun time with a little light show and she&#x27;s smiling and giggling and doesn&#x27;t bite and fight anymore.</li>
            <li> this works as advertised. makes it easier for us adults (ok, my husband) to make sure we are brushing the kids teeth enough! don&#x27;t know if it makes tooth brushing time go more smoothly, unfortunately :(</li>
            <li> one arrived with very little battery life left- it&#x27;s dim and shuts off quickly.  The other is great- nice and bright.  Wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle to return the dead one so we&#x27;re using it as is.</li>
            <li> I know the timer is supposed to be a \\&quot;minimum\\&quot; time for brushing teeth, but for my twin 3-year-olds (who would drag toothbrushing out forever if they could), it is a great product to get them to STOP brushing their teeth.

            <li> Great, kids like them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Light flashes so they know when to quit brushing.  We&#x27;ve used them for years now and it works well</li>
            <li> Great idea reply helps encourage tooth care</li>
            <li> Slow and costly shipping.  Manual toothbrushes.  Timer only 1 minute.  Suggested brushing time is 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> My son enjoys brushing with these and I like that the flashing gives you a good sense of how long he should brush. I&#x27;d like it to sing as well, but I guess you can&#x27;t have everything. It&#x27;s very easy for a toddler to figure out how to turn on the light (just tap the bottom of the brush on the counter), but be aware there is no way to turn off the light once it starts flashing.</li>
            <li> Both toothbrushes sent were defective. Won&#x27;t but these again.</li>
            <li> Meh. Not impressed with these. They are tiny, the bristles were falling out upon receiving the package. The lightup factor didn&#x27;t last long at all! The only reason they get 3 stars is for the price. If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap toothbrush that won&#x27;t last long, you&#x27;ve found them. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d be ok for perhaps cleaning things, but I didn&#x27;t find that they were suitable for brushing my kids teeth. No thanks, not recommended.</li>
            <li> Got two, one light did not work</li>
            <li> Sometimes he get&#x27;s too focused on turning it on, but in general these are really fun toothbrushes and seem to work well.</li>
            <li> My nephew ,who is two loves this!</li>
            <li> This was garbage.  I bought it because we have a different firefly toothbrush that my son uses (the one with green, yellow, &amp; red lights) that works great.  This one was worthless.  The light was almost impossible to get to turn on, and once it did, it would stay on for a few seconds sometimes, but never the full minute it was supposed to.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for little ones who don&#x27;t like to brush for very long.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t want to get too emotional about a toothbrush, but I love these. It helps with toddlers since we know to brush to brush until the light runs off and then the suction cup means I keep it held separately from the other toothbrushes. Also, so affordable, I throw them out every 3 months when they get a little worn out.</li>
            <li> One didn&#x27;t work. And we didn&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> I would love to write an exceptional review, but unfortunately I was sent a 2 pack with both toothbrushes having defective lights. Perhaps they should be tested before shipping?</li>
            <li> my toddler enjoys this toothbrush for 2 reasons; 1st the light but also the bristles are softer than some of the other toothbrushes we&#x27;ve tried. Since he&#x27;s is only 2.5 years old and still requires mommy&#x27;s help in brushing, I can appreciate the softer bristles because then he is more willing to let me brush!!! The light is helpful for me to know how long to brush for.</li>
            <li> I bought my daughter a Hello Kitty Firefly toothbrush and it worked for 4 days.  It came on the fourth day but only green would lite up for 30 sec then it would go off.  Day five it wont even turn on.  What a disappointment to me and my five year old daughter.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes did come on time(2 days after ordered).I thought that they would work but only one worked like everybody else had said.Total rip off too go down to target you get them for 1:89 and you can test them out to see if they work and they do.</li>
            <li> My Kids love these and ask to use them.  And the blinking light it keeps them brushing the whole time!</li>
            <li> We got these in October but used them as stocking stuffers.  Now that we&#x27;ve finally opened them up it turns out only one turns on.  The broken one worked 1 time...long enough for my son to fall in love with it only to find that it was broken by day 2.</li>
            <li> Only one of our two toothbrushes lit up and that&#x27;s not a good ratio when you have two kids that always want the same thing...poor quality control from Dr. Fresh.</li>
            <li> One of the brushes didn&#x27;t work right out of the package. My 3 yo was loved the other working toothbrush and just loved the flashing light. However, this in turn resulted in major meltdown when it stopped working after about 2 weeks. Very disappointing purchase. The only bright side was that I didn&#x27;t spend much money on them. If you are on the fence about purchasing these brushes, then I highly recommend that you just save your money.</li>
            <li> One of the two brushes did not blink. And it cost too much to send back so I had to keep the broken one. Booooo.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 2 year old daughter who already loves to brush her teeth, and she loves them! I never had an issue with having her brush for long enough right now, but I imagine that as she gets older she won&#x27;t like brushing her teeth as much, so I am sure the light will help then.</li>
            <li> My son loves this toothbrush. We actually have a pretty hard time getting him to brush his teeth for the right amount of time. Usually he puts the brush in his mouth and about 20 seconds later he says he is done. I love the “stop light” feature on this brush. He no longer argues and actually just checks the color and keeps on brushing until the light turns off! I can’t wait until his next dentist appointment I know it will go great!</li>
            <li> One of the 2 tooth brushes stopped working after the first day. The other is hard to trigger the light. Won&#x27;t be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to all the reviews.  These toothbrushes came quickly enough, but as many other people posted:  one didn&#x27;t work!  $4/brush is a bit much to pay when the gimmick is only half the package.  I sent them back for a refund, would be hesitant to buy anything that I couldn&#x27;t make sure was in working order first.  This company needs to up their quality control.</li>
            <li> The light doesn&#x27;t blink long enough in my opinion, and my son was not impressed as I thought he would be.</li>
            <li> We dipped the toothbrushes in hot water briefly to sterilize when they first arrived, and maybe they aren&#x27;t meant to be sterilized, the bristles came out easily after that within just a few uses (probably the hot water melted the glue).  I didn&#x27;t feel right to have my kid use them after the bristles started to come off, thinking that he&#x27;ll also be eating the glue that&#x27;s suppose to hold the bristles in place.  They are also just very cheaply made (not surprising given the cost).  I definitely wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> It sounds like a fun thing. I have purchased this product for my 4 year old nephew to give him on his upcoming visit next month.  So, for now I am not sure how will it work or how long will continue working or whether it is worth that much money.</li>
            <li> My 2 and 3 yr olds really love brushing their teeth with these light up toothbrushes. They let them know just how long to brush.</li>
            <li> Adequate toothbrush, neither brush every lit up... Sort of the point, but do function as basic brush.</li>
            <li> I think the concept is very cool. However , it is very difficult to press the bottom for it to light up. I can barely get it going. My daughter cannot do it independently. She is three.</li>
            <li> One of  the two toothbrushes did not light up. The other toothbrush was fine. I don&#x27;t know if I would order them again.</li>
            <li> The switch is difficult to use and stopped working inside a month for both brushes which kind of makes this product a failure in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My kids were real excited to try these out however when we went to use them both of these toothbrushes did not light up! We got duds! Totally bummed!</li>
            <li> So, my daughter&#x27;s 4 and not really the biggest fan of brushing teeth. These helped. I only wish the light went on for longer. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> My kid used one of them and it only lighted up once. I was excited with how fun it was going to be for my kid but turns out disappointed. They function ok as a toothbrush though. That&#x27;s why I gave them 2 stars.</li>
            <li> This item came with the packaging open as it looked like either  the glue or tape was so old or had gotten so heated it just simply didnt hold anymore. I opened the package and both toothbrushes immediately fell to the floor. The light up portion works but the light was dim and the product didn&#x27;t live up to expectations. We did keep one as a regular tooth brush for our toddler as the sizing is right for that after we cleaned it with peroxide, but it did not last long at all.</li>
            <li> Grandchildren loved them.</li>
            <li> Great my son loves these, he even wants to share</li>
            <li> The first time we used it, my son was scared, but now he likes it.  But actually, I&#x27;ve bought this twice and each time one of the 2 toothbrushes didn&#x27;t work and tonight one more stopped working, sending my son into a screaming fit and ruining the night. I&#x27;m done with these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> About a month in, lights still work on both just fine.</li>
            <li> we first learned about  these when given one by a 3-year old.  our dentist says there&#x27;s nothing harmful about an adult&#x27;s using a child-size toothbrush, so we give them to everyone!  they light up and  flash  for  a minute.  now adults get to have as much fun brushing as children do!</li>
            <li> I loved the idea of these toothbrushes so my kids would brush the appropriate amount of time. The light in the toothbrush is bright and the kids really enjoyed using them. The big drawback for me was that the part of the toothbrush you are supposed to push to activate the light was way too hard to push for my kids by themselves (my kids are 3 &amp; 5). We accidentally left these at a hotel when we went on vacation and I replaced their toothbrushes with something different.</li>
