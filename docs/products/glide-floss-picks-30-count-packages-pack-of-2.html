            <li>Better then the other kind of floss sticks that make you feel like your sawing your teeth.</li>
            <li>These are great for those of us who are slightly challenged in the finger dexterity department.</li>

            <li>Timely and exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>It seems silly to be buying floss over the Internet, but if you have teeth that are close together, these are the best floss picks out there.</li>
            <li>I have used thes pics for years and they are no longer available in stores near me.</li>
            <li>I rinse with hydrogen peroxide first, floss then brush with Oral-B toothbrush.</li>

            <li>Especially the cheap ones at drug stores that imitate it.</li>
            <li>too much trash.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>These particular floss are the only one I found that are not flat - the handle had a nice grip and it allows you to squeeze it to increase the tension of the floss thread.</li>
            <li>There are many other floss picks to choose from, but none perform as well as these.</li>
            <li>The floss is stronger than many of the other flossers.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend these flossers.</li>
            <li>Glide floss, just by itself, trumps all other flosses in terms of easily sliding in between teeth.</li>
            <li>I keep one of these in my purse, another around on my desk and another on my side table, and many occasions will happen to use them even when if you are lazy.</li>
            <li>This little change makes flossing so easy when pulling the floss up and out from between the teeth.</li>
            <li>Most of all, they are HARD TO FIND in stores, so BUY HERE and save yourself gas money.</li>
            <li>Other types, even glide 3D white, are flimsy and floss breaks easily.</li>
            <li>I can use them multiple times before tossing them, the thread is very durable.</li>
            <li>Very durable; last through multi uses, and like the squeeze handle which lets you adjust the tightness of the floss thread.  </li>
            <li>These picks&#x27;s horizontal glides work far better than the usual picks&#x27; vertical glides!</li>
            <li>Tried 10 other kinds, this one has a flat yet broad thread that slips easily between my closely packed teeth and gets under the gum line (carefully) to clear food and plaque.  </li>
            <li>The straight across style floss picks don&#x27;t make it any easier to get to your back teeth, which are really the most difficult to deal with, because your cheeks are still in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though these are they are a bit more expensive, I still exclusively use these because they are so much easier.</li>
            <li>It makes flossing so much easier that you can do it while doing other hings.</li>
            <li>Not too sharp and since I have been using, much improved gum health.</li>
            <li>Sting is firmly attached to the handle, and does not tear off easily like in some other brands</li>

            <li> I tried other floss and floss picks.</li>
            <li> Instead of usual flat non-cured head, the Glide pick allows flossing without having to contort the jaw or pull at the cheek.</li>
            <li> Glide string - easy to get between teeth, and does not split into annoying fibers like some others</li>
            <li> The three missing teeth are \wisdom teeth that came in imp;acted, and I had them extracted.</li>
            <li> I have a bag in each end of the house and carry a few in&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use them everyday.</li>

            <li> They are a bit pricey, but you can reuse one a few times.</li>
            <li> Picture is not really accurate.</li>
            <li> hard to find in our stores</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that they&#x27;re so hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they are very hard to find at a local store.</li>
            <li> These picks aren&#x27;t too thin and hard</li>
            <li> I was never great at keeping up with it until I found this style Glide Floss Picks.  </li>
            <li> These picks are the only ones my dentist considers acceptable for &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; (which I hate doing with regular floss, just a sensory thing, really hate it).</li>

            <li> Flossing can be a real pain.  I was never great at keeping up with it until I found this style Glide Floss Picks.  Now I floss just about every day and it isn&#x27;t a chore at all.  I can&#x27;t use regular floss string because trying to get two hands in my mouth to reach my back teeth is just ridiculous.  The straight across style floss picks don&#x27;t make it any easier to get to your back teeth, which are really the most difficult to deal with, because your cheeks are still in the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is why these floss picks are great.

            <li> Love them! As a non floss user, these make me floss more because their more user friendly.  Better then the other kind of floss sticks that make you feel like your sawing your teeth. Hard to find in the stores. Great price on Amazon.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Dentist recommended and the best you can buy. Why do I need to say more and why does Amazon require it? Seems kind of stupid to me. The product is great and Amazons requirements are stupid. That&#x27;s all I have to say.</li>
            <li> Tried 10 other kinds, this one has a flat yet broad thread that slips easily between my closely packed teeth and gets under the gum line (carefully) to clear food and plaque.  Its also strong and will not shred or break easily.  Always carry a few around with me in case i have something stuck between my teeth in addition to regular flossing duties.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this product in the store, but no one carries them anymore. It seems silly to be buying floss over the Internet, but if you have teeth that are close together, these are the best floss picks out there. I&#x27;ve tried every brand. These do not break, leaving bits of floss between your teeth.</li>
            <li> Service was great, received earlier than expected.  I love these picks.  They slide between your teeth very easily without getting stuck.</li>
            <li> These flossers are the ONLY ones that I can use without having to use 5 or 6 at time. All other brands break, even other Glide products, but these white ones do not break while flossing. Unfortunately, they are very hard to find at a local store. So I found them on Amazon and bought several bags. Highly recommend these flossers. My dentist says my gum disease has improved since using these regularly.</li>
            <li> There are many other floss picks to choose from, but none perform as well as these. This is the best (maybe the only?) Teflon floss out there, and the shape of the pick allows you to place tension on the floss so that it can more easily be inserted between teeth. Glide floss, just by itself, trumps all other flosses in terms of easily sliding in between teeth.</li>
            <li> Picture is not really accurate. Have a toothpick on the one end. Doesn&#x27;t show in these pictures. Love these.</li>
            <li> I use these floss picks all the time.&lt;br /&gt;They are the easiest thing to use  for flossing.</li>
            <li> The handle makes it easy to maneuver and the ribbon-style floss means it won&#x27;t shred or slice your gums. Try them and you&#x27;ll be hooked too!</li>
            <li> These picks are really great. I have a bag in each end of the house and carry a few in&lt;br /&gt;my pocketbook. You get to use a clean and fresh pick after every eating moment.</li>
            <li> My local store stopped carrying these Glide floss picks, Amazon to the rescue.  I&#x27;ve tried a few other brands and they all shred too easily or have awkward cheap little holders.  These are definitely the best of the lot.</li>
            <li> The best quality and great size for big teeth.;)</li>
            <li> Mush easier to use than regular floss and easier on your fingers</li>
            <li> Excellent flossers! It&#x27;s a shame that they&#x27;re so hard to find in stores. I use them everyday.</li>
            <li> I tried several different brands and these are the best, because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Flat &amp;#34;signature&amp;#34; Glide string - easy to get between teeth, and does not split into annoying fibers like some others&lt;br /&gt;- Very easy to hold , ergonomically designed handle; has a pick on the end too&lt;br /&gt;- Sting is firmly attached to the handle, and does not tear off easily like in some other brands&lt;br /&gt;- Sting has some give, so it does not hurt by jamming into gyms&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best floss out there!</li>
            <li> I use my Glide floss picks on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> These particular floss are the only one I found that are not flat - the handle had a nice grip and it allows you to squeeze it to increase the tension of the floss thread. I find this little difference to make a big difference over other floss picks that do not allow you to act of the tension of the thread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have never used floss picks, then you should try! It makes flossing so much easier that you can do it while doing other hings. I flossing much more often now that I have them. I keep one of these in my purse, another around on my desk and another on my side table, and many occasions will happen to use them even when if you are lazy. I can use them multiple times before tossing them, the thread is very durable. My dentist totally noticed that something had changed after I started using these, she said my gums used to bleed so easily when touched, but not anymore.</li>
            <li> I have used thes pics for years and they are no longer available in stores near me. Amazon to the rescue again! These are perfect for reaching back molars and flossing between tight teeth where tradional floss shreds or breaks.</li>
            <li> use these every day- can&#x27;t find them in stores. love these and so does my dentist.</li>
            <li> These are great for those of us who are slightly challenged in the finger dexterity department. The floss is stronger than many of the other flossers.</li>
            <li> every thing worked out nicely</li>
            <li> I always had trouble cleaning the spaces between my back molars.  The way this floss pick is designed makes it way easier to remove any food stuck between all my teeth including the rear molars.</li>
            <li> great product, wish there was a compo-stable or recyclable version. too much trash.</li>
            <li> Best floss picks. Other types, even glide 3D white, are flimsy and floss breaks easily. Will not go back</li>
            <li> Amazon is one of the few places I can find these. I floss EVERY day with these and without them, I dislike flossing.</li>
            <li> I love these dental picks. I have really tight teeth and these work without tearing and stringing.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived on time and in great condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years and tried other styles. Even though these are they are a bit more expensive, I still exclusively use these because they are so much easier. My dentist tells me every year, &amp;#34;keep doing what you&#x27;re doing.&amp;#34; The wide tape is more comfortable and the ability to expand he wishbone to tighten the tape makes it easier to get between your teeth.</li>
            <li> The only floss picks I will buy. Hard to find this exact one at stores.</li>
            <li> I used these after the dentist identified onset of gum disease. I rinse with hydrogen peroxide first, floss then brush with Oral-B toothbrush. Problem gone. I tried other floss and floss picks. I threw those away and went back to these. I bought 6 bags. Keeps me flossing more often.</li>
            <li> These have the best angle for flossing back teeth</li>
            <li> The only picks I use...forget the blue ones....these are the BEST.  Very durable; last through multi uses, and like the squeeze handle which lets you adjust the tightness of the floss thread.  And so handy to be able to buy from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good product, but they just don&#x27;t do it for me.  Plus, they end up being a lot more expensive than the traditional package where you reel off ~1 ft. at a time.</li>
            <li> These picks&#x27;s horizontal glides work far better than the usual picks&#x27; vertical glides!</li>
            <li> These picks are the only ones my dentist considers acceptable for &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; (which I hate doing with regular floss, just a sensory thing, really hate it). They are easy to hold onto and won&#x27;t shred. You can get under the gumline for cleaning, which is what my dentist wanted. Most of all, they are HARD TO FIND in stores, so BUY HERE and save yourself gas money.</li>
            <li> Design made it easier to floss back teeth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I could love a floss pick but I do love this one. The major difference is the pick has a flexible center when pushed in makes the floss taught and when released provides ease. This little change makes flossing so easy when pulling the floss up and out from between the teeth. Another change is the tilt of the head of the flosser. Instead of usual flat non-cured head, the Glide pick allows flossing without having to contort the jaw or pull at the cheek. I use these guys daily.</li>
            <li> These floss picks are my favorite and I can never find them in the store. They are a bit pricey, but you can reuse one a few times. These actually make it easy to floss so I do it way more often. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Most easy for me to use of all the floss.  Does very good job and makes it easier than string.  Not too sharp and since I have been using, much improved gum health.</li>
            <li> The only floss picks I can use and they are hard to find as CVS stopped carrying them a long time ago for some reason.  These picks aren&#x27;t too thin and hard so they don&#x27;t cut into the gum like some do and the fact that you can pinch them and tighten the string helps get it between teeth and the end pick for going between teeth also works the best out of any tried.  This is the best tooth floss pick that is made for all areas of flossing.</li>
