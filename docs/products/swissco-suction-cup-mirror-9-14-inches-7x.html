    <ol>
            <li>Suction cups are awesome - you can move location and height as needed.</li>

            <li>It adheres great to the mirror on my medicine cabinet.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a good quality.  </li>
            <li>It arrived in  good condition and on time.  </li>

            <li>When the eye sight goes can&#x27;t live without this mirror and the price is great!!!</li>
            <li>Great quality, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li>I liked the 7-times magnifier better than the 5.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the \\&quot;strong stick\\&quot; to my bathroom mirror and 7X strength.</li>
            <li>The 3 suction cups appear to be strongly attached and it took a bit of fingernail finagling under each to re-position it, so I&#x27;m thinking, It&#x27;s gonna stay!</li>
            <li>but something must have changed as the magnification was not as good as the original one I had which was a 7x.</li>
            <li>This is really a great mirror for ~$10, but it is too large.  </li>

            <li>This mirror is extremely good for travel (putting on make-up), for someone at the very \\&quot;near-sighted\\&quot; stage of life.</li>
            <li>The suction cups work very well and the mirror is a good quality.</li>
            <li>Hangs on our vanity mirror easily with the 3 suction cups.  </li>
            <li>Liked it so much we purchased 3 more to give as gifts and 1 for traveling.</li>
            <li>also travel with it because its easy to pack.</li>
            <li>Great mirror for those over the age of mid 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I just put it up and the size is perfect and the magnification is as I would have hoped, if not downright scary seeing myself with THIS kind of clarity.</li>
            <li>I can remember when a 5 magnification was good enough.  </li>
            <li>Not such a good idea.  </li>
            <li>Not such a good idea.</li>

            <li>The best viewing area is only in the middle.  </li>
            <li>If you wear around a 3.00 magnification or higher for close up work, this is the mirror for you!  </li>
            <li>It was worth writing about to you.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and big, plus the suctions on the back hold the mirror in place nice and snug.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the larger size and am extremely satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not liking this mirror much but kept it!</li>
            <li>so I could&#x27;ve looked at it and known exactly what I was getting.  </li>
            <li>I ordered a replacement, and it arrived and it was not at all the 7x magnification as my other 3 I own.</li>
            <li>Myself being older with declining eyesight, I enjoy a renewed ability to more clearly see my face for various tasks.</li>
            <li>The company shipped it pretty fast too.</li>
            <li>The mirror works very well.</li>
            <li>Makes shaving a face with detail for men and tweezing for females much easier.</li>
            <li>I also may not need that much magnification.</li>
            <li>This mirror has too much magnification for me to apply make-up.  </li>
            <li>I though this would work for whole face makeup application, but I can&#x27;t look at my whole face because of the distortion.</li>
            <li>I was not able to find it locally and was glad they are still available.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to move around and place it other positions.  </li>
            <li>Had it delivered to my son&#x27;s house and right now I can&#x27;t retrieve it to send back.</li>
            <li>So when I dropped mine, I ordered a new one immediately.</li>
            <li>However, as a matter of personal preference, I think I will order a swing arm type that attaches to the wall with a back light.  </li>
            <li>I had looked all over for a magnifying mirror like an old one I had with the suction cups.  </li>
            <li>I already own three of these mirrors for each of our bathrooms, but one unfortunately broke and I wanted to replace</li>
            <li>High magnification, good solid construction of the base and mounting cups.</li>

            <li> A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I keep the plastic envelope that it comes in, in my suitcase, so that when I am packing to come home, the empty envelope will remind me to pull it from the mirror!</li>
            <li> Both were unacceptable: the first had such a distorted image that it was impossible to use.</li>
            <li> It is hard to use it there since I can&#x27;t get close enough to see to put on makeup, which is what I needed it for.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping it - not worth returning it.</li>
            <li> Worse yet, I tried to do some early Christmas shopping and now it isn&#x27;t returnable.  </li>
            <li> Amazon shipped out another one, and it was just like the previously shipped one I had just received.</li>

            <li> It is hard to use where I wanted it, which was attached to my bathroom mirrow.  </li>
            <li> You have to place your face at least three inches from the mirror in order to see part of your face to shave, and then water obscures the image and makes the product unusable.  </li>
            <li> The optics are terrible and it distorts images like a fun house mirror.  </li>

            <li> I would be lost without this mirror, use it daily. Very pleased with the \\&quot;strong stick\\&quot; to my bathroom mirror and 7X strength. If ever broken, would purchase again. Great quality, HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
            <li> When the eye sight goes can&#x27;t live without this mirror and the price is great!!!</li>
            <li> unhappy with this mirror.  You have to get 2 inches from it to see yourself.</li>
            <li> I like the size of the mirror and the magnification, but it will does not stick to the mirror in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I was noticing myself running to get my reading glasses one too many times while washing up in the morning, and it dawned on me (for ladies this was likely a no brainer) how about a magnifying mirror that attaches to the bathroom mirror with suction cups. I just put it up and the size is perfect and the magnification is as I would have hoped, if not downright scary seeing myself with THIS kind of clarity. The 3 suction cups appear to be strongly attached and it took a bit of fingernail finagling under each to re-position it, so I&#x27;m thinking, It&#x27;s gonna stay! The company shipped it pretty fast too. For the price and size It was worth writing about to you.</li>
            <li> This mirror is extremely good for travel (putting on make-up), for someone at the very \\&quot;near-sighted\\&quot; stage of life.</li>
            <li> The mirror works very well. High magnification, good solid construction of the base and mounting cups.</li>
            <li> Great mirror for those over the age of mid 40&#x27;s that need magnifiers or bifocals. Makes shaving a face with detail for men and tweezing for females much easier. Suction cups are awesome - you can move location and height as needed.</li>
            <li> I purchased and received this mirror a few days ago and I should have paid more attention to the reviews I read before purchasing.  It is hard to use where I wanted it, which was attached to my bathroom mirrow.  It is hard to use it there since I can&#x27;t get close enough to see to put on makeup, which is what I needed it for.  I will probably purchase another one but it will be in person not online so I can check it out beforehand.  I also may not need that much magnification.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use in the shower as an aid in shaving.  I had purchased a similar one previously, but the suction cups wore out and the mirror became spotty, so I needed a new one. You have to place your face at least three inches from the mirror in order to see part of your face to shave, and then water obscures the image and makes the product unusable.  It should not fog, and it should shed water without leaving water traces. If you like comedy, try shaving with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these to replace a broken one and have one extra. Both were unacceptable: the first had such a distorted image that it was impossible to use. The second one, while without distortion, did not have the promised 7X magnification (looked like 5X). Definitely not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is just what I wanted. The product shipped in a timely matter.  I was not able to find it locally and was glad they are still available.</li>
            <li> I had a smaller size of this mirror which I accidentally broke.  I ordered the larger size and am extremely satisfied with it.  It provides my wife with an enlarged reflection enabling her to apply makeup with ease and assist her with her contacts.  Myself being older with declining eyesight, I enjoy a renewed ability to more clearly see my face for various tasks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not liking this mirror much but kept it! For some reason my eyes can&#x27;t seem to adjust to the mirror. I have to get up super close just for my eyes to adjust to the mirror. In the future I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> This is really a great mirror for ~$10, but it is too large.  I didn&#x27;t realize how big 9\\&quot; diameter was -- I think a 6\\&quot; diameter would be a better size.  I&#x27;m keeping it - not worth returning it.</li>
            <li> The mirror makes me feel like I m going to throw up when I look into it.  It is all wavy.</li>
            <li> The best viewing area is only in the middle.  Sides are somewhat distorted.</li>
            <li> I have a difficult time seeing close up to do my make-up.  I can remember when a 5 magnification was good enough.  If you wear around a 3.00 magnification or higher for close up work, this is the mirror for you!  I also take it with me when I travel and just stick it onto the hotel mirror.  I keep the plastic envelope that it comes in, in my suitcase, so that when I am packing to come home, the empty envelope will remind me to pull it from the mirror!</li>
            <li> This mirror has too much magnification for me to apply make-up.  I wish I&#x27;d bought a mirror from a store so I could&#x27;ve looked at it and known exactly what I was getting.  It doesn&#x27;t serve my needs.</li>
            <li> not happy with product. It was distorted</li>
            <li> All of my siblings and I are past 40 years of age and no longer see as well as we used to.  As soon as I tried one of these mirrors, I purchased one for everyone in my family including my Mom.  We all keep the mirror suctioned onto our bathroom mirrors at all times (it looks rather stylish).  One of my brothers was dating a woman who lived in a different town and he would pack his suction mirror in his luggage with everything else.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  Distorted view. Adheres to well to larger mirror, but can&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so big it creates a strange distortion. I though this would work for whole face makeup application, but I can&#x27;t look at my whole face because of the distortion. I prefer the smaller, stronger magnification and just look at smaller sections of my face!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my wife to apply makeup!  Hangs on our vanity mirror easily with the 3 suction cups.  Liked it so much we purchased 3 more to give as gifts and 1 for traveling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this mirror before and loved it. So when I dropped mine, I ordered a new one immediately. Don&#x27;t hesitate.</li>
            <li> I used to have a Swissco Mirror but it fell and broke into a thousand pieces so I re-ordered it but something must have changed as the magnification was not as good as the original one I had which was a 7x.</li>
            <li> I already own three of these mirrors for each of our bathrooms, but one unfortunately broke and I wanted to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;I also travel with it because its easy to pack. I ordered a replacement, and it arrived and it was not at all the 7x magnification as my other 3 I own. So I sent it back with a note explaining why I was returning it. Amazon shipped out another one, and it was just like the previously shipped one I had just received. I guess Swissco must have changed their magnification specifications. I didn&#x27;t waste my time shipping out again, I just gave it away to my younger daughter.&lt;br /&gt;If I order it again, I will order it in 10x to probably get the magnification to match the others I previously own.</li>
            <li> This mirror gives such a distorted image that its practically useless. The suction cups work well on a mirror surface</li>
            <li> I had looked all over for a magnifying mirror like an old one I had with the suction cups.  I was elated to find it on Amazon at a resonable price. It&#x27;s what I use to apply my lashes and makeup. I bought an extra one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> The size was good.  But the 7x magnification was not enuf for this bifocal-wearing person.  And the distortion in the mirror almost gave me a headache.  Plus the suction cups are so close together, near the center of the mirror, that it makes removing it a pain.  I returned it.</li>
            <li> My eyes aren&#x27;t as good as they used to be so I  decided to get a magnifying mirror to help put my makeup on easier.  This mirror is great.  It&#x27;s nice and big, plus the suctions on the back hold the mirror in place nice and snug.  It&#x27;s a good quality.  It&#x27;s also easy to move around and place it other positions.  I liked the 7-times magnifier better than the 5.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror to replace one I broke.  The image is distorted and if I had kept the packaging material I would return it.  I would not recommend this item</li>
            <li> The optics are terrible and it distorts images like a fun house mirror.  Worse yet, I tried to do some early Christmas shopping and now it isn&#x27;t returnable.  It&#x27;s a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> The mirror is not strong enough and it costs too much to return the 3 of them and I will never purchase anything again from AMAZON.COM!!!!! I am stuck for the cost of the mirrors....BOO!</li>
            <li> The mirror is distorted and there is no option for return or refund. Had one of these before and thought I would get another when it broke. Not such a good idea.  A total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Poor quality in magnification and focus.  This is the third and fourth mirror of this type I have bought and their quality has gone downhill.</li>
            <li> Mirror is blurry,defected, and distorted. Had it delivered to my son&#x27;s house and right now I can&#x27;t retrieve it to send back. Sure would like a refund.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this mirror.  The suction cups work very well and the mirror is a good quality.</li>
            <li> The mirror is distorted and there is no option for return or refund.  Had one of these before and thought I would get another when it broke.  Not such a good idea.</li>
            <li> It arrived in  good condition and on time.  It adheres great to the mirror on my medicine cabinet.  However, as a matter of personal preference, I think I will order a swing arm type that attaches to the wall with a back light.  It would be easier on my back without having to lean over the sink.</li>
