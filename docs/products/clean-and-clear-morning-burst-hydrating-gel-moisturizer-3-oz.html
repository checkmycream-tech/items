            <li>The gel is quite light, but still provides a good deal of hydration.  </li>
            <li>like, and very light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Very light ...</li>
            <li>I love the texture</li>
            <li>I like this better than the Clinique gel moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and so I tried this and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been able to moisturize my skin without the product breaking my oily skin out.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer since using Mary Kays Velocity which was discontinued.</li>
            <li>This lotion is great, well really this gel.</li>
            <li>I use more than I would otherwise.</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>But This deserves a 100% I absolutely love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>And I love the oil-free part.</li>
            <li>Granted i still love Clinique</li>
            <li>I love that it contains cumber and mango</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like to wash my face any more than 2 times a day because it drys my skin out.</li>
            <li>, I love the moisturizing effects and that it works under makeup and primer.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in LOVE.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>It feels so refreshing on my face :)</li>
            <li>It has a great scent and leaves my skin feeling great if not better than Clinique.</li>
            <li>smells great and leaves skin soft.  </li>
            <li>Keep up the good work clean and clear :)!</li>
            <li>, I love the smell, I love that it&#x27;s quick drying</li>
            <li>I used this product for 3 days and at first I really liked it.  </li>
            <li>Hands down THEE BEST moisturizer period...</li>
            <li>I love that it absorbs quickly leaving my skin feeling silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was such a great deal.</li>
            <li>It dries nice and fast and feels like you have nothing on, while still moisturizing.</li>
            <li>but this gel is so light</li>
            <li>and it leaves my face feeling so smooth and as the bottle says refreshed.</li>
            <li>The smell is light, and nice, and most importantly, doesn&#x27;t cause my sensitive skin to react.&lt;br /&gt;3.)  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel and look smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a great lightweight oil free gel and it is especially wonderful for those cold winter months where you need all the moisture you can get.  </li>
            <li>great for my combination skin especially in the summer when I am prone to break outs</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten a couple of free samples of this and have been using them as my morning moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light &amp; doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a huge relief coming from someone with super oily skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Applying it to my face also makes my hands nice and soft</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of thick lotion on my face, I feel like it makes me break out so this product is perfect.</li>
            <li>This stuff honestly makes my face completely balanced in all</li>
            <li>love the light, fresh fragrance, and it leaves my skin feeling very soft and moisturized without any greasy or oily residue or shine.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>would recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a versatile facial moisturizer that is easy to apply, reasonably priced, and makes your skin feel pretty good.</li>
            <li>Who would have thought a gel would give such nice, non-greasy coverage?</li>
            <li>I used this on my oily acne prone skin after washing my face first thing in the morning and it always makes my skin super soft and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Goes right into your skin and leaves you feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s really important that people with oily skin know to steer clear of lotion moisturizers and opt for gel instead!</li>
            <li>But I just tried this stuff for the first time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always so smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and my foundation goes on smoothly and evenly afterward.  </li>
            <li>The things that are supposed to help with breakouts actually make me break out most of the time.</li>
            <li>This is the first moisturizer that hasn&#x27;t made me break out.</li>
            <li>i hav trouble finding a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause any kind of reaction in my sensitive skin which is a little surprising because some of the ingredients are not so great (artificial dyes and fragrances as well as a couple of parabens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this with some Clean &amp; Clear oil-blotting sheets.</li>
            <li>I always stick to clean and clear products.</li>
            <li>just as I know that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, I definitely believe that if you are struggling to find a good moisturizer, with the price point, you should give it a try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter than regular moisturizers and it isn&#x27;t greasy like most of them are on my skin,</li>
            <li>Its so light, absorbs right into the skin with no residue left over.</li>
            <li>My only problem so far is that the scent is really strong, although it fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I really like this Clean &amp; Clear</li>
            <li>I was given a small .05 oz tube as a free sample and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It is so light and really helps with my super oily skin while not making my skin dry out.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s a gel rather than a lotion or an oil, it absorbs into and hydrates my skin without leaving any kind of residue (even if I dispense a little too much).</li>
            <li>Absorbs well, keeps skin moisturized, and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had no breakouts (acne-prone, sensitive, and VERY oily); it layers well under foundation sort of acting as a primer; and I enjoy the fresh cucumber-like scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>also moisturized really well, without feeling greasy or choking my pores.</li>
            <li>so I tend to rub the excess over my whole hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is the only thing that provides light moisturizing without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li>What I really like about this as a morning moisturizer is the texture.</li>
            <li>I have VERY picky skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually one to write a 100% positive review on a product but positives</li>
            <li>I have a lot of issues with my skin being super dry, but super sensitive.</li>
            <li>My face still feels super soft hours after using it, and it doesn&#x27;t take very much to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li>well Clinique&#x27;s Gel Moisturizer is but this is up next and only because it&#x27;s more affordable.</li>
            <li>I use the Clean and Clear Morning Burst face scrub and it works well for me, so thought I&#x27;d give this a shot since its from the same line.</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin, even though it can also flake really easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very cautious about what I use on my face seeing as though I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Other than that it does feel great on my skin for a little bit and it does moisturize my face, skin, and neck area!</li>
            <li>My skin is almost totally clear!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not the one to Rate  a product 100%.</li>
            <li>For reference, I have combination skin and tend to break out easily if moisturizers are too heavy.</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t have a lot of flakes, I use less, and then I&#x27;m more likely to stay oil-free</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a thousand other products, high end to pharmacy brand, all natural to totally artificial, and this is the best gel moisturizer I can find.</li>
            <li>Just soft skin.</li>
            <li>Hoping this clears up soon, but skin reactions can last 2-4 weeks even with treatment, so just be cautious if you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but it also makes all of my face feel extra soft and</li>
            <li>I may actually be one of the only people who isn&#x27;t a fan of the smell (very artificial cucumber smell) but overall, excellent little moisturizer for an incredibly reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has acne and dry skin, or just looking for something new to try.</li>
            <li>Clear Morning Burst hydrating gel moisturizer not only hydrates my dry skin</li>

            <li> I was given a small .05 oz tube as a free sample and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> It is so light and really helps with my super oily skin while not making my skin dry out.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s a gel rather than a lotion or an oil, it absorbs into and hydrates my skin without leaving any kind of residue (even if I dispense a little too much).</li>
            <li> Absorbs well, keeps skin moisturized, and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no breakouts (acne-prone, sensitive, and VERY oily); it layers well under foundation sort of acting as a primer; and I enjoy the fresh cucumber-like scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> also moisturized really well, without feeling greasy or choking my pores.</li>
            <li> so I tend to rub the excess over my whole hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is the only thing that provides light moisturizing without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> What I really like about this as a morning moisturizer is the texture.</li>
            <li> I have VERY picky skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually one to write a 100% positive review on a product but positives</li>
            <li> I have a lot of issues with my skin being super dry, but super sensitive.</li>
            <li> My face still feels super soft hours after using it, and it doesn&#x27;t take very much to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> well Clinique&#x27;s Gel Moisturizer is but this is up next and only because it&#x27;s more affordable.</li>
            <li> I use the Clean and Clear Morning Burst face scrub and it works well for me, so thought I&#x27;d give this a shot since its from the same line.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, even though it can also flake really easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very cautious about what I use on my face seeing as though I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Other than that it does feel great on my skin for a little bit and it does moisturize my face, skin, and neck area!</li>
            <li> My skin is almost totally clear!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not the one to Rate  a product 100%.</li>
            <li> For reference, I have combination skin and tend to break out easily if moisturizers are too heavy.</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t have a lot of flakes, I use less, and then I&#x27;m more likely to stay oil-free</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a thousand other products, high end to pharmacy brand, all natural to totally artificial, and this is the best gel moisturizer I can find.</li>
            <li> Just soft skin.</li>
            <li> Hoping this clears up soon, but skin reactions can last 2-4 weeks even with treatment, so just be cautious if you have sensitive skin</li>

            <li> I may actually be one of the only people who isn&#x27;t a fan of the smell (very artificial cucumber smell) but overall, excellent little moisturizer for an incredibly reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has acne and dry skin, or just looking for something new to try.</li>
            <li> Clear Morning Burst hydrating gel moisturizer not only hydrates my dry skin</li>
            <li> just enough moisture without causing me any new blemishes, and then on day 3 my face and neck were covered in little bumps and my face felt like it was on fire.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be sticky (why I usually avoid gels) but it was not, and actually much lighter feeling than the cream moisturizer</li>
            <li> Most of the other lotions I&#x27;ve used on my face end up burning like crazy, even the sensitive skin formulas, but this stuff didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>

            <li> Really good. Absorbs well, keeps skin moisturized, and doesn&#x27;t cause me to break out much. Plus it&#x27;s a lot less sticky than other gel moisturizers I&#x27;ve used. My only problem so far is that the scent is really strong, although it fades pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer that I use in the morning and at night. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has acne and dry skin, or just looking for something new to try.</li>
            <li> Holy moly. Never written an Amazon review. But I just tried this stuff for the first time and I&#x27;m in love!! I love the texture, I love the smell, I love that it&#x27;s quick drying and I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling greasy at all! That&#x27;s a huge relief coming from someone with super oily skin. Woohoo! Love it!!</li>
            <li> This was such a great deal. Works similar to Biotherm for men.</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing. I like this better than the Clinique gel moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect and I wanted a change from my Simple Blemish-Fighting Moisturiser and so I tried this and love it. Who would have thought a gel would give such nice, non-greasy coverage? Well, this does. It also smells great, I&#x27;ll be reordering :)</li>
            <li> I love that it absorbs quickly leaving my skin feeling silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no breakouts (acne-prone, sensitive, and VERY oily); it layers well under foundation sort of acting as a primer; and I enjoy the fresh cucumber-like scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason is gets 4 instead of 5 stars is because there&#x27;s no SPF in it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and keeps my T zone from being greasy.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 3 days and at first I really liked it.  Smells really nice, just enough moisture without causing me any new blemishes, and then on day 3 my face and neck were covered in little bumps and my face felt like it was on fire.  It is day 4 now and the rash continues as well as the fiery sensation.  Bummed out!  Hoping this clears up soon, but skin reactions can last 2-4 weeks even with treatment, so just be cautious if you have sensitive skin this may not be the product for you!</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer for combo skin good to use day or night i hav trouble finding a good moisturizer and this one is good for me</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I have a lot of issues with my skin being super dry, but super sensitive. Most of the other lotions I&#x27;ve used on my face end up burning like crazy, even the sensitive skin formulas, but this stuff didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;It also moisturized really well, without feeling greasy or choking my pores. My face still feels super soft hours after using it, and it doesn&#x27;t take very much to cover my entire face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been able to moisturize my skin without the product breaking my oily skin out.  Now that I&#x27;m over 50, I expected my breakouts to stop but no.  This product is a gel moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores at all!</li>
            <li> Not normally a product I would buy, but I received a sample of this with some Clean &amp; Clear oil-blotting sheets. I was expecting it to be sticky (why I usually avoid gels) but it was not, and actually much lighter feeling than the cream moisturizer I usually use.&lt;br /&gt;I love the light, fresh fragrance, and it leaves my skin feeling very soft and moisturized without any greasy or oily residue or shine.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely purchase this product in the future. I only wish it contained SPF as I prefer a product with sunscreen in the summer.</li>
            <li> wonderful wonderful wonderful product for protection here in CO</li>
            <li> I was given a small .05 oz tube as a free sample and I absolutely love it. I have combination skin so finding a facial moisturizer that helps my dry zones while not clogging up my oily/normal zones is a challenge for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst hydrating gel moisturizer not only hydrates my dry skin but it also makes all of my face feel extra soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another great thing about this item is the invigorating yet pleasant scent that reminds me of citrus and cucumbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying it to my face also makes my hands nice and soft so I tend to rub the excess over my whole hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product for anyone who is looking for a versatile facial moisturizer that is easy to apply, reasonably priced, and makes your skin feel pretty good.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It is so light and really helps with my super oily skin while not making my skin dry out. It smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer since using Mary Kays Velocity which was discontinued. I HATE the feel of lotion on my face. This is &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; like, and very light. Goes right into your skin and leaves you feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a thousand other products, high end to pharmacy brand, all natural to totally artificial, and this is the best gel moisturizer I can find. I keep coming back to it! It is the only thing that provides light moisturizing without clogging my pores. I use a richer moisturizer at night, but this does the trick during the day.  Feels great under makeup.  It works for me!</li>
            <li> This lotion is great, well really this gel. It&#x27;s very light and not greasy. I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of thick lotion on my face, I feel like it makes me break out so this product is perfect. It dries nice and fast and feels like you have nothing on, while still moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with milia. (tiny white bumps on my face)  I read online to use a gel moisturizer instead of a cream or oil base.  I really like this Clean &amp; Clear and it&#x27;s the ONLY gel moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever seen.  It&#x27;s very light and feels good when I put it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! I&#x27;m very cautious about what I use on my face seeing as though I have sensitive skin but this gel is so light and it leaves my face feeling so smooth and as the bottle says refreshed. This is a must have product for me.</li>
            <li> I have rated this moisturizer a 5 and i&#x27;ll tell you why... It&#x27;s AMAZING!  I&#x27;m not usually one to write a 100% positive review on a product but positives are all that i&#x27;ve gotten from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.)  I have combination skin.  Oily t-zone and dry everywhere else.  This stuff honestly makes my face completely balanced in all areas.&lt;br /&gt;2.)  The smell is light, and nice, and most importantly, doesn&#x27;t cause my sensitive skin to react.&lt;br /&gt;3.)  My face feels amazing after I put this stuff on.  It&#x27;s always so smooth and soft.  Even hours after i&#x27;ve used it.  It also doesn&#x27;t clog your pores or cause breakouts.  (I&#x27;m extremely prone to breakouts but this hasn&#x27;t caused a single zit!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now just as I know that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, I definitely believe that if you are struggling to find a good moisturizer, with the price point, you should give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, even though it can also flake really easily. I&#x27;ve been desperately on the lookout for a product that isn&#x27;t lotion, because my oily skin can&#x27;t handle it and I typically break out if I use lotion moisturizers. I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and I have to say that I&#x27;m very impressed. It&#x27;s much lighter than regular moisturizers and it isn&#x27;t greasy like most of them are on my skin, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I have a lot of flakes I use more than I would otherwise. Which means that my skin will start to produce noticeable oil within 3-4 hours. However, the plus is that it hydrates my skin enough to get rid of the flakes AND it does not cause me to break out. When I don&#x27;t have a lot of flakes, I use less, and then I&#x27;m more likely to stay oil-free longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used for my skin type. I think it&#x27;s really important that people with oily skin know to steer clear of lotion moisturizers and opt for gel instead!</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer ... Very light ... I have problems finding products that I don&#x27;t break out with and this one is perfect</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but it does smell good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not the one to Rate  a product 100%. But This deserves a 100% I absolutely love this moisturizer.  Definitely recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> In love with this product, The smell is wonderful. It makes my face feel softer to the touch after I use it. And I love the oil-free part. I also have the matching facial cleanser. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Recommend this item. Makes your skin feel and look smooth. No need for additional moisterizers.</li>
            <li> I have been using Clinique&#x27;s moisturizing gel for years because I like the lightweight feel of the moisturizer.  Granted i still love Clinique but it can get expensive dropping $$ on moisturizer often.  Then I found this in a travel sample and decided to give it a try.  It has a great scent and leaves my skin feeling great if not better than Clinique. This is a great lightweight oil free gel and it is especially wonderful for those cold winter months where you need all the moisture you can get.  There&#x27;s also a face wash that matches this moisturizer that I&#x27;ve also started using, it&#x27;s amazing too!</li>
            <li> This moisturizing gel smells amazing! I love that it contains cumber and mango so I knew it would soothe any irritation on my skin. I used this on my oily acne prone skin after washing my face first thing in the morning and it always makes my skin super soft and healthy looking. The only thing is I did start to notice that I would start getting oily after using this after about 3-5 hrs. So, I had to sometimes wash face again and I don&#x27;t like to wash my face any more than 2 times a day because it drys my skin out. But it didn&#x27;t make my acne any worse. Other than that it does feel great on my skin for a little bit and it does moisturize my face, skin, and neck area! I always stick to clean and clear products. Keep up the good work clean and clear :)!</li>
            <li> awesome moisturizer. non oily at all. great for my combination skin especially in the summer when I am prone to break outs</li>
            <li> This is a great, inexpensive moisturizer! I may actually be one of the only people who isn&#x27;t a fan of the smell (very artificial cucumber smell) but overall, excellent little moisturizer for an incredibly reasonable price.  The gel is quite light, but still provides a good deal of hydration.  It leaves my skin soft and my foundation goes on smoothly and evenly afterward.  For reference, I have combination skin and tend to break out easily if moisturizers are too heavy.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found, it doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. I wish it had SPF but then it probably WOULD have a residue.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see the ingredients on the product page, so I thought I&#x27;d include them here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Dimethicone, Glycerin, Dimethicone/Vinyl Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Polyacrylamide, Cetearyl Olivate, Phenoxyethanol, Dimethiconol, Sorbitan Olivate, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Fragrance, Dimethicone Crosspolymer, Carbomer, Laureth-7, Methylparaben, Propylene Glycol, C12-14 Pareth-12, Propylparaben, Ethylparaben, Cucumis Sativus (Cucumber) Fruit Extract, Mangifera Indica (Mango) Fruit Extract, Sodium Hydroxide, Green 5, Blue 1, Yellow 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten a couple of free samples of this and have been using them as my morning moisturizer. What I really like about this as a morning moisturizer is the texture. Because it&#x27;s a gel rather than a lotion or an oil, it absorbs into and hydrates my skin without leaving any kind of residue (even if I dispense a little too much). It doesn&#x27;t cause any kind of reaction in my sensitive skin which is a little surprising because some of the ingredients are not so great (artificial dyes and fragrances as well as a couple of parabens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I use this, I use foundation (often with primer). It doesn&#x27;t interfere with the application of either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I love the moisturizing effects and that it works under makeup and primer. I&#x27;m not as thrilled about all the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have VERY picky skin. The things that are supposed to help with breakouts actually make me break out most of the time. I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding a moisturizer that didn&#x27;t do so. I use the Clean and Clear Morning Burst face scrub and it works well for me, so thought I&#x27;d give this a shot since its from the same line. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and I&#x27;m in LOVE. Its so light, absorbs right into the skin with no residue left over. Just soft skin. I&#x27;ve even found I seem to get less greasy throughout the day. And the best part? My skin is almost totally clear! This is the first moisturizer that hasn&#x27;t made me break out. I&#x27;m sold. Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Great deal for its price. I recommend it. It came very fast and perfect conditions. I will buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> Hands down THEE BEST moisturizer period...well Clinique&#x27;s Gel Moisturizer is but this is up next and only because it&#x27;s more affordable. I have oily skin and this hydrates without breaking me out. It is light and evaporates amazingly!! I am telling you that it is great!!!</li>
            <li> smells great and leaves skin soft.  My 18 yo, my 8 yo and I (I&#x27;m the mom) - we all use it. I think it helps calm acne prone skin and protects your face from the cold winter wind.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! It&#x27;s light &amp; doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. It feels so refreshing on my face :)</li>
