            <li>However, the Alfaparf Semi Di Lino does not produce any oil for me, and my hair stays looking nice and clean for about 3 to 4 days - which is impressive compared to other similar products I&#x27;ve used!</li>

            <li>It works from the first day!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I tried one application from this Alfaparf Semi Di Lino line at my local beauty salon and fell in love with it right away!</li>
            <li>Illuminating Essential Oil and Alfa Parf Real Cream Ph4, it works better!</li>
            <li>I heard from a friend about this product and the funny thing is that it shines your hair but increases the volume.</li>
            <li>My first trying was in the hair salon</li>
            <li>This is the best thing you could use when your hair is a little dry...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even slathered pure coconut oil on my hair for a mask.</li>
            <li>I was actually given something similar to this from a salon and it worked AMAZINGLY.</li>
            <li>I really recommend for curly and frizzy hair</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I do not use a whole bottle of either.  </li>
            <li>It make it very tangle and</li>
            <li>Never in my life, that I have that much coming out while I was trying to detangle my hair</li>
            <li>It really works and I feel like it&#x27;s restoring my hair.</li>
            <li>I will recommend this to any-and-everyone that wants to condition their hair.</li>
            <li>My hair was very frizz</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life i was able to put down the condicioner .</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants to take extra special care of their hair.</li>
            <li>Been using it for sooo long, a little expensive but worth every penny , works great on my hair,does not leave it&lt;br /&gt;sticky nor weights it down, yet the best conditioner.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product for periodical intensive hair care.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for troubled hair and is great for cold and very humid climate.</li>
            <li>Your hair also will have a high natural shine you&#x27;ll be amaze.</li>
            <li>My hair feel so soft!</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair shiny and soft!  </li>
            <li>Soft shiny hair is what you can expect after just one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Great price!</li>
            <li>I have used better products in the past.</li>
            <li>A big preoccupation I initially had was that my hair (naturally straight) usually gets very oily after one or two days with most products I use.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so incredibly soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This is truly the only product I have seen REAL results with.</li>
            <li>It says to rinse it out, but if you don&#x27;t put too much you can actually use it as a leave-in.</li>
            <li>It delivers on its promise to make hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>the salon did a treatment on my hair that left my hair like smooth black glass.  </li>
            <li>I just remember the little blue glass bottles they used, my hair never looked so smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Removes frizz and adds shine like no other product.</li>
            <li>My Hair is dry and thick, so it needed more than one application to feel that was softer...</li>
            <li>However, the price at the salon for one bottle was equivalent to almost half of what it would cost me to get the 12-applications package, so I decided to purchase the whole thing through Amazon.</li>
            <li>leaves my hair soft and shiny, after many relaxers in the past relaxers tend to kill the shine of your hair and make it dull</li>
            <li>The product definitely helps dry hair and leaves it soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> The directions also say to use the whole application at one time, but if you don&#x27;t have long or thick hair, you can actually get 2 or 3 applications out of one bottle.</li>
            <li> I had overprocessed my hair with color and straightening and my hair was left very dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> They stretch and go a long way for me.</li>
            <li> Alfaparf Semi Di Lino Essential Oil is designed to maximize and give you shine and beauty to your hair without weighing it down, it delivers daily nourishment while increasing hair strength.</li>
            <li> and I only use half a bottle each time</li>
            <li> As I mentioned in the leave-in conditioner pink AlfaParf review, I mix the two of them and use them together for a leave-in conditioner after I&#x27;ve shampooed.  </li>
            <li> on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> i hate when one breaks in the bathroom, but it does nice stuff for her hair.</li>
            <li> I also put a little on before I blow dry my hair.m</li>
            <li> IT SMOOTHE THE FRIZZES AND KEEEPS THEM DOWN EVEN THROUGH HUMIDITY</li>
            <li> Silky to extreme!</li>
            <li> I use Macademia hair oil for my very dry and thick hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product for a few years now.</li>
            <li> I usually use half a bottle each time.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the product arrived with one of the glass vials broken.</li>
            <li> It immediately, I mean immediately, makes the hair silkier, and less damaged looking.</li>
            <li> Hardly recommended</li>
            <li> I cleansed it, rinsed it of, applied my usual conditioner,but my hair still feels and looks like straw!</li>
            <li> As a gift about two years ago a friend treated me to an expensive salon day in Beverly Hills</li>
            <li> This salon was a 6 hour driving distance from me, though, and I was desperate to find it again</li>
            <li> Its a waste of money!!!!!</li>
            <li> bad product.</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Great product I do relaxers in my hair and this is the only product that I use with a deep conditioner I mix them together and apply to my air put a plastic cap over my hair and sit in dryer for ten minutes leaves my hair soft and shiny, after many relaxers in the past relaxers tend to kill the shine of your hair and make it dull even give you split ends this product work wonders for me I really recommend for curly and frizzy hair</li>
            <li> My hair feel so soft! This is the best thing you could use when your hair is a little dry... After blow drying my hair almost everyday and did some highlights, my hair was becoming a little dry. I just use this oil twice a week and it has been the best thing ever. My hair looks shiny and healthy again!!!! And It is not greasy at all!</li>
            <li> My Hair is dry and thick, so it needed more than one application to feel that was softer... It works.</li>
            <li> the wife loves this stuff.  i hate when one breaks in the bathroom, but it does nice stuff for her hair.</li>
            <li> I love it.  It makes my gray hair very shiny and strong.</li>
            <li> Perfet serv&amp;iacute;..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for years... And always great results , moisturizer and shine hair. Love it and recommend  this product</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this product and I just love it! I&#x27;ll be ordering again for sure. Works great even on my highlighted fine hair. It&#x27;s pricey but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! You have to try a mix of Alfa Parf Semi Di Lino Illuminating Essential Oil and Alfa Parf Real Cream Ph4, it works better!</li>
            <li> Alfaparf Semi Di Lino Essential Oil is designed to maximize and give you shine and beauty to your hair without weighing it down, it delivers daily nourishment while increasing hair strength. Hair feels silky-smooth, manageable and easy to style.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> It works from the first day!</li>
            <li> Excellent for damaged hair!</li>
            <li> I use this product for a few years now. I like how it makes my hair look and feel. It makes my hair stronger and helps it grow faster. I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Conditions hair perfectly and long lasting too.</li>
            <li> I tried one application from this Alfaparf Semi Di Lino line at my local beauty salon and fell in love with it right away! My hair was incredibly shiny and silky smooth after just one application, and it smelled amazing! However, the price at the salon for one bottle was equivalent to almost half of what it would cost me to get the 12-applications package, so I decided to purchase the whole thing through Amazon. I have been using this product at home about once a month and still get the same results every time. With each application as well as in-between use, my hair looks healthier because it is hydrated, and the strands look fuller and shinier. A big preoccupation I initially had was that my hair (naturally straight) usually gets very oily after one or two days with most products I use. However, the Alfaparf Semi Di Lino does not produce any oil for me, and my hair stays looking nice and clean for about 3 to 4 days - which is impressive compared to other similar products I&#x27;ve used! Would highly recommend this product for periodical intensive hair care.</li>
            <li> As a gift about two years ago a friend treated me to an expensive salon day in Beverly Hills the salon did a treatment on my hair that left my hair like smooth black glass.  I just remember the little blue glass bottles they used, my hair never looked so smooth and shiny.  I found it by accident here on Amazon and so I bought it hoping it was indeed the same product.  It was and I an so happy my hair looks and feels amazing.</li>
            <li> THIS IS GREAT FOR YOUR HAIR, ESPECIALLY IF YOUR HAIR IS FRIEDD IT SMOOTHE THE FRIZZES AND KEEEPS THEM DOWN EVEN THROUGH HUMIDITY</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I really love it! Made my purchase with GoGeorgeus seller. The shipping was very fast and the product was finely packaged. Thanks :) I definitely recommend this product and seller</li>
            <li> this is a really good product for your hair. I really love it I will buy this product again, it is very cheap</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years now. It leaves my hair so incredibly soft and shiny. I have a lot of hair and I only use half a bottle each time I wash my hair which is once to twice a week. My hairstylist always compliments how healthy and stronger my hair has gotten and I know it has a lot to do with me using this product. I highly recommend. You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> THE VERY BEST HAIR CONDITIONER I HAVE EVER USED IN MY SALON.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  As I mentioned in the leave-in conditioner pink AlfaParf review, I mix the two of them and use them together for a leave-in conditioner after I&#x27;ve shampooed.  I do not use a whole bottle of either.  Maybe a third of each, or even a fourth.  They stretch and go a long way for me.</li>
            <li> bad product. I have been using this product for a while. I just wash my hair. It make it very tangle and the amount of hair that just came out, made me speechless. Never in my life, that I have that much coming out while I was trying to detangle my hair</li>
            <li> I loved my hair is shiny  and smooth .</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have used it for more than 5 years and nothing can beat it. Removes frizz and adds shine like no other product.</li>
            <li> I use Macademia hair oil for my very dry and thick hair.I came across this product and was impressed by all the wonderful reviews. So I said to myself why not see what&#x27;s it all about? I applied this oil to my hair 2 days ago and my hair turned into a bunch of straw! I cleansed it, rinsed it of, applied my usual conditioner,but my hair still feels and looks like straw! Will just stick to my Macademia line of products for sure!</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair shiny and soft!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Ohmy gawd thank you! I&#x27;ve always loved this product! Just had to buy it and add to my collection ...</li>
            <li> Incredible hair conditioner!!  nothing else makes hair feel the way alfaparf does.  it is worth every penny and a very special product.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years now, and still get great results on every application. I can feel how my hair absorbs the product, leaving it shiny, silky, detangled and it smells really good. Soft shiny hair is what you can expect after just one bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Great price!</li>
            <li> Very good for my hair!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products for your hair 100% worth it  I JUST LOVE IT , so highly recomend it and once you try it , you will be using this product forever!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It makes my hair smooth and shiney. I also put a little on before I blow dry my hair.m</li>
            <li> I love this oil and it leaves the hair feeling soft and has a wonderful shine to it. This is a great product for troubled hair and is great for cold and very humid climate. I love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I have been using for a while now.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants to take extra special care of their hair. The product definitely helps dry hair and leaves it soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the product arrived with one of the glass vials broken. But this isn&#x27;t the fault of the company I purchased it from. I think the problem is with the shipper.</li>
            <li> I heard from a friend about this product and the funny thing is that it shines your hair but increases the volume.I bought for myself, my mom and mother-in-law and now is my second time buying it. My mother&#x27;s hair was thinning after using tis her hair is fuller and way shinier.</li>
            <li> I have tried EVERY deep conditioner, mask, etc. out there. Everything from drug store to salon ones. I&#x27;ve even slathered pure coconut oil on my hair for a mask. I was actually given something similar to this from a salon and it worked AMAZINGLY. This salon was a 6 hour driving distance from me, though, and I was desperate to find it again and I&#x27;m so glad I did. This is truly the only product I have seen REAL results with. It is so worth it! I will buy it again and again. It immediately, I mean immediately, makes the hair silkier, and less damaged looking. I had overprocessed my hair with color and straightening and my hair was left very dry and brittle. It really works and I feel like it&#x27;s restoring my hair. It says to rinse it out, but if you don&#x27;t put too much you can actually use it as a leave-in. It doesn&#x27;t look oily. The directions also say to use the whole application at one time, but if you don&#x27;t have long or thick hair, you can actually get 2 or 3 applications out of one bottle. I will recommend this to any-and-everyone that wants to condition their hair.</li>
            <li> Great Price and got it right away. Leaves my curly hair soft, shinny and smelling amazing.</li>
            <li> I like using this product once per week. I usually use half a bottle each time. Arrived in the mail within one week of ordering.</li>
            <li> I really love it. I have told to a  lot of friends about this wonderful product and all of them are now using it.My first trying was in the hair salon so I went to Amazon.com and I have bought 24 vials.theres no product for restauring your hain betten than that and it is so chea</li>
            <li> I got them in time 😉 and everything is like I wanted. Thank you for you help and for been faster than others</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that was damaged my having a perm.The hairdresser did not roll the curlers correctly which fried my hair.She took off 4 inch because there was no curl to the 4 inches at the ends.My hair was very frizz and I purchased this product because of the reviews.The product did nothing for my hair.I purchase a cheaper product at Wal Mart which did help my frizzy hair ad the dryness.I would not recommend this to any one with dry,fine hair and frizzy.Its a waste of money!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. For the first time in my life i was able to put down the condicioner . The smell is great, hair is soft and shine.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, great smell, delivers all results promised! Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> I have been getting hair treatments with this product in salons for years with great  results. It delivers on its promise to make hair soft and shiny. It works best if you are able to sit under the heat for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Been using it for sooo long, a little expensive but worth every penny , works great on my hair,does not leave it&lt;br /&gt;sticky nor weights it down, yet the best conditioner. Have recommmended many times !</li>
            <li> I did not care for this product. I thought it was going to better. It did not leave a shine that I was expecting.  I have used better products in the past.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with this product after just one application. For me it is both the best hair conditioner ever as well as aromatherapy, the scent is absolutely intoxicating. Leaves my hair incredibly shiny and silky smooth every time.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! My hair looks awesome after every use, so shiny and soft! Easy brushing! Hardly recommended</li>
            <li> It helped my hair shine.</li>
