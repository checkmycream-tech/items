            <li>(the replacement has been great).  </li>
            <li>Worked great for a couple months, but then wouldn&#x27;t keep a charge.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this toothbrush!!</li>
            <li>great toothbrush, keep up the good work...5 stars</li>
            <li>I loved it for a while, until it started pinching my cheeks and tongue.  </li>
            <li>Good value.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>I looked around on Amazon and this one had good reviews and a good price.</li>
            <li>It is a superior product in every way.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to do a good job</li>
            <li>Even the charger is attractive with the nice water ripple effect on the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now I am using it and feel so good.</li>
            <li>The product was good</li>
            <li>The brush feels sturdy and has a sleek design that looks good in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li>It came quickly and is perfect.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Perfect: great price, comfortable design, and two setting that really clean your teeth.</li>
            <li>When this toothbrush arrived, we were very impressed: it was powerful and effective.</li>
            <li>i notice it gets 95% or more of the plaque off my teeth every brushing!</li>
            <li>it shuts the toothbrush off after the 2 minutes I LOVE THAT!</li>
            <li>You wont want to return it though, you will fall in love with this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Love the travel toothbrush as well!</li>
            <li>Glad I found this!</li>
            <li>I am SO GLAD I bought this set!</li>
            <li>First of all, the design is very attractive.</li>
            <li>so you can have an amazing electric toothbrush while you travel as well</li>
            <li>The free travel toothbrush is also great, it takes a AA battery, so no need to lug a charger around.  </li>
            <li>My teeth have gotten whiter and it is amazing to see the progress.  </li>
            <li>so my husband and myself can each have our own brush.</li>
            <li>It works very well and the price is excellent.  </li>
            <li>I liked the brush and ordered another for my husband.</li>
            <li>Looks nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it would have been nice to have included information with the unit for how to order the replacement heads for both the rechargeable &amp; battery operated traveling units.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if Braun is still making them as effective as the one I have,</li>
            <li>and he was thrilled with how my teeth are looking.</li>
            <li>, it almost forces you (in a good way) to commit to better dental</li>
            <li>It is so much better then using an manual toothbrush for sure!</li>
            <li>I was lookign for an electronic tooth brush and this one seemed to be a good fit.</li>
            <li>I travel a lot and that is super nice to have!</li>
            <li>This was a great product at first....</li>
            <li>At first I thought this item was great.</li>
            <li>I addition, the ToiletTree brush head is very, very cheaply made and ineffective compared to the options you can get with Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Must be very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the Oral B, but adequate.</li>
            <li>Up until then it was fine and we liked it.  </li>
            <li>I really love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a battery operated travel brush.</li>
            <li>This is really a great product at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>BTW, I used to use a Philips Sonicare for years and it costs a lot more money.</li>
            <li>It may even be better than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I used an manual toothbrush my whole life and always wanted to try an electric toothbrush, So i was so happy to give Toilettree&#x27;s electric toothbrush</li>
            <li>I also love that this electric toothbrush has an 2 minutes timer.</li>
            <li>i brush my teeth to make sure i get my two minuets in cause with the built in timer</li>
            <li>Just love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>, appear to be well made, and I am completely satisfied with the units themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They were then able to provide me the information on the replacement heads for the rechargeable unit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush by ToiletTree for about 2 weeks now and am quite satisfied with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Feels better than Oral-B - not as aggressive, gentler and gums get massaged.  </li>
            <li>Kids love both toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I really love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure my gums will be healthy as we&#x27;ll soon.</li>
            <li>It is uglier and bulkier but a much better cleaning.  </li>
            <li>And of course you can&#x27;t return a used toothbrush :)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this has to do with water entering through the split in the case.  </li>
            <li>We threw it out and bought a Braun electric toothbrush which has proven to be much more reliable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>But, I have to really hand it to ToiletTree&#x27;s great customer department for replacing the brush after I contacted them</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have an electric toothbrush available for the road.</li>
            <li>My Toilet Tree travel and rechargeable tooth brushes are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>The charge lasts a long time and the size of the brush head is perfect for my son.  </li>
            <li>I compared a couple of electric toothbrushes before opting for this one seeing that it had pretty good reviews and customer service.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when i got an yes to review Toilettree&#x27;s rechargeable electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li>There are others available, some with more bells and whistles, but you are going to pay more for them.</li>
            <li>Originally, I rated this product with five stars, as I was impressed by how well it cleaned, and at a fraction of the cost of similar products.</li>
            <li>I love the fact this is BPA free.  </li>
            <li>Very nice toothbrush:-) glad to help an underdog with the big boys &amp; girls...</li>
            <li>Like the design, but more importantly, it does a fine job brushing the teeth.</li>
            <li>seems cool!</li>
            <li>This rechargeable brush has so much more power, is consistent, is better for the environment and my gums and teeth never felt better.  </li>
            <li>I like the handle as it is easy to grip and does not slip.  </li>
            <li>but then the brush wouldn&#x27;t work after about 2 months and it lost power easily.  </li>
            <li>I liked this toothbrush at first and gave it 5 stars</li>
            <li>The kit also came with an extra brush for your full size tooth brush cause it is good to change your brush heads after so many months!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, light and cleans my teeth quite well.</li>
            <li>The sleek &amp;#34;hourglass&amp;#34; shape makes it comfortable to hold and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>the head falls apart when you try to use it which is a huge design flaw.  </li>
            <li>Unit is light, cleans well.  </li>
            <li>The travel toothbrush is a great extra and I will be using it a lot.  </li>
            <li>Now my teeth always feel as smooth as they do after a trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li>I miss the 2 speed operation, but it does the job for a vacation place and in am happy enough with it?</li>
            <li>The light that indicated it was charging was on, but the toothbrush never started again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>think the overall performance of the toothbrush, in mint condition, is great.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>It also has a slower speed for sensitive teeth which I do not need to use yet, but it is a good option.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t lie that  I originally got lured in by the offer of a travel toothbrush with the larger sonic toothbrush, but I am SO happy with how this set is working.</li>
            <li>The two speeds are nice, and the high setting is nice and fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really easy to clean and keep clean.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a product that will effectively clean your teeth and don&#x27;t want to pay more, you&#x27;ve come to the right</li>
            <li>Buy you one today and have fun with every brushing and have a guaranteed clean mouth every brushing!</li>
            <li>we will see if it holds up better than the first.  </li>
            <li>Have just received additional replacement brushes, still on the original brush so, will be changing brush soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a great job cleaning my teeth despite a strange company name.</li>
            <li>I leave it in my purse, the case keeps it clean</li>
            <li>so you know your getting your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel quite clean after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>so I have been using the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; setting to clean my teeth</li>
            <li>It makes my teeth feel so clean,</li>
            <li>I bought it for the RV, but it didn&#x27;t feel like my teeth were getting clean.</li>
            <li>teeth feel clean as when I return from the Dentist after my schedule appointment &amp; cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Will continue using it until it falter then will buy a different, more popular name brand.</li>
            <li>In no way does this clean as well (as some reviewers suggest)as the &amp;#34;top brand&amp;#34; electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews seemed positive and did not have an issue, so I ordered one for myself.</li>
            <li>It works, but it is nothing special.  </li>
            <li>The full size brush took a while to get used to, but after about a month, I could brush without my gums bleeding.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work at full force even after charging it overnight).</li>
            <li>I also love the look of it on my vanity since it is very sleek.  </li>
            <li>However, the fact that it barely last 3 months, and the last month or so was fairly flakey, makes me not consider this toothbrush a good value.</li>
            <li>There is enough power to actually clean your teeth individually and the size of the brush head is perfect and doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums while brushing.</li>
            <li>the speed is fast &amp; I feel very clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li>But I LOVE this new one!</li>
            <li>This toothbrush recharges quickly.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s call it a 4.5 star rating since I did run into an issue in which the toothbrush stopped adequately powering the brush head as it should (even with replacement etc.)</li>
            <li>I especially love the sensitive mode because, well, I still have 2 baby teeth and at 34 years old and they are sensitive.</li>
            <li>I was considering another more expensive electric toothbrush from another more popular brand, but I&#x27;m so glad I came across this.</li>
            <li>The clean setting really scrubs your teeth clean</li>
            <li>brush head is easy to install and remove and I like that the kit came with an extra one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this came with a mini battery-powered travel brush, which feels just as powerful as its full-size counterpart (it too has 2 settings).</li>
            <li>The larger toothbrush has a Sensitive setting that is perfect my teeth, although the Clean setting isn&#x27;t too aggressive in general; it also shuts off automatically after 2 minutes</li>
            <li>It is nice to have the timer to remind me when to move along and to have a two minute mark for total brushing time.</li>
            <li>Either way, between the 2, it should be worth the amount I paid.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far (two weeks in), I am pleased with the experience...</li>
            <li>Am thinking of ordering the irrigator since I am so pleased with the brush so far.</li>
            <li>I say this product is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>Have had this toothbrush for over six month with very positive results.</li>
            <li>The price was right, however.</li>
            <li>The size of the brush head is just right, as it seems to &amp;#34;cup&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had it long, but am happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li>A good value, but the lack of generic heads makes it less cost effective.</li>
            <li>The brush attachment to the handle is a much simpler design than the Braun, so is easier to clean.</li>
            <li>The travel tooth brush is pretty decent and still going strong.</li>
            <li>do enjoy  my new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Took me a while to get used to having a motor in my mouth, but my teeth certainly feel cleaner!</li>
            <li>It worked very, very well for 4 months.</li>
            <li>This has the force of those battery operated ones that really don&#x27;t do very much.  </li>
            <li>We have never been the couple that wants to share a toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love and will never go back to an manual toothbrush ever again!</li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to any one since it wouldn&#x27;t function consistently.</li>
            <li>always find it interesting when companies send a satisfaction survey after only a couple of weeks of receiving it.</li>
            <li>I first got this brush in May of 2014.</li>
            <li>Thanks ToiletTree!</li>
            <li>They sent a replacement, but sure enough, that lasted about six months as well.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I went a week without having to recharge it, using it twice a day.</li>
            <li>So fast delivery!</li>
            <li>My dentist will be pleased with the results after my next check-up.</li>
            <li>I had left my electric toothbrush at a hotel on a trip and thought that this one was so much better looking that I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>This electric toothbrush has two settings clean setting and sensitive setting!</li>
            <li>I still love the toothbrush, as well as the mouth irrigator/flosser I purchased from Toilet Tree.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s every bit as good as the more expensive brands (for which I find additional brushes costly).  </li>
            <li>I so wanted to give this electric toothbrush 5 stars, because it cleans just as good if not better than the leading brand name rechargeable toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>The holder is pretty small and it doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the vanity, which is good.  </li>
            <li>Buy you one today and have fun with every brushing and have a guaranteed clean mouth every brushing!I&#x27;ve seen some electric toothbrushes go for hundreds of dollars but you can get Toiletttree&#x27;s electric toothbrush for only 49.95!</li>
            <li>The first, the toothbrush head has some kind of vent or slits on the side and when water gets in them as your brushing it makes the brush louder and you get a little spritz of water on your face.</li>
            <li>Price seemed like a good deal, given this version includes many &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; features in the other companies, such as the 30 second timer&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had braces for a few weeks now, so I needed a toothbrush that would be able to be gentle,  give a good clean, stop if I was brushing too hard, and not cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush, so I have only manual to which I can compare, but teeth feel clean, and that is the point.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve only had this a little over 1 week, I can say I am happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like these.  </li>
            <li>It gets my teeth so much cleaner then an manual toothbrush as well.</li>
            <li>but still its very convenience that it came it a travel size toothbrush as well.</li>
            <li>After talking to them, I received a replacement, which was much appreciated.</li>
            <li>and I can say it cleans your teeth really well.</li>
            <li>The T.T. Toothbrush is a real bargain and I recommended it without reservation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic, and I would never go back to a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li>I bought a Sonicare and was much happier with it.</li>
            <li>It works very well,</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much space either</li>
            <li>Very aggravating.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for developing a safer and efficient product.</li>
            <li>Really liked this toothbrush, but after a few months it stopped working.</li>
            <li>I really love the rotating round brushes as opposed to the kind that vibrates up and down.</li>
            <li>Both the main rechargeable unit and the travelling unit work very well</li>
            <li>What a great product for such a small price, plus a bonus travel brush.  </li>
            <li>So far the toothbrush seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>Overall, this toothbrush is a great deal, especially when compared to the other brand names that are 3-4x as much</li>
            <li>It ships with two different brush-heads, so my lady friend and I are able to use the same device</li>
            <li>I love the 30 second intervals because it lets me know when to move onto the next section of my teeth</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product if you care about your teeth.....</li>
            <li>I assume means it doesn&#x27;t go at as high of a speed.</li>
            <li>The only other thing that would be nice, is if the brushes came with covers and a holder.</li>
            <li>Recharging dock is compact, takes up little precious space.</li>
            <li>Also loved the small travel toothrbrush, though I wish that the head was a bit larger.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes the brush will come off right in my mouth while I&#x27;m in the middle of brushing.</li>
            <li>Worked really well the first week or so...then the motor started acting up and became considerably weaker.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so great after brushing, no more fuzzies like a regular toothbrush left.  </li>
            <li>I thought putting a new head on would fix it, but it didn&#x27;t make any difference.  </li>
            <li>and they sent me a new toothbrush with no charge.  </li>
            <li>I had a Sonicare that was still working after 10 years and just thought I would get a new machine.</li>
            <li>On top of that, the design of the toothbrush collects residue both at the top of the brush and the base, and it quickly becomes unsightly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for about 5 months and over the past month, it stops and starts more stop that start</li>
            <li>u can just use the sensitive setting!</li>
            <li>Definitely would recommend this product does exactly what is stated in description  </li>
            <li>The travel toothbrush is small and handy, but the tiny head takes forever to brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li>So if you have sensitive teeth or gums</li>
            <li>I could not find them on Amazon until I contacted Toilettree directly.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Even had occasion to use the travel one already for an unexpected overnight stay.  </li>
            <li>As part of the purchase I got a travel toothbrush that is battery powered, it has a tiny head and there really isn&#x27;t much vibration</li>
            <li>My old electric toothbrush had a bunch of nooks and crannies and grooves where toothpaste/water/spit/grime would get caught and crust up, but it&#x27;s not the case with the ToiletTree brush.</li>
            <li>Replaced an old Oral B toothbrush with this one from ToiletTree.  </li>
            <li>and then I have to restart it to complete brushing.</li>
            <li>so you can see it in action.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a while since my old electric toothbrush died.  </li>
            <li>I loved my braun and was annoyed that I had to get a different one.</li>
            <li>Previously, I took my sonicare rechargeable toothbrush when I traveled, but the T.T.  travel toothbrush is not nearly as cumbersome, it actually fits nicely in my purse.  </li>
            <li>After this very positive experience, I will look for TT items to buy over other brands.</li>
            <li>I particularly like this last feature.</li>
            <li>The other reviewers said that you need to polish each tooth with this brush and they were right</li>
            <li>brushing your teeth, the brush pauses for a moment to indicate the end of a 30-second cycle, allowing you to move from one quadrant of your mouth to the other, for a total of 2 full minutes.</li>
            <li>My teeth are starting to look and feel better after a few weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m interested in trying ToiletTree&#x27;s other products, particularly the &amp;#34;oral irrigator&amp;#34; (i.e. Waterpik) but not in the cards financially as of yet!</li>
            <li>Shortly after that, the president of the company responded (that itself is unusual) and said he would send me a replacement the next day.</li>
            <li>Much easier to clean the actual unit &amp; brush heads than my previous, more expensive toothbrush which I purchased from my dentist.  </li>
            <li>The travel unit is very practical and small enough to fit into my toilet kit.</li>
            <li>Slim and simple design, few nooks and crannies to have to clean out.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean as it states in the description and died only a few months after using it.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing toothbrush and it isn&#x27;t expensive either I&#x27;ve seen some electric toothbrushes go for hundreds of dollars</li>
            <li>when the motor was working I could see healthier, whiter teeth if only because I was brushing twice as long as I normally would.</li>
            <li>after a month we received the replacement unit, my brush stopped working too(motor wouldn&#x27;t run and it would randomly start on its own when left uncharged).</li>
            <li>I usually like to do a little more</li>

            <li> This is a great toothbrush for anyone to use.</li>
            <li> but I have tried the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; setting and it works great as well.</li>
            <li> These are great for anyone to use and now have thrown out my manual toothbrush for the ToiletTree Rechargeable Toothbrush.</li>
            <li> but I have not had to recharge yet, which is great.</li>

            <li> Great toothbrush for the price .</li>
            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush with a lot of &#x27;bang for the buck&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> (the replacement has been great).  </li>
            <li> Worked great for a couple months, but then wouldn&#x27;t keep a charge.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this toothbrush!!</li>
            <li> great toothbrush, keep up the good work...5 stars</li>
            <li> I loved it for a while, until it started pinching my cheeks and tongue.  </li>
            <li> Good value.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> I looked around on Amazon and this one had good reviews and a good price.</li>
            <li> It is a superior product in every way.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to do a good job</li>
            <li> Even the charger is attractive with the nice water ripple effect on the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I am using it and feel so good.</li>
            <li> The product was good</li>
            <li> The brush feels sturdy and has a sleek design that looks good in my bathroom.  </li>
            <li> It came quickly and is perfect.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Perfect: great price, comfortable design, and two setting that really clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> When this toothbrush arrived, we were very impressed: it was powerful and effective.</li>
            <li> i notice it gets 95% or more of the plaque off my teeth every brushing!</li>
            <li> it shuts the toothbrush off after the 2 minutes I LOVE THAT!</li>
            <li> You wont want to return it though, you will fall in love with this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Love the travel toothbrush as well!</li>
            <li> Glad I found this!</li>
            <li> I am SO GLAD I bought this set!</li>
            <li> First of all, the design is very attractive.</li>
            <li> so you can have an amazing electric toothbrush while you travel as well</li>
            <li> The free travel toothbrush is also great, it takes a AA battery, so no need to lug a charger around.  </li>
            <li> My teeth have gotten whiter and it is amazing to see the progress.  </li>
            <li> so my husband and myself can each have our own brush.</li>
            <li> It works very well and the price is excellent.  </li>
            <li> I liked the brush and ordered another for my husband.</li>
            <li> Looks nice.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it would have been nice to have included information with the unit for how to order the replacement heads for both the rechargeable &amp; battery operated traveling units.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if Braun is still making them as effective as the one I have,</li>
            <li> and he was thrilled with how my teeth are looking.</li>
            <li> , it almost forces you (in a good way) to commit to better dental</li>
            <li> It is so much better then using an manual toothbrush for sure!</li>
            <li> I was lookign for an electronic tooth brush and this one seemed to be a good fit.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot and that is super nice to have!</li>
            <li> This was a great product at first....</li>
            <li> At first I thought this item was great.</li>
            <li> I addition, the ToiletTree brush head is very, very cheaply made and ineffective compared to the options you can get with Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Must be very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Oral B, but adequate.</li>
            <li> Up until then it was fine and we liked it.  </li>
            <li> I really love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I love that it comes with a battery operated travel brush.</li>
            <li> This is really a great product at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> BTW, I used to use a Philips Sonicare for years and it costs a lot more money.</li>
            <li> It may even be better than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I used an manual toothbrush my whole life and always wanted to try an electric toothbrush, So i was so happy to give Toilettree&#x27;s electric toothbrush</li>
            <li> I also love that this electric toothbrush has an 2 minutes timer.</li>
            <li> i brush my teeth to make sure i get my two minuets in cause with the built in timer</li>
            <li> Just love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> , appear to be well made, and I am completely satisfied with the units themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were then able to provide me the information on the replacement heads for the rechargeable unit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush by ToiletTree for about 2 weeks now and am quite satisfied with the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> Feels better than Oral-B - not as aggressive, gentler and gums get massaged.  </li>
            <li> Kids love both toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I really love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure my gums will be healthy as we&#x27;ll soon.</li>
            <li> It is uglier and bulkier but a much better cleaning.  </li>
            <li> And of course you can&#x27;t return a used toothbrush :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this has to do with water entering through the split in the case.  </li>
            <li> We threw it out and bought a Braun electric toothbrush which has proven to be much more reliable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> But, I have to really hand it to ToiletTree&#x27;s great customer department for replacing the brush after I contacted them</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have an electric toothbrush available for the road.</li>
            <li> My Toilet Tree travel and rechargeable tooth brushes are wonderful.  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time and the size of the brush head is perfect for my son.  </li>
            <li> I compared a couple of electric toothbrushes before opting for this one seeing that it had pretty good reviews and customer service.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when i got an yes to review Toilettree&#x27;s rechargeable electric toothbrush!</li>
            <li> There are others available, some with more bells and whistles, but you are going to pay more for them.</li>
            <li> Originally, I rated this product with five stars, as I was impressed by how well it cleaned, and at a fraction of the cost of similar products.</li>
            <li> I love the fact this is BPA free.  </li>
            <li> Very nice toothbrush:-) glad to help an underdog with the big boys &amp; girls...</li>
            <li> Like the design, but more importantly, it does a fine job brushing the teeth.</li>
            <li> seems cool!</li>
            <li> This rechargeable brush has so much more power, is consistent, is better for the environment and my gums and teeth never felt better.  </li>
            <li> I like the handle as it is easy to grip and does not slip.  </li>
            <li> but then the brush wouldn&#x27;t work after about 2 months and it lost power easily.  </li>
            <li> I liked this toothbrush at first and gave it 5 stars</li>
            <li> The kit also came with an extra brush for your full size tooth brush cause it is good to change your brush heads after so many months!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, light and cleans my teeth quite well.</li>
            <li> The sleek &amp;#34;hourglass&amp;#34; shape makes it comfortable to hold and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> the head falls apart when you try to use it which is a huge design flaw.  </li>
            <li> Unit is light, cleans well.  </li>
            <li> The travel toothbrush is a great extra and I will be using it a lot.  </li>
            <li> Now my teeth always feel as smooth as they do after a trip to the dentist.</li>
            <li> I miss the 2 speed operation, but it does the job for a vacation place and in am happy enough with it?</li>
            <li> The light that indicated it was charging was on, but the toothbrush never started again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> think the overall performance of the toothbrush, in mint condition, is great.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> It also has a slower speed for sensitive teeth which I do not need to use yet, but it is a good option.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t lie that  I originally got lured in by the offer of a travel toothbrush with the larger sonic toothbrush, but I am SO happy with how this set is working.</li>
            <li> The two speeds are nice, and the high setting is nice and fast.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really easy to clean and keep clean.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product that will effectively clean your teeth and don&#x27;t want to pay more, you&#x27;ve come to the right</li>
            <li> Buy you one today and have fun with every brushing and have a guaranteed clean mouth every brushing!</li>
            <li> we will see if it holds up better than the first.  </li>
            <li> Have just received additional replacement brushes, still on the original brush so, will be changing brush soon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does a great job cleaning my teeth despite a strange company name.</li>
            <li> I leave it in my purse, the case keeps it clean</li>
            <li> so you know your getting your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel quite clean after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> so I have been using the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; setting to clean my teeth</li>
            <li> It makes my teeth feel so clean,</li>
            <li> I bought it for the RV, but it didn&#x27;t feel like my teeth were getting clean.</li>
            <li> teeth feel clean as when I return from the Dentist after my schedule appointment &amp; cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Will continue using it until it falter then will buy a different, more popular name brand.</li>
            <li> In no way does this clean as well (as some reviewers suggest)as the &amp;#34;top brand&amp;#34; electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews seemed positive and did not have an issue, so I ordered one for myself.</li>
            <li> It works, but it is nothing special.  </li>
            <li> The full size brush took a while to get used to, but after about a month, I could brush without my gums bleeding.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at full force even after charging it overnight).</li>
            <li> I also love the look of it on my vanity since it is very sleek.  </li>
            <li> However, the fact that it barely last 3 months, and the last month or so was fairly flakey, makes me not consider this toothbrush a good value.</li>
            <li> There is enough power to actually clean your teeth individually and the size of the brush head is perfect and doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums while brushing.</li>
            <li> the speed is fast &amp; I feel very clean after brushing.  </li>
            <li> But I LOVE this new one!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush recharges quickly.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s call it a 4.5 star rating since I did run into an issue in which the toothbrush stopped adequately powering the brush head as it should (even with replacement etc.)</li>
            <li> I especially love the sensitive mode because, well, I still have 2 baby teeth and at 34 years old and they are sensitive.</li>
            <li> I was considering another more expensive electric toothbrush from another more popular brand, but I&#x27;m so glad I came across this.</li>
            <li> The clean setting really scrubs your teeth clean</li>
            <li> brush head is easy to install and remove and I like that the kit came with an extra one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this came with a mini battery-powered travel brush, which feels just as powerful as its full-size counterpart (it too has 2 settings).</li>
            <li> The larger toothbrush has a Sensitive setting that is perfect my teeth, although the Clean setting isn&#x27;t too aggressive in general; it also shuts off automatically after 2 minutes</li>
            <li> It is nice to have the timer to remind me when to move along and to have a two minute mark for total brushing time.</li>
            <li> Either way, between the 2, it should be worth the amount I paid.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far (two weeks in), I am pleased with the experience...</li>
            <li> Am thinking of ordering the irrigator since I am so pleased with the brush so far.</li>
            <li> I say this product is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Have had this toothbrush for over six month with very positive results.</li>
            <li> The price was right, however.</li>
            <li> The size of the brush head is just right, as it seems to &amp;#34;cup&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long, but am happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li> A good value, but the lack of generic heads makes it less cost effective.</li>
            <li> The brush attachment to the handle is a much simpler design than the Braun, so is easier to clean.</li>
            <li> The travel tooth brush is pretty decent and still going strong.</li>
            <li> do enjoy  my new toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Took me a while to get used to having a motor in my mouth, but my teeth certainly feel cleaner!</li>
            <li> It worked very, very well for 4 months.</li>
            <li> This has the force of those battery operated ones that really don&#x27;t do very much.  </li>
            <li> We have never been the couple that wants to share a toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love and will never go back to an manual toothbrush ever again!</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to any one since it wouldn&#x27;t function consistently.</li>
            <li> always find it interesting when companies send a satisfaction survey after only a couple of weeks of receiving it.</li>
            <li> I first got this brush in May of 2014.</li>
            <li> Thanks ToiletTree!</li>
            <li> They sent a replacement, but sure enough, that lasted about six months as well.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I went a week without having to recharge it, using it twice a day.</li>
            <li> So fast delivery!</li>
            <li> My dentist will be pleased with the results after my next check-up.</li>
            <li> I had left my electric toothbrush at a hotel on a trip and thought that this one was so much better looking that I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> This electric toothbrush has two settings clean setting and sensitive setting!</li>
            <li> I still love the toothbrush, as well as the mouth irrigator/flosser I purchased from Toilet Tree.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s every bit as good as the more expensive brands (for which I find additional brushes costly).  </li>
            <li> I so wanted to give this electric toothbrush 5 stars, because it cleans just as good if not better than the leading brand name rechargeable toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> The holder is pretty small and it doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the vanity, which is good.  </li>
            <li> Buy you one today and have fun with every brushing and have a guaranteed clean mouth every brushing!I&#x27;ve seen some electric toothbrushes go for hundreds of dollars but you can get Toiletttree&#x27;s electric toothbrush for only 49.95!</li>
            <li> The first, the toothbrush head has some kind of vent or slits on the side and when water gets in them as your brushing it makes the brush louder and you get a little spritz of water on your face.</li>
            <li> Price seemed like a good deal, given this version includes many &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; features in the other companies, such as the 30 second timer&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had braces for a few weeks now, so I needed a toothbrush that would be able to be gentle,  give a good clean, stop if I was brushing too hard, and not cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, so I have only manual to which I can compare, but teeth feel clean, and that is the point.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve only had this a little over 1 week, I can say I am happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these.  </li>
            <li> It gets my teeth so much cleaner then an manual toothbrush as well.</li>
            <li> but still its very convenience that it came it a travel size toothbrush as well.</li>
            <li> After talking to them, I received a replacement, which was much appreciated.</li>
            <li> and I can say it cleans your teeth really well.</li>
            <li> The T.T. Toothbrush is a real bargain and I recommended it without reservation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic, and I would never go back to a manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
            <li> I bought a Sonicare and was much happier with it.</li>
            <li> It works very well,</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up much space either</li>
            <li> Very aggravating.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for developing a safer and efficient product.</li>
            <li> Really liked this toothbrush, but after a few months it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I really love the rotating round brushes as opposed to the kind that vibrates up and down.</li>
            <li> Both the main rechargeable unit and the travelling unit work very well</li>
            <li> What a great product for such a small price, plus a bonus travel brush.  </li>
            <li> So far the toothbrush seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li> Overall, this toothbrush is a great deal, especially when compared to the other brand names that are 3-4x as much</li>
            <li> It ships with two different brush-heads, so my lady friend and I are able to use the same device</li>
            <li> I love the 30 second intervals because it lets me know when to move onto the next section of my teeth</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product if you care about your teeth.....</li>
            <li> I assume means it doesn&#x27;t go at as high of a speed.</li>
            <li> The only other thing that would be nice, is if the brushes came with covers and a holder.</li>
            <li> Recharging dock is compact, takes up little precious space.</li>
            <li> Also loved the small travel toothrbrush, though I wish that the head was a bit larger.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes the brush will come off right in my mouth while I&#x27;m in the middle of brushing.</li>
            <li> Worked really well the first week or so...then the motor started acting up and became considerably weaker.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so great after brushing, no more fuzzies like a regular toothbrush left.  </li>
            <li> I thought putting a new head on would fix it, but it didn&#x27;t make any difference.  </li>
            <li> and they sent me a new toothbrush with no charge.  </li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare that was still working after 10 years and just thought I would get a new machine.</li>
            <li> On top of that, the design of the toothbrush collects residue both at the top of the brush and the base, and it quickly becomes unsightly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for about 5 months and over the past month, it stops and starts more stop that start</li>
            <li> u can just use the sensitive setting!</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend this product does exactly what is stated in description  </li>
            <li> The travel toothbrush is small and handy, but the tiny head takes forever to brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> So if you have sensitive teeth or gums</li>
            <li> I could not find them on Amazon until I contacted Toilettree directly.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Even had occasion to use the travel one already for an unexpected overnight stay.  </li>
            <li> As part of the purchase I got a travel toothbrush that is battery powered, it has a tiny head and there really isn&#x27;t much vibration</li>
            <li> My old electric toothbrush had a bunch of nooks and crannies and grooves where toothpaste/water/spit/grime would get caught and crust up, but it&#x27;s not the case with the ToiletTree brush.</li>
            <li> Replaced an old Oral B toothbrush with this one from ToiletTree.  </li>
            <li> and then I have to restart it to complete brushing.</li>
            <li> so you can see it in action.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a while since my old electric toothbrush died.  </li>
            <li> I loved my braun and was annoyed that I had to get a different one.</li>
            <li> Previously, I took my sonicare rechargeable toothbrush when I traveled, but the T.T.  travel toothbrush is not nearly as cumbersome, it actually fits nicely in my purse.  </li>
            <li> After this very positive experience, I will look for TT items to buy over other brands.</li>
            <li> I particularly like this last feature.</li>
            <li> The other reviewers said that you need to polish each tooth with this brush and they were right</li>
            <li> brushing your teeth, the brush pauses for a moment to indicate the end of a 30-second cycle, allowing you to move from one quadrant of your mouth to the other, for a total of 2 full minutes.</li>
            <li> My teeth are starting to look and feel better after a few weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m interested in trying ToiletTree&#x27;s other products, particularly the &amp;#34;oral irrigator&amp;#34; (i.e. Waterpik) but not in the cards financially as of yet!</li>
            <li> Shortly after that, the president of the company responded (that itself is unusual) and said he would send me a replacement the next day.</li>
            <li> Much easier to clean the actual unit &amp; brush heads than my previous, more expensive toothbrush which I purchased from my dentist.  </li>
            <li> The travel unit is very practical and small enough to fit into my toilet kit.</li>
            <li> Slim and simple design, few nooks and crannies to have to clean out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean as it states in the description and died only a few months after using it.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing toothbrush and it isn&#x27;t expensive either I&#x27;ve seen some electric toothbrushes go for hundreds of dollars</li>
            <li> when the motor was working I could see healthier, whiter teeth if only because I was brushing twice as long as I normally would.</li>
            <li> after a month we received the replacement unit, my brush stopped working too(motor wouldn&#x27;t run and it would randomly start on its own when left uncharged).</li>
            <li> I usually like to do a little more</li>
            <li> so you really aren&#x27;t getting much cleaning out of it, no more than an ordinary manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> so I know without a timer that I&#x27;ve brushed as long as my dentist advised.</li>
            <li> Just long enough</li>
            <li> I Purchased the Toilet Tree toothbrush after my Sonicare finally bit the dust, and decided to replace it with the Toilet tree&#x27;s far less costly teeth scrubber.</li>
            <li> Not used daily as it is in our summer home and only used on weekends or for other short periods of time.</li>
            <li> We got a new tooth brush in our mail within a few days and have no issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to comment on how long the appliance will hold up.</li>
            <li> Contacted Toilet Tree, received immediate response and offer to replace item no questions asked and no charge.</li>
            <li> Steve Parisi from Toilet Tree Products replied me at once and offered to send me a replacement.</li>
            <li> However, upon reading of my dissatisfaction with the product, the president of Toilet Tree reached out to me and replaced the unit.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only model the company offers, so I wasn&#x27;t bogged down in deciding between various models of the aforementioned companies.&lt;br /&gt;B)</li>
            <li> Since I have been using I do not know how long the toothbrush it self holds a charge</li>
            <li> This certainly is minor though</li>
            <li> For how long?</li>
            <li> so a COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> This week, less than 2 months later, the handle is starting to split down the middle, just above the power button.  </li>
            <li> In the past two years I was using a battery operated brush which needed a new battery every two weeks.</li>
            <li> I would though recommend that the designers create a flat back so that the brush could be layn down without rolling off of the counter.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I really liked it  :-(</li>
            <li> I had a sensodyne for years and finally got tired of paying the high prices for replacement toothbrushes which led me to try this brand.  </li>
            <li> overall i like this toothbrush but its a little messy-sprays some water when its on.</li>
            <li> And as someone says in a review I didn&#x27;t carefully read..</li>
            <li> The only thing that bugs me is the 30 second timers; I typically brush for a little over 2 minutes and with this brush it shuts down</li>
            <li> I can easily change the brush heads if needed by simply twisting onto the base.</li>
            <li> The customer response is also varied and is not consistent.</li>
            <li> Sometimes the button would turn the brush on and other times it wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I saw my dentist the other day</li>
            <li> First toothbrush failed after 3 months of use.</li>
            <li> every other day however never ran out of power.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
            <li> the money and the other reviews</li>
            <li> By early September (we bought the toothbrush in late May), it was dead.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that there is some saliva leakage when I do my bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> Not worth it to even try it.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t heavy and you can grip it without the worry of it slipping from your hands while in use.</li>
            <li> Also appreciate that the base is small enough to fit into a 2 compartment toothbrush holder.</li>
            <li> I previous used the Phillips Sonicare HX-6530 which broke after 15 months.</li>
            <li> Works as well as my OralB electric toothbrush and is half the price.  </li>
            <li> No quick swipes of enamel here</li>
            <li> It lasted less than 6 months before water got inside and ruined the battery.</li>
            <li> The vibration is in a lower pitch than my previous brush, which (being somewhat of an expert in electrical devices that create rapid/repetitive movement)</li>
            <li> However, performance degraded over time: initially it would stop randomly and require adjusting the head, or you would need to turn it off and back on.</li>
            <li> It really felt terrible to add so many batteries to be recycled and it often had weak power.</li>
            <li> only product suggestion is for the charger base to be redesigned to hold the second brush-head; alternately, to include some sort of hygienic plastic container to enclose it while the other person&#x27;s head is attached.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Rechargeable Toothbrush for a little over a week</li>
            <li> I have 2 little complaints about it.</li>
            <li> I like the smaller, compact base, as others had large bases.  </li>
            <li> After a few months, it started shutting itself off after about 20 seconds, then it eventually stopped working at all.</li>
            <li> just thought I could save a few bucks.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s tooth brush stopped working after a few months</li>
            <li> I chose to go ahead and buy it for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had it a few months and the thing died.  </li>
            <li> Had it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I had ordered another one for my husband and he started seeing some issues with it after a few months (brush pausing at irregular intervals instead of every 30sec).</li>
            <li> Also, after just a few uses it would sometimes not start at all</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost used to the round (as apposed to oblong) brush.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I think some might find the brush head a little too small, but I don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> poor quality, do not work for long time</li>
            <li> I like the timer and the small round brush.  </li>
            <li> Somehow this makes the 2 minutes seem less painstaking, at least for me.</li>
            <li> The design needs a serious overhaul because as it is now, it&#x27;s poorly designed and the result is a very short life.</li>
            <li> I have tried electric brushes in the past but have not been convinced on their superiority until this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money on this one!  </li>
            <li> When it did, the brush would randomly cut off in the middle of me brushing my teeth (and no, it wasn&#x27;t the built in timer.)</li>
            <li> Now it is past my window to return it.</li>
            <li> Hopefully no more problem anymore.</li>
            <li> When I have started pressing The\\&quot;on\\&quot; button, then giving to it small /no, may be medium/ shock.</li>
            <li> Before using the ToiletTree toothbrush, I was skeptical of electric toothbrushes and concerned that it would irritate my gums, but it has definitely won me over.    </li>
            <li> wife has arthritis and it is hard for her to change brush</li>
            <li> We filed a complaint online and  received a replacement unit.</li>
            <li> We complained again through their website but didn&#x27;t receive any response.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small head allows you to reach behind your wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li> and today a few days shy of 5 months...</li>
            <li> , battery has lasted for at least 6 months!</li>
            <li> I have had it for about 9 months and the motor is running so weakly</li>
            <li> Not sure what went wrong</li>
            <li> And no big clunky base to deal with.  </li>
            <li> At the moment, we are merely using a plastic Ziploc on the counter to keep it close by and</li>
            <li> That was uncomfortable and ineffective.</li>
            <li> It would keep stalling out with a mere bit of pressure against the teeth.</li>
            <li> It also started to turn itself on randomly this week.  </li>
            <li> As for the battery charged portable toothbrush, the vibration is fake.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointment!</li>
            <li> The motor stopped working in 6 months. :(</li>
            <li> It comes with the charger base that plugs into your wall and when your done brushing you just stick it on the base</li>
            <li> The base is equipped with four rubber pads on the bottom to keep the base from sliding around while placing the brush in place.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the base or the head</li>
            <li> base could use a weight.</li>
            <li> This was terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really liked this toothbrush, but after a few months it stopped working. I contacted the company and they immediately replaced it! Great customer service and product! The travel toothbrush is also a great bonus! I leave it in my purse, the case keeps it clean, battery has lasted for at least 6 months!</li>
            <li> I really love this toothbrush. I have tried electric brushes in the past but have not been convinced on their superiority until this toothbrush. It is great! It is nice to have the timer to remind me when to move along and to have a two minute mark for total brushing time. I love that it comes with a battery operated travel brush. I travel a lot and that is super nice to have! Also, I like that it comes with two different heads (with color markers) so my husband and myself can each have our own brush. We have never been the couple that wants to share a toothbrush! This is really a great product at a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> great one and I like dual voltages.</li>
            <li> This was a great product at first....I really love the rotating round brushes as opposed to the kind that vibrates up and down. The price was a deciding factor, as well as the great reviews. After a few months, it started shutting itself off after about 20 seconds, then it eventually stopped working at all. I guess I will contact the company to see what they tell me, but I don&#x27;t think I will buy this product again. Should have stuck with the better-known brands, just thought I could save a few bucks. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money on this one!  I&#x27;ve had it for about 5 months and over the past month, it stops and starts more stop that start</li>
            <li> I had a problem with a ToiletTree toothbrush not working correctly and wrote Amazon. Shortly after that, the president of the company responded (that itself is unusual) and said he would send me a replacement the next day. It came quickly and is perfect. It works very well and the price is excellent.  BTW, I used to use a Philips Sonicare for years and it costs a lot more money. It may even be better than the Sonicare. Even if there is a problem, ToiletTree deals with it.  I recommend this company and their toothbrush without reservation.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush recharges quickly. The two speeds are nice, and the high setting is nice and fast. The toothbrush has four intervals, 30 seconds apart. This lets you know where you are in the process of brushing all 4 quarters of your teeth. I particularly like this last feature.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like these.  The travel toothbrush is small and handy, but the tiny head takes forever to brush my teeth.  The full size brush took a while to get used to, but after about a month, I could brush without my gums bleeding.  I loved it for a while, until it started pinching my cheeks and tongue.  I thought putting a new head on would fix it, but it didn&#x27;t make any difference.  I tried to contact ToiletTree to ask their advice, but I never got any response to it, or my request to return it.  ****Update 6/24/15 I emailed again and got a response from the company and they sent me a new toothbrush with no charge.  It is working great...we will see if it holds up better than the first.  Either way, between the 2, it should be worth the amount I paid.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when i got an yes to review Toilettree&#x27;s rechargeable electric toothbrush! I used an manual toothbrush my whole life and always wanted to try an electric toothbrush, So i was so happy to give Toilettree&#x27;s electric toothbrush a go! I absolutely love this toothbrush!! It is so much better then using an manual toothbrush for sure! It gets my teeth so much cleaner then an manual toothbrush as well. This electric toothbrush has two settings clean setting and sensitive setting! So if you have sensitive teeth or gums u can just use the sensitive setting! The clean setting really scrubs your teeth clean i notice it gets 95% or more of the plaque off my teeth every brushing! I also love that this electric toothbrush has an 2 minutes timer. The dentist says you should brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes each brushing so now i don&#x27;t have to set a timer each time i brush my teeth to make sure i get my two minuets in cause with the built in timer it shuts the toothbrush off after the 2 minutes I LOVE THAT! It comes with the charger base that plugs into your wall and when your done brushing you just stick it on the base and it stays charged. This kit also came with an travel electric toothbrush as well so you can have an amazing electric toothbrush while you travel as well It isn&#x27;t rechargeable so you need batteries but still its very convenience that it came it a travel size toothbrush as well. The kit also came with an extra brush for your full size tooth brush cause it is good to change your brush heads after so many months! What is also so wonderful about this toothbrush is that its waterproof so you can brush your teeth in  the shower! When you buy the toothbrush it comes with an money back guaranteed so if you don&#x27;t like it you can return it! You wont want to return it though, you will fall in love with this toothbrush! I&#x27;m in love and will never go back to an manual toothbrush ever again! This is an amazing toothbrush and it isn&#x27;t expensive either I&#x27;ve seen some electric toothbrushes go for hundreds of dollars but you can get Toiletttree&#x27;s electric toothbrush for only 49.95! So what are you waiting for? Buy you one today and have fun with every brushing and have a guaranteed clean mouth every brushing!I&#x27;ve seen some electric toothbrushes go for hundreds of dollars but you can get Toiletttree&#x27;s electric toothbrush for only 49.95! So what are you waiting for? Buy you one today and have fun with every brushing and have a guaranteed clean mouth every brushing!</li>
            <li> Just love this toothbrush. The charge lasts a long time and the size of the brush head is perfect for my son.  Also appreciate that the base is small enough to fit into a 2 compartment toothbrush holder. Love the travel toothbrush as well! Great value and wonderful company!</li>
            <li> I was lookign for an electronic tooth brush and this one seemed to be a good fit. Most of the reviews seemed positive and did not have an issue, so I ordered one for myself. I liked the brush and ordered another for my husband. My husband&#x27;s tooth brush stopped working after a few months (the motor wouldn&#x27;t pause at 30s intervals and stop erratically. It didn&#x27;t work at full force even after charging it overnight). We filed a complaint online and  received a replacement unit. We thought this brush happens to be one of their defective ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just after a month we received the replacement unit, my brush stopped working too(motor wouldn&#x27;t run and it would randomly start on its own when left uncharged). We complained again through their website but didn&#x27;t receive any response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to any one since it wouldn&#x27;t function consistently. The customer response is also varied and is not consistent.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across ToiletTree while researching all of the various &amp;#34;base&amp;#34; models from Philips, Soniccare, etc. I chose to go ahead and buy it for a few reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) It&#x27;s the only model the company offers, so I wasn&#x27;t bogged down in deciding between various models of the aforementioned companies.&lt;br /&gt;B) It ships with two different brush-heads, so my lady friend and I are able to use the same device&lt;br /&gt;C) Price seemed like a good deal, given this version includes many &amp;#34;premium&amp;#34; features in the other companies, such as the 30 second timer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far (two weeks in), I am pleased with the experience...Took me a while to get used to having a motor in my mouth, but my teeth certainly feel cleaner! I have yet to try the included travel version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only product suggestion is for the charger base to be redesigned to hold the second brush-head; alternately, to include some sort of hygienic plastic container to enclose it while the other person&#x27;s head is attached. At the moment, we are merely using a plastic Ziploc on the counter to keep it close by and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m interested in trying ToiletTree&#x27;s other products, particularly the &amp;#34;oral irrigator&amp;#34; (i.e. Waterpik) but not in the cards financially as of yet!</li>
            <li> Bought in July 2014, stopped working Nov. Contacted TolietTree and they immediately issed a replacement - excellent. Replacement just stopped working this week. Seems each unit only operates for six months.</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend this product does exactly what is stated in description  Good value.  Looks nice.  hesitates every 30 secs and stops after 2 minutes so you know your getting your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, light and cleans my teeth quite well. I have used the larger unit for one week and the travel unit for four days.  The travel unit is very practical and small enough to fit into my toilet kit. I previous used the Phillips Sonicare HX-6530 which broke after 15 months.</li>
            <li> Both the main rechargeable unit and the travelling unit work very well, appear to be well made, and I am completely satisfied with the units themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it would have been nice to have included information with the unit for how to order the replacement heads for both the rechargeable &amp; battery operated traveling units.  I could not find them on Amazon until I contacted Toilettree directly.  They were then able to provide me the information on the replacement heads for the rechargeable unit.  I am still awaiting the same information for the travelling unit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush by ToiletTree for about 2 weeks now and am quite satisfied with the quality of this product. There are others available, some with more bells and whistles, but you are going to pay more for them. If you are looking for a product that will effectively clean your teeth and don&#x27;t want to pay more, you&#x27;ve come to the right place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always find it interesting when companies send a satisfaction survey after only a couple of weeks of receiving it. I would challenge ToiletTree Products to ask for a follow up review perhaps in 6 months.</li>
            <li> I first got this brush in May of 2014. It worked very, very well for 4 months. Then the problems began. Sometimes the button would turn the brush on and other times it wouldn&#x27;t. When it did, the brush would randomly cut off in the middle of me brushing my teeth (and no, it wasn&#x27;t the built in timer.) I contacted the company and got a prompt and helpful response from ToiletTree. After talking to them, I received a replacement, which was much appreciated. Three months later in December 2014 the power in the replacement brush began to dissipate with each use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of curiosity, I opened up both tooth brushes and the motors and contacts are rusted in both. Obviously, water had gotten inside of the enclosure of both brushes. The design needs a serious overhaul because as it is now, it&#x27;s poorly designed and the result is a very short life.</li>
            <li> Had it a few months and the thing died.  Can&#x27;t change out the battery - so I threw it out.</li>
            <li> Feels better than Oral-B - not as aggressive, gentler and gums get massaged.  The free travel toothbrush is also great, it takes a AA battery, so no need to lug a charger around.  Kids love both toothbrushes.  Thanks ToiletTree!</li>
            <li> What a great product for such a small price, plus a bonus travel brush.  And no big clunky base to deal with.  I know what everyone on my list is getting for Christmas this year.</li>
            <li> Great!  30 second intervals get on my nerves though.</li>
            <li> Glad I found this! It&#x27;s every bit as good as the more expensive brands (for which I find additional brushes costly).  Like the design, but more importantly, it does a fine job brushing the teeth. Thank you ToiletTree Products!</li>
            <li> Item was just as described. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> enjoyment of toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;I do enjoy  my new toothbrush.  My teeth feel quite clean after brushing.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that there is some saliva leakage when I do my bottom teeth. I have used electric toothbrushes  for several years without this problem. Can you give me a suggestion?  I DO NOT WANT TO GO BACK TO A MANUAL TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush for anyone to use. I have been using the Rechargeable Toothbrush for a little over a week and I can say it cleans your teeth really well. I have sensitive teeth so I have been using the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; setting to clean my teeth but I have tried the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; setting and it works great as well. There is enough power to actually clean your teeth individually and the size of the brush head is perfect and doesn&#x27;t hurt your gums while brushing. It isn&#x27;t heavy and you can grip it without the worry of it slipping from your hands while in use. I can easily change the brush heads if needed by simply twisting onto the base. The base is equipped with four rubber pads on the bottom to keep the base from sliding around while placing the brush in place. I love the 30 second intervals because it lets me know when to move onto the next section of my teeth so each section has the same amount of time while brushing the entire 2 minutes.  These are great for anyone to use and now have thrown out my manual toothbrush for the ToiletTree Rechargeable Toothbrush. Since I have been using I do not know how long the toothbrush it self holds a charge but I have not had to recharge yet, which is great.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Oral B, but adequate. Not used daily as it is in our summer home and only used on weekends or for other short periods of time.</li>
            <li> Originally, I rated this product with five stars, as I was impressed by how well it cleaned, and at a fraction of the cost of similar products. However, six months later, the battery died on me. They sent a replacement, but sure enough, that lasted about six months as well. On top of that, the design of the toothbrush collects residue both at the top of the brush and the base, and it quickly becomes unsightly. I&#x27;m happier with the Oral B brushes I just bought at Costco (two for $45 total), and they don&#x27;t have the residue issue. Hopefully they&#x27;ll last longer than six months . . .</li>
            <li> I got this because my braun ran out. I loved my braun and was annoyed that I had to get a different one. But I LOVE this new one! I&#x27;m going to get second one just for our cabin in the woods.</li>
            <li> Works well. Good product.</li>
            <li> so far so good. wife has arthritis and it is hard for her to change brush</li>
            <li> Works as well as my OralB electric toothbrush and is half the price.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to comment on how long the appliance will hold up.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long, but am happy with it so far.  Even had occasion to use the travel one already for an unexpected overnight stay.  Am thinking of ordering the irrigator since I am so pleased with the brush so far.</li>
            <li> My Toilet Tree travel and rechargeable tooth brushes are wonderful.  Previously, I took my sonicare rechargeable toothbrush when I traveled, but the T.T.  travel toothbrush is not nearly as cumbersome, it actually fits nicely in my purse.  The T.T. Toothbrush is a real bargain and I recommended it without reservation.</li>
            <li> It works, but it is nothing special.  When it stops, it stops.  I&#x27;d rather that it tell me with a pause that the two minutes are up.  I&#x27;m used to brushing for 2 minutes and don&#x27;t like the sudden stop.  The price was right, however.</li>
            <li> The quality is very good considering the price. It&#x27;s very good product, and it arrived on time ( with amazon prime though).</li>
            <li> Slim and simple design, few nooks and crannies to have to clean out. Recharging dock is compact, takes up little precious space. This is my first electric toothbrush, so I have only manual to which I can compare, but teeth feel clean, and that is the point. I like that the vibration pauses to let you know to change quadrants.  The company responded to my e-mail, and prompted this review, so I am assuming they are conscientious.    UPDATE: 11/14  I had a problem with toothbrush losing power, not holding a charge. Contacted Toilet Tree, received immediate response and offer to replace item no questions asked and no charge. This company is tops at customer service. I still love the toothbrush, as well as the mouth irrigator/flosser I purchased from Toilet Tree. After this very positive experience, I will look for TT items to buy over other brands.</li>
            <li> I had a Sonicare that was still working after 10 years and just thought I would get a new machine. I looked around on Amazon and this one had good reviews and a good price. The timer feature started malfunctioning after month 4 and I had to start fiddling to get it to work and today a few days shy of 5 months... the thing won&#x27;t start at all. Tried recharging/de-charging, etc... nuttin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> broke after a couple of months. Disappointment!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same Braun for about a decade on the same rechargeable battery..  It&#x27;s fantastic, and I would never go back to a manual toothbrush.  I bought this ToiletTree model to keep at another home and the battery conked out within months.  I addition, the ToiletTree brush head is very, very cheaply made and ineffective compared to the options you can get with Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if Braun is still making them as effective as the one I have, but I advise against buying this ToiletTree product.</li>
            <li> I chose a rating of 5 for this product because of the combination of quality and value.  It makes my teeth feel so clean, like I just came back from the dentist.  I had a sensodyne for years and finally got tired of paying the high prices for replacement toothbrushes which led me to try this brand.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It is a superior product in every way.  The other reviewers said that you need to polish each tooth with this brush and they were right, that is the way you get the best benefit.</li>
            <li> So far the toothbrush seems to work pretty well. I have 2 little complaints about it. The first, the toothbrush head has some kind of vent or slits on the side and when water gets in them as your brushing it makes the brush louder and you get a little spritz of water on your face. As part of the purchase I got a travel toothbrush that is battery powered, it has a tiny head and there really isn&#x27;t much vibration so you really aren&#x27;t getting much cleaning out of it, no more than an ordinary manual toothbrush. Had it for a few weeks and it seems to do a good job, I&#x27;ll have to see its longevity as I replaced an oral B pulsonic with this after only 8 months.</li>
            <li> One of the brushheads broke after 3 months of use. The motor stopped working in 6 months. :(</li>
            <li> overall i like this toothbrush but its a little messy-sprays some water when its on.</li>
            <li> I have had it for about 9 months and the motor is running so weakly it stops numerous times during a brushing.</li>
            <li> I am SO GLAD I bought this set! I have had braces for a few weeks now, so I needed a toothbrush that would be able to be gentle,  give a good clean, stop if I was brushing too hard, and not cost an arm and a leg. I found ALL of that with this toothbrush set. The larger toothbrush has a Sensitive setting that is perfect my teeth, although the Clean setting isn&#x27;t too aggressive in general; it also shuts off automatically after 2 minutes so I know without a timer that I&#x27;ve brushed as long as my dentist advised. The smaller travel brush also has two settings, and is sleek and utlra-portable; I throw it in my purse and it takes up barely any room, almost like an overly long lipstick tube. I won&#x27;t lie that  I originally got lured in by the offer of a travel toothbrush with the larger sonic toothbrush, but I am SO happy with how this set is working. I saw my dentist the other day and he was thrilled with how my teeth are looking. I will definitely be sticking with this company and this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I really love this toothbrush. First of all, the design is very attractive. The sleek &amp;#34;hourglass&amp;#34; shape makes it comfortable to hold and easy to maneuver. It&#x27;s also really easy to clean and keep clean. My old electric toothbrush had a bunch of nooks and crannies and grooves where toothpaste/water/spit/grime would get caught and crust up, but it&#x27;s not the case with the ToiletTree brush. I appreciate that it&#x27;s waterproof too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has two settings, &amp;#34;Clean&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Sensitive&amp;#34; and the words glow on a light-up interface. The first time I used it, I went a week without having to recharge it, using it twice a day. Even the charger is attractive with the nice water ripple effect on the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When brushing your teeth, the brush pauses for a moment to indicate the end of a 30-second cycle, allowing you to move from one quadrant of your mouth to the other, for a total of 2 full minutes. Somehow this makes the 2 minutes seem less painstaking, at least for me. The size of the brush head is just right, as it seems to &amp;#34;cup&amp;#34; each tooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is easy to install and remove and I like that the kit came with an extra one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that this came with a mini battery-powered travel brush, which feels just as powerful as its full-size counterpart (it too has 2 settings). I think some might find the brush head a little too small, but I don&#x27;t mind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, an excellent quality electric toothbrush. It was 40 bucks at my time of purchase. I was considering another more expensive electric toothbrush from another more popular brand, but I&#x27;m so glad I came across this. My teeth are starting to look and feel better after a few weeks of daily use. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great brush for good price!</li>
            <li> Worked really well the first week or so...then the motor started acting up and became considerably weaker. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the base or the head that&#x27;s the root of the problem, but this is almost a really great toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer function is great...when the motor was working I could see healthier, whiter teeth if only because I was brushing twice as long as I normally would. No quick swipes of enamel here, it almost forces you (in a good way) to commit to better dental health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again though, I just wish the motor was stronger...</li>
            <li> works great. base could use a weight. great value.   I also bought their water pick (Rechargeable Oral Irrigator ) that works great!! also</li>
            <li> Die in 3 months!!  At first I thought this item was great. It comes with a travel pack. seems cool! However, I brushed my teeth this morning, and it STOP working!! (I have just charged last night), That lasted about 3 months!! Now it is past my window to return it. Stay away from ToiletTree Products!!      UPDATE!!  Steve Parisi from Toilet Tree Products replied me at once and offered to send me a replacement. I&#x27;ve received the toothbrush yesterday. So fast delivery! I was impressed with his excellent customer service. Now I am using it and feel so good. Hopefully no more problem anymore.</li>
            <li> First toothbrush failed after 3 months of use. Amazon&#x27;s return policy allows for a one month return window. However, upon reading of my dissatisfaction with the product, the president of Toilet Tree reached out to me and replaced the unit.  Great customer service.</li>
            <li> Excellent all around, and how it works!  Wonderful construction, and handling while brushing.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I compared a couple of electric toothbrushes before opting for this one seeing that it had pretty good reviews and customer service. The product was good and I had no issues with it. I had ordered another one for my husband and he started seeing some issues with it after a few months (brush pausing at irregular intervals instead of every 30sec). I sent an email through their website and I got a response immediately saying that they were sorry about the defective piece and would gladly replace it. We got a new tooth brush in our mail within a few days and have no issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really happy with the product and the customer service!</li>
            <li> Perfect: great price, comfortable design, and two setting that really clean your teeth.</li>
            <li> poor quality, do not work for long time</li>
            <li> Unit is light, cleans well.  I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> If this product could be given 10 stars I would definitely do it. I wish I had this  tooth brush years ago (I&#x27;m 64). My son bought one and raved about it. In the past two years I was using a battery operated brush which needed a new battery every two weeks. It really felt terrible to add so many batteries to be recycled and it often had weak power. This rechargeable brush has so much more power, is consistent, is better for the environment and my gums and teeth never felt better.  I also love the look of it on my vanity since it is very sleek.  I will definitely reccommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product. I bought it for the RV, but it didn&#x27;t feel like my teeth were getting clean. Also, after just a few uses it would sometimes not start at all and I had to try to use to manually. That was uncomfortable and ineffective. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It lasted less than 6 months before water got inside and ruined the battery. The travel tooth brush is pretty decent and still going strong.</li>
            <li> Have had this toothbrush for over six month with very positive results. Have just received additional replacement brushes, still on the original brush so, will be changing brush soon.&lt;br /&gt;My teeth feel clean as when I return from the Dentist after my schedule appointment &amp; cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;I do charge this brush every other day however never ran out of power.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Replaced an old Oral B toothbrush with this one from ToiletTree.  I like the handle as it is easy to grip and does not slip.  The travel toothbrush is a great extra and I will be using it a lot.  As I&#x27;ve only had this a little over 1 week, I can say I am happy with it.  The only thing that bugs me is the 30 second timers; I typically brush for a little over 2 minutes and with this brush it shuts down and then I have to restart it to complete brushing. Is this a big deal?  Not really.&lt;br /&gt;For the money and the other reviews I say this product is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> A good value, but the lack of generic heads makes it less cost effective. Will continue using it until it falter then will buy a different, more popular name brand.</li>
            <li> I liked this toothbrush at first and gave it 5 stars but then the brush wouldn&#x27;t work after about 2 months and it lost power easily.  I bought a Sonicare and was much happier with it. I do not recommend this toothbrush</li>
            <li> Excellent product, perfect for oral care,excellent travel accessory . I would highly recommend this product if you care about your teeth.....</li>
            <li> I like the smaller, compact base, as others had large bases.  It works very well, the speed is fast &amp; I feel very clean after brushing.  It also has a slower speed for sensitive teeth which I do not need to use yet, but it is a good option.  I like the timer whichs reminds you to brush same amount of time in each quarter of mouth.  The only thing is, I wish it did not turn off when 2 minutes is up.  I usually like to do a little more &amp; I have to turn it back.  This certainly is minor though</li>
            <li> I so wanted to give this electric toothbrush 5 stars, because it cleans just as good if not better than the leading brand name rechargeable toothbrushes. I had to deduct a star, because the brush will not stay locked in place on the handle. Sometimes the brush will come off right in my mouth while I&#x27;m in the middle of brushing. If there is a remedy for this, I hope the manufacturer can offer it up. The only other thing that would be nice, is if the brushes came with covers and a holder.</li>
            <li> Worked for 8 months. Don&#x27;t buy it.  I have revived it. When I have started pressing The\\&quot;on\\&quot; button, then giving to it small /no, may be medium/ shock. suddenly the toothbrush have started working. So I&#x27;m giving two stars back. For how long? Have no idea.</li>
            <li> this product worked great for about 4 months and then it stopped.  Just long enough so I cannot return it from Amazon and emailing the company got me no where.  I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Used this toothbrush 2 or 3 times before it broke</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:3947ce437dd99000a070a8044a79c861]]I&#x27;m very happy with this toothbrush. I use it twice a day and it definitely gets my teeth cleaner than a standard toothbrush. Now my teeth always feel as smooth as they do after a trip to the dentist. The brush feels sturdy and has a sleek design that looks good in my bathroom.  Before using the ToiletTree toothbrush, I was skeptical of electric toothbrushes and concerned that it would irritate my gums, but it has definitely won me over.    If you&#x27;re considering this toothbrush, here&#x27;s a short video so you can see it in action.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a while since my old electric toothbrush died.  I wanted another but didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot for it.  I stumbled across this toothbrush and it had excellent reviews.  I can see why!  My teeth feel so great after brushing, no more fuzzies like a regular toothbrush left.  I especially love the sensitive mode because, well, I still have 2 baby teeth and at 34 years old and they are sensitive. I am so glad I found this tooth brush.  Now I just need to find the replacement heads so my kids can use it as well.  My husband notices a difference too.  It doesn&#x27;t take up much space either and I didn&#x27;t have any to spare anyway.  It really is a terrific brush!</li>
            <li> My teeth have gotten whiter and it is amazing to see the progress.  I&#x27;m sure my gums will be healthy as we&#x27;ll soon. Great product!</li>
            <li> I Purchased the Toilet Tree toothbrush after my Sonicare finally bit the dust, and decided to replace it with the Toilet tree&#x27;s far less costly teeth scrubber. It works fine. The vibration is in a lower pitch than my previous brush, which (being somewhat of an expert in electrical devices that create rapid/repetitive movement) I assume means it doesn&#x27;t go at as high of a speed. Seems to get the job done. I&#x27;m almost used to the round (as apposed to oblong) brush. The brush attachment to the handle is a much simpler design than the Braun, so is easier to clean. I would though recommend that the designers create a flat back so that the brush could be layn down without rolling off of the counter.</li>
            <li> Died after 4 months.  It would keep stalling out with a mere bit of pressure against the teeth. OR even without any pressure it would just stop. Had to push start button again. Very aggravating.  Up until then it was fine and we liked it.  then became aggravating and ditched it for a Phillips Sonicare.  Not worth it to even try it. Must be very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I love the fact this is BPA free.  It was the selling point for me.  (Hope you are changing the packaging to include that info!).  I like the timer and the small round brush.  It is perfect for me.  Thanks for developing a safer and efficient product.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush! Cleans my teeth so well and the timer function is great.  Also loved the small travel toothrbrush, though I wish that the head was a bit larger.  Overall, this toothbrush is a great deal, especially when compared to the other brand names that are 3-4x as much</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  My dentist will be pleased with the results after my next check-up.</li>
            <li> In no way does this clean as well (as some reviewers suggest)as the &amp;#34;top brand&amp;#34; electric toothbrush.And as someone says in a review I didn&#x27;t carefully read..the head falls apart when you try to use it which is a huge design flaw.  THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY.  I had left my electric toothbrush at a hotel on a trip and thought that this one was so much better looking that I would give it a try.  I have now gone back and replaced the Oral B.  It is uglier and bulkier but a much better cleaning.  This has the force of those battery operated ones that really don&#x27;t do very much.  And of course you can&#x27;t return a used toothbrush :)  so a COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this toothbrush.  Much easier to clean the actual unit &amp; brush heads than my previous, more expensive toothbrush which I purchased from my dentist.  Does a great job cleaning my teeth.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush for the price .</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase. Does a great job cleaning my teeth despite a strange company name.</li>
            <li> Bought this on August 14, but didn&#x27;t start using until August 20.  This week, less than 2 months later, the handle is starting to split down the middle, just above the power button.  It also started to turn itself on randomly this week.  And, at one point, it wouldn&#x27;t turn on.  I&#x27;m sure this has to do with water entering through the split in the case.  Otherwise, I really liked it  :-(</li>
            <li> The electeric toothbrush stopped working after only 2 months.  Not sure what went wrong but it stopped charging.  We threw it out and bought a Braun electric toothbrush which has proven to be much more reliable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the toothbrush.  The holder is pretty small and it doesn&#x27;t take up much space on the vanity, which is good.  I am used to a toothbrush with 2 speeds and this is a one speed.  I miss the 2 speed operation, but it does the job for a vacation place and in am happy enough with it?</li>
            <li> Very nice toothbrush:-) glad to help an underdog with the big boys &amp; girls...great toothbrush, keep up the good work...5 stars</li>
            <li> I bought one and tried it out and now have bought another. Excellent product. The small head allows you to reach behind your wisdom teeth.</li>
            <li> This was terrible. It doesn&#x27;t clean as it states in the description and died only a few months after using it. It does not work at all now. As for the battery charged portable toothbrush, the vibration is fake. It vibrates from the inside but the brush bristles do not move at all. I can&#x27;t get either of them to work anymore. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothbrush for a week and I LOVE it.  It feels as close to a dentist&#x27;s cleaning as I&#x27;ve ever had from a toothbrush at home.</li>
            <li> This is a great electric toothbrush with a lot of &#x27;bang for the buck&#x27;.  Let&#x27;s call it a 4.5 star rating since I did run into an issue in which the toothbrush stopped adequately powering the brush head as it should (even with replacement etc.) after around 3 months.  But, I have to really hand it to ToiletTree&#x27;s great customer department for replacing the brush after I contacted them (the replacement has been great).  Although it&#x27;s not quite as powerful, the secondary battery-powered travel toothbrush is also a big added value in the package.  It&#x27;s nice to have an electric toothbrush available for the road.</li>
            <li> When this toothbrush arrived, we were very impressed: it was powerful and effective. However, performance degraded over time: initially it would stop randomly and require adjusting the head, or you would need to turn it off and back on. By early September (we bought the toothbrush in late May), it was dead. The light that indicated it was charging was on, but the toothbrush never started again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the overall performance of the toothbrush, in mint condition, is great. However, the fact that it barely last 3 months, and the last month or so was fairly flakey, makes me not consider this toothbrush a good value.</li>
            <li> Worked great for a couple months, but then wouldn&#x27;t keep a charge.  Now it won&#x27;t even work at all!</li>
