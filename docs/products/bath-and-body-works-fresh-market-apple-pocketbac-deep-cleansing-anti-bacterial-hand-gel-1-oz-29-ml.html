            <li> I bought this from a Bath and Body Works store and it has a very nice scent.  It is not my favourite scent, but it is fresh and pleasant. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Great Smells, but BBW dont&#x27; make those apple anymore!  I don&#x27;t know why</li>
            <li> I love the smell it leaves my hands, I use it all the time, wherever I go, is very practical</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product because it met my expectations, I liked the flavor and presentation of it ..! Would you purchase ....</li>
            <li> I got a few of these for the holidays as stocking stuffers, especially because we&#x27;re always on the go or going to the gym. Great to keep in your car &amp; it smells fresh - even for guys.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost 5 dollars for a little 1.5inch bottle! Only enough for like 6 or 9 uses. I thought it would be much bigger!</li>
            <li> Great smell and long lasting............&lt;br /&gt;I put it on and the beautiful smell lasts a good hr..&lt;br /&gt;Very gentle on your hands . Love it .......</li>
            <li> I orded two of these and expected them to be a normal size for hand soap. They came together in an evelope which puzzeled me until I opened it. I was horribly disappointed when I saw they were each about two applications. When I visit my daughters, we are able to go to the Bath &amp; Body works store where I purchase several containers of their wonderful scented soaps. It had not occured to me that their online items would be a complete rip-off. I will never order their products online again and may not even purchase them at the mall.</li>
