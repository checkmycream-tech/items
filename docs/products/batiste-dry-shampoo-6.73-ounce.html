            <li>cherry scene is pleasant and a nice added touch.</li>
            <li>Exceptionally smelly and flammable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that it is lightly scented and is fruity.  </li>
            <li>By the afternoon my hair starts to look kind of greasy again</li>
            <li>Smells nice, isn&#x27;t sticky or powdery, I don&#x27;t know what else you could ask for.</li>
            <li>: Cleans with effectively.</li>
            <li>but it still smells nice.</li>
            <li>I was so thrilled with it</li>
            <li>Suave used to leave it feeling kind of tangled, but I thought that was the price I&#x27;d have to pay.  </li>
            <li>The smell is nice.  </li>
            <li>This products works really, really well and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>With this I dont have that problem and it has a nice scent.</li>

            <li>The cherry scent is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>it smells great, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strong AND persistent - you have been warned.</li>
            <li>Smells great and works pretty well!</li>
            <li>and I like it better than the others, although Blush is nice as well.</li>
            <li>This stuff tackles the oilyness, gives my hair volume, but the best part is that it leaves my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li>works great and soaks up oily hair and makes it look freshly washed.</li>
            <li>The smell is also nice and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>This one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>It just gives your roots and follicles a nice refreshing lift and oil absorption.  </li>
            <li>And I feel the cherry scent suits my red hair perfectly, what could be better!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love - consider me a lifer!</li>
            <li>the smell is fresh and very nice</li>
            <li>Works great as well a little spray qas perfect</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like HE Color me Happy shampoo.</li>
            <li>Smells like bright, sweet citrus.</li>
            <li>so I cannot say how great it works on day 2-3 but one day I will be brave enough to try I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>Has a great scent and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>I have very smooth hair, and braids</li>
            <li>the best dry shampoo I have ever used:) I will buy this again!</li>
            <li>Scent is nice but too strong.</li>
            <li>they hold true :) the smell is pleasant and i was in awwee at how clean my hair looks and the added volume is a plus!</li>
            <li>Love the scent as well</li>
            <li>Nice light scent.</li>
            <li>Lovely &amp; refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herbal</li>
            <li>Why is that any product I love like shoes, lipstick, perfume, vitamin supplement, etc.</li>
            <li>Why is that any product I love like shoes, lipstick, perfume, vitamin supplement, etc.</li>
            <li>and I love the Cherry smell.</li>
            <li>I have not gone more than 1 day without washing my hair</li>
            <li>and I love the cherry bottle...</li>
            <li>I will say the scent isn&#x27;t as pleasing as Tresemme, but that&#x27;s probably why theirs didn&#x27;t do it for me; they focused more on scent than on function.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes hair oil free all day!</li>
            <li>the alcohol in it just helps me style my hair better.  </li>
            <li>The cherry scent is my favorite...</li>
            <li>This is understandable since the primary ingredients are propane and butane gas!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a better product in this category:</li>
            <li>Gives my oily hair one more day of wear.</li>
            <li>I used to get along ok with suave...</li>
            <li>It did the job on oilyness and gave an ok</li>
            <li>Well anyway, I love using this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I have already ordered more.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>This smell is ok.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did...</li>
            <li>It does a better job of adding volume to my hair than does</li>
            <li>If you need your hair to look gray then you should buy this product :)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This one does not do that if you hold the can the appropriate distance from your scalp, while spraying.</li>
            <li>Does its job in taking the oil out of my roots to get me through one more day without a shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The scent was okay</li>
            <li>okay, but a smoky cherry.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This one is the latter, but does great things for volume as well!</li>
            <li>The floral one is better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Smells so much better than the Original!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay girls.</li>
            <li>I really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>In addition, I don&#x27;t find the formula to make my hair any better than baby powder.  </li>
            <li>So anyway, I was worried that the cherry smell would be overwhelming or that I would smell like chapstick all day.  </li>
            <li>(my hair is baby-fine and somewhat oily), and I love the silky texture it gives my hair.  </li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>And its cheap!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This will be my go-to from now on. :)</li>
            <li>so I feel OK about using this on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>Also, if I go camping or somewhere where the showers are dodgy, I make sure I have this with me.</li>
            <li>It works alright, though I think the Tresseme I used to buy worked just a bit better.</li>
            <li>so the braid stays in better.  </li>
            <li>If I was blonde it would be perfect for boosting volume, but I&#x27;m brunette</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the product and will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>but baby powder gives me wicked static cling.  </li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t my favorite option..</li>
            <li>this is better.  </li>
            <li>I love the cherry smell and</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried tropical and like this one better.</li>
            <li>I think it does a really good job of soaking up the oil, and making my hair look fresh -</li>
            <li>In fact I just&lt;br /&gt;ordered 3 more.  </li>
            <li>The cherry one is my favorite smell.</li>
            <li>Make sure you shake the can well before use to resuspend the powder and pump up the aerosol.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>admit it works better when I straighten my hair out than when I let it do its wavy thing.</li>
            <li>Maybe the one for brunettes is a better choice for me.</li>
            <li>then you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the best way to use it is to spray it into the roots right away when I get up, and then let it sit while I&#x27;m getting ready.</li>
            <li>It smells nice all day and it keeps my hair looking clean and not oily.</li>
            <li>It also is excellent for adding a little bit of texture, and my hair has never looked better for longer in between washes!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the special ingredient is in this stuff, but it leaves my hair feeling so nice.  </li>
            <li>In all my time working in the beauty industry i have never found a more perfect dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>The smell was a true rose oil scent.</li>
            <li>This item works pretty good.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t weighed down, smelled good, and my hair looked good!  </li>
            <li>It smells great and gives my hair texture and a new feel.  </li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo.</li>

            <li>I love this one because it really seems to absorb all the oil, and the spray is very strong which, in my opinion, seems to make the produce distribute more evenly.</li>
            <li>This is one of the best of the cheap dry shampoos!</li>
            <li>Good as new!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Hair becomes silky and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>Very quick shipping.</li>
            <li>The cherry scent is very mild, I almost can&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li>Even if it does, it&#x27;s easily dissapated by brushing thoroughly through hair.</li>
            <li>easy to use.</li>
            <li>I like that it doesnt smell too strong..</li>
            <li>I would avoid the tropical one though, it is really strong.</li>
            <li>When you spray the smell is so strong it takes your breath away.</li>
            <li>Even if I take a shower every day, my hair starts to get greasy mid-afternoon, so dry shampoo is perfect for a touch-up when a full shower isn&#x27;t a possibility.</li>
            <li>First of all it (cherry flavor) smells super good.</li>
            <li>The cherry scent is so refreshing and sweet</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling soft and fresh and smells good!</li>
            <li>I can go five days without washing my hair and it still looks awesome worn down and</li>
            <li>: they&#x27;re fine, they do their jobs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Two, I have fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve taken to just shaking my hair out with my fingers, and that works just fine.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super cheap too!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t rub it in or brush out my hair until I&#x27;m ready to go, and that makes the volume much, much better!</li>
            <li>A couple of light sprays and my hair is good as new without looking like I skipped a day washing my hair.</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend this produce of this certain smell and most importantly, it works!</li>
            <li>This spray gives it a little texture to hold it in place and look perfectly undone!</li>
            <li>but it works pretty well and makes my hair look nice and clean.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s also important to you.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great if you are running short on time and didn&#x27;t get to jump in the shower.  </li>
            <li>The cherry scent is surprisingly light</li>
            <li>Some relevant information - I work two jobs.</li>
            <li>Such as great product for the price.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on my hair after using this product than when I freshly wash and style.</li>
            <li>My hair is light brown with highlights</li>
            <li>The price is OK though, and to me it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>A couple more bucks than Suave, but so worth it.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried pssst brand, and a few others and batiste is the best.</li>
            <li>Great for extra volume and root lifting!</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t really enjoy the smell</li>
            <li>It also really seems to put a nice refresh on my hair on the days that I do not wash it.  </li>
            <li>Smells fantastic</li>
            <li>more like super sweet body spray which i didn&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean and volumized and I love the smell, which is a fresh sort of cherry and and floral blend.</li>
            <li>A top review said this was a great product and worked well on her dark hair without dulling the color.</li>
            <li>Maybe this particular issue is not the product’s fault but my own head.</li>
            <li>Maybe this particular issue is not the product’s fault but my own head.</li>
            <li>It absorbs oil without giving my hair a gross feeling, and the scent is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like most Garnier Fructis products; like tropical fruits &amp; citrus.</li>
            <li>I can already tell this is going to be a monthly purchase for me - absolutely worth the price!</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t enjoy the overly sweet smell.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find the brand I was originally looking for, but after reading the reviews I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth ordering!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Love how it smells and it seems to clean my hair pretty well.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair looking clean and adds body on days I don&#x27;t have time to wash it.</li>
            <li>you scalp clean.</li>
            <li>Happy dry shampoo:</li>
            <li>This brand&#x27;s dry shampoo is great, but I did not like the Cherry smell.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is great.</li>
            <li>Hair looks clean and shiny, not dulling at all.</li>
            <li>Absolute best dry shampoo around!!</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair, and after massaging this in a little bit, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or chalky appearance, and it creates some good volume too!</li>
            <li>I love love love this brand of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love love love this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>(And yes used the product right!)</li>
            <li>My hair feels clean after using it and I never need to reapply it throughout the day since it does such a good job.</li>
            <li>My favorite dry shampoo &amp; I love this scent!</li>
            <li>I have bright red hair</li>
            <li>The smell is overbearing and sickly sweet, and the bathroom reeks of it afterwards.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is that of sweet roses.</li>
            <li>The smell is a syrupy sweet mango/vanilla concoction.</li>
            <li>One thing I noticed immediately was that it dispensed a white powder, which is a good sign because I know it&#x27;ll soak up the greasiness.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, and my entire family is p-i-c-k-y.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really all I need most days.</li>
            <li>/smell good without actually washing it.</li>
            <li>just a simple spray, rub your fingers through your hair, and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li>thanks :)</li>
            <li>I like the smell, sweet and fresh and light.</li>
            <li>The smell is good at first, but to me it gets old quickly.</li>
            <li>This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>But still by far one of the best dry shampoos I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>This dry shampoo is amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this one is a great value.</li>
            <li>and it soaks up all the oil in your hair leaving it looking fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It all brushes out though and leaves my hair looking fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li>All of the Batiste dry shampoos work great, but this scent is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>ALWAYS gets discontinued quickly?</li>
            <li>ALWAYS gets discontinued quickly?</li>
            <li>After spraying, a quick brushing helps blend it in.</li>
            <li>This stuff allows me to get away with just a quick pirate wash and not look or smell like a hipster.</li>
            <li>The product came quickly and well packaged</li>
            <li>a quick shuffle through my hair with my fingers disperses the powder just fine&lt;</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t enjoy the smell very much.</li>
            <li>i have dark brown hair and it works great.</li>
            <li>Absorbs the oil well as long as you dump a fair amount of the product into your hair.</li>
            <li>This product doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel heavy and has a great clean smell to it.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, leaves my hair with a nice texture that allows me to add some lift and body without leaving it wet looking and flat.  </li>
            <li>I no longer feel the need to search for a good dry shampoo...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a good dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoos on the market but none work as good as Batiste&#x27;s line.  </li>
            <li>works well especially with my long curly hair.. smells great!</li>
            <li>My hair has body for the first time, ever!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried this scent and the tropical and love them both!</li>
            <li>I first bought the Original scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful but not overbearing and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried probably a dozen different brands of dry shampoo, and this is the best.</li>
            <li>leading to more shampooing.. and more heat damage (I blow dry and straighten).  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many different dry shampoos and this is by far the best product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t really smell like cherries but it does have a light floral fruity scent.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair an extra day or two without washing (though I almost always have my hair in a ponytail), but it&#x27;s not some amazing product that makes it look or feel freshly-washed.</li>
            <li>and my hair looks and smells good enough that I can get away with brushing my hair out really well and putting in a headband.</li>
            <li>I was even in hospital for 5 days and everyone marveled at how fresh my hair looked.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell and helpfull to give my hair a rest from daily shampoo.</li>
            <li>And my hair feels freshly washed every time I use it.</li>
            <li>Another said my hair looked as if I had just had a fresh blow-out!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s nice for girls who can go 3-4 days without washing their hair, but for girls like me it takes a lot of product to actually combat</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite scent of the Batiste shampoos so far.  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally oily and this product takes it all away leaving my hair looking even better and fuller than when it&#x27;s freshly washed.</li>
            <li>leaves my hair feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>It makes your hair look fresh all day.</li>
            <li>Awesome for second or third day hair or newly washed hair!</li>
            <li>, I tried several other brands and this is the best.</li>
            <li>It took the grease RIGHT out of my hair.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair just the right amount of body and texture.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it was nearly a third of the price of a higher end brand I liked.</li>
            <li>you relate to me, I have had good luck with the Aveeno Pure Renewal dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>Some have a very strong smell, some don&#x27;t, but they all work similarly</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant and light, not overwhelming or any where near the unsex / cheap cologne spectrum like some others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>It is less if a bright, fruity smell, and more of a deep sweet one.</li>
            <li>I was anything but fresh, but this stuff works really well!  </li>
            <li>Peace Rose Oil dry shampoo</li>
            <li>stuff smells INCREDIBLE, and it makes my hair feel so soft after it has dried.  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t smell particularly cherry-like, but this is a good dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>This works great, but it definitely does put a white residue in your hair from the powder, but you can blend/rub it in with your hands</li>
            <li>It works very well and allows me to do quick touch ups on my oily hair</li>
            <li>This is, hands down, the best dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite dry shampoo of more than 5 brands I have tried so far.</li>
            <li>This is a must for your gym bag or anyone who lives a busy lifestyle and needs a quick pick me up!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve mentioned in some previous reviews that I have been on the search for the perfect dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Just go with the original Clean &amp; Classic for something, well, clean and simple.</li>
            <li>After trying several brands, this line is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Smells generic but refreshing nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like cherries to me</li>
            <li>For Christmas my sister got me a travel sized version of this exact shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Paul Mithchel, Big Sexy, Tigi.. even Pantene and Suave .. and nothing ..</li>
            <li>i would definitely see myself buying more of this product</li>
            <li>One, I am a hot yoga addict.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I received this, which I purchased in the &amp;#34;cherry&amp;#34; scent based on others&#x27; reviews (thanks, by the way!)</li>
            <li>Yes it will look that way at first</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying</li>
            <li>This smells lovely, and lasted me for several months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really changed my life!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy from Amazon because my first purchase was an impulse buy.</li>
            <li>it was ok overall.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!  </li>
            <li>Great scent, but also one that doesn&#x27;t last long or become overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Takes away greasiness from roots of hair while making hair look healthy overall.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to see if I could go longer between washes to keep the color longer, and it has worked out really well!</li>
            <li>My hair always looks ten times better after a spritz with this.</li>
            <li>Make sure to hold the correct distance from scalp so that the white doesn&#x27;t build up.</li>
            <li>I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to use so much!</li>
            <li>The great thing about this specific dry shampoo is that there isn&#x27;t any flaking and it is appropriate for any hair color light or dark.    </li>
            <li>This is the only dry shampoo, out of the many I&#x27;ve tried, that not only rids my hair of oil, but also gives a great body boost.</li>
            <li>have oily roots and very fine blond long hair</li>
            <li>To me, the perfect dry shampoo will keep me feeling pretty, takes away the greasiness in my roots and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as lush dry shampoo</li>
            <li>Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing dry shampoo: Cleans very effectively without leaving any residue behind.</li>
            <li>It went on bright white and powdery, more so than any other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried - even the cheap Suave one.</li>
            <li>However, after I discovered dry shampoo, I was so pleased to be able to have an alternate solution.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair looking clean and feeling silky soft.  </li>
            <li>I have hair, so oily, I have had to wash it every day, since I was old enough to wash my own hair.</li>
            <li>you want a good dry shampoo, I would reccommend big sexy hair brand (which is a white powder spray) or bumble and bumble (a tinted spray).</li>
            <li>I have struggled with that problem for so long, I stopped looking for the answer to make it better.</li>
            <li>, I bought three full sized bottles: In blush, wild and of course, Cherry.</li>
            <li>I bought the blue can too and that one smells fresh and clean and I preferred that one</li>
            <li>I could spritz the stuff in my hair to soak up the oil, give it a fluff, and have an extra day or two without washing - amazing!  </li>
            <li>White powder residue disappears easily when you brush or finger comb it out.</li>
            <li>Its my favorite among the batiste dry shampoo scents.</li>
            <li>Most dry shampoos are sticky, have wierd volumizing ingredients that gunk up hair.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>which isn&#x27;t always an easy task after spending several hours sweating my ass off at job #1.</li>
            <li>This is the first one I&#x27;ve found that has a fantastic smell with no sticky or white residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many dry shampoos before.</li>
            <li>My favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love Batiste dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>LOVE this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I also have never had any dry scalp issues though, so maybe they are simply more susceptible.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it make my hair look perfectly clean whenever I use it, but it also gives it some extra volume which I need and love.  </li>
            <li>batiste is my favorite dry shampoo, and cherry is my go to scent.</li>
            <li>I love this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li>This works better than any dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li>the spray is really strong smelling overall will buy again</li>
            <li>This is a pure powder.</li>
            <li>a new must have for me!!</li>
            <li>My absolute favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>Favorite dry shampoo ever!</li>
            <li>My favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li>I walked over to where I had been standing when I sprayed my hair and the floor was covered in a fine white film - and I only sprayed 4 quick blasts into my hair!  </li>
            <li>Plus after a few uses it sprays the best, not as heavy.</li>
            <li>Very lovely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>LIft up your roots, spray onto your scalp, rub in, and you&#x27;re ready to go.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work very well</li>
            <li>If you are like me, my hair doesn&#x27;t hold color very well</li>
            <li>I have really greasy hair after one day of not showering.</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair and at times, can see the white.  </li>
            <li>this REALLY works.</li>
            <li>Even after massaging it into my hair and combing it through over and over it was still VERY noticeable in my hair.</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair (as soon a I sleep</li>
            <li>I wrote a review for the tropical scent which I really like.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily hair,</li>
            <li>so much so that if I wash it at night it is greasy in the mornings when I wake up.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of the cherry, and I don&#x27;t think the aerosol is too much like a lot of the reviews</li>
            <li>But it goes by way too fast.</li>
            <li>It works for my needs, though it does leave a grayish film on the roots of my hair no matter how much I agitate and work it in.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Dry Shampoo, and I like it a lot better.</li>
            <li>still gives static, but not nearly as much.  </li>
            <li>The smell is fainter than I expected and more &amp;#34;fruity than cherry.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to make much difference on my hair.</li>
            <li>It really soaks up all the excess oil in no time.</li>
            <li>So, I try to avoid shampooing and conditioning unless I absolutely have to.</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of the smell of it, but it works very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell or notice if this makes a difference in my hair or not.</li>
            <li>and it really helps on days</li>
            <li>most important, one that is affordable.awback was that because my hair is so thick, it made it rigid too.</li>
            <li>It works very well to get oil out but compared to suave it dulls the shine more.</li>
            <li>I think it works, at least it smells good.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different products and even making my own, but nothing else I have tried works as well as this product, and gives volume.</li>
            <li>it gives my hair more body, but it doesn&#x27;t absorb quite as much grease as I expected.</li>
            <li>Love this dry shampoo!!</li>
            <li>I normally use tresemme dry shampoo and of course anything is better than tresemme</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I can&#x27;t seem to rinse it off my comb or brush very easily, so I feel like I&#x27;m always putting it back in my hair when I&#x27;m trying to comb it out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also great if you&#x27;ve had a long day at work and need just a bit of a freshen-up prior to going to the kids&#x27; functions later that evening.</li>
            <li>However, with this, I can go every other day or probably even more, but I haven&#x27;t tried that out yet.  </li>
            <li>After a lot of research on different dry shampoos on the market I finally decided t try Batiste after the great rating I read on a website.</li>
            <li>It doesn’t clean well, doesn’t volumize, and only serves to deodorize the hair.</li>
            <li>usually when I accidentally put too much product in my hair, or my hair is just kind of greasy-</li>
            <li>I have very fine straight hair that is prone to looking limp and greasy.</li>
            <li>, this dry shampoo is far better than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>The Dry Shampoo is okay, but please be aware that it leaves a white trace.</li>
            <li>To me that seems quick because I rarely use any other hair products, so</li>
            <li>LOVE the other versions (blonde, fresh, tropical).  </li>
            <li>I had to use way more of this one, and it still didn&#x27;t make my hair look as clean as the other Batiste dry shampoos do.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product to use when you are in a time</li>
            <li>This is a color-life-saver, particularly if you use temporary or semi-permanent color.  </li>
            <li>It appears they are using mainly rice starch (to absorb oil) and propellant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stringy and gross looking, it leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>But more importantly: the amount of white gunky powder left in your hair is minimal.</li>
            <li>The bottle says highly flammable.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend and I use it often.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, does not let my hair white like other</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite dry shampoos because it actually makes your hair look clean and fresh if you don&#x27;t have a chance to wash it, whereas a lot of newer brands are really just meant to keep your hair from looking limp.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so fresh and clean even after not showering for a few days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Batiste dry shampoo Original:</li>
            <li>Leaves hair less chalky looking and more shiny then other cheap brands</li>
            <li>great solution especially if you&#x27;re female and can&#x27;t wash your hair everyday.</li>
            <li>I have continue to order a few more bottles.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair fresh a second day and absorbs the oil.</li>
            <li>I have used it again a few times and I absolutely love this.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, so at least she can freshen up her hair if nothing else.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and does not leave residue on my blonde hair.</li>
            <li>and I normally can&#x27;t go even a day without washing.</li>
            <li>It works ok but leaves white stuff on my hair and my mom thought I was going grey!</li>
            <li>While it does take away dome oil, of all the dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used, this one leaves the most white residue.</li>
            <li>I feel I&#x27;m applying the right amount, but it&#x27;s never quite enough.</li>
            <li>I have fairly fine light to medium blonde hair past my shoulders.</li>
            <li>It smells great - very fresh, without that weird, lingering baby-powder scent other brands have.</li>
            <li>(hair looked fine after I brushed the white powder off</li>
            <li>it does, at first, give my hair a whiteish silverish hue due to it being basically a spray powder.. but that brushes right out.  </li>
            <li>I’m posting this review and will update it whenever I have any new product comparison to add to help those folks who need comparative feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair becomes slightly thickened due to leftover powder so this may be good news for those of you who seek to add volume to your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the same product with several different smells (fresh, original, sakura, etc.)</li>
            <li>and I do have black hair, but I just leave it for a minute to do its magic and gently run my fingers through my hair, tease my roots and pat any excess until the white is no longer showing.  </li>
            <li>: Cleans effectively without leaving much of a residue behind.</li>
            <li>many potentially worthless products until you get to the good one.</li>
            <li>As long as you don&#x27;t mind spraying your head with butane (yes, butane is the first ingredient!)</li>
            <li>It sprays on VERY heavy at first, so you have to use a light touch until you&#x27;ve depleted the can a bit.</li>
            <li>Oh, and one more thing I really liked about this product is that it has very natural ingredients that don’t bother sick folks, cancer patients, asthma sufferers, etc.</li>
            <li>Oh, and one more thing I really liked about this product is that it has very natural ingredients that don’t bother sick folks, cancer patients, asthma sufferers, etc.</li>
            <li>Dry shampoo is pretty much my lifeline on days when I work both jobs.</li>
            <li>I would like to return this item, I barely sprayed my hair, and it was super white...</li>
            <li>My 16 year old daughter LOVES it!  </li>
            <li>When you first spray it in, it is white</li>
            <li>It does leave a bit of a light residue if you have dark hair</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is better than other brands I have tried (like Ojon), but still not quite up to par for me.</li>
            <li>When you first spray it, it will leave a film of white powder, which disappears</li>
            <li>But it really seems as though this particular one is not made in the same way that the others are.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this if you regularly dye your hair and are looking to keep it from fading too fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tresemme Fresh Start dry shampoo</li>
            <li>True things about this product (neither good nor bad IMO, just things):&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Mess free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several other types, but none have actually made my hair look fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoo and this is my favorite that I repeatedly come back to.  </li>
            <li>I think it works so much better than a more expensive dry shampoo I purchased at Gene Juarez.</li>
            <li>This is a must have for any girl who wants to freshen up her hair without going through a whole wash and dry session!</li>
            <li>I even use it when my hair is clean because it keeps my hair from weighing down as the day progresses</li>
            <li>It does also smell better than some other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>I have only used it a handful of times, but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>Overall I feel it works really well</li>
            <li>It is on the feminine side, so those who prefer a neutral or masculine fragrance might not like it.</li>
            <li>It *seems* safer than the spray cans so far.</li>
            <li>It *seems* safer than the spray cans so far.</li>
            <li>It works well and allows me to go a day or 2 longer without shampooing, which keeps my red haircolor from fading so fast.</li>
            <li>how far away you spray it on to your hair,  the amount you use, and of course how often you use it.</li>
            <li>I only use it once throughout the day and it really manages the excess oil in my hair when I dont have the time to take a shower.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the old incense cones my mom used to burn in the 70s.  </li>
            <li>I have oily hair, naturally.</li>
            <li>I bet I could even go a third day if I really wanted to.</li>
            <li>Does the job, leaves hair with some residue, and makes hair so soft.</li>
            <li>Also, because it is powdery, it eliminated my hair&#x27;s natural shine and made it look matte/dried out.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to scents, I would suggest getting an unscented one.</li>
            <li>The 3 star review is for the ungodly amount of chemicals that are on the list that one would think you shouldn&#x27;t be spraying directly on your head....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Add this to the fact that the bottle is VERY SMALL for the price, and it feels very cheap and ineffective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One minor issue--I use it almost daily and the can does run out fairly quickly (&amp;#62; 2 weeks).  </li>
            <li>I have used this for a while with my red hair color due to not being able to wash daily!</li>
            <li>Very discrete and clean, however it DOES NOT ad texture as other dry shampoos do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoos and this is hands down a favorite.</li>
            <li>my first try with a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use dry shampoos often (this is actually my first one), but I may have to get in the habit of using this stuff to go longer between washes.</li>
            <li>I usually need to wash my hair every day because it gets oily very quickly.  </li>
            <li>My normal hair is straight, fine, thin and oily.</li>
            <li>I like the cherry scent which is light and subtle, but the powder is a bit intense.</li>
            <li>They usually run a sale on this item pay full price $8.99 for the first one get the second one for 50% off.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing and does not make your hair grey or powdery looking like other dry shampoos!</li>
            <li>My hair gets oily pretty quickly and I usually have to shampoo my hair every day to prevent it from looking gross.</li>
            <li>I use the Cherry scent on my very very dark brown hair without having to worry about how the dry shampoo affecting and dulling the color (the way so many others do.)</li>
            <li>As my hair becomes more oily with age and with loss of hair, this dry shampoo allows me to wash my hair every other day instead of daily</li>
            <li>other dry shampoos, it is a fine absorbent powder in an aerosol can.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos and the different Batiste dry shampoo are ok.</li>
            <li>this is the best dry shampoo I have used (I have previously used suave, tresemme and a nasty ojon kind which smelled like nose cancer but</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried any other dry shampoo, so I can&#x27;t accurately compare Batiste to others.</li>
            <li>new I needed to upgrade to a larger size.  </li>
            <li>This is essentially scented powder in an aerosol can, which is typical for most dry shampoos.</li>
            <li>this dry shampoo really helps to get me through the time in-between washes.</li>
            <li>I really like the Batiste Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li>I know most dry shampoos leave a white residue, but after rubbing my scalp for a few minutes my hair is back to normal.</li>
            <li>I usually use the original formula with no smell.</li>
            <li>This was one of the first dry shampoos I had ever tried on my blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Every dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried previous to this one has either smelled too strong, hasn&#x27;t worked at all, or left my hair feeling heavy and full of product.  </li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t even that bad (although it isn&#x27;t that great).  </li>
            <li>Since job #2 involves dealing directly with the public, I have to look presentable...</li>
            <li>As far as application goes, my method is to spray it on my roots only, keeping the can about 6 inches away from my head as I spray.</li>
            <li>This is my fault for not reading the ingredients, but I never expected to find propane in a shampoo.</li>
            <li>I just so happen to have ashy brown/blonde hair, so, on me, it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I held my arm as far away from my head as possible while spraying</li>
            <li>its cool dont spray in a small area</li>
            <li>it cleans yourhair just as if you washed it and has a nice faint sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She has dark brown hair and as with most dry shampoos, you have to be careful</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really compare it to anything else since this is the only dry shampoo product I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time after not washing my hair for about a day and a half.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot and humid where I am and this dry shampoo maintains my style without it looking powdery or dry.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this dry shampoo to anyone!</li>
            <li>Long-lasting effects (much longer than other brands I have tried, including Suave).  5.</li>
            <li>It does leave a white cast on my black hair that I have to brush out a little more than with the suave brand.</li>
            <li>If you have dark hair and order this exact product, your hair will look white.</li>
            <li>and I have no need to buy the tinted sprays because the normal stuff doesn&#x27;t leave your roots white or grey.</li>
            <li>The cherry smell is a little overpowering, not crazy, but a little too intense for my tastes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried at least five different dry shampoos now, and this is the most recent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other dried shampoos that leave a build up and do not leave my hair as shiny and oil free as this one.</li>
            <li>Leaves white residue, need to brush off thoroughly before barely getting rid of the matte, gray residue.</li>
            <li>Leaves white residue, need to brush off thoroughly before barely getting rid of the matte, gray residue.</li>
            <li>I chose to save like a buck by buying it instead of my usual and it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Other dry shampoos just left a gooey residue, but batiste feels clean and dry.</li>
            <li>(DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH TRESEMME DRY SHAMPOO.</li>
            <li>My fav dry shampoo by far.</li>
            <li>I suspect if you have dark hair that the white would really show.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoos over the past few years and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Only draw back is it makes my dark auburn hair have a slightly lighter hue because of the light color of the powder.</li>
            <li>I found the first couple times I used it it left a little white in my hair</li>
            <li>My hair is fine but not so much thin (somewhere between) and it tends to get oily around my bangs and sides by day two (probably because of my oily skin).</li>
            <li>I may have not been using the container correctly, but I&#x27;ve not had this much issue dispensing other dry shampoo products.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair and typically any and all hair products will weigh my hair down and make it look even flatter!</li>

            <li> Spells good and is good.</li>
            <li> I wouldn’t call this a juicy fruity smell that you sometimes get from good shampoos.</li>
            <li> It smells good and works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted with it.</li>
            <li> I have fairly think medium length hair that tends to get oily.</li>
            <li> and I thought I was good.  </li>
            <li> I buy it in bulk whenever I find a good deal.</li>
            <li> and it smells really good and isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> The cherry sent smells good but isn&#x27;t that strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Smells good too.  </li>
            <li> The cherry version smells good.</li>
            <li> It does smell good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how anyone could give this product a good rating.</li>
            <li> good price and</li>
            <li> cherry scene is pleasant and a nice added touch.</li>
            <li> Exceptionally smelly and flammable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wonderful fresh scent and gives my hair a lot of body as well as getting rid of oil.</li>
            <li> Again, the product itself is nice and smells good too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>

            <li> : Cleans with effectively.</li>
            <li> but it still smells nice.</li>
            <li> I was so thrilled with it</li>
            <li> Suave used to leave it feeling kind of tangled, but I thought that was the price I&#x27;d have to pay.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nice.  </li>
            <li> This products works really, really well and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li> With this I dont have that problem and it has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> and it comes in handy on days where I can&#x27;t wash my hair anywhere.</li>

            <li> The cherry scent is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and is easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> it smells great, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strong AND persistent - you have been warned.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works pretty well!</li>
            <li> and I like it better than the others, although Blush is nice as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff tackles the oilyness, gives my hair volume, but the best part is that it leaves my hair really soft.  </li>
            <li> works great and soaks up oily hair and makes it look freshly washed.</li>
            <li> The smell is also nice and refreshing.  </li>
            <li> This one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> It just gives your roots and follicles a nice refreshing lift and oil absorption.  </li>
            <li> And I feel the cherry scent suits my red hair perfectly, what could be better!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love - consider me a lifer!</li>
            <li> the smell is fresh and very nice</li>
            <li> Works great as well a little spray qas perfect</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like HE Color me Happy shampoo.</li>
            <li> Smells like bright, sweet citrus.</li>
            <li> so I cannot say how great it works on day 2-3 but one day I will be brave enough to try I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> Has a great scent and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> I have very smooth hair, and braids</li>
            <li> the best dry shampoo I have ever used:) I will buy this again!</li>
            <li> Scent is nice but too strong.</li>
            <li> they hold true :) the smell is pleasant and i was in awwee at how clean my hair looks and the added volume is a plus!</li>
            <li> Love the scent as well</li>
            <li> Nice light scent.</li>
            <li> Lovely &amp; refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herbal</li>
            <li> Why is that any product I love like shoes, lipstick, perfume, vitamin supplement, etc.</li>
            <li> Why is that any product I love like shoes, lipstick, perfume, vitamin supplement, etc.</li>
            <li> and I love the Cherry smell.</li>
            <li> I have not gone more than 1 day without washing my hair</li>
            <li> and I love the cherry bottle...</li>
            <li> I will say the scent isn&#x27;t as pleasing as Tresemme, but that&#x27;s probably why theirs didn&#x27;t do it for me; they focused more on scent than on function.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes hair oil free all day!</li>
            <li> the alcohol in it just helps me style my hair better.  </li>
            <li> The cherry scent is my favorite...</li>
            <li> This is understandable since the primary ingredients are propane and butane gas!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a better product in this category:</li>
            <li> Gives my oily hair one more day of wear.</li>
            <li> I used to get along ok with suave...</li>
            <li> It did the job on oilyness and gave an ok</li>
            <li> Well anyway, I love using this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I have already ordered more.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> This smell is ok.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did...</li>
            <li> It does a better job of adding volume to my hair than does</li>
            <li> If you need your hair to look gray then you should buy this product :)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This one does not do that if you hold the can the appropriate distance from your scalp, while spraying.</li>
            <li> Does its job in taking the oil out of my roots to get me through one more day without a shampoo.  </li>
            <li> The scent was okay</li>
            <li> okay, but a smoky cherry.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This one is the latter, but does great things for volume as well!</li>
            <li> The floral one is better.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Smells so much better than the Original!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay girls.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> In addition, I don&#x27;t find the formula to make my hair any better than baby powder.  </li>
            <li> So anyway, I was worried that the cherry smell would be overwhelming or that I would smell like chapstick all day.  </li>
            <li> (my hair is baby-fine and somewhat oily), and I love the silky texture it gives my hair.  </li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> And its cheap!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This will be my go-to from now on. :)</li>
            <li> so I feel OK about using this on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> Also, if I go camping or somewhere where the showers are dodgy, I make sure I have this with me.</li>
            <li> It works alright, though I think the Tresseme I used to buy worked just a bit better.</li>
            <li> so the braid stays in better.  </li>
            <li> If I was blonde it would be perfect for boosting volume, but I&#x27;m brunette</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the product and will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> but baby powder gives me wicked static cling.  </li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t my favorite option..</li>
            <li> this is better.  </li>
            <li> I love the cherry smell and</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried tropical and like this one better.</li>
            <li> I think it does a really good job of soaking up the oil, and making my hair look fresh -</li>
            <li> In fact I just&lt;br /&gt;ordered 3 more.  </li>
            <li> The cherry one is my favorite smell.</li>
            <li> Make sure you shake the can well before use to resuspend the powder and pump up the aerosol.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> admit it works better when I straighten my hair out than when I let it do its wavy thing.</li>
            <li> Maybe the one for brunettes is a better choice for me.</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the best way to use it is to spray it into the roots right away when I get up, and then let it sit while I&#x27;m getting ready.</li>
            <li> It smells nice all day and it keeps my hair looking clean and not oily.</li>
            <li> It also is excellent for adding a little bit of texture, and my hair has never looked better for longer in between washes!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the special ingredient is in this stuff, but it leaves my hair feeling so nice.  </li>
            <li> In all my time working in the beauty industry i have never found a more perfect dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> The smell was a true rose oil scent.</li>
            <li> This item works pretty good.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t weighed down, smelled good, and my hair looked good!  </li>
            <li> It smells great and gives my hair texture and a new feel.  </li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Best Dry Shampoo.  </li>

            <li> The best dry shampoo out there..</li>
            <li> This is hands-down the best dry shampoo on the market.</li>
            <li> easy to use and keep hair smooth without feeling that greasy!</li>
            <li> the BEST dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Dry shampoo is an oily haired girl&#x27;s best friend!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> The very best dry shampoo out there.  </li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works wonderfully on my hair.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I have ever had....</li>
            <li> I read that this product is the best dry shampoo out there, so I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I chose this one since it was voted the best dry shampoo</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling dry shampoo that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> the kind formulated for volume and the kind formulated for absorbing excess oils.</li>
            <li> Great product so far!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo on the planet!</li>
            <li> , the scent is ok, it works fine</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BEST dry shampoo I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> This is an awesome dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have the oiliest hair in existence and it looks and feels clean after I use this!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo - I use it all the time!</li>
            <li> Other than that I love it :D</li>
            <li> The best part is that this volumizes so much more than any of the other products I have seen.</li>
            <li> most important, one that is affordable.</li>
            <li> Even better, I will apply just before bed and when I awake, there is no residue and my hair looks and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a great product so far.</li>
            <li> this is the best smelling and working dry shampoo ever!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not the best product that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I love this one because it really seems to absorb all the oil, and the spray is very strong which, in my opinion, seems to make the produce distribute more evenly.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best of the cheap dry shampoos!</li>
            <li> Good as new!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Hair becomes silky and easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping.</li>
            <li> The cherry scent is very mild, I almost can&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> Even if it does, it&#x27;s easily dissapated by brushing thoroughly through hair.</li>
            <li> easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesnt smell too strong..</li>
            <li> I would avoid the tropical one though, it is really strong.</li>
            <li> When you spray the smell is so strong it takes your breath away.</li>
            <li> Even if I take a shower every day, my hair starts to get greasy mid-afternoon, so dry shampoo is perfect for a touch-up when a full shower isn&#x27;t a possibility.</li>
            <li> First of all it (cherry flavor) smells super good.</li>
            <li> The cherry scent is so refreshing and sweet</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling soft and fresh and smells good!</li>
            <li> I can go five days without washing my hair and it still looks awesome worn down and</li>
            <li> : they&#x27;re fine, they do their jobs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Two, I have fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken to just shaking my hair out with my fingers, and that works just fine.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cheap too!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t rub it in or brush out my hair until I&#x27;m ready to go, and that makes the volume much, much better!</li>
            <li> A couple of light sprays and my hair is good as new without looking like I skipped a day washing my hair.</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend this produce of this certain smell and most importantly, it works!</li>
            <li> This spray gives it a little texture to hold it in place and look perfectly undone!</li>
            <li> but it works pretty well and makes my hair look nice and clean.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s also important to you.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great if you are running short on time and didn&#x27;t get to jump in the shower.  </li>
            <li> The cherry scent is surprisingly light</li>
            <li> Some relevant information - I work two jobs.</li>
            <li> Such as great product for the price.</li>
            <li> I get more compliments on my hair after using this product than when I freshly wash and style.</li>
            <li> My hair is light brown with highlights</li>
            <li> The price is OK though, and to me it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> A couple more bucks than Suave, but so worth it.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried pssst brand, and a few others and batiste is the best.</li>
            <li> Great for extra volume and root lifting!</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t really enjoy the smell</li>
            <li> It also really seems to put a nice refresh on my hair on the days that I do not wash it.  </li>
            <li> Smells fantastic</li>
            <li> more like super sweet body spray which i didn&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean and volumized and I love the smell, which is a fresh sort of cherry and and floral blend.</li>
            <li> A top review said this was a great product and worked well on her dark hair without dulling the color.</li>
            <li> Maybe this particular issue is not the product’s fault but my own head.</li>
            <li> Maybe this particular issue is not the product’s fault but my own head.</li>
            <li> It absorbs oil without giving my hair a gross feeling, and the scent is light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like most Garnier Fructis products; like tropical fruits &amp; citrus.</li>
            <li> I can already tell this is going to be a monthly purchase for me - absolutely worth the price!</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t enjoy the overly sweet smell.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find the brand I was originally looking for, but after reading the reviews I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth ordering!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love how it smells and it seems to clean my hair pretty well.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair looking clean and adds body on days I don&#x27;t have time to wash it.</li>
            <li> you scalp clean.</li>
            <li> Happy dry shampoo:</li>
            <li> This brand&#x27;s dry shampoo is great, but I did not like the Cherry smell.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is great.</li>
            <li> Hair looks clean and shiny, not dulling at all.</li>
            <li> Absolute best dry shampoo around!!</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair, and after massaging this in a little bit, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or chalky appearance, and it creates some good volume too!</li>
            <li> I love love love this brand of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love love love this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> (And yes used the product right!)</li>
            <li> My hair feels clean after using it and I never need to reapply it throughout the day since it does such a good job.</li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo &amp; I love this scent!</li>
            <li> I have bright red hair</li>
            <li> The smell is overbearing and sickly sweet, and the bathroom reeks of it afterwards.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is that of sweet roses.</li>
            <li> The smell is a syrupy sweet mango/vanilla concoction.</li>
            <li> One thing I noticed immediately was that it dispensed a white powder, which is a good sign because I know it&#x27;ll soak up the greasiness.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, and my entire family is p-i-c-k-y.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really all I need most days.</li>
            <li> /smell good without actually washing it.</li>
            <li> just a simple spray, rub your fingers through your hair, and you&#x27;re good to go.  </li>
            <li> thanks :)</li>
            <li> I like the smell, sweet and fresh and light.</li>
            <li> The smell is good at first, but to me it gets old quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> But still by far one of the best dry shampoos I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is amazing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this one is a great value.</li>
            <li> and it soaks up all the oil in your hair leaving it looking fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It all brushes out though and leaves my hair looking fresh and clean.  </li>
            <li> All of the Batiste dry shampoos work great, but this scent is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> ALWAYS gets discontinued quickly?</li>
            <li> ALWAYS gets discontinued quickly?</li>
            <li> After spraying, a quick brushing helps blend it in.</li>
            <li> This stuff allows me to get away with just a quick pirate wash and not look or smell like a hipster.</li>
            <li> The product came quickly and well packaged</li>
            <li> a quick shuffle through my hair with my fingers disperses the powder just fine&lt;</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t enjoy the smell very much.</li>
            <li> i have dark brown hair and it works great.</li>
            <li> Absorbs the oil well as long as you dump a fair amount of the product into your hair.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel heavy and has a great clean smell to it.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, leaves my hair with a nice texture that allows me to add some lift and body without leaving it wet looking and flat.  </li>
            <li> I no longer feel the need to search for a good dry shampoo...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and it was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoos on the market but none work as good as Batiste&#x27;s line.  </li>
            <li> works well especially with my long curly hair.. smells great!</li>
            <li> My hair has body for the first time, ever!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this scent and the tropical and love them both!</li>
            <li> I first bought the Original scent.</li>
            <li> The smell is wonderful but not overbearing and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried probably a dozen different brands of dry shampoo, and this is the best.</li>
            <li> leading to more shampooing.. and more heat damage (I blow dry and straighten).  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many different dry shampoos and this is by far the best product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really smell like cherries but it does have a light floral fruity scent.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair an extra day or two without washing (though I almost always have my hair in a ponytail), but it&#x27;s not some amazing product that makes it look or feel freshly-washed.</li>
            <li> and my hair looks and smells good enough that I can get away with brushing my hair out really well and putting in a headband.</li>
            <li> I was even in hospital for 5 days and everyone marveled at how fresh my hair looked.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell and helpfull to give my hair a rest from daily shampoo.</li>
            <li> And my hair feels freshly washed every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Another said my hair looked as if I had just had a fresh blow-out!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s nice for girls who can go 3-4 days without washing their hair, but for girls like me it takes a lot of product to actually combat</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent of the Batiste shampoos so far.  </li>
            <li> My hair is naturally oily and this product takes it all away leaving my hair looking even better and fuller than when it&#x27;s freshly washed.</li>
            <li> leaves my hair feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair look fresh all day.</li>
            <li> Awesome for second or third day hair or newly washed hair!</li>
            <li> , I tried several other brands and this is the best.</li>
            <li> It took the grease RIGHT out of my hair.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair just the right amount of body and texture.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was nearly a third of the price of a higher end brand I liked.</li>
            <li> you relate to me, I have had good luck with the Aveeno Pure Renewal dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Some have a very strong smell, some don&#x27;t, but they all work similarly</li>
            <li> The fragrance is pleasant and light, not overwhelming or any where near the unsex / cheap cologne spectrum like some others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> It is less if a bright, fruity smell, and more of a deep sweet one.</li>
            <li> I was anything but fresh, but this stuff works really well!  </li>
            <li> Peace Rose Oil dry shampoo</li>
            <li> stuff smells INCREDIBLE, and it makes my hair feel so soft after it has dried.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell particularly cherry-like, but this is a good dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> This works great, but it definitely does put a white residue in your hair from the powder, but you can blend/rub it in with your hands</li>
            <li> It works very well and allows me to do quick touch ups on my oily hair</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the best dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo of more than 5 brands I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> This is a must for your gym bag or anyone who lives a busy lifestyle and needs a quick pick me up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve mentioned in some previous reviews that I have been on the search for the perfect dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Just go with the original Clean &amp; Classic for something, well, clean and simple.</li>
            <li> After trying several brands, this line is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Smells generic but refreshing nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like cherries to me</li>
            <li> For Christmas my sister got me a travel sized version of this exact shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Paul Mithchel, Big Sexy, Tigi.. even Pantene and Suave .. and nothing ..</li>
            <li> i would definitely see myself buying more of this product</li>
            <li> One, I am a hot yoga addict.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I received this, which I purchased in the &amp;#34;cherry&amp;#34; scent based on others&#x27; reviews (thanks, by the way!)</li>
            <li> Yes it will look that way at first</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying</li>
            <li> This smells lovely, and lasted me for several months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really changed my life!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy from Amazon because my first purchase was an impulse buy.</li>
            <li> it was ok overall.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  </li>
            <li> Great scent, but also one that doesn&#x27;t last long or become overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Takes away greasiness from roots of hair while making hair look healthy overall.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to see if I could go longer between washes to keep the color longer, and it has worked out really well!</li>
            <li> My hair always looks ten times better after a spritz with this.</li>
            <li> Make sure to hold the correct distance from scalp so that the white doesn&#x27;t build up.</li>
            <li> I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to use so much!</li>
            <li> The great thing about this specific dry shampoo is that there isn&#x27;t any flaking and it is appropriate for any hair color light or dark.    </li>
            <li> This is the only dry shampoo, out of the many I&#x27;ve tried, that not only rids my hair of oil, but also gives a great body boost.</li>
            <li> have oily roots and very fine blond long hair</li>
            <li> To me, the perfect dry shampoo will keep me feeling pretty, takes away the greasiness in my roots and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as lush dry shampoo</li>
            <li> Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing dry shampoo: Cleans very effectively without leaving any residue behind.</li>
            <li> It went on bright white and powdery, more so than any other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried - even the cheap Suave one.</li>
            <li> However, after I discovered dry shampoo, I was so pleased to be able to have an alternate solution.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair looking clean and feeling silky soft.  </li>
            <li> I have hair, so oily, I have had to wash it every day, since I was old enough to wash my own hair.</li>
            <li> you want a good dry shampoo, I would reccommend big sexy hair brand (which is a white powder spray) or bumble and bumble (a tinted spray).</li>
            <li> I have struggled with that problem for so long, I stopped looking for the answer to make it better.</li>
            <li> , I bought three full sized bottles: In blush, wild and of course, Cherry.</li>
            <li> I bought the blue can too and that one smells fresh and clean and I preferred that one</li>
            <li> I could spritz the stuff in my hair to soak up the oil, give it a fluff, and have an extra day or two without washing - amazing!  </li>
            <li> White powder residue disappears easily when you brush or finger comb it out.</li>
            <li> Its my favorite among the batiste dry shampoo scents.</li>
            <li> Most dry shampoos are sticky, have wierd volumizing ingredients that gunk up hair.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> which isn&#x27;t always an easy task after spending several hours sweating my ass off at job #1.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I&#x27;ve found that has a fantastic smell with no sticky or white residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many dry shampoos before.</li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love Batiste dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> LOVE this dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I also have never had any dry scalp issues though, so maybe they are simply more susceptible.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it make my hair look perfectly clean whenever I use it, but it also gives it some extra volume which I need and love.  </li>
            <li> batiste is my favorite dry shampoo, and cherry is my go to scent.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> This works better than any dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li> the spray is really strong smelling overall will buy again</li>
            <li> This is a pure powder.</li>
            <li> a new must have for me!!</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> Favorite dry shampoo ever!</li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo!</li>
            <li> I walked over to where I had been standing when I sprayed my hair and the floor was covered in a fine white film - and I only sprayed 4 quick blasts into my hair!  </li>
            <li> Plus after a few uses it sprays the best, not as heavy.</li>
            <li> Very lovely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> LIft up your roots, spray onto your scalp, rub in, and you&#x27;re ready to go.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work very well</li>
            <li> If you are like me, my hair doesn&#x27;t hold color very well</li>
            <li> I have really greasy hair after one day of not showering.</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair and at times, can see the white.  </li>
            <li> this REALLY works.</li>
            <li> Even after massaging it into my hair and combing it through over and over it was still VERY noticeable in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair (as soon a I sleep</li>
            <li> I wrote a review for the tropical scent which I really like.  </li>
            <li> I have very oily hair,</li>
            <li> so much so that if I wash it at night it is greasy in the mornings when I wake up.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the cherry, and I don&#x27;t think the aerosol is too much like a lot of the reviews</li>
            <li> But it goes by way too fast.</li>
            <li> It works for my needs, though it does leave a grayish film on the roots of my hair no matter how much I agitate and work it in.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Dry Shampoo, and I like it a lot better.</li>
            <li> still gives static, but not nearly as much.  </li>
            <li> The smell is fainter than I expected and more &amp;#34;fruity than cherry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to make much difference on my hair.</li>
            <li> It really soaks up all the excess oil in no time.</li>
            <li> So, I try to avoid shampooing and conditioning unless I absolutely have to.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the smell of it, but it works very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell or notice if this makes a difference in my hair or not.</li>
            <li> and it really helps on days</li>
            <li> most important, one that is affordable.awback was that because my hair is so thick, it made it rigid too.</li>
            <li> It works very well to get oil out but compared to suave it dulls the shine more.</li>
            <li> I think it works, at least it smells good.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different products and even making my own, but nothing else I have tried works as well as this product, and gives volume.</li>
            <li> it gives my hair more body, but it doesn&#x27;t absorb quite as much grease as I expected.</li>
            <li> Love this dry shampoo!!</li>
            <li> I normally use tresemme dry shampoo and of course anything is better than tresemme</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I can&#x27;t seem to rinse it off my comb or brush very easily, so I feel like I&#x27;m always putting it back in my hair when I&#x27;m trying to comb it out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also great if you&#x27;ve had a long day at work and need just a bit of a freshen-up prior to going to the kids&#x27; functions later that evening.</li>
            <li> However, with this, I can go every other day or probably even more, but I haven&#x27;t tried that out yet.  </li>
            <li> After a lot of research on different dry shampoos on the market I finally decided t try Batiste after the great rating I read on a website.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t clean well, doesn’t volumize, and only serves to deodorize the hair.</li>
            <li> usually when I accidentally put too much product in my hair, or my hair is just kind of greasy-</li>
            <li> I have very fine straight hair that is prone to looking limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> , this dry shampoo is far better than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> The Dry Shampoo is okay, but please be aware that it leaves a white trace.</li>
            <li> To me that seems quick because I rarely use any other hair products, so</li>
            <li> LOVE the other versions (blonde, fresh, tropical).  </li>
            <li> I had to use way more of this one, and it still didn&#x27;t make my hair look as clean as the other Batiste dry shampoos do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product to use when you are in a time</li>
            <li> This is a color-life-saver, particularly if you use temporary or semi-permanent color.  </li>
            <li> It appears they are using mainly rice starch (to absorb oil) and propellant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stringy and gross looking, it leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> But more importantly: the amount of white gunky powder left in your hair is minimal.</li>
            <li> The bottle says highly flammable.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend and I use it often.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, does not let my hair white like other</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of my favorite dry shampoos because it actually makes your hair look clean and fresh if you don&#x27;t have a chance to wash it, whereas a lot of newer brands are really just meant to keep your hair from looking limp.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so fresh and clean even after not showering for a few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Batiste dry shampoo Original:</li>
            <li> Leaves hair less chalky looking and more shiny then other cheap brands</li>
            <li> great solution especially if you&#x27;re female and can&#x27;t wash your hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I have continue to order a few more bottles.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair fresh a second day and absorbs the oil.</li>
            <li> I have used it again a few times and I absolutely love this.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, so at least she can freshen up her hair if nothing else.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and does not leave residue on my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> and I normally can&#x27;t go even a day without washing.</li>
            <li> It works ok but leaves white stuff on my hair and my mom thought I was going grey!</li>
            <li> While it does take away dome oil, of all the dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used, this one leaves the most white residue.</li>
            <li> I feel I&#x27;m applying the right amount, but it&#x27;s never quite enough.</li>
            <li> I have fairly fine light to medium blonde hair past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> It smells great - very fresh, without that weird, lingering baby-powder scent other brands have.</li>
            <li> (hair looked fine after I brushed the white powder off</li>
            <li> it does, at first, give my hair a whiteish silverish hue due to it being basically a spray powder.. but that brushes right out.  </li>
            <li> I’m posting this review and will update it whenever I have any new product comparison to add to help those folks who need comparative feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hair becomes slightly thickened due to leftover powder so this may be good news for those of you who seek to add volume to your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same product with several different smells (fresh, original, sakura, etc.)</li>
            <li> and I do have black hair, but I just leave it for a minute to do its magic and gently run my fingers through my hair, tease my roots and pat any excess until the white is no longer showing.  </li>
            <li> : Cleans effectively without leaving much of a residue behind.</li>
            <li> many potentially worthless products until you get to the good one.</li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t mind spraying your head with butane (yes, butane is the first ingredient!)</li>
            <li> It sprays on VERY heavy at first, so you have to use a light touch until you&#x27;ve depleted the can a bit.</li>
            <li> Oh, and one more thing I really liked about this product is that it has very natural ingredients that don’t bother sick folks, cancer patients, asthma sufferers, etc.</li>
            <li> Oh, and one more thing I really liked about this product is that it has very natural ingredients that don’t bother sick folks, cancer patients, asthma sufferers, etc.</li>
            <li> Dry shampoo is pretty much my lifeline on days when I work both jobs.</li>
            <li> I would like to return this item, I barely sprayed my hair, and it was super white...</li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter LOVES it!  </li>
            <li> When you first spray it in, it is white</li>
            <li> It does leave a bit of a light residue if you have dark hair</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is better than other brands I have tried (like Ojon), but still not quite up to par for me.</li>
            <li> When you first spray it, it will leave a film of white powder, which disappears</li>
            <li> But it really seems as though this particular one is not made in the same way that the others are.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this if you regularly dye your hair and are looking to keep it from fading too fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tresemme Fresh Start dry shampoo</li>
            <li> True things about this product (neither good nor bad IMO, just things):&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Mess free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several other types, but none have actually made my hair look fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoo and this is my favorite that I repeatedly come back to.  </li>
            <li> I think it works so much better than a more expensive dry shampoo I purchased at Gene Juarez.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for any girl who wants to freshen up her hair without going through a whole wash and dry session!</li>
            <li> I even use it when my hair is clean because it keeps my hair from weighing down as the day progresses</li>
            <li> It does also smell better than some other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a handful of times, but so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> Overall I feel it works really well</li>
            <li> It is on the feminine side, so those who prefer a neutral or masculine fragrance might not like it.</li>
            <li> It *seems* safer than the spray cans so far.</li>
            <li> It *seems* safer than the spray cans so far.</li>
            <li> It works well and allows me to go a day or 2 longer without shampooing, which keeps my red haircolor from fading so fast.</li>
            <li> how far away you spray it on to your hair,  the amount you use, and of course how often you use it.</li>
            <li> I only use it once throughout the day and it really manages the excess oil in my hair when I dont have the time to take a shower.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of the old incense cones my mom used to burn in the 70s.  </li>
            <li> I have oily hair, naturally.</li>
            <li> I bet I could even go a third day if I really wanted to.</li>
            <li> Does the job, leaves hair with some residue, and makes hair so soft.</li>
            <li> Also, because it is powdery, it eliminated my hair&#x27;s natural shine and made it look matte/dried out.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to scents, I would suggest getting an unscented one.</li>
            <li> The 3 star review is for the ungodly amount of chemicals that are on the list that one would think you shouldn&#x27;t be spraying directly on your head....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Add this to the fact that the bottle is VERY SMALL for the price, and it feels very cheap and ineffective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One minor issue--I use it almost daily and the can does run out fairly quickly (&amp;#62; 2 weeks).  </li>
            <li> I have used this for a while with my red hair color due to not being able to wash daily!</li>
            <li> Very discrete and clean, however it DOES NOT ad texture as other dry shampoos do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoos and this is hands down a favorite.</li>
            <li> my first try with a dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use dry shampoos often (this is actually my first one), but I may have to get in the habit of using this stuff to go longer between washes.</li>
            <li> I usually need to wash my hair every day because it gets oily very quickly.  </li>
            <li> My normal hair is straight, fine, thin and oily.</li>
            <li> I like the cherry scent which is light and subtle, but the powder is a bit intense.</li>
            <li> They usually run a sale on this item pay full price $8.99 for the first one get the second one for 50% off.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and does not make your hair grey or powdery looking like other dry shampoos!</li>
            <li> My hair gets oily pretty quickly and I usually have to shampoo my hair every day to prevent it from looking gross.</li>
            <li> I use the Cherry scent on my very very dark brown hair without having to worry about how the dry shampoo affecting and dulling the color (the way so many others do.)</li>
            <li> As my hair becomes more oily with age and with loss of hair, this dry shampoo allows me to wash my hair every other day instead of daily</li>
            <li> other dry shampoos, it is a fine absorbent powder in an aerosol can.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos and the different Batiste dry shampoo are ok.</li>
            <li> this is the best dry shampoo I have used (I have previously used suave, tresemme and a nasty ojon kind which smelled like nose cancer but</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other dry shampoo, so I can&#x27;t accurately compare Batiste to others.</li>
            <li> new I needed to upgrade to a larger size.  </li>
            <li> This is essentially scented powder in an aerosol can, which is typical for most dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> this dry shampoo really helps to get me through the time in-between washes.</li>
            <li> I really like the Batiste Dry Shampoo.</li>
            <li> I know most dry shampoos leave a white residue, but after rubbing my scalp for a few minutes my hair is back to normal.</li>
            <li> I usually use the original formula with no smell.</li>
            <li> This was one of the first dry shampoos I had ever tried on my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Every dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried previous to this one has either smelled too strong, hasn&#x27;t worked at all, or left my hair feeling heavy and full of product.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t even that bad (although it isn&#x27;t that great).  </li>
            <li> Since job #2 involves dealing directly with the public, I have to look presentable...</li>
            <li> As far as application goes, my method is to spray it on my roots only, keeping the can about 6 inches away from my head as I spray.</li>
            <li> This is my fault for not reading the ingredients, but I never expected to find propane in a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I just so happen to have ashy brown/blonde hair, so, on me, it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I held my arm as far away from my head as possible while spraying</li>
            <li> its cool dont spray in a small area</li>
            <li> it cleans yourhair just as if you washed it and has a nice faint sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She has dark brown hair and as with most dry shampoos, you have to be careful</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really compare it to anything else since this is the only dry shampoo product I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time after not washing my hair for about a day and a half.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hot and humid where I am and this dry shampoo maintains my style without it looking powdery or dry.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this dry shampoo to anyone!</li>
            <li> Long-lasting effects (much longer than other brands I have tried, including Suave).  5.</li>
            <li> It does leave a white cast on my black hair that I have to brush out a little more than with the suave brand.</li>
            <li> If you have dark hair and order this exact product, your hair will look white.</li>
            <li> and I have no need to buy the tinted sprays because the normal stuff doesn&#x27;t leave your roots white or grey.</li>
            <li> The cherry smell is a little overpowering, not crazy, but a little too intense for my tastes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least five different dry shampoos now, and this is the most recent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other dried shampoos that leave a build up and do not leave my hair as shiny and oil free as this one.</li>
            <li> Leaves white residue, need to brush off thoroughly before barely getting rid of the matte, gray residue.</li>
            <li> Leaves white residue, need to brush off thoroughly before barely getting rid of the matte, gray residue.</li>
            <li> I chose to save like a buck by buying it instead of my usual and it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Other dry shampoos just left a gooey residue, but batiste feels clean and dry.</li>
            <li> (DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH TRESEMME DRY SHAMPOO.</li>
            <li> My fav dry shampoo by far.</li>
            <li> I suspect if you have dark hair that the white would really show.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoos over the past few years and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Only draw back is it makes my dark auburn hair have a slightly lighter hue because of the light color of the powder.</li>
            <li> I found the first couple times I used it it left a little white in my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is fine but not so much thin (somewhere between) and it tends to get oily around my bangs and sides by day two (probably because of my oily skin).</li>
            <li> I may have not been using the container correctly, but I&#x27;ve not had this much issue dispensing other dry shampoo products.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair and typically any and all hair products will weigh my hair down and make it look even flatter!</li>
            <li> Must have for those who have early mornings and need to fake the clean hair.</li>
            <li> They may not cost as much as other brands but their quality far exceeds the others price.    </li>
            <li> :) The inexplicably high price makes it this a bad purchase for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo has worked wonders on my fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> But because the scent isn&#x27;t very strong, my hair still smelled dirty (which nullifies the term &amp;#34;shampoo).</li>
            <li> I just received my product, and the lid was completely broken on the top, and split down the side.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money buying anything more expensive, this actually makes hair feel soft, not clogged with powder.</li>
            <li> give the product itself four stars (because it runs out so quickly) but this Cherry scented kind gets three because the cherry scent is TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> I have red brown hair and when I use dry shampoo all I see is white at my roots.  </li>
            <li> I spray a few quick bursts onto the roots of my hair, lifting up sections so I can target the roots, let it dry for 30 seconds, then flip my hair upside down and brush out the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how this stuff is supposed to work, but I don&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> I have really oily hair and usually wash it every day which is a hassle.  </li>
            <li> It is long lasting but stays close so that you don’t “advertise” your hair fragrance throughout the day, so to speak.</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any problem with the powder showing up after I rub it in, and my hair has been navy blue, teal, and is now a deep cherry red, so I don&#x27;t know if other people are just over loading their hair or not rubbing it in enough.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair and try to only wash it every 3-4 days</li>
            <li> Other reviews stated that when you first use it, it comes out really heavy so to be sparing with the pressure on the button.</li>
            <li> This is the only dry hair spray I like, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  </li>
            <li> This being the case, I&#x27;ve tried several kinds of dry shampoo - Tresemme, Suave, Batiste, so on.</li>
            <li> (I make several parts through the crown of my hair and spray, or anywhere my hair is looking oily), wait a minute or so to dry, then massage in with fingertips.  </li>
            <li> This is the one and only dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> ive tried tons of different kinds of dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> And it runs out kind of fast, but this price is reasonable for buying multiple cans unlike some of other brands of dry shampoo out there that crazy are expensive.</li>
            <li> I saw some great reviews on it and the price wasn&#x27;t bad at all!</li>
            <li> My long, curly hair takes over an hour to wash, blow out and flat iron.  </li>
            <li> The smell is decent and not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> Doesn’t clean extremely well and thickens the hair due to the powdery deposit that’s hard to remove.</li>
            <li> Doesn’t clean extremely well and thickens the hair due to the powdery deposit that’s hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I bought some dry shampoo from Suave at the same time i bought this, and the Suave stuff leaves dry flakes.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo allows me to wash less frequently, thus extending the life and vibrancy of my color.  </li>
            <li> It might be trouble for those with dark or curly hair, but I&#x27;d suggest trying another scent that doesn&#x27;t leave that much residue.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with dry shampoo in the past, but no complaints on this particular one.</li>
            <li> Lasted a long time as well.</li>
            <li> Yes, it leaves a residue that reminds me of what it will look like when I turn grey.  </li>
            <li> One just has to be careful when spraying it it on because it can leave a powdery white residue on the hair.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be red, as their brown supposedly was for darker hair.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have ridiculously long hair, either.</li>
            <li> I tend to use too much product and am forced to either douse my head in baby powder or rewash.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly - you don&#x27;t need a ton, and if you use too much it will leave a white residue which you have to try very hard to blend in.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to shampoo my fine, thin hair everyday, but I always end up with greasy looking roots the day after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> Due to time constraints, I only like to deal with the process once of twice a week.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t listen to other people about it making your hair white.</li>
            <li> Once the dry shampoo is rubbed in and brushed out, there is still a little bit of residue left over</li>
            <li> Actually works, unlike other dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t keep to you hair very long.</li>
            <li> Batiste&#x27;s dry shampoo works as well as ever, eliminating the oily sheen on my hair and providing lift and volume as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Buying a dry shampoo can be a daunting task since it requires your going out and buying (and buying and buying and buying…)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Batiste dry shampoo Cherry:</li>
            <li> Volume Extend dry shampoo:</li>
            <li> Bed Head Matte dry shampoo</li>
            <li> Though, if you have wavy hair like me, you may not appreciate having to brush your dry, powdery roots.</li>
            <li> Because it is a powder you squeeze out of a bottle (non-aerosol), it didn&#x27;t give me that &amp;#34;choking feeling&amp;#34; I get from spraying dry shampoo all over my head.</li>
            <li> and it takes forever to dry it,</li>
            <li> I even use it sometime after I wash and dry it..</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverStyle Texture Series Energizing Dry Shampoo, 3.4 oz.</li>
            <li> I never tried dry shampoo and decided to buy Batista based on its reviews.</li>
            <li> but you need to follow the directions and work the dry shampoo into your scalp and brush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of dry shampoos</li>
            <li> This product did not have any adverse effects on my scalp and did not leave my hair dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoo...</li>
            <li> When I ran out, I went on a journey to find another dry shampoo in stores, from drugstores to sephora, and it didn&#x27;t matter the cost, brand, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found there are sort of two types of dry shampoo--</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some drugstore brands of dry shampoo</li>
            <li> Batiste also makes a colored dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> With this dry shampoo, I&#x27;ve gone up to five days!!&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> So dry shampoo is a must for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I make about all of my purchase decisions based off of Amazon reviews so that is why I chose this dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the dry shampoos by Pantene or Treseme</li>
            <li> I have now found my go-to dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bottle of dry shampoo after seeing rave reviews on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo bc of all the good reviews, but this is by far the worst dry shampoo I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I should also note that I have blonde hair meaning if you have dark hair get the Batiste Dry Shampoo made for darker hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just very hard to work into the hair, leaves a lot of white resedue that you really need to blend in well, especially with dark hair!</li>
            <li> Maybe it is different if you have really dark hair?</li>
            <li> Just took care of the excessive natural oils between washes.</li>
            <li> but once you massage it in, it blends away (I have dark red hair).  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to dry all of there products!</li>
            <li> I have black hair and don&#x27;t have problems with a white cast.</li>
            <li> Spray it onto the scalp (all over), let it sit a minute, then rub it a little and brush it through, and hair looks and feels almost instantly cleaner.</li>
            <li> (yes it goes on a little bit white, but it doesn&#x27;t remain), and then brush/spread through with my fingers.  </li>
            <li> Like, I wash my hair and by the next morning it looks a little iffy.</li>
            <li> my blonde starts growing out too, spray a little on the root</li>
            <li> I have a hard enough time putting fossil fuels in my car, I&#x27;m definitely not putting them  on my scalp.</li>
            <li> My hands were ice cold, so it took a bit longer than it should have to rub through my hair, but after I did my hair felt fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It adds body, smells great, and takes away all of the disgusting, greasy shine!</li>
            <li> And it did not give it extra body, it made it fall limp.</li>
            <li> For a few weeks prior, I experimented with baby powder</li>
            <li> but just let it sit for a minute to absorb the excess oil then comb it out with your fingers or wide tooth comb</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not very noticeable once you do that.  </li>
            <li> Gives hair body and bounce back after a few days without washing.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s almost completely empty</li>
            <li> Not having to wash my hair everyday has helped to keep my color last longer...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering a few different scents.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wash my long hair but every three to four days due to illness, so I was probably pushing the will-work window, but it did, and I like it!  </li>
            <li> (it isn&#x27;t a replacement for regular washing, but it does mean I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair daily).</li>
            <li> I have dark brown, almost black hair, and it doesn&#x27;t leave white spots in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I use it on &#x27;dirty&#x27; hair days, as well as clean hair days for added volume without weight.</li>
            <li> I was previously using just sauve dry shampoo</li>
            <li> It does not work even half as well as other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it leaves a little white residue on your hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too big of an issue though because brushing it usually lessens it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands including the drugstore brand</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using it every other day, I went through a bottle in maybe 2 1/2~3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, Tresemme, Sauve etc</li>
            <li> I tried to switch and try some other options, but nothing compares to batiste.</li>
            <li> other ppl speak of.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the Cherry scent though, so I&#x27;m not sure about the other scents.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first because my hair is so oily that I did not believe a product could actually work for me.</li>
            <li> My biggest concern is after the container was about half empty, it started blowing out just air and not powder.</li>
            <li> It dissolves after a while, but it is extremely noticeable if you have dark hair.</li>
            <li> The others felt like hairspray or would leave my hair feeling dry and stiff.  </li>
            <li> the less you wet it down the longer</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disclaimer: My hair is dark, thick, extremely long, and wavy with oily roots and dry ends.</li>
            <li> As long as you&#x27;re not jetting a concentrated steam of product onto a small area, there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;ve gotten it well shaken out, it&#x27;s not at all noticeable in my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> My hair needs to last me 3 days at least and this stuff does just what it says.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> but I have dark hair</li>
            <li> At least my hair looked gray instead of white.  </li>
            <li> I have dark purple hair</li>
            <li> This one leaves a residue so thick that people could actually see it during the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Batiste has it down.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t bought it on Amazon since Ulta is just down the road from me</li>
            <li> I have used Tressme dry shampoo in the past and it did absoultely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have to wash my hair everyday and was looking for a product that would allow me to wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> However my hair gets oily again after a few hours (which might just happen to people with an extremely oily scalp like me).</li>
            <li> But, it leaves a thick powdery look in your hair and it makes my hair very flat.</li>
            <li> : I really have nothing bad to say about it actually.</li>
            <li> This stuff saves my hair because it allows me to go a week between washes, so I damage it way less with the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> The L&#x27;Oreal product is less smelly.</li>
            <li> and my hair is still off color slightly.</li>
            <li> I also like this scent, as I was getting sick of the original.</li>
            <li> things like hairspray seem to last forever, but maybe that&#x27;s not a fair comparison.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d stick with suave if it didn&#x27;t smell so bad and dissappear out of the can so quickly.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it&#x27;s so small and costs a lot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll spray a little in and massage through my hair..</li>
            <li> I can usually just get by washing my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past month, as I&#x27;ve gone from washing my hair every day to every other day.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works wonders and doesn&#x27;t leave any weird white spots.</li>
            <li> I mean a LOT of dry shamppos</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair</li>
            <li> That said, I did notice that it leaves a little white color behind.  </li>
            <li> Leaves behind quite a bit of white powdery streaks that can be eliminated by thorough brushing.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasted 7 days of everyday&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> As a mom of 4, I don&#x27;t get to wash my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> Then, after a few uses, it came to me.  </li>
            <li> Eight dollars wasted.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair every day because it gets dried out.</li>
            <li> For those that are trying to keep from washing your hair everyday (like myself)</li>
            <li> but it was still a really heavy application.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair everyday if I don&#x27;t want to.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair heavy like hairspray or anything.</li>
            <li> I spray it in,  give it a few minutes and run my fingers like I&#x27;m dying my hair and then style and go.  </li>
            <li> This is not a good dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;cherry&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t bad - in fact, it didn&#x27;t linger long enough and just left a delicate and subtle scent in my hair.</li>
            <li> I was using Pssst and even tried oscar blandi (so expensive), but I felt like they left a residue in my hair and made my hair, which is thin and flat already, look even flatter.</li>
            <li> Never makes my hair look dull and any little bit of greasy shine goes away</li>
            <li> It looks small but it lasted longer than its spray counterparts.</li>
            <li> This item is usually for $8.99 at Ulta.com.</li>
            <li> then I just style as usual</li>
            <li> and they never worked that well, and left my hair feeling even worse then before I sprayed it on...until I found this one!</li>
            <li> I was definitely not impressed and ended up giving it to my very blonde niece.</li>
            <li> prefer to just spray small bursts at the roots and massage it in.</li>
            <li> Most products smell terrible and/or don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll try it again or not.</li>
            <li> Doesn’t leave a residue behind, even on my pitch black hair.</li>
            <li> I have used tons of dry shampoos, even ridiculously expensive ones and this remains my fav.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry it out or give it a weird texture.</li>
            <li> I was a die hard for Tressemme&#x27;s line for the longest time until on a whim I decided to research Amazon&#x27;s reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions of spraying the product at least 10 inches from the scalp and then rub into roots.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving this, I actually find it also awkward to apply--</li>
            <li> One drawback was that because my hair is so thick, it made it rigid too.</li>
            <li> I suppose thick hair is doomed to be rigid if you dump powder all over it.</li>
            <li> I suppose thick hair is doomed to be rigid if you dump powder all over it.</li>
            <li> Aside from oil another reason I used to wash my hair very often is because I hate that &amp;#34;dirty hair&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I mean NOTHING compares to Batiste.</li>
            <li> Style as usual afterwards!  </li>
            <li> The white powder turns to thick gunk that is very difficult to comb out.</li>
            <li> however i hate that it leaves little white particles in my hair</li>
            <li> Hair becomes hard and tough to style.</li>
            <li> Washing your hair that often is not good for it.</li>
            <li> On day 3 and 4 it starts looking pretty disgusting, and this is a life saver!</li>
            <li> not happy with this product and will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s thick and difficult to comb out.)</li>
            <li> I am addicted to this product and brand.</li>
            <li> Some made it worse.</li>
            <li> She has thin hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried plenty of overpriced dry shampoo products and none of them ever worked for my hair:( when I came across this product, I was hesitant to try it.</li>
            <li> Although I think I prefer the regular scent as the sweetness of the cherry can get sickening after a while.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money:( So sad</li>
            <li> I have tried tons of expensive and drug store brands but nothing works as well for this price.</li>
            <li> The unfortunate consequence of this “dumping” however, thickens and volumizes the hair to a point where it hurts to comb fingers through.</li>
            <li> Not so much because of the terrible smell, but because it made me look like I had a bad case of dandruff from the talc that it sprays into your hair.</li>
            <li> The list of ingredients doesn&#x27;t look too complicated or chemical-scary</li>
            <li> it does give body but it leaves a weird texture in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and ill</li>
            <li> also doesn&#x27;t make my hair itchy or weird feeling.</li>
            <li> Out of all of the dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used, this is the worst.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try a cheaper dry shampoo that didn&#x27;t smell awful.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst dry shampoo I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was because it was too cold out when it was delivered</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t pick this scent again; it tends to be unpleasant sometimes.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad either.  </li>
            <li> HATE the cherry.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll keep it &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; for around 2-3 hours before my hair looks filthy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells terrible.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m here to let you know that I am obsessed with it!!!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells terrible when spraying on...like propane and butane.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> or it dries out terribly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo. I have only bought the cherry scent but it smells amazing. Makes my hair feel so fresh and clean even after not showering for a few days. I have tried tons of expensive and drug store brands but nothing works as well for this price. Will buy again and again!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells great and doesn&#x27;t look like I threw a bunch of powder in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Have bought again and will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> After trying several brands, this line is my favorite.</li>
            <li> The smell is great however i hate that it leaves little white particles in my hair</li>
            <li> I like this stuff as it is a good way to freshen up when I don&#x27;t have time for a full-blown shower. I have black hair and don&#x27;t have problems with a white cast. Follow the instructions of spraying the product at least 10 inches from the scalp and then rub into roots. As long as you&#x27;re not jetting a concentrated steam of product onto a small area, there shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cherry scene is pleasant and a nice added touch.</li>
            <li> After a lot of research on different dry shampoos on the market I finally decided t try Batiste after the great rating I read on a website. I have to wash my hair everyday and was looking for a product that would allow me to wash my hair every other day. I have used Tressme dry shampoo in the past and it did absoultely nothing for my hair. I was very skeptical at first because my hair is so oily that I did not believe a product could actually work for me. I tried this for the first time after not washing my hair for about a day and a half. Overall I feel it works really well and my hair looks and smells good enough that I can get away with brushing my hair out really well and putting in a headband. By the afternoon my hair starts to look kind of greasy again and I have not tried reapplying the spray to see if it helps. The smell is decent and not overwhelming at all. I would recommend this product but I&#x27;m thinking of trying a different brand when I run out of this. I&#x27;m satisified with this product and would purchase it again if I cannot find something that works even better!</li>
            <li> I love batiste! I have dirty blonde hair and yes the product can come off white, but I just tussle my hair with my fingers and it blends in nicely.</li>
            <li> This has a great scent. Perfect for my preteen who has an oily scalp.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a while with my red hair color due to not being able to wash daily! It works well and smells awesome!</li>
            <li> Love it!!  I use this not only when hair needs cleaning but for volume when just washed!  Love the scent as well</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo on the planet! Leaves my hair looking clean and adds body on days I don&#x27;t have time to wash it. Nice light scent.</li>
            <li> Batiste&#x27;s dry shampoo works as well as ever, eliminating the oily sheen on my hair and providing lift and volume as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give the product itself four stars (because it runs out so quickly) but this Cherry scented kind gets three because the cherry scent is TERRIBLE. I chose to save like a buck by buying it instead of my usual and it wasn&#x27;t worth it. The smell is overbearing and sickly sweet, and the bathroom reeks of it afterwards. Just go with the original Clean &amp; Classic for something, well, clean and simple.</li>
            <li> Love this!  I have continue to order a few more bottles.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell. Easy to use. Mess free. Perfect.</li>
            <li> not happy with this product and will not buy it again. It leaves white powder on your hair.</li>
            <li> Very discrete and clean, however it DOES NOT ad texture as other dry shampoos do.</li>
            <li> Spells good and is good.</li>
            <li> This is the only dry hair spray I like, and I&#x27;ve tried them all.  I was even in hospital for 5 days and everyone marveled at how fresh my hair looked.  Ha!  I was anything but fresh, but this stuff works really well!  Smells nice, isn&#x27;t sticky or powdery, I don&#x27;t know what else you could ask for.</li>
            <li> This is not a good dry shampoo. It does not work even half as well as other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> LOVE the other versions (blonde, fresh, tropical).  HATE the cherry.  The smell isn&#x27;t even that bad (although it isn&#x27;t that great).  But it really seems as though this particular one is not made in the same way that the others are.  I had to use way more of this one, and it still didn&#x27;t make my hair look as clean as the other Batiste dry shampoos do.</li>
            <li> SMELLS AMAZING, works amazingly! :)</li>
            <li> Buying a dry shampoo can be a daunting task since it requires your going out and buying (and buying and buying and buying…) many potentially worthless products until you get to the good one. I’m posting this review and will update it whenever I have any new product comparison to add to help those folks who need comparative feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: My hair is dark, thick, extremely long, and wavy with oily roots and dry ends. So please keep in mind the results may not be the same for you if your hair is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batiste dry shampoo Original: Leaves white residue, need to brush off thoroughly before barely getting rid of the matte, gray residue. Doesn’t clean extremely well and thickens the hair due to the powdery deposit that’s hard to remove. Smells like nondescript citrus, unisex fragrance, similar to generic hand soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batiste dry shampoo Cherry: Leaves white residue, need to brush off thoroughly before barely getting rid of the matte, gray residue. Doesn’t clean extremely well and thickens the hair due to the powdery deposit that’s hard to remove. Smells like red fruits but somewhat synthetic. I wouldn’t call this a juicy fruity smell that you sometimes get from good shampoos. The fragrance is on the feminine side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Garnier Volume Extend dry shampoo: Leaves white residue but goes away as you massage you scalp clean. It doesn’t clean well, doesn’t volumize, and only serves to deodorize the hair. Smells exactly like most Garnier Fructis products; like tropical fruits &amp; citrus. Lovely &amp; refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herbal Essences Color Me Happy dry shampoo: Absorbs the oil well as long as you dump a fair amount of the product into your hair. The unfortunate consequence of this “dumping” however, thickens and volumizes the hair to a point where it hurts to comb fingers through. Hair becomes hard and tough to style. Some folks with fine/limp hair may actually appreciate this. Smells exactly like HE Color me Happy shampoo. The fragrance is that of sweet roses. It is on the perfume-y and feminine side. Very lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Refreshing dry shampoo: Cleans very effectively without leaving any residue behind. Hair becomes silky and easy to comb through. Truly a “just washed and done” effect. Smells like nondescript powdery citrus. Smells generic but refreshing nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tresemme Fresh Start dry shampoo: Cleans effectively without leaving much of a residue behind. Hair becomes slightly thickened due to leftover powder so this may be good news for those of you who seek to add volume to your hair. Smells like bright, sweet citrus. The price point and availability at every corner makes this an attractive choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIGI Bed Head Matte dry shampoo: Cleans with low-to-mediocre effectiveness. Leaves behind quite a bit of white powdery streaks that can be eliminated by thorough brushing. Though, if you have wavy hair like me, you may not appreciate having to brush your dry, powdery roots. I always end up looking like part-broccoli / part-hedgehog after that is done. The smell is a syrupy sweet mango/vanilla concoction. It&#x27;s very strong AND persistent - you have been warned. :) The inexplicably high price makes it this a bad purchase for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SheaMoisture Peace Rose Oil dry shampoo: Cleans with effectively. Doesn’t leave a residue behind, even on my pitch black hair. Because it is a powder you squeeze out of a bottle (non-aerosol), it didn&#x27;t give me that &amp;#34;choking feeling&amp;#34; I get from spraying dry shampoo all over my head. The smell was a true rose oil scent. It is on the feminine side, so those who prefer a neutral or masculine fragrance might not like it. It is long lasting but stays close so that you don’t “advertise” your hair fragrance throughout the day, so to speak. Lasted a long time as well. Has a volumizing effect too, in case that&#x27;s also important to you. It looks small but it lasted longer than its spray counterparts. One drawback was that because my hair is so thick, it made it rigid too. Maybe this particular issue is not the product’s fault but my own head. I suppose thick hair is doomed to be rigid if you dump powder all over it. All in all, I’d rather deal with this problem than the rest. Oh, and one more thing I really liked about this product is that it has very natural ingredients that don’t bother sick folks, cancer patients, asthma sufferers, etc. It *seems* safer than the spray cans so far. (I might just keep buying this until the inevitable discontinuation happens. Why is that any product I love like shoes, lipstick, perfume, vitamin supplement, etc. ALWAYS gets discontinued quickly? Does that happen to you too? :-] )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this comparison helped you. Look out for updates as I continue to search for a great dry shampoo that doesn’t leave residue, cleans effectively, doesn’t make the hair rigid, smells awesome and, most important, one that is affordable.awback was that because my hair is so thick, it made it rigid too.

            <li> got here in two days!! the best dry shampoo I have ever used:) I will buy this again! I can&#x27;t wait to dry all of there products!</li>
            <li> Best Dry Shampoo.  LIft up your roots, spray onto your scalp, rub in, and you&#x27;re ready to go.  This is the best dry shampoo (I feel like I&#x27;ve tried them all) and I love the Cherry smell. I use this on my brown hair with blonde highlights, no problem.</li>
            <li> Smells terrible. Unless you like chemical fruity smells.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoos and the different Batiste dry shampoo are ok. Some have a very strong smell, some don&#x27;t, but they all work similarly: they&#x27;re fine, they do their jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;cherry&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t bad - in fact, it didn&#x27;t linger long enough and just left a delicate and subtle scent in my hair. My problem with this &amp;#34;version&amp;#34; is that is was VERY white. I know most dry shampoos leave a white residue, but after rubbing my scalp for a few minutes my hair is back to normal. With Batiste Cherry I had to brush my hair. I have curly hair and I *never* brush my hair. I haven&#x27;t brushed my hair in about 3 years - I comb it with my hands to enhance the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the scent is ok, it works fine (hair looked fine after I brushed the white powder off - I washed my hair 5 days ago and skied for 4 days). It might be trouble for those with dark or curly hair, but I&#x27;d suggest trying another scent that doesn&#x27;t leave that much residue.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo of more than 5 brands I have tried so far. It works well and allows me to go a day or 2 longer without shampooing, which keeps my red haircolor from fading so fast. My hair feels clean and volumized and I love the smell, which is a fresh sort of cherry and and floral blend. And I feel the cherry scent suits my red hair perfectly, what could be better!</li>
            <li> I would not know how it worked as it would never spray.  I thought it was because it was too cold out when it was delivered but it must be clogged or something because it won&#x27;t spray at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great if you are running short on time and didn&#x27;t get to jump in the shower.  I have not gone more than 1 day without washing my hair so I cannot say how great it works on day 2-3 but one day I will be brave enough to try I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the smell...but it works pretty well and makes my hair look nice and clean.</li>
            <li> The best dry shampoo out there..and I love the cherry bottle...the smell is fresh and very nice</li>
            <li> This is hands-down the best dry shampoo on the market. The cherry scent is surprisingly light and I like it better than the others, although Blush is nice as well. This stuff saves my hair because it allows me to go a week between washes, so I damage it way less with the blow dryer. Definitely my HG hair product.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, doesn&#x27;t exactly smell like cherries to me but it still smells nice. However my hair gets oily again after a few hours (which might just happen to people with an extremely oily scalp like me). And it runs out kind of fast, but this price is reasonable for buying multiple cans unlike some of other brands of dry shampoo out there that crazy are expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried plenty of overpriced dry shampoo products and none of them ever worked for my hair:( when I came across this product, I was hesitant to try it. I saw some great reviews on it and the price wasn&#x27;t bad at all! So I gave it a try and I&#x27;m here to let you know that I am obsessed with it!!!!! It Gives great volume to hair and smells amazing! It&#x27;s super cheap too! Awesome for second or third day hair or newly washed hair! I would highly recommend this dry shampoo to anyone!</li>
            <li> For Christmas my sister got me a travel sized version of this exact shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had ZERO hopes for it; I had only used Tresemme up until that point (DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH TRESEMME DRY SHAMPOO. They literally don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re doing over there.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it just before work one morning and OH MY GOD. It took the grease RIGHT out of my hair. AND IT STAYED THAT WAY FOR 2 DAYS. I sh*t you not! I was so thrilled with it, I bought three full sized bottles: In blush, wild and of course, Cherry. I will say the scent isn&#x27;t as pleasing as Tresemme, but that&#x27;s probably why theirs didn&#x27;t do it for me; they focused more on scent than on function.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batiste has it down. I totally recommend it~!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best of the cheap dry shampoos! This leaves virtually no residue and the smell is incredible. The cherry scent is so refreshing and sweet and it soaks up all the oil in your hair leaving it looking fresh and clean. Stock up on these babies!</li>
            <li> This item is usually for $8.99 at Ulta.com. They usually run a sale on this item pay full price $8.99 for the first one get the second one for 50% off. With that said. This item works pretty good. I use it on my daughters hair. She has dark brown hair and as with most dry shampoos, you have to be careful how far away you spray it on to your hair,  the amount you use, and of course how often you use it. Reason being, is on darker hair it can leave a white film or dust like residue on your hair.</li>
            <li> For the price, this works great. It keeps my hair fresh a second day and absorbs the oil.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and it takes forever to dry it, so I wanted something that would help extend the life of a wash. This is great. Spray it onto the scalp (all over), let it sit a minute, then rub it a little and brush it through, and hair looks and feels almost instantly cleaner. (it isn&#x27;t a replacement for regular washing, but it does mean I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair daily). It smells good and works well. I&#x27;m delighted with it.</li>
            <li> Love it ! doesn&#x27;t  leave a white powdery film on hair. Smells great ! Makes hair oil free all day!</li>
            <li> my first try with a dry shampoo. i have dark brown hair and it works great. no residue.</li>
            <li> Seems to work very well</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!!!  I haven&#x27;t bought it on Amazon since Ulta is just down the road from me and that&#x27;s where I get it.. but if they ever quit carrying it then Amazon will be delivering this to my house on a regular basis.  I&#x27;ve tried Paul Mithchel, Big Sexy, Tigi.. even Pantene and Suave .. and nothing .. I mean NOTHING compares to Batiste. I have fairly think medium length hair that tends to get oily. I only condition it a couple of times a week and I like to skip a day between washing.  I hold it about 8 inches from my head and spray all over my scalp then rub it in all over... then I just style as usual and I swear it make may hair look amazing and controlled.  I even use it sometime after I wash and dry it.. I&#x27;ll spray a little in and massage through my hair.. the alcohol in it just helps me style my hair better.  The cherry scent is my favorite...</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BEST dry shampoo I have ever used!  I was a die hard for Tressemme&#x27;s line for the longest time until on a whim I decided to research Amazon&#x27;s reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells INCREDIBLE, and it makes my hair feel so soft after it has dried.  The others felt like hairspray or would leave my hair feeling dry and stiff.  Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> The white powder turns to thick gunk that is very difficult to comb out. It will fill and clog your comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells terrible when spraying on...like propane and butane. This is understandable since the primary ingredients are propane and butane gas! It&#x27;s basically like cleaning your head with gasoline/petroleum products. Exceptionally smelly and flammable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a better product in this category: L&#x27;Oreal Paris EverStyle Texture Series Energizing Dry Shampoo, 3.4 oz. The L&#x27;Oreal product is less smelly. But more importantly: the amount of white gunky powder left in your hair is minimal. It&#x27;s a decent product to use when you are in a time pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Batiste product ended up in the garbage. Not so much because of the terrible smell, but because it made me look like I had a bad case of dandruff from the talc that it sprays into your hair. (It&#x27;s thick and difficult to comb out.)</li>
            <li> Works well, no problems.</li>
            <li> The Dry Shampoo is okay, but please be aware that it leaves a white trace. The bottle lasted 7 days of everyday&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> Cherry is the best! Smells great! Doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling waxy! White powder residue disappears easily when you brush or finger comb it out. Gives my oily hair one more day of wear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the same product with several different smells (fresh, original, sakura, etc.) but this newly-bought cherry smell is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had. Strongly recommend this produce of this certain smell and most importantly, it works!</li>
            <li> Great price and quality</li>
            <li> I was in aweee! I never tried dry shampoo and decided to buy Batista based on its reviews. they hold true :) the smell is pleasant and i was in awwee at how clean my hair looks and the added volume is a plus! i would definitely see myself buying more of this product</li>
            <li> This product is a life saver for two reasons.  One, I am a hot yoga addict.  Two, I have fine hair.  Washing my hair after a yoga (or any exercise) session used to be non-negotiable.  However, after I discovered dry shampoo, I was so pleased to be able to have an alternate solution.  I could spritz the stuff in my hair to soak up the oil, give it a fluff, and have an extra day or two without washing - amazing!  I used to get along ok with suave...and I thought I was good.  It did the job on oilyness and gave an ok texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Batiste is even better than washing!!  This stuff tackles the oilyness, gives my hair volume, but the best part is that it leaves my hair really soft.  I don&#x27;t know what the special ingredient is in this stuff, but it leaves my hair feeling so nice.  After yoga or whatever else I am doing, I just shake the can and spray along the roots. I let it sit for a bit (yes it goes on a little bit white, but it doesn&#x27;t remain), and then brush/spread through with my fingers.  Instant volume and softness.  Suave used to leave it feeling kind of tangled, but I thought that was the price I&#x27;d have to pay.  Well anyway, I love using this stuff.  I can get along 2-3 days without having to wash.  I buy it in bulk whenever I find a good deal.</li>
            <li> Nice smell and helpfull to give my hair a rest from daily shampoo.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the smell but it does the job..</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the best dry shampoo that I&#x27;ve tried.  My long, curly hair takes over an hour to wash, blow out and flat iron.  Due to time constraints, I only like to deal with the process once of twice a week.  Yes, it leaves a residue that reminds me of what it will look like when I turn grey.  It all brushes out though and leaves my hair looking fresh and clean.  Since it smells so great, I keep a can in my gym bag to freshen up my hair after workouts.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, sweet and fresh and light. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this one is a great value. Lots of product in there. It does leave a white cast on my black hair that I have to brush out a little more than with the suave brand. It works very well to get oil out but compared to suave it dulls the shine more. I&#x27;d stick with suave if it didn&#x27;t smell so bad and dissappear out of the can so quickly. I probably won&#x27;t buy this one again though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least five different dry shampoos now, and this is the most recent.  I&#x27;ve mentioned in some previous reviews that I have been on the search for the perfect dry shampoo.  To me, the perfect dry shampoo will keep me feeling pretty, takes away the greasiness in my roots and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  Every dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried previous to this one has either smelled too strong, hasn&#x27;t worked at all, or left my hair feeling heavy and full of product.  As soon as I received this, which I purchased in the &amp;#34;cherry&amp;#34; scent based on others&#x27; reviews (thanks, by the way!) I took it out of the package and tried it out.  It just happened to arrive on the day after I showered.  One thing I noticed immediately was that it dispensed a white powder, which is a good sign because I know it&#x27;ll soak up the greasiness.  My hands were ice cold, so it took a bit longer than it should have to rub through my hair, but after I did my hair felt fantastic.  It wasn&#x27;t weighed down, smelled good, and my hair looked good!  I have used it again a few times and I absolutely love this.  I no longer feel the need to search for a good dry shampoo... I&#x27;ve found it!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it on my second day hair and it just whisks away the grease. Makes my hair look like I just washed it. I have already ordered more.</li>
            <li> I think it works, at least it smells good.</li>
            <li> easy to use and keep hair smooth without feeling that greasy! Don&#x27;t feel like the smell meet my expection though.</li>
            <li> Great product so far!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo. One just has to be careful when spraying it it on because it can leave a powdery white residue on the hair. After spraying, a quick brushing helps blend it in.</li>
            <li> Its my favorite among the batiste dry shampoo scents. I like that it doesnt smell too strong.. I only use it once throughout the day and it really manages the excess oil in my hair when I dont have the time to take a shower.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! I bought the cherry scented one and it smells really good and isn&#x27;t overpowering. I would avoid the tropical one though, it is really strong. Don&#x27;t listen to other people about it making your hair white. Yes it will look that way at first but you need to follow the directions and work the dry shampoo into your scalp and brush. Maybe it is different if you have really dark hair? I have red hair and it wasn&#x27;t a problem. I would highly recommend this if you regularly dye your hair and are looking to keep it from fading too fast. If you are like me, my hair doesn&#x27;t hold color very well so it helped out a lot.</li>
            <li> In all my time working in the beauty industry i have never found a more perfect dry shampoo. This product has no stickyness, no extra ingredients. It simply removes oil and refreshes the hair. Most dry shampoos are sticky, have wierd volumizing ingredients that gunk up hair. This is a pure powder. Must have for those who have early mornings and need to fake the clean hair. This smell is ok. I usually use the original formula with no smell.</li>
            <li> i use this after the gym or running to keep my hair looking presentable, will definitely buy again and would recommend to curly haired ladies</li>
            <li> Absolute best dry shampoo around!! Recommended for any hair type or color! A must have!!!!</li>
            <li> I found the first couple times I used it it left a little white in my hair but I was spraying too close. Plus after a few uses it sprays the best, not as heavy. Great for going from the gym to work when needed. Great when I wake up and don&#x27;t feel like washing my hair. This was my first time buying and I am already planning my second purchase as it should be running out soon. Though it seems to keep going and going.</li>
            <li> I have really greasy hair after one day of not showering. So, this product is my savior. When i use it my hair looks like i just showered.... I bought some dry shampoo from Suave at the same time i bought this, and the Suave stuff leaves dry flakes. It makes me look like i have dandruff.  This Batiste stuff i can apply every day for three days and still not get any white flakes. its awesome.</li>
            <li> Leaves a white powder in my hair even when using sparingly. Scent is nice but too strong.</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> My 16 year old daughter LOVES it!  She has requested it again (which says a lot because she is picky!)</li>
            <li> This is my favorite dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I use it often.</li>
            <li> Overall, I like this product and would buy again.  The smell is nice.  My only complaint is that it leaves a little white residue on your hair.  I have light brown hair and at times, can see the white.  Definitely give some distance between the can and your head before spraying.  It&#x27;s not too big of an issue though because brushing it usually lessens it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of dry shampoos (Tresemme...yuck!) and they never worked that well, and left my hair feeling even worse then before I sprayed it on...until I found this one! I heard about it through a beauty blog (wish I could remember which one) and ordered it on a whim...I&#x27;m so glad I did...this REALLY works. I have light brown hair, and after massaging this in a little bit, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t leave any residue or chalky appearance, and it creates some good volume too!</li>
            <li> This is the best dry shampoo I&#x27;ve found so far. It leaves my hair soft--no feeling any residue. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that I can&#x27;t seem to rinse it off my comb or brush very easily, so I feel like I&#x27;m always putting it back in my hair when I&#x27;m trying to comb it out. I&#x27;ve taken to just shaking my hair out with my fingers, and that works just fine. Once I&#x27;ve gotten it well shaken out, it&#x27;s not at all noticeable in my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> Love how it smells and it seems to clean my hair pretty well.</li>
            <li> Actually works, unlike other dry shampoos.</li>
            <li> Very effective and smells great. I&#x27;ve tried other brands including the drugstore brand Psst.  The smell is very good at masking the chemical smell of the chemicals that are in this spray.  It does a better job of adding volume to my hair than does Psst. I even recommended it to a friend who has a problem with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I would like to return this item, I barely sprayed my hair, and it was super white... Don&#x27;t waste your money:( So sad</li>
            <li> If you need your hair to look gray then you should buy this product :)</li>
            <li> Really happy about this product. As a mom of 4, I don&#x27;t get to wash my hair everyday. This stuff allows me to get away with just a quick pirate wash and not look or smell like a hipster. Love it.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Unbrightens shine, though.</li>
            <li> I have hair, so oily, I have had to wash it every day, since I was old enough to wash my own hair. If I go out at night, I have always had to wash it twice that day. If I didn&#x27;t, it looked like I had not washed my hair in a week. Washing your hair that often is not good for it. I have struggled with that problem for so long, I stopped looking for the answer to make it better. Then my sister showed me this amazing product. Now I can wash my hair every 2-3 days and not look homeless for it. All of the Batiste dry shampoos work great, but this scent is by far my favorite. It smells a bit like a pixie stix. (Not at all like that gross smelling car freshener I was initially concerned about). And bonus- My hair has body for the first time, ever! This stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Fyi, I tried several other brands and this is the best. The others left a white residue, that looked like days of hair spray build up. This one does not do that if you hold the can the appropriate distance from your scalp, while spraying. I rub it in with my fingers, brush it, and go!</li>
            <li> Does its job in taking the oil out of my roots to get me through one more day without a shampoo.  The scent was okay but there was just something about it that I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on.  Then, after a few uses, it came to me.  It reminds me of the old incense cones my mom used to burn in the 70s.  It&#x27;s cherry okay, but a smoky cherry.  Not my preferred scent.  BUT, it does the job.</li>
            <li> Some relevant information - I work two jobs. My morning job consists of being out in the sun and heat for several hours, and my evening job is an inside job, working at the front desk of a hotel. Since job #2 involves dealing directly with the public, I have to look presentable...which isn&#x27;t always an easy task after spending several hours sweating my ass off at job #1. Dry shampoo is pretty much my lifeline on days when I work both jobs. Even if I take a shower every day, my hair starts to get greasy mid-afternoon, so dry shampoo is perfect for a touch-up when a full shower isn&#x27;t a possibility. This being the case, I&#x27;ve tried several kinds of dry shampoo - Tresemme, Suave, Batiste, so on. And this is WITHOUT A DOUBT the BEST dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried. It smells great - very fresh, without that weird, lingering baby-powder scent other brands have. It sprays on VERY heavy at first, so you have to use a light touch until you&#x27;ve depleted the can a bit. As far as application goes, my method is to spray it on my roots only, keeping the can about 6 inches away from my head as I spray. After letting it soak for a minute or so, I flip my hair in front of my face and use my fingers to work the shampoo into my scalp. I flip it back, then use a brush or comb to work in any of the excess. Batiste soaks up oil/grease/sweat, as well as giving your hair texture and volume. I can already tell this is going to be a monthly purchase for me - absolutely worth the price!</li>
            <li> This smells lovely, and lasted me for several months. But then again I used it sparingly. They don&#x27;t joke when they state to spray it from a distance-or else you&#x27;ll see this white stuff all over your hair ! Yikes ! It dissolves after a while, but it is extremely noticeable if you have dark hair. Other than that I love it :D</li>
            <li> As my hair becomes more oily with age and with loss of hair, this dry shampoo allows me to wash my hair every other day instead of daily and now I can leave the hair growth treatment to stay on longer. This product did not have any adverse effects on my scalp and did not leave my hair dry.  Just took care of the excessive natural oils between washes.</li>
            <li> Dry shampoo is an oily haired girl&#x27;s best friend! Smells great, kinda floral. This one is only a bit powdery but run your fingers through and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li> Such as great product for the price. Wonderful fresh scent and gives my hair a lot of body as well as getting rid of oil. Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoo...this is a great affordable go to. Never tried a Batiste I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> A top review said this was a great product and worked well on her dark hair without dulling the color. NOT THE CASE HERE. Eight dollars wasted. Even after massaging it into my hair and combing it through over and over it was still VERY noticeable in my hair. And it did not give it extra body, it made it fall limp. I was definitely not impressed and ended up giving it to my very blonde niece. It smells nice, so at least she can freshen up her hair if nothing else.</li>
            <li> This was one of the first dry shampoos I had ever tried on my blonde hair. When I ran out, I went on a journey to find another dry shampoo in stores, from drugstores to sephora, and it didn&#x27;t matter the cost, brand, etc. - none of them worked as well as Batiste&#x27;s. This is the only dry shampoo, out of the many I&#x27;ve tried, that not only rids my hair of oil, but also gives a great body boost. I get more compliments on my hair after using this product than when I freshly wash and style. I&#x27;ve only tried this scent and the tropical and love them both!</li>
            <li> Smells great and works pretty well! It&#x27;s just very hard to work into the hair, leaves a lot of white resedue that you really need to blend in well, especially with dark hair!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t smell particularly cherry-like, but this is a good dry shampoo. I&#x27;ve found there are sort of two types of dry shampoo-- the kind formulated for volume and the kind formulated for absorbing excess oils. This one is the latter, but does great things for volume as well! It&#x27;s one of my favorite dry shampoos because it actually makes your hair look clean and fresh if you don&#x27;t have a chance to wash it, whereas a lot of newer brands are really just meant to keep your hair from looking limp.</li>
            <li> Pros: This stuff is awesome. I can go five days without washing my hair and it still looks awesome worn down and everything! I have bright red hair and once I spray and run my fingers through my hair, and muss it around a bit, it doesn&#x27;t look powdery at all. The cherry sent smells good but isn&#x27;t that strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I really have nothing bad to say about it actually.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a good dry shampoo. This is the first one I&#x27;ve found that has a fantastic smell with no sticky or white residue. And my hair feels freshly washed every time I use it. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! The cherry scent is light and pleasant. I have very oily hair (as soon a I sleep, I&#x27;ll wake up with some greasiness) I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair every day because it gets dried out. So I just spray the Batiste in and brush it out (following the directions on the can) It&#x27;s really changed my life! I don&#x27;t have to walk around with greasy hair anymore!</li>
            <li> This brand&#x27;s dry shampoo is great, but I did not like the Cherry smell. It does not smell like cherries at all!! The floral one is better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to shampoo my fine, thin hair everyday, but I always end up with greasy looking roots the day after shampooing.  I&#x27;ve tried some drugstore brands of dry shampoo and I found they just didn&#x27;t work.  Batiste is awesome!  It smells so good and is easy to apply.  Best of all, I can use it and go out without looking like I didn&#x27;t wash my hair.  Love it!  That said, I did notice that it leaves a little white color behind.  My hair is light brown with highlights so it&#x27;s not a problem because the white can sort of blend in, but I suspect if you have dark hair that the white would really show.  Batiste also makes a colored dry shampoo.  I did buy some of the brown for my hair to see if it makes a difference, but I haven&#x27;t opened it yet since I&#x27;m still using the Cherry scent.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this dry shampoo! Cuts grease out of your hair when used according to product directions. I should also note that I have blonde hair meaning if you have dark hair get the Batiste Dry Shampoo made for darker hair. If you have dark hair and order this exact product, your hair will look white.</li>
            <li> I adore this product. I didn&#x27;t buy from Amazon because my first purchase was an impulse buy. I first bought the Original scent. I would give that one 4 stars just because the smell was off-putting and it lingered throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I decided to give the Cherry scent a go. I LOVE it. Smells so much better than the Original!&lt;br /&gt;So, this dry shampoo is far better than any of the others I&#x27;ve tried. I can usually just get by washing my hair every other day. That second day is a maybe. With this dry shampoo, I&#x27;ve gone up to five days!!&lt;br /&gt;One day I went to work on the fourth day after washing. One coworker asked if I had just gotten my hair done. Another said my hair looked as if I had just had a fresh blow-out!&lt;br /&gt;I prefer to just spray small bursts at the roots and massage it in. Let it sit for a minute or so and then brush through. Gives my hair just the right amount of body and texture. I have fairly fine light to medium blonde hair past my shoulders. Never makes my hair look dull and any little bit of greasy shine goes away immediately.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great if you&#x27;ve had a long day at work and need just a bit of a freshen-up prior to going to the kids&#x27; functions later that evening. Good as new!</li>
            <li> Okay girls. I have oily hair, naturally. Like, I wash my hair and by the next morning it looks a little iffy. Especially my bangs. So dry shampoo is a must for me.&lt;br /&gt;It takes A LOT of this product to manage oil. Maybe it&#x27;s nice for girls who can go 3-4 days without washing their hair, but for girls like me it takes a lot of product to actually combat it.&lt;br /&gt;Add this to the fact that the bottle is VERY SMALL for the price, and it feels very cheap and ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;Using it every other day, I went through a bottle in maybe 2 1/2~3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Also the scent does not last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you relate to me, I have had good luck with the Aveeno Pure Renewal dry shampoo.</li>
            <li> Does what it says. I can&#x27;t really compare it to anything else since this is the only dry shampoo product I&#x27;ve used but it doesn&#x27;t leave any white residues. My hair gets oily pretty quickly and I usually have to shampoo my hair every day to prevent it from looking gross. This definitely helps save my hair from all the heat/chemicals.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff.  It smells great and gives my hair texture and a new feel.  For those that are trying to keep from washing your hair everyday (like myself), this i a great product for those days in between washes.</li>
            <li> I make about all of my purchase decisions based off of Amazon reviews so that is why I chose this dry shampoo.  For a few weeks prior, I experimented with baby powder and I found it effective but a bit awkward to apply. Upon receiving this, I actually find it also awkward to apply-- maybe it will take some getting used to?  In addition, I don&#x27;t find the formula to make my hair any better than baby powder.  I will probably just stick with what is cheaper next time: baby powder.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo has worked wonders on my fine, thin hair. I have blonde hair and it makes it look like it isn&#x27;t greasy on the second day of not washing it. I bet I could even go a third day if I really wanted to. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is the smell. The cherry smell is a little overpowering, not crazy, but a little too intense for my tastes. I&#x27;ll stick with this bottle until it runs out, but next time I think I&#x27;ll go with a generic smell.</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo. Don&#x27;t waste your money buying anything more expensive, this actually makes hair feel soft, not clogged with powder.</li>
            <li> Smells good, and my entire family is p-i-c-k-y.  I can&#x27;t wash my long hair but every three to four days due to illness, so I was probably pushing the will-work window, but it did, and I like it!  I also ordered the red-hair version, too.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves it, I will be buying more!</li>
            <li> I wrote a review for the tropical scent which I really like.  I also ordered the cherry because it&#x27;s on Prime and I wanted it faster.  So anyway, I was worried that the cherry smell would be overwhelming or that I would smell like chapstick all day.  I&#x27;m happy to report that it is lightly scented and is fruity.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome dry shampoo! it smells great, and it absorbs quickly. I will definitely re-buy this.</li>
            <li> The very best dry shampoo out there.  Spray at the roots on parted hair (I make several parts through the crown of my hair and spray, or anywhere my hair is looking oily), wait a minute or so to dry, then massage in with fingertips.  Style as usual afterwards!  When you first spray it in, it is white but once you massage it in, it blends away (I have dark red hair).  It leaves my hair looking clean and feeling silky soft.  I even use it when my hair is clean because it keeps my hair from weighing down as the day progresses (my hair is baby-fine and somewhat oily), and I love the silky texture it gives my hair.  This is a color-life-saver, particularly if you use temporary or semi-permanent color.  This dry shampoo allows me to wash less frequently, thus extending the life and vibrancy of my color.  One minor issue--I use it almost daily and the can does run out fairly quickly (&amp;#62; 2 weeks).  To me that seems quick because I rarely use any other hair products, so things like hairspray seem to last forever, but maybe that&#x27;s not a fair comparison.  The price is OK though, and to me it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Love this item. Smells fresh and does not leave residue on my blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Smells great works great</li>
            <li> My fav dry shampoo by far. I have very oily hair, so much so that if I wash it at night it is greasy in the mornings when I wake up. I have used tons of dry shampoos, even ridiculously expensive ones and this remains my fav. It smells nice all day and it keeps my hair looking clean and not oily. And its cheap!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My hair needs to last me 3 days at least and this stuff does just what it says. When I&#x27;m feeling grimy on day 2, it&#x27;s like a mini cherry shower without the water. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> this smells nothing like cherry. more like super sweet body spray which i didn&#x27;t care for. it was ok overall. it did make my forehead break out a bit. i would prefer a powder as opposed to spray.</li>
            <li> I bought this over at a Walgreens based on the reviews I read. I didn&#x27;t like the dry shampoos by Pantene or Treseme so I gave this a try. My hair is fine but not so much thin (somewhere between) and it tends to get oily around my bangs and sides by day two (probably because of my oily skin). A couple of light sprays and my hair is good as new without looking like I skipped a day washing my hair. It smells great too. It does leave a bit of a light residue if you have dark hair but just let it sit for a minute to absorb the excess oil then comb it out with your fingers or wide tooth comb and it&#x27;s all good! This will be my go-to from now on. :)</li>
            <li> Favorite dry shampoo ever!</li>
            <li> I have now found my go-to dry shampoo. I have tried several different products and even making my own, but nothing else I have tried works as well as this product, and gives volume. I was using Pssst and even tried oscar blandi (so expensive), but I felt like they left a residue in my hair and made my hair, which is thin and flat already, look even flatter. I love this one because it really seems to absorb all the oil, and the spray is very strong which, in my opinion, seems to make the produce distribute more evenly. I use this after the gym or just to freshen up my hair because I don&#x27;t like to wash it every day. The best part is that this volumizes so much more than any of the other products I have seen. I have also tried various scents and this cherry one is my fav. This is a must have for any girl who wants to freshen up her hair without going through a whole wash and dry session!</li>
            <li> The product came quickly and well packaged but I didn&#x27;t enjoy the overly sweet smell. I bought the blue can too and that one smells fresh and clean and I preferred that one</li>
            <li> This works great, but it definitely does put a white residue in your hair from the powder, but you can blend/rub it in with your hands and it&#x27;s not very noticeable once you do that.  I like the smell of the cherry, and I don&#x27;t think the aerosol is too much like a lot of the reviews said.  Just don&#x27;t inhale when you spray it and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! It&#x27;s really great for&lt;br /&gt;when my blonde starts growing out too, spray a little on the root and I get root and oil cover up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several dry shampoo and this is my favorite that I repeatedly come back to.  The fragrance is pleasant and light, not overwhelming or any where near the unsex / cheap cologne spectrum like some others I&#x27;ve tried.  The list of ingredients doesn&#x27;t look too complicated or chemical-scary so I feel OK about using this on my scalp.  It appears they are using mainly rice starch (to absorb oil) and propellant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily roots and very fine blond long hair so this product works to equalize things and bring back volume.  I keep it in my gym bag, as it&#x27;s great to use after work outs.  Also, if I go camping or somewhere where the showers are dodgy, I make sure I have this with me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this bottle of dry shampoo after seeing rave reviews on it. I have lighter blonde hair, so it often starts to look greasy within the same day of washing. I&#x27;ve used many dry shampoos before. This one leaves a residue so thick that people could actually see it during the day. I won&#x27;t be buying another one of these bottles. While it does take away dome oil, of all the dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used, this one leaves the most white residue.</li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo. I&#x27;ve tried probably a dozen different brands of dry shampoo, and this is the best. It absorbs oil without giving my hair a gross feeling, and the scent is light and pleasant. Will reorder.</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is amazing! I&#x27;ve had several other types, but none have actually made my hair look fresh and clean. This dry shampoo works wonders and doesn&#x27;t leave any weird white spots.</li>
            <li> This is the one and only dry shampoo. I am addicted to this product and brand. I have oily air and cannot skip one day of shampooing, until now! I have tried other brands, Tresemme, Sauve etc and this is the only one that works. Some made it worse. Everytime I try a different brand, I regret it. I also like this scent, as I was getting sick of the original. Where was this all these years!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I wish it came in a bigger size though.</li>
            <li> It works ok but leaves white stuff on my hair and my mom thought I was going grey! Needs improvement. (And yes used the product right!)</li>
            <li> I really like this product!  Smells good too.  I think it works so much better than a more expensive dry shampoo I purchased at Gene Juarez.</li>
            <li> Does the job, leaves hair with some residue, and makes hair so soft. But it goes by way too fast.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I keep it in my gym bag and even spritz some on after washing my hair to give it some texture. I have a pixie and it&#x27;s really all I need most days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of dry shampoo.  Most products smell terrible and/or don&#x27;t work.  This products works really, really well and smells wonderful.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love Batiste dry shampoo. I have dark brown hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave a powdery residue, which is a big plus. The cherry version smells good.</li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo &amp; I love this scent!</li>
            <li> Very quick shipping. Excellent product. Smell great in my hair.</li>
            <li> It works alright, though I think the Tresseme I used to buy worked just a bit better. The smell is good at first, but to me it gets old quickly. It is less if a bright, fruity smell, and more of a deep sweet one. All in all, I would consider buying it again, and it does the job.</li>
            <li> Perfect for &amp;#34;second day hair&amp;#34;!  I love the scent!  I like to use it before I braid my hair so the braid stays in better.  I have very smooth hair, and braids tend to fall out mid day.  This spray gives it a little texture to hold it in place and look perfectly undone!</li>
            <li> Out of all of the dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used, this is the worst. On the plus side, it smells good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t keep to you hair very long. I have thin/short hair, so I don&#x27;t have to use a ton. But, it leaves a thick powdery look in your hair and it makes my hair very flat. It&#x27;ll keep it &amp;#34;fresher&amp;#34; for around 2-3 hours before my hair looks filthy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a fan of this product. It may have to do with my type of hair.</li>
            <li> its cool dont spray in a small area the spray is really strong smelling overall will buy again</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent of the Batiste shampoos so far.  It works for my needs, though it does leave a grayish film on the roots of my hair no matter how much I agitate and work it in.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite dry shampoo. I tried to switch and try some other options, but nothing compares to batiste. It is honestly the best thing I have tried. Other dry shampoos just left a gooey residue, but batiste feels clean and dry. I have very dark hair and I have no need to buy the tinted sprays because the normal stuff doesn&#x27;t leave your roots white or grey. It is the best option out there.</li>
            <li> This product works okay at best. When you spray the smell is so strong it takes your breath away.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  I have dark brown, almost black hair, and it doesn&#x27;t leave white spots in my hair.  The smell isn&#x27;t bad either.  I don&#x27;t use dry shampoos often (this is actually my first one), but I may have to get in the habit of using this stuff to go longer between washes.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really smell like cherries but it does have a light floral fruity scent. works great and soaks up oily hair and makes it look freshly washed. it does give body but it leaves a weird texture in my hair.</li>
            <li> I was previously using just sauve dry shampoo but I have dark hair so it looked like I dropped baby powder on my head. Yes I&#x27;d rub it all in but there would always be some left. With this I dont have that problem and it has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> This was the bomb lol. Shipping came in about one week. I don&#x27;t know what life would be without it. Will buy again &amp; recommend this item.</li>
            <li> great solution especially if you&#x27;re female and can&#x27;t wash your hair everyday. it drys out a lot of oil residue that can build up through a day. I have ordered this product about 3-4 times and keep one at my desk at work and it comes in handy on days where I can&#x27;t wash my hair anywhere.</li>
            <li> If I was blonde it would be perfect for boosting volume, but I&#x27;m brunette so it leaves a white residue. I bought the brunette one and it was perfect.</li>
            <li> This is my fault for not reading the ingredients, but I never expected to find propane in a shampoo. The bottle says highly flammable.  I&#x27;m throwing this away without using it. I have a hard enough time putting fossil fuels in my car, I&#x27;m definitely not putting them  on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Works great! Smells great! Leaves hair less chalky looking and more shiny then other cheap brands</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo works wonderfully on my hair. I have long, fine hair and typically any and all hair products will weigh my hair down and make it look even flatter! But not this one. Smells great, leaves my hair with a nice texture that allows me to add some lift and body without leaving it wet looking and flat.  I use it on &#x27;dirty&#x27; hair days, as well as clean hair days for added volume without weight. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> My favorite dry shampoo! Although I think I prefer the regular scent as the sweetness of the cherry can get sickening after a while.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be red, as their brown supposedly was for darker hair.  I wanted something i could use but not see.  This is not it.  I have red brown hair and when I use dry shampoo all I see is white at my roots.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I normally use tresemme dry shampoo and of course anything is better than tresemme but I love batiste! First of all it (cherry flavor) smells super good. When I spray it in my hair it doesn&#x27;t feel chalky afterwards. My hair feels clean after using it and I never need to reapply it throughout the day since it does such a good job.</li>
            <li> LOVE this dry shampoo. I have used Suave up until now but will definitely be switching permanently to this one.  Benefits:  1. Great scent, but also one that doesn&#x27;t last long or become overpowering.  2. Takes away greasiness from roots of hair while making hair look healthy overall.  3. Gives hair body and bounce back after a few days without washing.  4. Long-lasting effects (much longer than other brands I have tried, including Suave).  5. Great price. A couple more bucks than Suave, but so worth it.</li>
            <li> This is essentially scented powder in an aerosol can, which is typical for most dry shampoos. The cherry scent is very mild, I almost can&#x27;t smell it. I wanted something that would make my hair look/smell good without actually washing it. But because the scent isn&#x27;t very strong, my hair still smelled dirty (which nullifies the term &amp;#34;shampoo). Also, because it is powdery, it eliminated my hair&#x27;s natural shine and made it look matte/dried out. I used this product about 4 times a week over the course of 3 weeks before it ran out. I didn&#x27;t over-spray and I don&#x27;t have ridiculously long hair, either. It just didn&#x27;t last that long. Overall, this product is better than other brands I have tried (like Ojon), but still not quite up to par for me. I recently purchased Not Your Mother&#x27;s Clean Freak Dry Shampoo, and I like it a lot better.</li>
            <li> I love love love this brand of dry shampoo. I have severe fibromyalgia and there are times you just cannot get your hair washed. This gives your hair bounce and takes all the greasy away. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo I have ever had....would highly recommend and I use it often.</li>
            <li> I get my hair colored with bright, temporary colors every 2 months or so. Since the color is temporary, it comes out every time you wash it, so the less you wet it down the longer the color lasts. I bought this to see if I could go longer between washes to keep the color longer, and it has worked out really well! I&#x27;ve found that the best way to use it is to spray it into the roots right away when I get up, and then let it sit while I&#x27;m getting ready. I don&#x27;t rub it in or brush out my hair until I&#x27;m ready to go, and that makes the volume much, much better! I like the smell a lot, and it&#x27;s not overpowering or anything. I&#x27;ve never had any problem with the powder showing up after I rub it in, and my hair has been navy blue, teal, and is now a deep cherry red, so I don&#x27;t know if other people are just over loading their hair or not rubbing it in enough. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with the product and will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I have found to use on my curly hair.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and it was easy to use. Love this product</li>
            <li> Great smell and works all day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried &amp;#34;dry shampoo&amp;#34; before, and I&#x27;m pleasently surpised.  usually when I accidentally put too much product in my hair, or my hair is just kind of greasy- I would use baby powder.  but baby powder gives me wicked static cling.  so it isn&#x27;t my favorite option.. leading to more shampooing.. and more heat damage (I blow dry and straighten).  this is better.  still gives static, but not nearly as much.  the smell is awesome, too.  just a simple spray, rub your fingers through your hair, and you&#x27;re good to go.  I didn&#x27;t have any white dandruff-like flakes other ppl speak of.  I also have never had any dry scalp issues though, so maybe they are simply more susceptible.  it does, at first, give my hair a whiteish silverish hue due to it being basically a spray powder.. but that brushes right out.  I just so happen to have ashy brown/blonde hair, so, on me, it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  regardless, I am trilled I found this bc I tend to use too much product and am forced to either douse my head in baby powder or rewash. this is awesome! thanks :)</li>
            <li> This dry shampoo is great. I use the Cherry scent on my very very dark brown hair without having to worry about how the dry shampoo affecting and dulling the color (the way so many others do.) It also is excellent for adding a little bit of texture, and my hair has never looked better for longer in between washes!</li>
            <li> The smell is fainter than I expected and more &amp;#34;fruity than cherry. Sprays on very white but brushes out well.</li>
            <li> Great product. If you are sensitive to scents, I would suggest getting an unscented one. I love the cherry smell and this dry shampoo really helps to get me through the time in-between washes. Looks like a white powder on the scalp but rubs in well. My hair always looks ten times better after a spritz with this.</li>
            <li> It does smell good. I thought it would be a funky smell.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! My only complaint is it&#x27;s so small and costs a lot.</li>
            <li> For the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair this product is great! My hair is naturally oily and this product takes it all away leaving my hair looking even better and fuller than when it&#x27;s freshly washed. My normal hair is straight, fine, thin and oily. This is my second container purchased.</li>
            <li> Love this dry shampoo!! Smells great too!!</li>
            <li> LOVE this product! Has a great scent and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. Make sure to hold the correct distance from scalp so that the white doesn&#x27;t build up. Even if it does, it&#x27;s easily dissapated by brushing thoroughly through hair. Hair looks clean and shiny, not dulling at all.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t enjoy the smell very much.</li>
            <li> Love love love this dry shampoo.  I usually need to wash my hair every day because it gets oily very quickly.  However, with this, I can go every other day or probably even more, but I haven&#x27;t tried that out yet.  The smell is also nice and refreshing.  Aside from oil another reason I used to wash my hair very often is because I hate that &amp;#34;dirty hair&amp;#34; smell you get if you don&#x27;t, but this totally eliminated that without the product fragrance being too overpowering.  Not only does it make my hair look perfectly clean whenever I use it, but it also gives it some extra volume which I need and love.  Use sparingly - you don&#x27;t need a ton, and if you use too much it will leave a white residue which you have to try very hard to blend in.  Love, love, love - consider me a lifer!</li>
            <li> Smells yummy, and works great between washes!</li>
            <li> I have only used it a handful of times, but so far I really like it. I have had issues with dry shampoo in the past, but no complaints on this particular one. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great smelling not too overpowering.  Works great as well a little spray qas perfect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoos and this is hands down a favorite. Works great, smells good,and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky.</li>
            <li> I like the cherry scent which is light and subtle, but the powder is a bit intense. If you&#x27;re hair is darker than medium/dark blonde then I&#x27;d get the tinted ones instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how this stuff is supposed to work, but I don&#x27;t really like it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to make much difference on my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo bc of all the good reviews, but this is by far the worst dry shampoo I have ever used. It went on bright white and powdery, more so than any other dry shampoo I&#x27;ve tried - even the cheap Suave one. I tried and tried to rub it in. Itsort of worked. At least my hair looked gray instead of white.  I looked at my fingertips, they were covered in white flakes. Then I noticed the counter where I was standing while fixing my hair was also covered in powder. I walked over to where I had been standing when I sprayed my hair and the floor was covered in a fine white film - and I only sprayed 4 quick blasts into my hair!  I can&#x27;t imagine how this product could be used without turning your hair white. I held my arm as far away from my head as possible while spraying and it still did this.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a good dry shampoo, I would reccommend big sexy hair brand (which is a white powder spray) or bumble and bumble (a tinted spray). I don&#x27;t understand how anyone could give this product a good rating. It&#x27;s terrible.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells great. Definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! Works great &amp; smells great!!! Ordered the cherry one. Some sprays can spray white onto hair, but when you shake your hair out it disappears. Will def. be buying this stuff again!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to try a cheaper dry shampoo that didn&#x27;t smell awful.  I have really long hair and try to only wash it every 3-4 days or it dries out terribly. On day 3 and 4 it starts looking pretty disgusting, and this is a life saver! It adds body, smells great, and takes away all of the disgusting, greasy shine! I&#x27;d recommend this to any one.  You can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> batiste is my favorite dry shampoo, and cherry is my go to scent. i&#x27;ve tried tropical and like this one better. the scent isn&#x27;t overbearing. it&#x27;s nice. i&#x27;ve tried pssst brand, and a few others and batiste is the best.</li>
            <li> Leaves a bit of a white residue, but it will rub out...leaves my hair feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> I read that this product is the best dry shampoo out there, so I ordered it. It&#x27;s certainly not the best product that I&#x27;ve used. Other reviews stated that when you first use it, it comes out really heavy so to be sparing with the pressure on the button. I did that but it was still a really heavy application. The product itself is nice. It blends in well. I have dark purple hair and I don&#x27;t see any white after I brush it out. It does also smell better than some other dry shampoos I&#x27;ve used before. I&#x27;ve only used the Cherry scent though, so I&#x27;m not sure about the other scents. My biggest concern is after the container was about half empty, it started blowing out just air and not powder. Now it&#x27;s almost completely empty and I&#x27;ve only had it couple weeks. Again, the product itself is nice and smells good too. I may have not been using the container correctly, but I&#x27;ve not had this much issue dispensing other dry shampoo products. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll try it again or not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past month, as I&#x27;ve gone from washing my hair every day to every other day. I think it does a really good job of soaking up the oil, and making my hair look fresh - I just wish I didn&#x27;t have to use so much! I like the smell, and will definitely keep using this brand!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoos on the market but none work as good as Batiste&#x27;s line.  They may not cost as much as other brands but their quality far exceeds the others price.    The great thing about this specific dry shampoo is that there isn&#x27;t any flaking and it is appropriate for any hair color light or dark.    This product doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel heavy and has a great clean smell to it.  Will continue to buy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister. She has thin hair and she like it.</li>
            <li> works well especially with my long curly hair.. smells great!</li>
            <li> I really like the Batiste Dry Shampoo. It works very well and allows me to do quick touch ups on my oily hair so I don&#x27;t have to wash my hair everyday if I don&#x27;t want to.</li>
            <li> If you ever need to &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; shampoo your hair as you don&#x27;t have time to wash it or as they say now we should&lt;br /&gt;only wash our hair 2 or 3 times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I have used a LOT..... I mean a LOT of dry shamppos and THIS IS THE VERY BEST. In fact I just&lt;br /&gt;ordered 3 more.  Ilove it.. it cleans yourhair just as if you washed it and has a nice faint sent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d RECOMMEND to everyone.</li>
            <li> My absolute favorite dry shampoo. Have tried lots of others but always go back to batiste. The cherry one is my favorite smell.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have very fine straight hair that is prone to looking limp and greasy. This spray does soak up the grease, and is great for freshening up on days that I don&#x27;t shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like other dry shampoos, it is a fine absorbent powder in an aerosol can. Make sure you shake the can well before use to resuspend the powder and pump up the aerosol. I spray a few quick bursts onto the roots of my hair, lifting up sections so I can target the roots, let it dry for 30 seconds, then flip my hair upside down and brush out the product. When you first spray it, it will leave a film of white powder, which disappears as you brush/comb it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does have its limitations-- I have to use it sparingly or else it gives my black-brown hair a grayish tint. If you&#x27;re fair-haired you can probably go to town with it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It really soaks up all the excess oil in no time.</li>
            <li> I chose this one since it was voted the best dry shampoo and I love it. I have the oiliest hair in existence and it looks and feels clean after I use this!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Not having to wash my hair everyday has helped to keep my color last longer... and I really love this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! I have wavy hair and ill admit it works better when I straighten my hair out than when I let it do its wavy thing. But still by far one of the best dry shampoos I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s not as good as lush dry shampoo but it&#x27;s ALOT easier and faster to put on.</li>
            <li> BEST STUFFF!!! Works soooo great. ive tried tons of different kinds of dry shampoo. This one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Effective! Smells nice.</li>
            <li> I love this dry shampoo.  I stumbled upon this product through a subscription service and new I needed to upgrade to a larger size.  The smell is wonderful but not overbearing and doesn&#x27;t last very long.  It just gives your roots and follicles a nice refreshing lift and oil absorption.  The powder is white and I do have black hair, but I just leave it for a minute to do its magic and gently run my fingers through my hair, tease my roots and pat any excess until the white is no longer showing.  Even better, I will apply just before bed and when I awake, there is no residue and my hair looks and smells fantastic.  This is a must for your gym bag or anyone who lives a busy lifestyle and needs a quick pick me up! Great for extra volume and root lifting!</li>
            <li> This is the worst dry shampoo I have ever tried.  When you spray it on, it turns your hair a white/gray looking color from the powder. Once the dry shampoo is rubbed in and brushed out, there is still a little bit of residue left over and my hair is still off color slightly. For this reason, I am rating this product with one star.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t pick this scent again; it tends to be unpleasant sometimes. I haven&#x27;t tried any other dry shampoo, so I can&#x27;t accurately compare Batiste to others. It gives my hair an extra day or two without washing (though I almost always have my hair in a ponytail), but it&#x27;s not some amazing product that makes it look or feel freshly-washed. I like that it gives my hair more body, but it doesn&#x27;t absorb quite as much grease as I expected. I feel I&#x27;m applying the right amount, but it&#x27;s never quite enough. As it is, though, I&#x27;d rather be with it than without it. I&#x27;m ordering a few different scents.</li>
            <li> Works well but I don&#x27;t really enjoy the smell</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find the brand I was originally looking for, but after reading the reviews I decided to give this one a try. I ended up liking it even more than the one I was looking for! Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair heavy like hairspray or anything. Leaves your hair feeling soft and fresh and smells good! Definitely worth ordering!</li>
            <li> I just received my product, and the lid was completely broken on the top, and split down the side. There&#x27;s no way to fix it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a great product so far. I have curly, unruly hair and I must straighten my hair anytime moisture hit it. So, I try to avoid shampooing and conditioning unless I absolutely have to. I&#x27;ve tried other dried shampoos that leave a build up and do not leave my hair as shiny and oil free as this one. It&#x27;s hot and humid where I am and this dry shampoo maintains my style without it looking powdery or dry. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> easy to use. If i want to go outside in a hurry, I can use it in several min. Great!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing and does not make your hair grey or powdery looking like other dry shampoos! It makes your hair look fresh all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of dry shampoos over the past few years and this one is by far my favorite. I am not a fan of the smell of it, but it works very well. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stringy and gross looking, it leaves it soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have really oily hair and usually wash it every day which is a hassle.  Heard about this and thought I&#x27;d try it. This works better than any dry shampoo I&#x27;ve used before.  I spray it in,  give it a few minutes and run my fingers like I&#x27;m dying my hair and then style and go.  My hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy and has body too! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Best dry shampoo - I use it all the time!</li>
            <li> this is the best smelling and working dry shampoo ever!! a new must have for me!!</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling dry shampoo that I have ever used.  It also really seems to put a nice refresh on my hair on the days that I do not wash it.  It doesn&#x27;t dry it out or give it a weird texture.</li>
            <li> Works great and smells good</li>
            <li> I bought this because it was nearly a third of the price of a higher end brand I liked. I was not disappointed. It worked just as well.</li>
            <li> True things about this product (neither good nor bad IMO, just things):&lt;br /&gt;- it does not smell like cherries&lt;br /&gt;- it sprays a white powder onto my hair, which is brown&lt;br /&gt;- a quick shuffle through my hair with my fingers disperses the powder just fine&lt;br /&gt;- this is the best dry shampoo I have used (I have previously used suave, tresemme and a nasty ojon kind which smelled like nose cancer but was highly effective otherwise), good price and also doesn&#x27;t make my hair itchy or weird feeling.</li>
            <li> The product works great!  I have short hair and I normally can&#x27;t go even a day without washing. However, I can go up to three days between washes (tho I likely won&#x27;t!) when using this product. Only draw back is it makes my dark auburn hair have a slightly lighter hue because of the light color of the powder. Maybe the one for brunettes is a better choice for me. All around great!</li>
            <li> Nice smell, does not let my hair white like other I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different dry shampoos and this is by far the best product I have ever used.  And it smells great!  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really tell or notice if this makes a difference in my hair or not.</li>
            <li> This product is great! Smells fantastic and it really helps on days I don&#x27;t wash my hair!</li>
            <li> This product does work! As long as you don&#x27;t mind spraying your head with butane (yes, butane is the first ingredient!) then you&#x27;ll love it. The 3 star review is for the ungodly amount of chemicals that are on the list that one would think you shouldn&#x27;t be spraying directly on your head....</li>
