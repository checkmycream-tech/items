            <li>The company makes many excellent skin products.  </li>
            <li>The Face Screen is a good value.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used a bioelements product that I don&#x27;t love!</li>
            <li>Buy it and you&#x27;ll love it, too!</li>
            <li>one is ok..</li>
            <li>Really enjoy the product!</li>
            <li>I love going to the pool during the summer</li>
            <li>never looked better</li>
            <li>I have used this product for more than 8 years.  </li>
            <li>My favorite day  cream.  </li>
            <li>Why not make it super pleasant and easy?</li>
            <li>The cream is light and very easy to apply, under make-up, or even with no make-up.  </li>
            <li>My skin is neither dry nor oily and I find the texture of this product to be perfect.</li>
            <li>I am a redhead and tend to burn easily</li>
            <li>Strong SPF</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and spend a lot of time in Tahoe which is high altitude.  </li>
            <li>Great product, especially if you have a pool or are out in the sun a lot.  </li>
            <li>She swears by this product line and was extremely happy to receive this as a present.</li>
            <li>Rich and not greasy.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this product when I saw it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>so the SPF 50 really excited me.</li>
            <li>Bioelements SPF 50 Broad Spectrum Face Screen is possibly the best combination moisturizer and sun protection out there.  </li>
            <li>This product really does deserve five stars - and more.  </li>
            <li>My eyes do get irritated easily from most sunscreens, so I do have to be careful with many products.  </li>
            <li>This product really protects but is light in texture smells clean.</li>
            <li>So no, I&#x27;m not crazy about this product.</li>
            <li>I discontinued this(and switched back to my original daytime moisturizer)  but still wear the Bioelements Sleepwear at night and that seems to be a better combination.  </li>
            <li>If u have dry skin&lt;br /&gt;You will probably love it!</li>
            <li>I tried this at a friends and was pretty excited because my skin didn&#x27;t react at all, and at 50 SPF I can feel really protected in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved all the other Bioelements products that she used during my facial, so I thought I would love this moisturizing sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>Although I did not get the moisturizer sunscreen near my eyes, it was strong enough to irritate them and I felt immediately better</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years and really enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth a million dollars to me and my red rosacea face!</li>
            <li>I use it 12 months a year even though I live up north.</li>
            <li>I recommend for anyone with skin that is normal to sensitive.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is more money than I&#x27;d usually spend</li>
            <li>I have a few things that work fine for me (Eucerin has a night cream for rosacea sufferers that I use), but I had yet to find any product with SUNSCREEN that didn&#x27;t make me feel like my face was on fire.</li>
            <li>but don&#x27;t get near eyes if your going to sweat , it will burn.</li>
            <li>Hazard score key for this in Skin Deep is 8 / 10 (very High hazard).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 and have dry skin and really need the moisture and SPF</li>
            <li>I generally like Bioelement products and&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Bioelements for years and highly recommend it for dry skin.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s glass and too heavy</li>
            <li> And you should be using sun screen every day, all year round.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent service and product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bioelements for years and highly recommend it for dry skin. Everybody thinks I&#x27;m 20 years younger than I am!</li>
            <li> My skin is neither dry nor oily and I find the texture of this product to be perfect. Rich and not greasy. Having had skin cancer, I wear it every day; rain or shine. Only complaint - the packaging. It&#x27;s glass and too heavy so when I travel, I transfer it to a plastic container.</li>
            <li> I generally like Bioelement products and&lt;br /&gt;This one is ok.. Strong SPF but I have oily skin and this does&lt;br /&gt;Not help that. I still will use it sparingly. If u have dry skin&lt;br /&gt;You will probably love it!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used a bioelements product that I don&#x27;t love!</li>
            <li> 1st time using this particular one , it feels a little rough , not smooth as I was expecting but it definitely protect my face!!</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and spend a lot of time in Tahoe which is high altitude.  This product really protects but is light in texture smells clean.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years and really enjoy it.  It is perfect under my makeup and I like the SPF protection.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy the product!</li>
            <li> I use several bio element products . I like this one when I know I&#x27;ll be outdoors playing tennis but don&#x27;t get near eyes if your going to sweat , it will burn. I&#x27;m 50 and have dry skin and really need the moisture and SPF so I would recommend but not if you have oily skin. I,pat it on from my forehead to my chest.</li>
            <li> I have used Bioelements SPF 50 Face Screen for the last 3 summers.  Great product, especially if you have a pool or are out in the sun a lot.  Don&#x27;t know of any other moisturizer that offers SPF 50.</li>
            <li> For Sunscreen, according to Skin Deep, should say No to Oxybenzone, which is 6% here. Hazard score key for this in Skin Deep is 8 / 10 (very High hazard). Should stay away from this for your health.</li>
            <li> I bought this after getting a facial where they used Bioelements products.  In the beginning I used it in the morning and Bioelements Sleepwear in the evening.  Even though I have oily skin, my face ended up having a shiny  appearance by the end of the day.  I discontinued this(and switched back to my original daytime moisturizer)  but still wear the Bioelements Sleepwear at night and that seems to be a better combination.  So no, I&#x27;m not crazy about this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from an esthetician recently.  I loved all the other Bioelements products that she used during my facial, so I thought I would love this moisturizing sunscreen.  Although I did not get the moisturizer sunscreen near my eyes, it was strong enough to irritate them and I felt immediately better once I washed my face.  I had to return the product.  My eyes do get irritated easily from most sunscreens, so I do have to be careful with many products.  I did notice that the other Bioelements product with the lower SPF 15 did not bother my eyes, however.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this product when I saw it on Amazon. I love going to the pool during the summer and I adore Bioelements products. Unfortunately I can get better coverage using a drug store SPF 30 lotion for my face. I am a redhead and tend to burn easily so the SPF 50 really excited me. I feel I should mention that I only go out for two hours at a time and never get my face wet. I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the best. It has saved my face from brown spots. I use it 12 months a year even though I live up north.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while, and since beginning daily application I have not been burned and my skin&lt;br /&gt;has never looked better</li>
            <li> I have used this product for more than 8 years.  Recently moved from one climate to another.  Still works great!  I recommend for anyone with skin that is normal to sensitive.</li>
            <li> I gave my daughter this for a Christmas present.  She swears by this product line and was extremely happy to receive this as a present.</li>
            <li> My favorite day  cream.  It is EXCELLENT.  I have been using it for years.  Buy it and you&#x27;ll love it, too!</li>
            <li> I have rosacea that has gotten worse as I&#x27;ve aged. At this point, there are very few products I can put on my face that don&#x27;t have my face burning and red as a tomato in seconds. I have a few things that work fine for me (Eucerin has a night cream for rosacea sufferers that I use), but I had yet to find any product with SUNSCREEN that didn&#x27;t make me feel like my face was on fire.

            <li> Bioelements SPF 50 Broad Spectrum Face Screen is possibly the best combination moisturizer and sun protection out there.  The company makes many excellent skin products.  The Face Screen is a good value.  It lasts a long time.  The cream is light and very easy to apply, under make-up, or even with no make-up.  The cream is not greasy, nor does your face have a shine.  Put it on in the morning and you are ready to go, knowing your delicate face is protected from the elements and is also being nourished.  This product really does deserve five stars - and more.  And you should be using sun screen every day, all year round.  Why not make it super pleasant and easy?</li>
