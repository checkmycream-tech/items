            <li> A little pricey but the reward is worth it. The Goldleaf fragrance is so rich and timeless. I hope they never stop making this!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance for my home. Guest ask me about it saying that it&#x27;s so pleasing.</li>
            <li> I get compliments repeatedly from guests for the unbelievably lovely scent of this candle.  It even scents the room when it&#x27;s not lit!  Long lasting, burns 60+ hours.  I&#x27;ve purchased several as gifts for friends and relatives alike.  Albeit a pricey candle, you get what you pay for.  After smelling this delightful aroma you&#x27;re sure to become an immediate fan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Thymes Home Spray for many years.  It&#x27;s a first for the candle. I must tell you I&#x27;m very happy with the aroma and I definitely will order again and again. It will be wonderful for gifts for any occasion. üëèüëèüëè</li>
            <li> I have purchased this candle many times from local stores and the scent is always quite strong.  It can be smelled throughout the house.  In this one, however, the scent was so faint that you can/could barely smell it in the room where it was burning. Obviously, it had been sitting on the seller&#x27;s shelf too long (candles lose their scent with \\&quot;age\\&quot;).  I will not be purchasing this item from Amazon&#x27;s vendor again.</li>
            <li> This candle looks lovely and it smells beautiful!! It leaves a lovely, but not overpowering, fragrance throughout the house. I&#x27;ve used other Goldleaf products as well and have never been disappointed!</li>
            <li> This candle smells so good. It smells even when not lit. Everyone who comes into the house asks about it.</li>
            <li> PURCHASED THIS TO GO WITH THE ROOM SPRAY.  IT HAS A DELIGHTFUL SCENT AND THE CANDLE LASTA A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> The Goldleaf line smells so luxurious!  I bought the candle, soap, and lotion and put it in a basket as a hostess gift.</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance in the world.You never get sick of this fresh smell. I have one in esach bath room and the kitchen&lt;br /&gt;.Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I have always loved the way this candle makes my house smell.  Delightful, without over perfume smell.  I moved and could not find a dealer in my new town so I ordered on line, but now I have found a supplier.</li>
            <li> Such a lovely scent!  I was given one as a gift years ago and was so happy to find it on Amazon. It&#x27;s such a wonderful affordable luxury. Love it!</li>
            <li> Love these candles and paired with the room spray - wonderful scent. Not for just the powder room. Love this.</li>
            <li> This product is great! Good price and arrived on time.  Very happy with the service and product.</li>

            <li> Thymes has the best candles anywhere...they burn beautifully, last forever and smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> This Goldleaf Thymes candle is one of my first perfumed candles I purchased from amazon.com  I have been trying several brands they sell of a perfumed aroma.  Goldleaf may be the most favorite candle of all that I have purchased to try.  It will be a great gift idea for family and friends.  The aroma, to me, is that of a fine perfume -----meaning that the aroma is not shy, but lush with its scents.  I also enjoy how very much it adds to my living room when burning, of its lovely scent. It burns very well, evenly, and lasts for a long time, also.</li>
            <li> Thymes makes great products that give your home a wonderful scent with a large variety to pick from. Goldleaf is my favorite.</li>
