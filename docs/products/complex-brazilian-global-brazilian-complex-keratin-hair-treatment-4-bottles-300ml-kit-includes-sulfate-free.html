            <li>The price is great.</li>
            <li>I love it!!  </li>
            <li>It was very effective.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the $500 salon treatment.</li>

            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>still be good.</li>
            <li>coz i took really good care of it, since the moment i got my treatment</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, my hair is easier to maintain.</li>
            <li>Maybe because my skills are not so good</li>
            <li>therefore it is not as good as the salon.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with my purchase and glad I decided on the bundle with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I have to be honest and say that it&#x27;s not as good as keratin from the salons, but for a DIY it&#x27;s pretty good!!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>My hair is beautiful and smooth.</li>
            <li>I stumbled across this looking for the top rated keratin system, so i went on a limb and ordered it!</li>
            <li>and it was amazing,</li>
            <li>My friend used this product as well, her hair is curly and it has done an amazing job.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>This is light putting a great conditioner on your hair and reaping the results of a perm from it.  </li>
            <li>In fact it smelled rather nice.  </li>
            <li>I could never leave it Curley because I didn&#x27;t have nice curls and straightening it takes forever.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this product !!</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply and use.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>The chemicals are very strong.</li>
            <li>Very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I was very impressed.  </li>
            <li>More effective than having the &amp;#34;blowout&amp;#34; done at a salon.  </li>
            <li>Therefore it is important to do in a room with good ventilation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product does sting your eyes and my throat was irritated a bit, make sure you have a well ventilated area when doing this.</li>
            <li>I love my hair</li>
            <li>and I love my hair now</li>
            <li>I love this product  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I just love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a keratin treatment before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my hair is now</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair is now</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>More frizz has returned but it&#x27;s manageable and my wave has returned.</li>
            <li>It is getting better about not looking oily as time</li>
            <li>I was able to see the before and after on a client.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>For better results leave in hair for 3 days.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and conditioner it came with.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>But when i condition i have to comb out my curls to avoid more tangles when finished.</li>
            <li>I am pleased on the outcome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid for keratin treatments at the salon (3 different times) and none of them turned out as good as this one!!  </li>
            <li>Make sure you use the appropriate amount to.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with how this product transformed my hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been in salons for many years to have keratin done and</li>
            <li>I was not expecting great things, but this really works.  </li>
            <li>you need to make sure you are in a ventilated area to apply this.</li>
            <li>I love the way it leaves my hair and each treatment lasts over 6 months.</li>
            <li>and i believe it helps to make the hair more manageable and</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is a good product which is worth trying even though it took me around 2 hours and end up with aching arms and fingers</li>
            <li>I love the treatment worked</li>
            <li>I love it though</li>
            <li>the more fried and damaged my hair became.</li>
            <li>This treatment does not need for you to leave it in for the typical 3 days which is awesome because I can&#x27;t make it more than 2 days without washing my hair ever!  </li>
            <li>Right away when you are washing your hair with the after care sulfate free shampoo and conditoner you can tell the difference and that it is going to be amazing!  </li>
            <li>The thing that I love best about it is, you blow dry your hair and then straighten.  </li>
            <li>I never had such an amazing hair!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth the money and time!!</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that my hair has never looked so good after drying naturally.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second wash now and still have beautiful frizz free hair!</li>
            <li>I will try to keep you updated but so far I am extremely happy.  </li>
            <li>It took me 2 1/2 hours to complete the process and my hair looks great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After more than a week since i done the keratin treatment, my hair is getting more and more easier to maintain and it is even smoother and silkier than the first wash.</li>
            <li>My hair gets frizzy really easily</li>
            <li>The instructions were easy to follow and they have a website that does the steps for you to observe before applying this process and what to expect.  </li>
            <li>even though it&#x27;s easy, it IS time consuming.</li>
            <li>priceless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: definitely use a fan and make sure your area has great venilation.</li>
            <li>I did &amp; had no problems with lingering fumes, but I can see how it could easily be an issue depending on the layout of your space.</li>
            <li>It was really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I think the product is worth the money, I&#x27;ll be able to use this keratin treatment another 3-4 more times &amp;</li>
            <li>Easy to apply</li>
            <li>Product is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>are easy to follow.and</li>
            <li>and it was still too strong.</li>
            <li>I have given it a strong recommendation to three others who will be buying.  </li>
            <li>I will be getting my favorite keratin conditioner, KeratinPerfect (sephora), but this is a good buy for the clarifying pre shampoo, which u need to make sure to open the hair&#x27;s cuticle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As the directions stated I did just comb it through with a fine tooth comb</li>
            <li>this stuff is the real deal!The important ingredients are at the top of the list!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to enjoy my summer and not have to be worrying about my hair.</li>
            <li>I waited two days, then washed it using the sulfate free shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I tried thos product in hopes of being hair care stress free for a bit.</li>
            <li>The content of two of the bottles spilled; one of them was precisely the Keratin treatment..</li>
            <li>And the best part is it doesn&#x27;t feel dead or damaged.  </li>
            <li>It worked well to straighten, but wasn&#x27;t as shiny or as smooth as the blowouts I had done at the salon.</li>
            <li>The shampoo never leaves a residue &amp; the conditioner is light &amp; moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I washed 36hrs after treatment with fabulous results.</li>
            <li>and my bf just noticed my hair was nice and straight as Im writing this review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>days ago, I had my wonderfully patient sister help me with applying the treatment after I washed my hair with the clarifying shampoo and blow dried it.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I have a &amp;#34;Tangle Teaser&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I have had professional keratin treatments done before, but nothing has been a good as this product.</li>
            <li>The second day I did not wash my hair and it stayed looking clean longer and was still straight and awesome.</li>
            <li>The second day I did not wash my hair and it stayed looking clean longer and was still straight and awesome.</li>
            <li>Also its great that you do not need to wait 4 days to wash, although after all the work blowdrying and flat ironing, im gonna wait anyways&lt;</li>
            <li>My hair felt light, strong &amp; best of all straight with absolutely no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes out almost perfectly straight with just the blow drier, so if you run the flat iron through your hair quickly it will be perfect.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I got them, and watched YouTube video learned how to apply them.</li>
            <li>Considering this IS my first time ever using keratin i am fully satisfied.</li>
            <li>Never mind how much I was coughing as a result of still inhaling those fumes, even in a well ventilated room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through great pains (literally) to follow all of the instructions, I expected to see spectacular results.</li>
            <li>to blow dry, and I would still have fly aways and frizz.</li>
            <li>Hair generally feel very healthy and are not falling at all.</li>
            <li>Let just say I would happily leave the house with wet hair</li>
            <li>Me and my sister in law tried this, followed directions EXACTLY as per video instructions and the results were great until we washed our hair 3 days later.  </li>
            <li>I did wait the full 72 hours before washing out the product</li>
            <li>This changes them to a healthy shiny glow and very manageable.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if this is true or not.</li>
            <li>the underneath is very Curley and the top is a mix of wave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m completely satisfied with my purchase, Keratin Research has saved me so much time &amp; frustration with my hair.</li>
            <li>then you don&#x27;t have to wait the full 3- 4 days</li>
            <li>then you should wait the full recommend 3-4days and use the maximum 450 degrees heat for optimal penetration of the product.</li>
            <li>And its is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>my hair is super curly and this product makes my dream come true now</li>
            <li>the longer I have my treatment in my hair.to smooth the fly aways down because there wasn&#x27;t any!  </li>
            <li>It is not that straight, but it made my hair less bulky, the shampoo and conditioner are ok, don&#x27;t expect them to be great.</li>
            <li>I decided I would write a quick review.</li>
            <li>Simply the best product I used in the last 2 years!</li>
            <li>A 10 min shpwer quickly escalates into a 45 min one.  </li>
            <li>I am overall very satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li>It comes out sooooooooo straight right away!!  </li>
            <li>im in love with this cant live without it now&lt;</li>
            <li>Directions and straight forward and product is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is amazing, my hair is frizz free, I don&#x27;t need to blow dry or iron it.</li>
            <li>i had it done january 15th, for the fisrt 4 weeks i had to to nothing to my hair, it dry completely straight which is great</li>
            <li>The sticky film washed out leaving soft and very smooth hair.  </li>
            <li>The heat greatly improved my hair&#x27;s texture, although still a little filmy/sticky.  </li>
            <li>and it was smooth, shiny and straight.  </li>
            <li>and it was smooth, shiny and straight.  </li>
            <li>I got straight and smooth hair.</li>
            <li>While my roots were straight and smooth, the closer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 yrs and find it economical to use on my neck-length hair.</li>
            <li>(totally worth it)</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I really love my results which were better than what I expected.</li>
            <li>I feel I deserve some kind of compensation.&lt;br /&gt;Not even a FRAGILE sticker on the envelope.</li>
            <li>I liked it but will probably try another brand next time.</li>
            <li>Which is way i gave it 4 stars, 1 star off for the conditioner having more fragrance then important ingredients like the keratin and amino acids, they are very low on the list!. .</li>
            <li>WOW it air dried pretty quickly and looks GREAT!</li>
            <li>The reviews are right.</li>
            <li>It worked great first few weeks.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product &amp; brand to anyone to wants to wake up with beautiful hair everyday.</li>
            <li>, this was the first time I&#x27;d ever tried any kind of lasting treatment.</li>
            <li>Will have to update on how long it lasts, but Im happy so far</li>
            <li>and it was still nice and smooth feeling and dried faster.  </li>
            <li>and it was still nice and smooth feeling and dried faster.  </li>
            <li>After I did it, my hair looked straight and smooth, it saved a lot time for me to get ready , since my hair is frizzy and puffy.</li>
            <li>On the left side my hair dries more curly while the right side has a wave</li>
            <li>oh no, I must have used too much!</li>
            <li>Second time around with these products and I love them.</li>
            <li>I included a during 3 day treatment and after first shower photo.</li>
            <li>I am guessing I will most likely do my hair again in 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Left it on for 6 more hours.</li>
            <li>Like a real brazilian blow out!</li>
            <li>Started going about my day and since it is summer and hot out I had to shower after I was done working.  </li>
            <li>Came fast!</li>
            <li>is not the first time i have done keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>(I washed my hair 3 times to make sure that it was super clean for the application process, and it made my easily tangled hair even more of a mess than usual.</li>
            <li>I have not used the flat iron once, which is huge!</li>
            <li>Make sure your flat iron is a 450 degree one.  </li>
            <li>So if you have a friend to do the flat iron for you, i believe results will be even better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Upon learning the Chi Enviro treatment appeared to be off the market, I decided on this one based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Let me say this: those positive reviews are so warranted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far my grandauthter&#x27;s hair has been straight and beautiful for the past month.</li>
            <li>were super soft after 48 hours and washing, lot of frizz went away.</li>
            <li>It is the first product I have tired and felt 100 percent happy with.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Directions are simple &amp; having been through &amp; watched my stylist do this on my hair for years, I found the application to be easy.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t as good or as long lasting as this stuff is!</li>
            <li>Good product.very efficient and last for a long period of time.it does not harm the hair.deffinitly will order it again</li>
            <li>The product is good for the hair and it last long.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You have to consider certain factors that will impact the results on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not sure if I would buy it again since it didn&#x27;t work as well, but it is the only good option I have found for that salon blowout that everyone has stopped doing!</li>
            <li>Definitely saves time blow drying, but one area that Irushed thru since it was the last section, didn&#x27;t really pick up the keratin as much, you need to be sure to do section by section as if you were coloring the hair!</li>
            <li>( I fell asleep on it) and straight in the front.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>, my hair was straight before but dry,unhealty, and now i just shower every day</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t straighten hair that much, but it lessens waves.</li>
            <li>The clarifying shampoo worked really well.  </li>
            <li>At work people thought I got hair extensions because my hair seemed so much longer</li>
            <li>At work people thought I got hair extensions because my hair seemed so much longer</li>
            <li>it done in a very well ventilated area.</li>
            <li>Then did the straight iron to it while some remained in my hair.</li>
            <li>Straight ironed it again.</li>

            <li>After use her hair was much smoother and very shiny.</li>
            <li>it made made my hair straight</li>
            <li>, I lost so much, I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>My hair naturally straight</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had this kind of freedom from having to style my hair precisely everyday.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s soft and silky, and no FRIZZZ!!!</li>
            <li>I ran my straightener through my hair (way less than I usually have to) and my hair looked excellent!  </li>
            <li>I ran my straightener through my hair (way less than I usually have to) and my hair looked excellent!  </li>
            <li>I was excited because I had been conemplainting going to the salon but after looking into it they wanted to start 350 dollars and my hair is pretty long</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even use my usual spray after to smooth the fly aways down because there wasn&#x27;t any!  </li>
            <li>This is DEFINITELY better than other DIY kit which i have tried.</li>
            <li>It is also important to have your flat iron on a high heat.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to follow the directions and the process was long but not hard to do.  </li>
            <li>I did my hair and left it in for the full 3 days.</li>
            <li>Definitely not worth two hours of work and not being able to wash your hair for 3 days.</li>
            <li>The most challenging part was the back due to the short length.  </li>
            <li>It is important in the instructions to 100% dry your hair</li>
            <li>I found Keratin Research on Amazon and read several reviews, watched several tutorials on how to DIY and felt confident that I could do it.</li>
            <li>I also have more than enough for a second treatment!  </li>
            <li>my hair is straight and very soft</li>
            <li>I hung in there as long as I could because I was really excited to see results</li>
            <li>Be careful when you touch your hair or the person doing your hair touches it because it gets super hot as you run the iron through it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Results:  WOW!!  </li>
            <li>With the ones I&#x27;ve had done in the past, I still would have to run the flat iron through after drying just to get that smooth, sleek look that I so love.  </li>
            <li>The stylist who gets it for me is hard to book with, so i decided to take measures in my own hands, plus save some money and time.</li>
            <li>have short hair to my chin, but my roots are very thick and kinky from letting my relaxer grow out for many months as well as letting my keratin treatment fade, and prob could get 1 or 2 more treatments from this size bottle .</li>
            <li>They have all worked great on my hair but have always been so expensive.</li>
            <li>my hair is very shinny, soft and easier to manage..</li>
            <li>Not having that pain, and have straight, shiny hair that lasts - WOW, who knew.  </li>
            <li>Normally my hair would take 45 mins.</li>
            <li>I sjampoo as normal.</li>
            <li>I normally go from bottom up doing a row at a time</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty fried, but the keratin treatments I can apply myself where needed has really helped improve the overall health of my hair.</li>
            <li>This product is my new holy grail.</li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;m EXTREMELY pleased with the results and will update after a few weeks or so......</li>
            <li>I mainly use it to touch up my roots and it keeps my hair manageable, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a nightmare during high humidity, but I&#x27;ve had no trouble with frizzy hair on rainy days since treatment.</li>
            <li>(The very little I do have are the ends of my top layer and its prob because I need a hair cut.</li>
            <li>I can only report what my experience was, but if you have super dry, coarse, light brown-44 year old hair, what are you waiting for?</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t extremely curly but enough that I would call it more than wavy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I waited 3 days but after the first wash my hair went back to curly.</li>
            <li>but at the same time is not because you cant  give waves to the hair, with time i started using the john freida salon shape hot air brush and the remington curling wand coz</li>
            <li>Blow drying and then straightening my hair had my eyes hurting and watering so much that I could barely see what I was doing.</li>
            <li>My stylist had to cut a good few inches off of my hair due to the damage and apply treatments to fix the ends.</li>
            <li>I chose to keep the product in my hair a few more days...... and used the flat iron along the way to guarantee i get the straight  hair.</li>
            <li>I tried Wen and was so disappointed and now, I will never stop using this natural and wonderful product</li>
            <li>My hair is almost completely straight (I don&#x27;t really care much about how straight) and my hair has very little frizz</li>
            <li>By the morning of the 3rd day my hair was super oily but was not a big deal for me because I had planned to not go anywhere the 3 days.</li>
            <li>For the price I expected the product to work longer than the first hair wash!</li>
            <li>My hair bacame more soft and shinny and a little bit straight, but not straight enought.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>my hair feels soft, and bright.&lt;br /&gt;each</li>
            <li>So since I did so much research and read every review possible when I was looking for an at home Brazilian Blowout</li>
            <li>The treatment loosened my curls a lot, my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz, and it&#x27;s made my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, silky &amp; the time saved is</li>
            <li>We had a weekend long event out in the hot humid air and no curling or frizzing!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very unsure if I used enough product I didn&#x27;t want to over saturate or under saturate.  </li>
            <li>The next day when I woke up still pin straight.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, frizzy hair</li>
            <li>process to complete the keratin treatment took about 5 hours.</li>
            <li>hair completely stop shredding</li>
            <li>and it is already enough to cover the whole head.</li>
            <li>Therefore it is not necessary to leave it for 72 hours unless you have very curly or frizzy</li>
            <li>your hair is straight with frizz or wavy (not actually curly)</li>
            <li>By the time she had finished, my scalp was bright red and burning from the few places that she had accidentally gotten the solution on my skin, and both of our eyes were red and watering from what I can only assume was the formaldehyde in the solution.</li>
            <li>Definitely not a look that I would have paid so much for.</li>
            <li>It feels so soft and looks so pretty all day long!  </li>
            <li>It feels so soft and looks so pretty all day long!  </li>
            <li>When I let my hair air dry naturally after the first wash it AMAZED me.</li>
            <li>It may be a little itchy but worth it to me!</li>
            <li>I can blow dry a whole section at a time in minutes!</li>
            <li>This makes my hairy silky and straight and cuts my flat ironing time in half.&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Wear</li>
            <li>I typically never leave a review</li>
            <li>Major bonus!</li>
            <li>well I my major curly hair!</li>
            <li>I have long very frizzy unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li>I waited a bit to write this review to see how long my hair would be straight.  </li>
            <li>Yet, after using this treatment, my hair didn&#x27;t look smooth and glossy like it usually does after straightening.</li>
            <li>Though this look is not what I was going for in the least, it is far better than what this treatment left me with.</li>
            <li>Or If you are a curly who just wants to reduce blowdrying time when styling straight and not really get rid of curls then you can leave the product in for at least 48 hours, and not wait the full 3-4 days.</li>
            <li>Her hair is more coarse and thick</li>
            <li>Her hair is more coarse and thick</li>
            <li>, my hair is so shiny so soft and manegeable and completely frizz-free, i only use the shampoo of this kit and loreal eversleek deep conditioner, leavein cream and serum which has no sulfates, sodium or silicones, i recommend to everyone who has BKT not to use silicones because in order to remove most of silicones from your hair you have to use shampoos with sulfates or other harsh chemicals that are enemies of the brazilian treatment, if you use conditioner and leavein with cones and use a soft shampoo to take care of your BKT  </li>
            <li>Our hair went back to being completely wavy and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>and we were sitting near the open door.  </li>
            <li>Other brands can really upset your respiratory system.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and lasts longer than a few other products I have  tried</li>
            <li>After washing it blow dried quickly, taking about 10 mins (as it did after my salon treatments - MAJOR plus as untreated, even with my short length it would take every bit of 20 mins to get it 100% dry ) .</li>
            <li>How long it lasts will depend on how well you followed the instructions , how long you left the treatment in your hair, and how much heat you used to seal in</li>
            <li>Well first off I&#x27;m mixed (Black, white, and filipina) and have thickish medium length curly hair that gets frizzy in humidity.</li>
            <li>I got lazy with the right side</li>
            <li>I washed and conditioned my hair with the set that came in this kit and then let it air dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>The whole process took less than an hour (mind you, my hair is SUPER thick).</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d never know how dry and coarse my hair is naturally after seeing the after-treatment effect.  </li>
            <li>and I typically use a few products to maintain a smooth appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; brush that was able to sort out that mess with minimal pain while I blow dried.)</li>
            <li>Based in the reviews there were good and bad.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love it!!  </li>
            <li> It was very effective.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the $500 salon treatment.</li>

            <li> coz i took really good care of it, since the moment i got my treatment</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, my hair is easier to maintain.</li>
            <li> Maybe because my skills are not so good</li>
            <li> therefore it is not as good as the salon.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my purchase and glad I decided on the bundle with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest and say that it&#x27;s not as good as keratin from the salons, but for a DIY it&#x27;s pretty good!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> My hair is beautiful and smooth.</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this looking for the top rated keratin system, so i went on a limb and ordered it!</li>
            <li> and it was amazing,</li>
            <li> My friend used this product as well, her hair is curly and it has done an amazing job.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> This is light putting a great conditioner on your hair and reaping the results of a perm from it.  </li>
            <li> In fact it smelled rather nice.  </li>
            <li> I could never leave it Curley because I didn&#x27;t have nice curls and straightening it takes forever.  </li>
            <li> I love love love this product !!</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply and use.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> The chemicals are very strong.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I was very impressed.  </li>
            <li> More effective than having the &amp;#34;blowout&amp;#34; done at a salon.  </li>
            <li> Therefore it is important to do in a room with good ventilation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product does sting your eyes and my throat was irritated a bit, make sure you have a well ventilated area when doing this.</li>
            <li> I love my hair</li>
            <li> and I love my hair now</li>
            <li> I love this product  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I just love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a keratin treatment before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my hair is now</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair is now</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> More frizz has returned but it&#x27;s manageable and my wave has returned.</li>
            <li> It is getting better about not looking oily as time</li>
            <li> I was able to see the before and after on a client.  </li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> For better results leave in hair for 3 days.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and conditioner it came with.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> But when i condition i have to comb out my curls to avoid more tangles when finished.</li>
            <li> I am pleased on the outcome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid for keratin treatments at the salon (3 different times) and none of them turned out as good as this one!!  </li>
            <li> Make sure you use the appropriate amount to.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with how this product transformed my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in salons for many years to have keratin done and</li>
            <li> I was not expecting great things, but this really works.  </li>
            <li> you need to make sure you are in a ventilated area to apply this.</li>
            <li> I love the way it leaves my hair and each treatment lasts over 6 months.</li>
            <li> and i believe it helps to make the hair more manageable and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is a good product which is worth trying even though it took me around 2 hours and end up with aching arms and fingers</li>
            <li> I love the treatment worked</li>
            <li> I love it though</li>
            <li> the more fried and damaged my hair became.</li>
            <li> This treatment does not need for you to leave it in for the typical 3 days which is awesome because I can&#x27;t make it more than 2 days without washing my hair ever!  </li>
            <li> Right away when you are washing your hair with the after care sulfate free shampoo and conditoner you can tell the difference and that it is going to be amazing!  </li>
            <li> The thing that I love best about it is, you blow dry your hair and then straighten.  </li>
            <li> I never had such an amazing hair!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth the money and time!!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that my hair has never looked so good after drying naturally.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second wash now and still have beautiful frizz free hair!</li>
            <li> I will try to keep you updated but so far I am extremely happy.  </li>
            <li> It took me 2 1/2 hours to complete the process and my hair looks great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After more than a week since i done the keratin treatment, my hair is getting more and more easier to maintain and it is even smoother and silkier than the first wash.</li>
            <li> My hair gets frizzy really easily</li>
            <li> The instructions were easy to follow and they have a website that does the steps for you to observe before applying this process and what to expect.  </li>
            <li> even though it&#x27;s easy, it IS time consuming.</li>
            <li> priceless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: definitely use a fan and make sure your area has great venilation.</li>
            <li> I did &amp; had no problems with lingering fumes, but I can see how it could easily be an issue depending on the layout of your space.</li>
            <li> It was really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I think the product is worth the money, I&#x27;ll be able to use this keratin treatment another 3-4 more times &amp;</li>
            <li> Easy to apply</li>
            <li> Product is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> are easy to follow.and</li>
            <li> and it was still too strong.</li>
            <li> I have given it a strong recommendation to three others who will be buying.  </li>
            <li> I will be getting my favorite keratin conditioner, KeratinPerfect (sephora), but this is a good buy for the clarifying pre shampoo, which u need to make sure to open the hair&#x27;s cuticle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As the directions stated I did just comb it through with a fine tooth comb</li>
            <li> this stuff is the real deal!The important ingredients are at the top of the list!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to enjoy my summer and not have to be worrying about my hair.</li>
            <li> I waited two days, then washed it using the sulfate free shampoo/conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I tried thos product in hopes of being hair care stress free for a bit.</li>
            <li> The content of two of the bottles spilled; one of them was precisely the Keratin treatment..</li>
            <li> And the best part is it doesn&#x27;t feel dead or damaged.  </li>
            <li> It worked well to straighten, but wasn&#x27;t as shiny or as smooth as the blowouts I had done at the salon.</li>
            <li> The shampoo never leaves a residue &amp; the conditioner is light &amp; moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I washed 36hrs after treatment with fabulous results.</li>
            <li> and my bf just noticed my hair was nice and straight as Im writing this review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> days ago, I had my wonderfully patient sister help me with applying the treatment after I washed my hair with the clarifying shampoo and blow dried it.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I have a &amp;#34;Tangle Teaser&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have had professional keratin treatments done before, but nothing has been a good as this product.</li>
            <li> The second day I did not wash my hair and it stayed looking clean longer and was still straight and awesome.</li>
            <li> The second day I did not wash my hair and it stayed looking clean longer and was still straight and awesome.</li>
            <li> Also its great that you do not need to wait 4 days to wash, although after all the work blowdrying and flat ironing, im gonna wait anyways&lt;</li>
            <li> My hair felt light, strong &amp; best of all straight with absolutely no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes out almost perfectly straight with just the blow drier, so if you run the flat iron through your hair quickly it will be perfect.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got them, and watched YouTube video learned how to apply them.</li>
            <li> Considering this IS my first time ever using keratin i am fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> Never mind how much I was coughing as a result of still inhaling those fumes, even in a well ventilated room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through great pains (literally) to follow all of the instructions, I expected to see spectacular results.</li>
            <li> to blow dry, and I would still have fly aways and frizz.</li>
            <li> Hair generally feel very healthy and are not falling at all.</li>
            <li> Let just say I would happily leave the house with wet hair</li>
            <li> Me and my sister in law tried this, followed directions EXACTLY as per video instructions and the results were great until we washed our hair 3 days later.  </li>
            <li> I did wait the full 72 hours before washing out the product</li>
            <li> This changes them to a healthy shiny glow and very manageable.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if this is true or not.</li>
            <li> the underneath is very Curley and the top is a mix of wave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m completely satisfied with my purchase, Keratin Research has saved me so much time &amp; frustration with my hair.</li>
            <li> then you don&#x27;t have to wait the full 3- 4 days</li>
            <li> then you should wait the full recommend 3-4days and use the maximum 450 degrees heat for optimal penetration of the product.</li>
            <li> And its is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> my hair is super curly and this product makes my dream come true now</li>
            <li> the longer I have my treatment in my hair.to smooth the fly aways down because there wasn&#x27;t any!  </li>
            <li> It is not that straight, but it made my hair less bulky, the shampoo and conditioner are ok, don&#x27;t expect them to be great.</li>
            <li> I decided I would write a quick review.</li>
            <li> Simply the best product I used in the last 2 years!</li>
            <li> A 10 min shpwer quickly escalates into a 45 min one.  </li>
            <li> I am overall very satisfied with this product.  </li>
            <li> It comes out sooooooooo straight right away!!  </li>
            <li> im in love with this cant live without it now&lt;</li>
            <li> Directions and straight forward and product is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is amazing, my hair is frizz free, I don&#x27;t need to blow dry or iron it.</li>
            <li> i had it done january 15th, for the fisrt 4 weeks i had to to nothing to my hair, it dry completely straight which is great</li>
            <li> The sticky film washed out leaving soft and very smooth hair.  </li>
            <li> The heat greatly improved my hair&#x27;s texture, although still a little filmy/sticky.  </li>
            <li> and it was smooth, shiny and straight.  </li>
            <li> and it was smooth, shiny and straight.  </li>
            <li> I got straight and smooth hair.</li>
            <li> While my roots were straight and smooth, the closer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 yrs and find it economical to use on my neck-length hair.</li>
            <li> (totally worth it)</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I really love my results which were better than what I expected.</li>
            <li> I feel I deserve some kind of compensation.&lt;br /&gt;Not even a FRAGILE sticker on the envelope.</li>
            <li> I liked it but will probably try another brand next time.</li>
            <li> Which is way i gave it 4 stars, 1 star off for the conditioner having more fragrance then important ingredients like the keratin and amino acids, they are very low on the list!. .</li>
            <li> WOW it air dried pretty quickly and looks GREAT!</li>
            <li> The reviews are right.</li>
            <li> It worked great first few weeks.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product &amp; brand to anyone to wants to wake up with beautiful hair everyday.</li>
            <li> , this was the first time I&#x27;d ever tried any kind of lasting treatment.</li>
            <li> Will have to update on how long it lasts, but Im happy so far</li>
            <li> and it was still nice and smooth feeling and dried faster.  </li>
            <li> and it was still nice and smooth feeling and dried faster.  </li>
            <li> After I did it, my hair looked straight and smooth, it saved a lot time for me to get ready , since my hair is frizzy and puffy.</li>
            <li> On the left side my hair dries more curly while the right side has a wave</li>
            <li> oh no, I must have used too much!</li>
            <li> Second time around with these products and I love them.</li>
            <li> I included a during 3 day treatment and after first shower photo.</li>
            <li> I am guessing I will most likely do my hair again in 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Left it on for 6 more hours.</li>
            <li> Like a real brazilian blow out!</li>
            <li> Started going about my day and since it is summer and hot out I had to shower after I was done working.  </li>
            <li> Came fast!</li>
            <li> is not the first time i have done keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> (I washed my hair 3 times to make sure that it was super clean for the application process, and it made my easily tangled hair even more of a mess than usual.</li>
            <li> I have not used the flat iron once, which is huge!</li>
            <li> Make sure your flat iron is a 450 degree one.  </li>
            <li> So if you have a friend to do the flat iron for you, i believe results will be even better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Upon learning the Chi Enviro treatment appeared to be off the market, I decided on this one based on the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Let me say this: those positive reviews are so warranted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far my grandauthter&#x27;s hair has been straight and beautiful for the past month.</li>
            <li> were super soft after 48 hours and washing, lot of frizz went away.</li>
            <li> It is the first product I have tired and felt 100 percent happy with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions are simple &amp; having been through &amp; watched my stylist do this on my hair for years, I found the application to be easy.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t as good or as long lasting as this stuff is!</li>
            <li> Good product.very efficient and last for a long period of time.it does not harm the hair.deffinitly will order it again</li>
            <li> The product is good for the hair and it last long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You have to consider certain factors that will impact the results on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I would buy it again since it didn&#x27;t work as well, but it is the only good option I have found for that salon blowout that everyone has stopped doing!</li>
            <li> Definitely saves time blow drying, but one area that Irushed thru since it was the last section, didn&#x27;t really pick up the keratin as much, you need to be sure to do section by section as if you were coloring the hair!</li>
            <li> ( I fell asleep on it) and straight in the front.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> , my hair was straight before but dry,unhealty, and now i just shower every day</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t straighten hair that much, but it lessens waves.</li>
            <li> The clarifying shampoo worked really well.  </li>
            <li> At work people thought I got hair extensions because my hair seemed so much longer</li>
            <li> At work people thought I got hair extensions because my hair seemed so much longer</li>
            <li> it done in a very well ventilated area.</li>
            <li> Then did the straight iron to it while some remained in my hair.</li>
            <li> Straight ironed it again.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely sold on this Keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> Semi straight hair at the bottom, and curly hair at the roots.</li>
            <li> My hair turned out very silky with a lot of body, like when I go to the Dominican shop.  </li>
            <li> Works really well with my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really frizzy</li>
            <li> Lasted all day straight.  </li>
            <li> Day 2 woke up still straight.  </li>
            <li> It really does what it says..</li>
            <li> I did not experience that at all with this product, thanks to the way that it works.  </li>
            <li> i dont like straight hair</li>
            <li> Once I sealed the product in, my hair was very sleek &amp; pin straight.</li>
            <li> straight do you want</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personal advice for straight- frizzy / wavy Caucasian textured hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After use her hair was much smoother and very shiny.</li>
            <li> it made made my hair straight</li>
            <li> , I lost so much, I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> Not so much.</li>
            <li> My hair naturally straight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this kind of freedom from having to style my hair precisely everyday.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s soft and silky, and no FRIZZZ!!!</li>
            <li> I ran my straightener through my hair (way less than I usually have to) and my hair looked excellent!  </li>
            <li> I ran my straightener through my hair (way less than I usually have to) and my hair looked excellent!  </li>
            <li> I was excited because I had been conemplainting going to the salon but after looking into it they wanted to start 350 dollars and my hair is pretty long</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use my usual spray after to smooth the fly aways down because there wasn&#x27;t any!  </li>
            <li> This is DEFINITELY better than other DIY kit which i have tried.</li>
            <li> It is also important to have your flat iron on a high heat.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to follow the directions and the process was long but not hard to do.  </li>
            <li> I did my hair and left it in for the full 3 days.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth two hours of work and not being able to wash your hair for 3 days.</li>
            <li> The most challenging part was the back due to the short length.  </li>
            <li> It is important in the instructions to 100% dry your hair</li>
            <li> I found Keratin Research on Amazon and read several reviews, watched several tutorials on how to DIY and felt confident that I could do it.</li>
            <li> I also have more than enough for a second treatment!  </li>
            <li> my hair is straight and very soft</li>
            <li> I hung in there as long as I could because I was really excited to see results</li>
            <li> Be careful when you touch your hair or the person doing your hair touches it because it gets super hot as you run the iron through it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Results:  WOW!!  </li>
            <li> With the ones I&#x27;ve had done in the past, I still would have to run the flat iron through after drying just to get that smooth, sleek look that I so love.  </li>
            <li> The stylist who gets it for me is hard to book with, so i decided to take measures in my own hands, plus save some money and time.</li>
            <li> have short hair to my chin, but my roots are very thick and kinky from letting my relaxer grow out for many months as well as letting my keratin treatment fade, and prob could get 1 or 2 more treatments from this size bottle .</li>
            <li> They have all worked great on my hair but have always been so expensive.</li>
            <li> my hair is very shinny, soft and easier to manage..</li>
            <li> Not having that pain, and have straight, shiny hair that lasts - WOW, who knew.  </li>
            <li> Normally my hair would take 45 mins.</li>
            <li> I sjampoo as normal.</li>
            <li> I normally go from bottom up doing a row at a time</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pretty fried, but the keratin treatments I can apply myself where needed has really helped improve the overall health of my hair.</li>
            <li> This product is my new holy grail.</li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;m EXTREMELY pleased with the results and will update after a few weeks or so......</li>
            <li> I mainly use it to touch up my roots and it keeps my hair manageable, soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a nightmare during high humidity, but I&#x27;ve had no trouble with frizzy hair on rainy days since treatment.</li>
            <li> (The very little I do have are the ends of my top layer and its prob because I need a hair cut.</li>
            <li> I can only report what my experience was, but if you have super dry, coarse, light brown-44 year old hair, what are you waiting for?</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t extremely curly but enough that I would call it more than wavy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I waited 3 days but after the first wash my hair went back to curly.</li>
            <li> but at the same time is not because you cant  give waves to the hair, with time i started using the john freida salon shape hot air brush and the remington curling wand coz</li>
            <li> Blow drying and then straightening my hair had my eyes hurting and watering so much that I could barely see what I was doing.</li>
            <li> My stylist had to cut a good few inches off of my hair due to the damage and apply treatments to fix the ends.</li>
            <li> I chose to keep the product in my hair a few more days...... and used the flat iron along the way to guarantee i get the straight  hair.</li>
            <li> I tried Wen and was so disappointed and now, I will never stop using this natural and wonderful product</li>
            <li> My hair is almost completely straight (I don&#x27;t really care much about how straight) and my hair has very little frizz</li>
            <li> By the morning of the 3rd day my hair was super oily but was not a big deal for me because I had planned to not go anywhere the 3 days.</li>
            <li> For the price I expected the product to work longer than the first hair wash!</li>
            <li> My hair bacame more soft and shinny and a little bit straight, but not straight enought.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> my hair feels soft, and bright.&lt;br /&gt;each</li>
            <li> So since I did so much research and read every review possible when I was looking for an at home Brazilian Blowout</li>
            <li> The treatment loosened my curls a lot, my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz, and it&#x27;s made my hair really soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, silky &amp; the time saved is</li>
            <li> We had a weekend long event out in the hot humid air and no curling or frizzing!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very unsure if I used enough product I didn&#x27;t want to over saturate or under saturate.  </li>
            <li> The next day when I woke up still pin straight.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> process to complete the keratin treatment took about 5 hours.</li>
            <li> hair completely stop shredding</li>
            <li> and it is already enough to cover the whole head.</li>
            <li> Therefore it is not necessary to leave it for 72 hours unless you have very curly or frizzy</li>
            <li> your hair is straight with frizz or wavy (not actually curly)</li>
            <li> By the time she had finished, my scalp was bright red and burning from the few places that she had accidentally gotten the solution on my skin, and both of our eyes were red and watering from what I can only assume was the formaldehyde in the solution.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a look that I would have paid so much for.</li>
            <li> It feels so soft and looks so pretty all day long!  </li>
            <li> It feels so soft and looks so pretty all day long!  </li>
            <li> When I let my hair air dry naturally after the first wash it AMAZED me.</li>
            <li> It may be a little itchy but worth it to me!</li>
            <li> I can blow dry a whole section at a time in minutes!</li>
            <li> This makes my hairy silky and straight and cuts my flat ironing time in half.&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Wear</li>
            <li> I typically never leave a review</li>
            <li> Major bonus!</li>
            <li> well I my major curly hair!</li>
            <li> I have long very frizzy unmanageable hair.</li>
            <li> I waited a bit to write this review to see how long my hair would be straight.  </li>
            <li> Yet, after using this treatment, my hair didn&#x27;t look smooth and glossy like it usually does after straightening.</li>
            <li> Though this look is not what I was going for in the least, it is far better than what this treatment left me with.</li>
            <li> Or If you are a curly who just wants to reduce blowdrying time when styling straight and not really get rid of curls then you can leave the product in for at least 48 hours, and not wait the full 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> Her hair is more coarse and thick</li>
            <li> Her hair is more coarse and thick</li>
            <li> , my hair is so shiny so soft and manegeable and completely frizz-free, i only use the shampoo of this kit and loreal eversleek deep conditioner, leavein cream and serum which has no sulfates, sodium or silicones, i recommend to everyone who has BKT not to use silicones because in order to remove most of silicones from your hair you have to use shampoos with sulfates or other harsh chemicals that are enemies of the brazilian treatment, if you use conditioner and leavein with cones and use a soft shampoo to take care of your BKT  </li>
            <li> Our hair went back to being completely wavy and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> and we were sitting near the open door.  </li>
            <li> Other brands can really upset your respiratory system.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and lasts longer than a few other products I have  tried</li>
            <li> After washing it blow dried quickly, taking about 10 mins (as it did after my salon treatments - MAJOR plus as untreated, even with my short length it would take every bit of 20 mins to get it 100% dry ) .</li>
            <li> How long it lasts will depend on how well you followed the instructions , how long you left the treatment in your hair, and how much heat you used to seal in</li>
            <li> Well first off I&#x27;m mixed (Black, white, and filipina) and have thickish medium length curly hair that gets frizzy in humidity.</li>
            <li> I got lazy with the right side</li>
            <li> I washed and conditioned my hair with the set that came in this kit and then let it air dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> The whole process took less than an hour (mind you, my hair is SUPER thick).</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d never know how dry and coarse my hair is naturally after seeing the after-treatment effect.  </li>
            <li> and I typically use a few products to maintain a smooth appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; brush that was able to sort out that mess with minimal pain while I blow dried.)</li>
            <li> Based in the reviews there were good and bad.  </li>
            <li> My hair soaked it up, but I still only used a little less than half of the bottle which I thought interesting since I go through a bottle of conditioner per week.  </li>
            <li> A few hours later, I was left with hair in a very short bob that flips out at the bottom in a very unattractive way if left to air dry.</li>
            <li> It took me like 2 hours to complete the process to do the treatment, and it&#x27;s just not worth the time since the result only last that short.</li>
            <li> Still need flat iron daily</li>
            <li> I applied the treatment as directed, made several passes with the flat iron at 450F.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last as long as the last one I purchased.  </li>
            <li> blonde highlighted hair that I need to blow dry and straighten on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I then used my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> and I hope it lasts as long as possible!  </li>
            <li> and I hope it lasts as long as possible!  </li>
            <li> I am wondering how long it will last...</li>
            <li> then take hair comb it and flat iron it.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t need to run the flat iron through.  </li>
            <li> No blow drying OR flat iron</li>
            <li> is the third time I buy this product &#x27;cause it is good, but I am so mad with this mess.</li>
            <li> This will however reduce your curl pattern so if you are a 3C , the product will loosen your curls considerably and maybe bring you down to a 3A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you want your hair as straight as possible (for as long as possible) then you must consider leaving the product at least 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the flat iron to style my bangs &amp; it takes about 5-7 mins to completely dry my (shoulder blade length) hair.</li>
            <li> I blew dry my hair and it felt sticky and gross....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not expecting a miracle tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After waiting the three days, I washed out the product and was less than surprised by my results.</li>
            <li> I have long, coarse, and very dry hair.  </li>
            <li> After I blow dry my hair looks like I&#x27;ve already flat ironed.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this product as I have wanted to tame my thick, unruly hair for quite sometime without spending hundreds of dollars in a salon.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this product and DIY as long as I can.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s long soo</li>
            <li> The after photo is how my hair dried naturally.</li>
            <li> I will update to see how long this lasts.</li>
            <li> It lasted on my long hair for just over 4 months.  </li>
            <li> As my hair stylist moved &amp; I&#x27;m insanely picky about who touches my hair, this was my first time doing my own Keratin Smoothing/Brazillian Blowout</li>
            <li> To add insult to injury, after spending over an hour and a half straightening those toxic fumes away, I woke up the following morning to find that some of my hair had gotten kinks in it as I slept (which doesn&#x27;t ever happen when I simply straighten it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use to only wash my hair every other day</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry</li>
            <li> It will dry your hands out.&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> It was a 5 hour process to wash, dry, apply product, and straighten.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed it again today and decided to let it air dry -</li>
            <li> I did use a comb to blow dry</li>
            <li> Once it was all dry my hair looked like it always did after blow drying.  </li>
            <li> i let my hair air dry and</li>
            <li> thought all these make my hair dry</li>
            <li> While most of the reviews seemed positive, I did note that some complained about the painful tingling sensation that occurs when the treatment makes contact with one&#x27;s scalp/skin and concerns about its formaldehyde content.</li>
            <li> I stopped getting the treatments years ago and just had to deal with flat ironing my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it leave my hair so soft its unbelievable</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to go through the process, maybe a couple of hours I spent on it.</li>
            <li> so the curls aren&#x27;t as loose</li>
            <li> I use dry shampoo sometimes in between washes &amp; apply a hair serum (either: usually Living Proof brand from Sephora) &amp; a kertain recharge combing cream after washing; I currently wash with the Keratin Research Brand &amp; have recently ordered additional one-liter combo shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and Mexican</li>
            <li> zero frizz a little wave in the back</li>
            <li> Only a 4 because it doesn&#x27;t last months like the other treatments I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> It can take a few hours to do especially if you have a lot of hair.</li>
            <li> It feels smoother even while it is wet.  </li>
            <li> wet</li>
            <li> wet</li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone who has frizzy hair that look like totally damaged and dried up.</li>
            <li> After that I partially washed it out.</li>
            <li> Takes a while to apply the product and the results were not what I expected.</li>
            <li> just like I spent all the time it USED to take me to get it</li>
            <li> It made my hair dry quicker and require less straightening when I was doing my hair.  </li>
            <li> I only use very little solutions (ard 4 tablespoon) for my shoulder length hair</li>
            <li> I have gotten Keratin treatments, Brazilian blow outs, Japanese Straightening in the past.</li>
            <li> I heard that it will come out faster if you use any other shampoo or conditoner.</li>
            <li> No protection, plastic bubbles, something to prevent from spilling with the pressure of other packages.</li>
            <li> I do encounter 1 side of my hair not as silky as the other side.</li>
            <li> , I could&#x27;ve gone to Walmart and got a cheap perm, it would&#x27;ve had the same effect , I&#x27;ve done keratin treatment before, this is by far the worst I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> It is easy to use I did not have even one bad thing to say about it, will use it again and again.</li>
            <li> I wait a few days to allow my hair to air dry</li>
            <li> It looked and still looks dry and dead.</li>
            <li> I am African-American with very soft,  thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick Caucasian hair with a lot of frizz and its slightly wavy normally.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and about an inch past my shoulders and it took me almost 4 hours to finish the whole process.</li>
            <li> at the same time, it is delicate to  my scalp.</li>
            <li> Those &#x27;pops&#x27; of hot product, especially at your neckline are downright painful.  </li>
            <li> I washed my hair about every other day and it lasted for almost 3 months!  </li>
            <li> It says to straighten till all the steam stops, but it is a little hard to get all of it with a regular straightener.</li>
            <li> I still have half a bottle</li>
            <li> It has the typical Keratin smell, but it&#x27;s manageable if you use it in a ventilated area or just where you have a window.</li>
            <li> I no longer wantthe stress of thos mess.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very disappointed that pretty much lasted around three weeks</li>
            <li> There was still some wave and body on the under neath part of my hair because that&#x27;s where I had tight curls.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been 2 months and my hair is a little wavier but still not frizzy.</li>
            <li> so it has been a little over 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> I got my little sister to put the keratin in my hair then straightened it myself.  </li>
            <li> Yes the fumes got to me a little bit.  </li>
            <li> My eyes watered and my throat burned a little bit</li>
            <li> With just a little amount, my hair is all moisturized</li>
            <li> It does what it says but you have to be careful when straightening your hair!!!</li>
            <li> Wear gloves or you will feel your hands very dry for at least a few days after application.</li>
            <li> A few things: 1.</li>
            <li> it was when my hair was being blow dried (my sister was doing it)</li>
            <li> So now I am washing it everyday.</li>
            <li> Since I sadly, I cannot afford the frequent visits to the salon.</li>
            <li> Plus after a few days if i dont press it again, i get that curly frizzy look.</li>
            <li> I did have to stop a few times to take a break.  </li>
            <li> I did run my straightener over it a few times just incase.  </li>
            <li> The product did make my hair feel heavy, then oily by day two.</li>
            <li> She painstakingly applied the treatment using a bowl and hair color brush so as not to waste the product but still saturate my hair.</li>
            <li> not easy, I applied the keratin.  </li>
            <li> It did not smell bad at all first of all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Given everything that this stupid product has put me through, I&#x27;m waiting the full three days before washing it out.</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair everyday</li>
            <li> I woke up with only a little bit of waves, rather than my usual crazy frizzy wet hair bed head.  </li>
            <li> I woke up with only a little bit of waves, rather than my usual crazy frizzy wet hair bed head.  </li>
            <li> It is less expensive than other brands and way less than going to a salon.  </li>
            <li> It is less expensive than other brands and way less than going to a salon.  </li>
            <li> I applied it on my mom&#x27;s hair and I used very little quantity</li>
            <li> Then soon as im finished ill hurry an oil my hair and brush back and roll into a bun.</li>
            <li> was waiting anxiously for this item because it was mentioned that \\&quot;No</li>
            <li> But it lasted just 3 weeks on my hair although I have thin slightly curly.</li>
            <li> and it looks so dull and lifeless</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I have a thick course strand and keratin makes it easier to manage without the use of chemical relaxers.</li>
            <li> so my hair is thick and curly and frizzy.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and course.  </li>
            <li> the silicones eventually will create built-up in your hair because a soft shampoo wont remove cones and the hair will start to dry and will end up horrible by the time the BKT has gone, some people say that their treatment has not lasted buy not in my case</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse crazy hair.</li>
            <li> Also, the fumes were ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I was seriously wondering for awhile if my vision would be impaired as a result.</li>
            <li> Idk bout how bad the chemical smell is cuz personally i read the reviews before purchase and i prepared for all that.</li>
            <li> I am Native American and Black, and my routine of haor care is insane.</li>
            <li> It was very disappointing because it lasted for only 2 weeks in  hair.</li>
            <li> I brought product in March and just decided to use it because with all the rain I am tired of wearing a ponytail.  </li>
            <li> I tried using it on a lower heat seating because of thin hair but did no straighten as well.  </li>
            <li> Way worse than the one at the salon.</li>
            <li> And then it got even worse.</li>
            <li> and I can also let it air dry without seeing an awful, frizzy mess.</li>
            <li> It took us almost 4 hrs each to get through the entire procedure and of course we are very disappointed in wasting our time and money on this product.  </li>
            <li> I read another review that the lady received her package in an envelope and some product had leaked out which is unfortunate</li>
            <li> This product has transformed my horribly frizzy hair to a totally different head of hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t experience any terrible fumes, I kept a box fan &amp; the window open just in case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell didn&#x27;t bother me until it was time to run the flat iron through and even that wasn&#x27;t  terribly</li>
            <li> My hair was dry brittle lifeless and just awful, this product worked wonders</li>
            <li> I was so afraid that i will faint and die.</li>
            <li> I thought I would get used to the irritant after awhile, but, boy, was I wrong!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t start to smell bad until the heat is applied to it.</li>
            <li> Im sick of that routine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;1)The solution STINKS!</li>
            <li> ; it&#x27;s insane how manageable my hair is.  </li>
            <li> I read that the smell was horrible.</li>
            <li> Another warning, the fumes are awful while applying the product.  </li>
            <li> Our eyes were burning from the fumes and got a scratchy, nasty feeling in the throat.  </li>
            <li> It smells awful.</li>
            <li> professonal result at home without the expensive cost!!!!</li>

            <li> I have very thick, coarse crazy hair. On the left side my hair dries more curly while the right side has a wave/frizz to it. I have gotten Keratin treatments, Brazilian blow outs, Japanese Straightening in the past. They have all worked great on my hair but have always been so expensive. I stopped getting the treatments years ago and just had to deal with flat ironing my hair every other day. I found Keratin Research on Amazon and read several reviews, watched several tutorials on how to DIY and felt confident that I could do it. I got my package in 2 days with my Amazon Prime account and it arrived in pristine condition. I read another review that the lady received her package in an envelope and some product had leaked out which is unfortunate but I did not have that problem at all. You will need a hair dye brush to apply the product as well as a pair of gloves which are not included. My hair is very thick and about an inch past my shoulders and it took me almost 4 hours to finish the whole process. I did wait the full 72 hours before washing out the product and I noticed my hair felt smoother in the shower. I let my hair air dry and it was amazing, zero frizz a little wave in the back ( I fell asleep on it) and straight in the front. I am so happy with my purchase and glad I decided on the bundle with the shampoo and conditioner. It just makes things easier. I went to the beach two days ago (Big Sur, CA) and did not experience any frizz or &amp;#34;beach hair&amp;#34; it&#x27;s insane how manageable my hair is.  I&#x27;m on my second wash now and still have beautiful frizz free hair! I have not used the flat iron once, which is huge! I will continue to purchase this product and DIY as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product couple of weeks ago and I put the treatment in my hair last Thursday, June 13th. It takes a long time to go through the process, maybe a couple of hours I spent on it. The product does sting your eyes and my throat was irritated a bit, make sure you have a well ventilated area when doing this. I have thick hair and it&#x27;s long soo maybe it&#x27;s just me. But it works!!! After the clarifing shampoo my hair looked like Chaka Khan, lol. Normally my hair would take 45 mins. to blow dry, and I would still have fly aways and frizz. My hair now takes me 10-15 mins tops!!  I can blow dry a whole section at a time in minutes! It&#x27;s so worth the money and time!! I love my hair, it&#x27;s soft and silky, and no FRIZZZ!!! I&#x27;m going to enjoy my summer and not have to be worrying about my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 yrs and find it economical to use on my neck-length hair. I have a thick course strand and keratin makes it easier to manage without the use of chemical relaxers. I only need to use it every 3-4 months. Great product. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have been using Keratin treatment for a while and I decided to buy a different brand. It was very disappointing because it lasted for only 2 weeks in  hair. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is going to be my second time buying this product. It has lasted me up to 4 treatments, each lasting about 3 months each. I used to pay $300+ for Brazilian blowouts at the salon and it wasn&#x27;t as good or as long lasting as this stuff is! It can take a few hours to do especially if you have a lot of hair. It takes me about 3 hours to do my hair (totally worth it) I&#x27;m black and Mexican so my hair is thick and curly and frizzy. This makes my hairy silky and straight and cuts my flat ironing time in half.&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;Wear gloves when applying the product. It will dry your hands out.&lt;br /&gt;Take your time when straightening the product in so it seals properly.&lt;br /&gt;Use in well ventilated area. It doesn&#x27;t start to smell bad until the heat is applied to it.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry brittle lifeless and just awful, this product worked wonders I absolutely LOVE it !!! It is easy to use I did not have even one bad thing to say about it, will use it again and again.</li>
            <li> Burned a piece of my hair off, as I was blowing drying it. Do not use4 this product.</li>
            <li> It worked great first few weeks. But it lasted just 3 weeks on my hair although I have thin slightly curly.</li>
            <li> Great product !! My hair looks a lot great</li>
            <li> This product did not work at all and made some of my hair fall out don&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> my hair feels soft, and bright.&lt;br /&gt;each application last about 4-5 month in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;but at the same time, it is delicate to  my scalp.</li>
            <li> well i got this products and I love my hair now, my hair was straight before but dry,unhealty, and now i just shower every day and I do not have to do anything with my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product  my hair is super curly and this product makes my dream come true now my hair is straight and very soft I love it I just do it every 5 month but it wort it  I just love it</li>
            <li> Worked great in my hair!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It is amazing, my hair is frizz free, I don&#x27;t need to blow dry or iron it. My friend used this product as well, her hair is curly and it has done an amazing job. I recommend it to any hair type.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a keratin treatment before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  I have long, coarse, and very dry hair.  I was nervous about using a clarifying shampoo, but it&#x27;s part of the process, so I went ahead and started.  Once I got my hair combed through....not easy, I applied the keratin.  My hair soaked it up, but I still only used a little less than half of the bottle which I thought interesting since I go through a bottle of conditioner per week.  I blew dry my hair and it felt sticky and gross....oh no, I must have used too much! I then used my flat iron.  The heat greatly improved my hair&#x27;s texture, although still a little filmy/sticky.  I waited two days, then washed it using the sulfate free shampoo/conditioner.  Wow, I was very impressed.  The sticky film washed out leaving soft and very smooth hair.  You&#x27;d never know how dry and coarse my hair is naturally after seeing the after-treatment effect.  I usually wash my hair everyday so I&#x27;m not sure how long the keratin will stay, but definitely worth the effort AND I didn&#x27;t have to pay the $300 quote I received from my stylist.  I also have more than enough for a second treatment!  I can only report what my experience was, but if you have super dry, coarse, light brown-44 year old hair, what are you waiting for?</li>
            <li> Second time around with these products and I love them. big thumbs up ♡</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t straighten hair that much, but it lessens waves. I included a during 3 day treatment and after first shower photo. The after photo is how my hair dried naturally. It&#x27;s been 2 months and my hair is a little wavier but still not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I would like to update you all on this Keratin treatment.  I washed my hair about every other day and it lasted for almost 3 months!  It made my hair dry quicker and require less straightening when I was doing my hair.  I love it!  I will be doing it again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will start by describing my hair: I have waist length blonde highlighted hair that I need to blow dry and straighten on a daily basis. My hair gets frizzy really easily and I typically use a few products to maintain a smooth appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this treatment system on a Sunday afternoon.  It did not smell bad at all first of all.  In fact it smelled rather nice.  It was easy to follow the directions and the process was long but not hard to do.  The clarifying shampoo worked really well.  I followed the instructions and washed my hair 3 times to thoroughly cleanse it.  It is important in the instructions to 100% dry your hair so I did this.  I separated my hair into 3 sections and started having my daughter apply the Keratin treatment.  It is also important to have your flat iron on a high heat.  Be careful when you touch your hair or the person doing your hair touches it because it gets super hot as you run the iron through it.  It comes out sooooooooo straight right away!!  This treatment does not need for you to leave it in for the typical 3 days which is awesome because I can&#x27;t make it more than 2 days without washing my hair ever!  I actually washed my hair the next day because it said I only needed to wait overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results:  WOW!!  I love it!!  Right away when you are washing your hair with the after care sulfate free shampoo and conditoner you can tell the difference and that it is going to be amazing!  It feels smoother even while it is wet.  It is easier to comb as well.  It dries faster too!  It comes out almost perfectly straight with just the blow drier, so if you run the flat iron through your hair quickly it will be perfect.  I didn&#x27;t even use my usual spray after to smooth the fly aways down because there wasn&#x27;t any!  At work people thought I got hair extensions because my hair seemed so much longer and it was smooth, shiny and straight.  The second day I did not wash my hair and it stayed looking clean longer and was still straight and awesome. The third day I washed my hair, went to bed with it wet and it was still nice and smooth feeling and dried faster.  I woke up with only a little bit of waves, rather than my usual crazy frizzy wet hair bed head.  I ran my straightener through my hair (way less than I usually have to) and my hair looked excellent!  I love the way my hair is now and I hope it lasts as long as possible!  It feels so soft and looks so pretty all day long!  I love it so much!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this Keratin Treatment system from Keratin research to everyone to buy!  It is less expensive than other brands and way less than going to a salon.  I will totally do this treatment again when I notice the results diminishing. I am going to do this treatment to my daughters hair next weekend!  Her hair is more coarse and thick so I hope it comes out good!  I will update my review when I do her hair and the longer I have my treatment in my hair.to smooth the fly aways down because there wasn&#x27;t any!

            <li> After using this, I wondered why I did not order this earlier. Amazing product. Very easy to apply and use.&lt;br /&gt;Hair were super soft after 48 hours and washing, lot of frizz went away. Hair generally feel very healthy and are not falling at all. I had a hair fall issue prior to the use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who has frizzy hair that look like totally damaged and dried up. This changes them to a healthy shiny glow and very manageable.</li>
            <li> So since I did so much research and read every review possible when I was looking for an at home Brazilian Blowout I decided I would write a quick review. I did my hair and left it in for the full 3 days. By the morning of the 3rd day my hair was super oily but was not a big deal for me because I had planned to not go anywhere the 3 days. I washed my hair with the shampoo and condition they recommended. When I let my hair air dry naturally after the first wash it AMAZED me. I have very thick Caucasian hair with a lot of frizz and its slightly wavy normally. My hair is almost completely straight (I don&#x27;t really care much about how straight) and my hair has very little frizz (The very little I do have are the ends of my top layer and its prob because I need a hair cut. And its is not bad at all. Let just say I would happily leave the house with wet hair and I haven&#x27;t done that EVER) I am wondering how long it will last... I will try to keep you updated but so far I am extremely happy.  Update: March 18, 2015  so it has been a little over 5 weeks. Over all I am still happy with my hair. More frizz has returned but it&#x27;s manageable and my wave has returned. I am guessing I will most likely do my hair again in 2-3 weeks. That&#x27;s a total of 8 weeks. I was hoping that it lasted longer but I&#x27;m so happy with it that&#x27;s it&#x27;s not to big of a deal for me.  A few things: 1. I read that the smell was horrible. I was in a well vented area and the only time I even smelt it was when my hair was being blow dried (my sister was doing it) 2. I used only the recommended shampoo and conitioner during this entire time. I heard that it will come out faster if you use any other shampoo or conditoner. I have no idea if this is true or not. 3. I use to only wash my hair every other day but I found my hair looks oily on the second day. So now I am washing it everyday. (Never in my life has my hair looked oily. It is getting better about not looking oily as time has gone on)  So over all I still would give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Simply the best product I used in the last 2 years! My hair is soft and healthy. I highly recommend. Directions and straight forward and product is easy to use. You will save hundreds of dollars!</li>
            <li> I have long very frizzy unmanageable hair. I have curls in some areas and waves in others. I have had professional keratin treatments done before, but nothing has been a good as this product. My friend did it for me. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to back to salon again. I really love my results which were better than what I expected. I would recommend to get  it done in a very well ventilated area. The chemicals are very strong.</li>
            <li> The instructions were easy to follow and they have a website that does the steps for you to observe before applying this process and what to expect.  I was able to see the before and after on a client.  This option is works for me.</li>
            <li> Well first off I&#x27;m mixed (Black, white, and filipina) and have thickish medium length curly hair that gets frizzy in humidity. The treatment loosened my curls a lot, my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz, and it&#x27;s made my hair really soft. It was a 5 hour process to wash, dry, apply product, and straighten. I got my little sister to put the keratin in my hair then straightened it myself.  I got lazy with the right side so the curls aren&#x27;t as loose but that&#x27;s okay. I still have half a bottle so I&#x27;m planning to do another treatment in 2 months or so. If you&#x27;re on the fence about it definitely buy. It&#x27;s great! Smells like coconut. Fumes bother eyes some as I was tearing up a bit so straighten in a well ventilated area as advised. For better results leave in hair for 3 days. I went 4 before I washed it out. It may be a little itchy but worth it to me!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I got them, and watched YouTube video learned how to apply them. After I did it, my hair looked straight and smooth, it saved a lot time for me to get ready , since my hair is frizzy and puffy. But it only last for a week , my hair went back to what it was. It took me like 2 hours to complete the process to do the treatment, and it&#x27;s just not worth the time since the result only last that short.</li>
            <li> Me and my sister in law tried this, followed directions EXACTLY as per video instructions and the results were great until we washed our hair 3 days later.  Our hair went back to being completely wavy and frizzy.  It simply did not work for us, now my head itches every day and I&#x27;ve never had this problem before.  Another warning, the fumes are awful while applying the product.  We had all the windows open, fan blowing and we were sitting near the open door.  Our eyes were burning from the fumes and got a scratchy, nasty feeling in the throat.  It took us almost 4 hrs each to get through the entire procedure and of course we are very disappointed in wasting our time and money on this product.  Therefore, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend products from this company to anyone.</li>
            <li> Loved it, and the results were impressive, my hair is straighter now, I can almost skip the straightener</li>
            <li> Wow! The reviews are right. It works. Not as good as the $500 salon treatment. But what regular wage slave can afford that every six weeks. I put the treatment straightening treatment on, left it on for two days. After that I partially washed it out. Then did the straight iron to it while some remained in my hair. Left it on for 6 more hours. Straight ironed it again. Then washed it out. I love the shampoo and conditioner it came with. This product is my new holy grail. Since I sadly, I cannot afford the frequent visits to the salon.</li>
            <li> I had bought this before and it worked great!  Like a real brazilian blow out! It lasted around 3 weeks.  For some reason this time the solution did not seem to work as well.  It didn&#x27;t last as long as the last one I purchased.  I am not sure if I would buy it again since it didn&#x27;t work as well, but it is the only good option I have found for that salon blowout that everyone has stopped doing!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. But I would not recommend shampoo and conditioner. Also my hair dresser suggested using dish washing liquid instead of cleansing shampoo because your goal is to take all the grease from your hair what dish washer liquid can do. WEAR THE MASK WHEN YOU APPLY IT THE SMELL AND  fumes will irritate your eyes and thought. It does contain formaldehyde but that is the only thing that helps to straighten your hair, I have tried lots of non-formaldehyde products but they just DONT WORK.</li>
            <li> It is the first product I have tired and felt 100 percent happy with.  This is light putting a great conditioner on your hair and reaping the results of a perm from it.  Who thought of this...  I tried Wen and was so disappointed and now, I will never stop using this natural and wonderful product</li>
            <li> As my hair stylist moved &amp; I&#x27;m insanely picky about who touches my hair, this was my first time doing my own Keratin Smoothing/Brazillian Blowout treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon learning the Chi Enviro treatment appeared to be off the market, I decided on this one based on the positive reviews. Let me say this: those positive reviews are so warranted!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions are simple &amp; having been through &amp; watched my stylist do this on my hair for years, I found the application to be easy. Note: even though it&#x27;s easy, it IS time consuming. Plan accordingly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left it in from Friday morning until Monday morning. My first wash, I was expecting to see obvious curl &amp; this has my hair straighter than any treatment used in the past. It&#x27;s cut my styling time and I can also let it air dry without seeing an awful, frizzy mess. I am absolutely sold on this Keratin treatment. My hair is soft, silky &amp; the time saved is priceless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: definitely use a fan and make sure your area has great venilation. I did &amp; had no problems with lingering fumes, but I can see how it could easily be an issue depending on the layout of your space. I didn&#x27;t find the fumes insufferable, but there were a couple times where they definitely made themselves known.</li>
            <li> Love this product. It&#x27;s a lot cheaper to do my hair myself. I can not afford to go to a salon every 4 months and pay $250</li>
            <li> It smells awful. I sat outside while doing the treatment and it was still too strong. Takes a while to apply the product and the results were not what I expected. Definitely not worth two hours of work and not being able to wash your hair for 3 days.</li>
            <li> I have always had an issue with my curls. I am Native American and Black, and my routine of haor care is insane. To wash i must take a supply of hair stuff in the shower with me just to avoid my hair getting tangled up again. I sjampoo as normal. But when i condition i have to comb out my curls to avoid more tangles when finished. As i rinse i run my fingers through to keep it managable. Then soon as im finished ill hurry an oil my hair and brush back and roll into a bun. A 10 min shpwer quickly escalates into a 45 min one.  I wait a few days to allow my hair to air dry then take hair comb it and flat iron it. Which is about over an hour. Hmmm........  idk bout yall. But. Im sick of that routine. Plus after a few days if i dont press it again, i get that curly frizzy look. Lets not talk about sweating. Semi straight hair at the bottom, and curly hair at the roots. No. I no longer wantthe stress of thos mess. I tried thos product in hopes of being hair care stress free for a bit. Idk bout how bad the chemical smell is cuz personally i read the reviews before purchase and i prepared for all that. I had one fan in my bedroom window faced outward. Then one fan in my bathroom facing out as well. Then i have an air vent fan thingy i turned on in my bathroom, and i wore a surgical mask. No issues at all. Worked out perfect. I chose to keep the product in my hair a few more days...... and used the flat iron along the way to guarantee i get the straight  hair. And i did.  Worked perfect.  Im pleasedwith my investment. I am pleased on the outcome. Considering this IS my first time ever using keratin i am fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve paid for keratin treatments at the salon (3 different times) and none of them turned out as good as this one!!  With the ones I&#x27;ve had done in the past, I still would have to run the flat iron through after drying just to get that smooth, sleek look that I so love.  Not the case with this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions and it took me about 2 hours (I have a short bob with bangs).  The most challenging part was the back due to the short length.  My hair is thick and course.  It isn&#x27;t extremely curly but enough that I would call it more than wavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell didn&#x27;t bother me until it was time to run the flat iron through and even that wasn&#x27;t  terribly unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did the treatment on Thursday evening and even though it&#x27;s suppose to be express, I decided not to wash until 48 hours later.  After washing it blow dried quickly, taking about 10 mins (as it did after my salon treatments - MAJOR plus as untreated, even with my short length it would take every bit of 20 mins to get it 100% dry ) . I also didn&#x27;t need to run the flat iron through.  We had a weekend long event out in the hot humid air and no curling or frizzing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed it again today and decided to let it air dry - WOW it air dried pretty quickly and looks GREAT! Major bonus! No blow drying OR flat iron and I could walk out the door looking just like I spent all the time it USED to take me to get it just right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m EXTREMELY pleased with the results and will update after a few weeks or so......</li>
            <li> Good product.very efficient and last for a long period of time.it does not harm the hair.deffinitly will order it again</li>
            <li> For the price I expected the product to work longer than the first hair wash! I waited 3 days but after the first wash my hair went back to curly.</li>
            <li> This product has transformed my horribly frizzy hair to a totally different head of hair.  Very easy to apply.  I have given it a strong recommendation to three others who will be buying.  Saved a TON of money going this route instead of at the salon, and there is a lot of product, so I can even do 2-3 treatments.</li>
            <li> I brought product in March and just decided to use it because with all the rain I am tired of wearing a ponytail.  I am African-American with very soft,  thin hair.  I must say I was impressed.  My hair turned out very silky with a lot of body, like when I go to the Dominican shop.  I suggest you use product in well ventilated area.  No problem with smell, but my eyes  were burning.  Make sure your flat iron is a 450 degree one.  I tried using it on a lower heat seating because of thin hair but did no straighten as well.  I will update to see how long this lasts.</li>
            <li> I could not believe these people sent me the four bottles in a plastic envelope, instead of a box like they did before.. No protection, plastic bubbles, something to prevent from spilling with the pressure of other packages. The content of two of the bottles spilled; one of them was precisely the Keratin treatment.. almost 1/4 of the content gone! The seals popped !&lt;br /&gt;This is the third time I buy this product &#x27;cause it is good, but I am so mad with this mess. I feel I deserve some kind of compensation.&lt;br /&gt;Not even a FRAGILE sticker on the envelope. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m only giving it 4 star.</li>
            <li> It was very effective. I got straight and smooth hair.</li>
            <li> Works really well with my hair.  More effective than having the &amp;#34;blowout&amp;#34; done at a salon.  Seems rather &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34;,  but then again,  all of the related products are.</li>
            <li> It is not that straight, but it made my hair less bulky, the shampoo and conditioner are ok, don&#x27;t expect them to be great. Maybe I will try another brand next time. Make sure you use the appropriate amount to. I applied it on my mom&#x27;s hair and I used very little quantity so it didn&#x27;t worked but I applied it on me after and it worked. My hair is really frizzy and I think this helped me to control it.</li>
            <li> This really is a great product! It does what it says but you have to be careful when straightening your hair!!! It says to straighten till all the steam stops, but it is a little hard to get all of it with a regular straightener. If you have a fancy one that gets up to the correct temperatures then you are good to go. I like my hair wavy.I just don&#x27;t want the frizz so this is great for me. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> My hair is beautiful and smooth. I don&#x27;t have to use hair straightener anymore</li>
            <li> I typically never leave a review but I do read them quiet often when I am looking for something I don&#x27;t know enough about.  I bought this online and it came with in days.  I was excited because I had been conemplainting going to the salon but after looking into it they wanted to start 350 dollars and my hair is pretty long so I would imagine it would have been closer to 450.  I am overall very satisfied with this product.  Based in the reviews there were good and bad.  I followed directions washing my hair 3 times with the clarifying shampoo and then blow dryed.  When putting on the actual keratin lotion it actually made it feel like I was doing a conditioning treatment.  Yes the fumes got to me a little bit.  My eyes watered and my throat burned a little bit but I just walked away for a minute and then went back.  I was very unsure if I used enough product I didn&#x27;t want to over saturate or under saturate.  As the directions stated I did just comb it through with a fine tooth comb so I was hopefully I had enough in.  While waiting the 20 mins my hair started drying and I didn&#x27;t read that in reviews so I didn&#x27;t know if I didn&#x27;t have enough product it.  I decided to comb it with 5 mins left just to assure the parts drying had enough solution.  Once I started blow drying I did use a comb to blow dry you could smell the fumes again I did have to stop a few times to take a break.  Once it was all dry my hair looked like it always did after blow drying.  A big frizz ball.  When I straighten my hair I normally go from bottom up doing a row at a time so I am used to having to straighten every strand.  I did use 2 straighteners my chi is 2&amp;#34; and I have a 1/2 inch one that goes up to 450 degrees.  After straightening every strand over and over again I was finally done.  My hair did feel greesy which I am not used too.  The next day when I woke up still pin straight.  I did run my straightener over it a few times just incase.  Lasted all day straight.  Day 2 woke up still straight.  Started going about my day and since it is summer and hot out I had to shower after I was done working.  I washed and conditioned my hair with the set that came in this kit and then let it air dry naturally.  I can honestly say that my hair has never looked so good after drying naturally.  There was still some wave and body on the under neath part of my hair because that&#x27;s where I had tight curls.  My hair typically is very coarse frizz the underneath is very Curley and the top is a mix of wave.  I could never leave it Curley because I didn&#x27;t have nice curls and straightening it takes forever.  I am so pleased with how this product transformed my hair.  And the best part is it doesn&#x27;t feel dead or damaged.  I would recommend this product.  And I will use proberly for life!</li>
            <li> Loved this hair keratin product.. It really does what it says..my hair is very shinny, soft and easier to manage.. I&#x27;ve been in salons for many years to have keratin done and after had done myself I was really happy with the results..a lot of compliments from friends..try yourself and you will not regret it...</li>
            <li> The product is good for the hair and it last long. Good product. I wish the process was quicker to get it done.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product !!&lt;br /&gt;A professonal result at home without the expensive cost!!!!</li>
            <li> Did take frizz out but did not totally straighten hair despite following instructions to a t.  Still need flat iron daily</li>
            <li> This product is the best I have ever used.  I have highlighted hair and it worked like a miracle.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It worked well to straighten, but wasn&#x27;t as shiny or as smooth as the blowouts I had done at the salon. I liked it but will probably try another brand next time. Also, the fumes were ridiculous. Way worse than the one at the salon.</li>
            <li> My hair bacame more soft and shinny and a little bit straight, but not straight enought.&lt;br /&gt;But still be good.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting great things, but this really works.  I waited a bit to write this review to see how long my hair would be straight.  It lasted on my long hair for just over 4 months.  Longer than the treatments in the salon that I paid over $300 for each time.  It was really easy to use.  The thing that I love best about it is, you blow dry your hair and then straighten.  Some you end up straightening with your hair damp.  Those &#x27;pops&#x27; of hot product, especially at your neckline are downright painful.  I did not experience that at all with this product, thanks to the way that it works.  Not having that pain, and have straight, shiny hair that lasts - WOW, who knew.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!!!!! i had it done january 15th, for the fisrt 4 weeks i had to to nothing to my hair, it dry completely straight which is great but at the same time is not because you cant  give waves to the hair, with time i started using the john freida salon shape hot air brush and the remington curling wand coz the full-straight effect was gone which works for me coz i dont like straight hair, my hair is so shiny so soft and manegeable and completely frizz-free, i only use the shampoo of this kit and loreal eversleek deep conditioner, leavein cream and serum which has no sulfates, sodium or silicones, i recommend to everyone who has BKT not to use silicones because in order to remove most of silicones from your hair you have to use shampoos with sulfates or other harsh chemicals that are enemies of the brazilian treatment, if you use conditioner and leavein with cones and use a soft shampoo to take care of your BKT  the silicones eventually will create built-up in your hair because a soft shampoo wont remove cones and the hair will start to dry and will end up horrible by the time the BKT has gone, some people say that their treatment has not lasted buy not in my case coz i took really good care of it, since the moment i got my treatment i never go the salon!!!! i let my hair air dry and the shape it at home with the tools i mentioned before. I never had such an amazing hair!!</li>
            <li> Product is excellent! So far my grandauthter&#x27;s hair has been straight and beautiful for the past month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 4 weeks since I&#x27;ve performed the treatment &amp; I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. I&#x27;ve only used the flat iron to style my bangs &amp; it takes about 5-7 mins to completely dry my (shoulder blade length) hair. After I blow dry my hair looks like I&#x27;ve already flat ironed. I have naturally curly, frizzy hair that&#x27;s a nightmare during high humidity, but I&#x27;ve had no trouble with frizzy hair on rainy days since treatment. I&#x27;ve never had this kind of freedom from having to style my hair precisely everyday. I use dry shampoo sometimes in between washes &amp; apply a hair serum (either: usually Living Proof brand from Sephora) &amp; a kertain recharge combing cream after washing; I currently wash with the Keratin Research Brand &amp; have recently ordered additional one-liter combo shampoo/conditioner. The shampoo never leaves a residue &amp; the conditioner is light &amp; moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process to complete the keratin treatment took about 5 hours. I didn&#x27;t experience any terrible fumes, I kept a box fan &amp; the window open just in case. Other brands can really upset your respiratory system. I applied the treatment as directed, made several passes with the flat iron at 450F. Once I sealed the product in, my hair was very sleek &amp; pin straight. The product did make my hair feel heavy, then oily by day two. I hung in there as long as I could because I was really excited to see results, this was the first time I&#x27;d ever tried any kind of lasting treatment. I washed 36hrs after treatment with fabulous results. My hair felt light, strong &amp; best of all straight with absolutely no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used about 2-3oz of the Keratin Treatment product on my hair (about 1/4 of a 10oz bottle) &amp; 10oz shampoo/conditioner last about 45-60days. I wash my hair about 3-5 times weekly- I usually only shampoo once per shower.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m completely satisfied with my purchase, Keratin Research has saved me so much time &amp; frustration with my hair. I recommend this product &amp; brand to anyone to wants to wake up with beautiful hair everyday. I think the product is worth the money, I&#x27;ll be able to use this keratin treatment another 3-4 more times &amp; I&#x27;ve found great savings on Amazon for Keratin Research shampoo/conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing this Keratin treatment again!</li>
            <li> I got 4hair Power Brazilian Keratin (for ethnic hair) treatment in January, and it lasted for about 6 months! The stylist who gets it for me is hard to book with, so i decided to take measures in my own hands, plus save some money and time. I stumbled across this looking for the top rated keratin system, so i went on a limb and ordered it! Came fast! Easy to apply i would say&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; . . . Im an ingredient junkie and this stuff is the real deal!The important ingredients are at the top of the list! However, cant say the same about the conditioner (haven&#x27;t tried it yet based on the ingredient order)  Which is way i gave it 4 stars, 1 star off for the conditioner having more fragrance then important ingredients like the keratin and amino acids, they are very low on the list!. . I will be getting my favorite keratin conditioner, KeratinPerfect (sephora), but this is a good buy for the clarifying pre shampoo, which u need to make sure to open the hair&#x27;s cuticle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a tiny bit of formaldehyde, but for my kinky coarse hair, you need this ingredient so the keratin can penetrate deeper, and last longer. . . you need to make sure you are in a ventilated area to apply this. Also its great that you do not need to wait 4 days to wash, although after all the work blowdrying and flat ironing, im gonna wait anyways&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short hair to my chin, but my roots are very thick and kinky from letting my relaxer grow out for many months as well as letting my keratin treatment fade, and prob could get 1 or 2 more treatments from this size bottle . Will have to update on how long it lasts, but Im happy so far and my bf just noticed my hair was nice and straight as Im writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you amazon and keratin research for saving me money and making these types of products so accessible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The stylist who cut my hair was amazed on how my hair was straightened by this! Definitely saves time blow drying, but one area that Irushed thru since it was the last section, didn&#x27;t really pick up the keratin as much, you need to be sure to do section by section as if you were coloring the hair!</li>
            <li> Best Product for straightening. I love the way it leaves my hair and each treatment lasts over 6 months. It has been the one I&#x27;ve continued to use since..The price is great.</li>
            <li> im in love with this cant live without it now&lt;br /&gt;this thing do wonder to your hair&lt;br /&gt;it leave my hair so soft its unbelievable&lt;br /&gt;my hair completely stop shredding</li>
            <li> It took me 2 1/2 hours to complete the process and my hair looks great. Product is easy to apply. I have allergies and the smell did not affect me.</li>
            <li> 5 Dec 2012 (3 stars)&lt;br /&gt;I was waiting anxiously for this item because it was mentioned that \\&quot;No Need to wait 3 days- Express formula\\&quot;. However, when i received the keratin treatment, the instructions on the bottle is totally different! There is a 72 hours waiting time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shall update this review again when i try it out tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updates!(13 dec 2012 4 stars)&lt;br /&gt;This is not the first time i have done keratin treatment. I have done it before at a salon and have also tried DIY kit.&lt;br /&gt;Below is my short review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)The solution STINKS!! It smells like poison and it makes my eyes tear and nose burn. I was so afraid that i will faint and die. Therefore it is important to do in a room with good ventilation.&lt;br /&gt;2) I only use very little solutions (ard 4 tablespoon) for my shoulder length hair and it is already enough to cover the whole head. As i cannot tolerate having the solutions in my hair, i only leave it on for around 5 hours (the amount of time i sleep). Surprisingly, my hair is easier to maintain. Maybe because my skills are not so good therefore it is not as good as the salon. I do encounter 1 side of my hair not as silky as the other side. So if you have a friend to do the flat iron for you, i believe results will be even better. This is DEFINITELY better than other DIY kit which i have tried. Therefore it is not necessary to leave it for 72 hours unless you have very curly or frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After more than a week since i done the keratin treatment, my hair is getting more and more easier to maintain and it is even smoother and silkier than the first wash. The conditioner is very good! With just a little amount, my hair is all moisturized and i believe it helps to make the hair more manageable and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a good product which is worth trying even though it took me around 2 hours and end up with aching arms and fingers but i ended up saving lots of money! I will give it 5 stars if the solution does not make my nose feels like it is being burned by acid. Of course, this 300ml keratin treatment is going to last me a LOOOOOOOOOOONG time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Just a comment to seller. Maybe you can choose to put the bottles into a box to send it out instead of using just the padded envelope.

            <li> This lasts forever. I mainly use it to touch up my roots and it keeps my hair manageable, soft and shiny. The best thing is that it has not damaged my hair at all. It has the typical Keratin smell, but it&#x27;s manageable if you use it in a ventilated area or just where you have a window. Wear gloves or you will feel your hands very dry for at least a few days after application. I will buy again</li>
            <li> Yes this works! But...&lt;br /&gt;I took one star off because the instructions do not apply for all hair textures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to consider certain factors that will impact the results on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)How curly is your hair and texture.&lt;br /&gt;2)How straight do you want it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal advice for straight- frizzy / wavy Caucasian textured hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is straight with frizz or wavy (not actually curly) then you don&#x27;t have to wait the full 3- 4 days, you can leave it for 1-2 days it will eliminate frizz and blow drying time. How long it lasts will depend on how well you followed the instructions , how long you left the treatment in your hair, and how much heat you used to seal in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want your hair as straight as possible (for as long as possible) then you must consider leaving the product at least 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal advice for curly hair 2C-4C / African American textured hair:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair is curly 2C-4C then you should wait the full recommend 3-4days and use the maximum 450 degrees heat for optimal penetration of the product. Or If you are a curly who just wants to reduce blowdrying time when styling straight and not really get rid of curls then you can leave the product in for at least 48 hours, and not wait the full 3-4 days. This will however reduce your curl pattern so if you are a 3C , the product will loosen your curls considerably and maybe bring you down to a 3A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I used this product on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair. After use her hair was much smoother and very shiny. Definitely will be using on my hair as well. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love the treatment worked well I my major curly hair! I don&#x27;t like the shampoo thought all these make my hair dry but that&#x27;s all keratin products. I love it though</li>
            <li> It did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Only a 4 because it doesn&#x27;t last months like the other treatments I&#x27;ve used in the past. Only lasts a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> it made made my hair straight but it&#x27;s falling a lot, I could&#x27;ve gone to Walmart and got a cheap perm, it would&#x27;ve had the same effect , I&#x27;ve done keratin treatment before, this is by far the worst I&#x27;ve had, I get nervous everytime I wash or brush my hair, I lost so much, I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> so like it..i just did it by myself.instructions are easy to follow.and i did..</li>
            <li> I was excited to use this product as I have wanted to tame my thick, unruly hair for quite sometime without spending hundreds of dollars in a salon. While most of the reviews seemed positive, I did note that some complained about the painful tingling sensation that occurs when the treatment makes contact with one&#x27;s scalp/skin and concerns about its formaldehyde content. Foolishly, I ignored those reviews and decided to give it a go anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days ago, I had my wonderfully patient sister help me with applying the treatment after I washed my hair with the clarifying shampoo and blow dried it. (I washed my hair 3 times to make sure that it was super clean for the application process, and it made my easily tangled hair even more of a mess than usual. Fortunately, I have a &amp;#34;Tangle Teaser&amp;#34; brush that was able to sort out that mess with minimal pain while I blow dried.) She painstakingly applied the treatment using a bowl and hair color brush so as not to waste the product but still saturate my hair. The whole process took less than an hour (mind you, my hair is SUPER thick). By the time she had finished, my scalp was bright red and burning from the few places that she had accidentally gotten the solution on my skin, and both of our eyes were red and watering from what I can only assume was the formaldehyde in the solution. I definitely didn&#x27;t expect that to happen in a well-ventilated room. I thought I would get used to the irritant after awhile, but, boy, was I wrong! While my scalp stopped hurting after awhile, my eye irritation persisted for the 20 minutes that I waited for the solution to sink in after application. And then it got even worse. Blow drying and then straightening my hair had my eyes hurting and watering so much that I could barely see what I was doing. The fumes are a killer. I was seriously wondering for awhile if my vision would be impaired as a result. Never mind how much I was coughing as a result of still inhaling those fumes, even in a well ventilated room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through great pains (literally) to follow all of the instructions, I expected to see spectacular results. Not so much. I&#x27;m not a novice when it comes to straightening my hair. I&#x27;ve been straightening for over 15 years. Yet, after using this treatment, my hair didn&#x27;t look smooth and glossy like it usually does after straightening. It looked and still looks dry and dead. Definitely not a look that I would have paid so much for. To add insult to injury, after spending over an hour and a half straightening those toxic fumes away, I woke up the following morning to find that some of my hair had gotten kinks in it as I slept (which doesn&#x27;t ever happen when I simply straighten it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given everything that this stupid product has put me through, I&#x27;m waiting the full three days before washing it out. I&#x27;m not expecting a miracle tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After waiting the three days, I washed out the product and was less than surprised by my results. While my roots were straight and smooth, the closer I got to the ends of my hair, the more fried and damaged my hair became. As another reviewer also noted, it caused split ends like I have never before had in my entire life! I had to spend a lot of money at my local Red Door Salon and Spa to have some of this damage undone. My stylist had to cut a good few inches off of my hair due to the damage and apply treatments to fix the ends. A few hours later, I was left with hair in a very short bob that flips out at the bottom in a very unattractive way if left to air dry. My stylist did everything she could to save my hair. Though this look is not what I was going for in the least, it is far better than what this treatment left me with. (The flipping out at the bottom is a result of the damage from the treatment, not anything my stylist did. Be advised that this could happen to you.)</li>
            <li> My hair naturally straight but I tend to have frizz so I tried this product and I&#x27;m very disappointed that pretty much lasted around three weeks and now my hair has split ends almost in every hair strand and it looks so dull and lifeless</li>
            <li> Easy to use and lasts longer than a few other products I have  tried</li>
            <li> I have to be honest and say that it&#x27;s not as good as keratin from the salons, but for a DIY it&#x27;s pretty good!! I bleach my hair often so it&#x27;s pretty fried, but the keratin treatments I can apply myself where needed has really helped improve the overall health of my hair. Great product for over processed hair.. Smells nice too!!</li>
