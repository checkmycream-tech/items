            <li>The reviews were really nice for this perfume</li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of a girly CK One...</li>
            <li>The decorative bottle is a nice touch, too.</li>
            <li>Ferragamo perfumes are soooo nice.</li>

            <li>I love this perfume and Nordstrom</li>
            <li>i love this light scent!</li>
            <li>I believe that it will be fashionable for many years.</li>
            <li>When I come closer to my patients and co-workers, they would compliment me that they love my \\&quot;delightful\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li>Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it, but I recommend that the only place where you can find it at the best price is AMAZON.</li>
            <li>THE SMELL IS NOT OVER WHELMING LIKE MOST PERFUMES</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve ever gotten so many comments on a fragrance, and my (out of state) sister now uses it also.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>the top of this bottle is made it a way</li>
            <li>ppl love it</li>
            <li>but I love it.</li>
            <li>okay....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>this is more formal)</li>
            <li>co-worker had it on and my nose fell in love with it instantly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>just had to get it myself and am so pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>i love this fragrance.</li>
            <li>i think it is definitely my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>I took a risk in buying a perfume without smelling it, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I have used this perfume for more than two years, but never bought it online.</li>
            <li>and I love this floral scent :)</li>
            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>Incanto Shine, I love Incanto</li>
            <li>Light and nice to smell.</li>
            <li>An added bonus is most men who give me a hug</li>
            <li>I are allergic to most perfumes, but neither of us have never had any reaction to this one.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>lovely scent.</li>
            <li>I have been in love with this product for over 5 years now.</li>
            <li>Not a lot of product is required for a wonderful scent all day long.</li>
            <li>A great gift, I loved walking into the kitchen and smelling it on my Aunt, she is usually very hard to buy for but she loved this.</li>
            <li>(girly flowery is very sweet</li>
            <li>very good, just the same as I have imagined</li>
            <li>but I love it and enjoy wearing it</li>
            <li>It is so fresh and nice.</li>
            <li>It smells very fresh and isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and was excited to get it today.</li>
            <li>I purchased these in mini sets of 4 (dream, shine, heaven and I can&#x27;t remember the 4th one) at Sephora way back in the day and loved it!</li>
            <li>other than that, the product itself is great!</li>
            <li>Smells very light and sweet.</li>
            <li>This perfume was shipped very quickly and is 1/2 the price of what it sells for at Target, even with shipping costs.  </li>
            <li>Ultimately, this perfume is a great balance of making it&#x27;s presence known, but not in an overwhelming way.</li>
            <li>sometimes is too strong.</li>
            <li>Sweet and sexy.</li>
            <li>It works well with my body chemistry, and while it starts out sweet, it&#x27;s still sophisticated, and it turns warmer as the day progresses.</li>
            <li>Feminine with a hint of fruity goodness but not too much... Magical and enchanting!</li>
            <li>it is a nice light pretty fragance, not too sweet not too strong</li>
            <li>I love the clean sweet smell</li>
            <li>Oh, and the bottle is HUGE for the price.</li>
            <li>I had to review this perfume, to add to the fantastic feedback,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn this as my primary perfume for about 3 years now and still get tons of compliments on it.</li>
            <li>it is relly good and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good choice for a young girl.</li>
            <li>so light and fresh!</li>
            <li>I first smelled this perfume when I went to the Salvatore Ferragamo store on 5th Ave, and fell in love.</li>
            <li>worth giving it a shot!</li>
            <li>Snell nothing like the original</li>
            <li>The bottle top of the perfume broke off the first day and it and leaked everywhere.</li>
            <li>I wanted a new perfume, but I couldn&#x27;t find one in a department store that I really liked, so after reading online reviews, I ordered Incanto Shine on a whim.</li>
            <li>AND IT IS A CLEAN</li>
            <li>I never understood a clean fruity smell till I smelled this perfume.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;, but very good for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>BUT with all that said I guess it is good enough</li>
            <li>I am cool with it</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon :-)</li>
            <li>wow,incredibly amazing,love it love it,beleive me it is one of my fave perfume now,im very picky in fragrance</li>
            <li>Chances are you will be the only person around using it because it is fairly obscure.</li>
            <li>simply because he loved it....</li>
            <li>so i decided to give it a try, as the price was not bad.  </li>
            <li>The packaging/bottle is beautiful, and the incantu box was wrapped tightly in plastic</li>
            <li>By far the best thirty dollars I have ever spent on a perfume.</li>
            <li>arrived quickly</li>
            <li>Smells amazingly fresh &amp; cool</li>
            <li>but it smells good and it lasts all day long</li>
            <li>Love this new fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Based on the description and bottle, I was worried that it would be sickeningly sweet or smell too young (I&#x27;m 24), but I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>This is amazing, I love it, it is exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>This was such an amazing deal for this product.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell amazing</li>
            <li>It gives me a sense of feeling fresh all day</li>
            <li>This is a lovely soft scent.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is by far my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much that im on my 3rd bottle!!!</li>
            <li>since im a perfume/spray collector, i rarely finish even 1 bottle of perfume...</li>
            <li>The perfume packaging is pretty cool</li>
            <li>Very feminine and unique.</li>
            <li>Everybody loves this perfume, some more price is reasonable, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The perfume smells like bug spray, not the original way it normally smells when I order it.  </li>
            <li>I was a little bit worried that the delivery and packaging would break it, but it turned out the bottle was still in good condition.</li>
            <li>since I love fragrances (and it&#x27;s a part of my daily routine), I tried wearing it at work.  </li>
            <li>She likes it so this is really her review !</li>
            <li>This is likely my favorite perfume ever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s crisp with fruity and flowery overtones, but not at all saccharine.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle of Shine and let me just say that men love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like what you would imagine a fairy to smell like, and the bottle is so pretty to look at.</li>
            <li>Would recommend to anyone who likes soft scented, light floral perfumes.</li>
            <li>My hubby for the first time ever asked me which perfume was I wearing...</li>
            <li>I bought this perfume once at TJ Maxx just because the box was very pretty, but really loved this fresh and subtle smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is not what I expected and it has a strong men&#x27;s kinda cologne scent mix with a light floral smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that i found this, and I will forsure be buying more in the near near future!</li>
            <li>Wow, the only thing that I can say about this perfume is: AMAZING.</li>
            <li>While I love the brand and the scent is one of my most favorites, this bottle sucks.  </li>
            <li>In my experience younger generations (teenagers-young adulthood) seem to prefer this perfume more than older individuals.</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Please keep in mind that this is an eau de toilet, so it is not as strong as a eau de parfume or higher.</li>
            <li>Where else can you get a large bottle of a brand perfume for just $26?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really super sexy, a little floral and has a lot of fruit  but not as much as to be  \\&quot;cloy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Such a clean, pretty smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light with a gentle sweetness but definitely has a presence on you.</li>
            <li>but I would&#x27;ve rather put the $28 towards the real thing.</li>
            <li>She was very concerned I would buy her a \\&quot;granny-type</li>
            <li>I really like this scent.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very wasteful.</li>
            <li>and it stays the whole day and night, without you have to put on anymore</li>
            <li>The shipping is really fast.</li>
            <li>The shipment was fast and well protected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this perfume  for years now and it is very affordable.  </li>
            <li>i bay this item to my girl and really like it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I had never gotton so much compliments with a perfume like this.</li>
            <li>I used this scent a few years ago and forgot how much I liked it.</li>
            <li>This is a very HARD to find fragrance, it is also MY PERSONAL FAVORITE and to be able to get such a large bottle for the price blows me away!!!!</li>
            <li>The original smells glorious and when I seen it for only $29.00</li>
            <li>Initially received as a Christmas present a few years ago, smells AMAZING!!</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was slightly masculine smelling</li>
            <li>but I ordered it and chose super saver shipping and received it the next day!!!!  </li>
            <li>I was a little bummed to see that the bottle leaks when I spray it, the smell of the fragrance is lighter than I expected and the alcohol smell is strong which leads me to believe that this might not be authentic....</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>Wow!!</li>
            <li>I was  like wow!!</li>
            <li>think it is worthwhile in such a low price and use it as a gift for young girl.</li>
            <li>I adore this rare fragrance and at the current price it is a steal.</li>
            <li>It is light enough to use on your pulse points without being overpowering, smells very feminine, and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>so it was definitely new.  </li>
            <li>So when I ran out of it I decided to get a new one form Amazon.</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find such a great price for this product;  however, I am so disappointed that the spray mechanism does not work.</li>
            <li>The scent is not too intense that it will overwhelm others who are around you, however it&#x27;s not too light that the scent will go by unnoticed.</li>
            <li>I am a frequent purchaser of this particular fragrance, and the version I received this time seems off.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light but long lasting.</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s only a ETD, surprisingly, it lasts me a whole day--very subtle, but it lingers for a long time.</li>
            <li>So happy to find this perfume online and less expensive for an even larger bottle than I had originally had.</li>
            <li>so I would not trigger any allergic reaction to sensitive people.  </li>
            <li>Boy, was I VERY pleasantly surprised when it came.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>But mature.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that expensive and it has a light sweet scent.</li>
            <li>Overall its decent.</li>
            <li>AND IT REALLY LASTS A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s young friend wanted me to order this for her ,as I use my account to buy other things that she wants !</li>
            <li>&quot; but this perfume definitely has an appeal for younger, and also older people like me!</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter is very picky, and I let her open a present before Christmas.  </li>
            <li>BUT A SMALL SWEET SMELL.</li>
            <li>I typically pay 3x that for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>A sweet subtle scent with a hint of citrus</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Incanto Shine is a beautiful, strong, feminine fragrance</li>
            <li> and the bottle is very nice and elegant.</li>
            <li> Love this scent!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of customer descriptions and reviews--and, I&#x27;m glad I did!  </li>
            <li> but all in all this is a great perfume, but in a while you&#x27;ll get used to it, so its good to have more than one perfume &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Love this scent!</li>
            <li> and i love it!</li>
            <li> and I just love it!</li>

            <li> Great fragrance my wife enjoy it.</li>
            <li> the scent itself is amazing.</li>
            <li> It has a spicy hint that is nice for fall.</li>
            <li> All my friends are complimenting me on always smelling nice.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> Once Sephora stopped stocking it, I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The reviews were really nice for this perfume</li>
            <li> It kind of reminds me of a girly CK One...</li>
            <li> The decorative bottle is a nice touch, too.</li>
            <li> Ferragamo perfumes are soooo nice.</li>
            <li> Many people over the years have stopped me to ask what I am wearing because it smells so good.</li>
            <li> and I really liked it.</li>
            <li> So fresh!!!everyone compliments it, great gift as it is not too potent, easy for everyone to love.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this smell!  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love the smell!</li>
            <li> Happy to see it again on Amazon at such a great price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun and flirty scent its great for daytime AND nighttime fun!!</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and Nordstrom</li>
            <li> i love this light scent!</li>
            <li> I believe that it will be fashionable for many years.</li>
            <li> When I come closer to my patients and co-workers, they would compliment me that they love my \\&quot;delightful\\&quot; smell.</li>
            <li> Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it, but I recommend that the only place where you can find it at the best price is AMAZON.</li>
            <li> THE SMELL IS NOT OVER WHELMING LIKE MOST PERFUMES</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve ever gotten so many comments on a fragrance, and my (out of state) sister now uses it also.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> the top of this bottle is made it a way</li>
            <li> ppl love it</li>
            <li> but I love it.</li>
            <li> okay....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> this is more formal)</li>
            <li> co-worker had it on and my nose fell in love with it instantly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> just had to get it myself and am so pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> i love this fragrance.</li>
            <li> i think it is definitely my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li> I took a risk in buying a perfume without smelling it, but I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for more than two years, but never bought it online.</li>
            <li> and I love this floral scent :)</li>
            <li> Love this scent.</li>
            <li> Incanto Shine, I love Incanto</li>
            <li> Light and nice to smell.</li>
            <li> An added bonus is most men who give me a hug</li>
            <li> I are allergic to most perfumes, but neither of us have never had any reaction to this one.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> lovely scent.</li>
            <li> I have been in love with this product for over 5 years now.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of product is required for a wonderful scent all day long.</li>
            <li> A great gift, I loved walking into the kitchen and smelling it on my Aunt, she is usually very hard to buy for but she loved this.</li>
            <li> (girly flowery is very sweet</li>
            <li> very good, just the same as I have imagined</li>
            <li> but I love it and enjoy wearing it</li>
            <li> It is so fresh and nice.</li>
            <li> It smells very fresh and isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and was excited to get it today.</li>
            <li> I purchased these in mini sets of 4 (dream, shine, heaven and I can&#x27;t remember the 4th one) at Sephora way back in the day and loved it!</li>
            <li> other than that, the product itself is great!</li>
            <li> Smells very light and sweet.</li>
            <li> This perfume was shipped very quickly and is 1/2 the price of what it sells for at Target, even with shipping costs.  </li>
            <li> Ultimately, this perfume is a great balance of making it&#x27;s presence known, but not in an overwhelming way.</li>
            <li> sometimes is too strong.</li>
            <li> Sweet and sexy.</li>
            <li> It works well with my body chemistry, and while it starts out sweet, it&#x27;s still sophisticated, and it turns warmer as the day progresses.</li>
            <li> Feminine with a hint of fruity goodness but not too much... Magical and enchanting!</li>
            <li> it is a nice light pretty fragance, not too sweet not too strong</li>
            <li> I love the clean sweet smell</li>
            <li> Oh, and the bottle is HUGE for the price.</li>
            <li> I had to review this perfume, to add to the fantastic feedback,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this as my primary perfume for about 3 years now and still get tons of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> it is relly good and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good choice for a young girl.</li>
            <li> so light and fresh!</li>
            <li> I first smelled this perfume when I went to the Salvatore Ferragamo store on 5th Ave, and fell in love.</li>
            <li> worth giving it a shot!</li>
            <li> Snell nothing like the original</li>
            <li> The bottle top of the perfume broke off the first day and it and leaked everywhere.</li>
            <li> I wanted a new perfume, but I couldn&#x27;t find one in a department store that I really liked, so after reading online reviews, I ordered Incanto Shine on a whim.</li>
            <li> AND IT IS A CLEAN</li>
            <li> I never understood a clean fruity smell till I smelled this perfume.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;, but very good for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> BUT with all that said I guess it is good enough</li>
            <li> I am cool with it</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon :-)</li>
            <li> wow,incredibly amazing,love it love it,beleive me it is one of my fave perfume now,im very picky in fragrance</li>
            <li> Chances are you will be the only person around using it because it is fairly obscure.</li>
            <li> simply because he loved it....</li>
            <li> so i decided to give it a try, as the price was not bad.  </li>
            <li> The packaging/bottle is beautiful, and the incantu box was wrapped tightly in plastic</li>
            <li> By far the best thirty dollars I have ever spent on a perfume.</li>
            <li> arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Smells amazingly fresh &amp; cool</li>
            <li> but it smells good and it lasts all day long</li>
            <li> Love this new fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Based on the description and bottle, I was worried that it would be sickeningly sweet or smell too young (I&#x27;m 24), but I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, I love it, it is exactly what i expected.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> This was such an amazing deal for this product.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell amazing</li>
            <li> It gives me a sense of feeling fresh all day</li>
            <li> This is a lovely soft scent.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is by far my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> I loved it so much that im on my 3rd bottle!!!</li>
            <li> since im a perfume/spray collector, i rarely finish even 1 bottle of perfume...</li>
            <li> The perfume packaging is pretty cool</li>
            <li> Very feminine and unique.</li>
            <li> Everybody loves this perfume, some more price is reasonable, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The perfume smells like bug spray, not the original way it normally smells when I order it.  </li>
            <li> I was a little bit worried that the delivery and packaging would break it, but it turned out the bottle was still in good condition.</li>
            <li> since I love fragrances (and it&#x27;s a part of my daily routine), I tried wearing it at work.  </li>
            <li> She likes it so this is really her review !</li>
            <li> This is likely my favorite perfume ever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crisp with fruity and flowery overtones, but not at all saccharine.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Shine and let me just say that men love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like what you would imagine a fairy to smell like, and the bottle is so pretty to look at.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who likes soft scented, light floral perfumes.</li>
            <li> My hubby for the first time ever asked me which perfume was I wearing...</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume once at TJ Maxx just because the box was very pretty, but really loved this fresh and subtle smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is not what I expected and it has a strong men&#x27;s kinda cologne scent mix with a light floral smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that i found this, and I will forsure be buying more in the near near future!</li>
            <li> Wow, the only thing that I can say about this perfume is: AMAZING.</li>
            <li> While I love the brand and the scent is one of my most favorites, this bottle sucks.  </li>
            <li> In my experience younger generations (teenagers-young adulthood) seem to prefer this perfume more than older individuals.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance and exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Please keep in mind that this is an eau de toilet, so it is not as strong as a eau de parfume or higher.</li>
            <li> Where else can you get a large bottle of a brand perfume for just $26?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really super sexy, a little floral and has a lot of fruit  but not as much as to be  \\&quot;cloy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Such a clean, pretty smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light with a gentle sweetness but definitely has a presence on you.</li>
            <li> but I would&#x27;ve rather put the $28 towards the real thing.</li>
            <li> She was very concerned I would buy her a \\&quot;granny-type</li>
            <li> I really like this scent.</li>
            <li> but I really like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very wasteful.</li>
            <li> and it stays the whole day and night, without you have to put on anymore</li>
            <li> The shipping is really fast.</li>
            <li> The shipment was fast and well protected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume  for years now and it is very affordable.  </li>
            <li> i bay this item to my girl and really like it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I had never gotton so much compliments with a perfume like this.</li>
            <li> I used this scent a few years ago and forgot how much I liked it.</li>
            <li> This is a very HARD to find fragrance, it is also MY PERSONAL FAVORITE and to be able to get such a large bottle for the price blows me away!!!!</li>
            <li> The original smells glorious and when I seen it for only $29.00</li>
            <li> Initially received as a Christmas present a few years ago, smells AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was slightly masculine smelling</li>
            <li> but I ordered it and chose super saver shipping and received it the next day!!!!  </li>
            <li> I was a little bummed to see that the bottle leaks when I spray it, the smell of the fragrance is lighter than I expected and the alcohol smell is strong which leads me to believe that this might not be authentic....</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Wow!!</li>
            <li> I was  like wow!!</li>
            <li> think it is worthwhile in such a low price and use it as a gift for young girl.</li>
            <li> I adore this rare fragrance and at the current price it is a steal.</li>
            <li> It is light enough to use on your pulse points without being overpowering, smells very feminine, and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> so it was definitely new.  </li>
            <li> So when I ran out of it I decided to get a new one form Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find such a great price for this product;  however, I am so disappointed that the spray mechanism does not work.</li>
            <li> The scent is not too intense that it will overwhelm others who are around you, however it&#x27;s not too light that the scent will go by unnoticed.</li>
            <li> I am a frequent purchaser of this particular fragrance, and the version I received this time seems off.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light but long lasting.</li>
            <li> Though it&#x27;s only a ETD, surprisingly, it lasts me a whole day--very subtle, but it lingers for a long time.</li>
            <li> So happy to find this perfume online and less expensive for an even larger bottle than I had originally had.</li>
            <li> so I would not trigger any allergic reaction to sensitive people.  </li>
            <li> Boy, was I VERY pleasantly surprised when it came.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> But mature.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that expensive and it has a light sweet scent.</li>
            <li> Overall its decent.</li>
            <li> AND IT REALLY LASTS A LONG TIME.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s young friend wanted me to order this for her ,as I use my account to buy other things that she wants !</li>
            <li> &quot; but this perfume definitely has an appeal for younger, and also older people like me!</li>
            <li> My teenage daughter is very picky, and I let her open a present before Christmas.  </li>
            <li> BUT A SMALL SWEET SMELL.</li>
            <li> I typically pay 3x that for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li> A sweet subtle scent with a hint of citrus</li>
            <li> I find it lasts a long time, and have received several compliments in the 2 days I&#x27;ve had it.</li>
            <li> Btw this perfume last very long.</li>
            <li> And, it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a perfume fanatic, and i would normally read the reviews before making a purchase, and to tell you, it is what they say.</li>
            <li> I widely recommend it for spring and summer...</li>
            <li> and I have to be careful of any fragrances I wear (including laundry detergent)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had a few days so no compliments yet</li>
            <li> The product was received as expected, in a timely manner and well protected by packaging.</li>
            <li> It is a subtle, classy, youthful feminine smell.</li>
            <li> I will search for other products and see what is out there.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s because the vendor did something different,</li>
            <li> I want to try all the other fragrances to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve basically stopped wearing all my other scents.</li>
            <li> aside from it is way cheaper than any other perfumes that i like...</li>
            <li> the only reason i gave a 4 star is that the shipping is too slow.</li>
            <li> ::thumbs down to the packaging::</li>
            <li> When you press the sprayer down you get it all over your hand and the bottle.</li>
            <li> have an odd body chemistry</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this fragrance, however, when I received my shipment, the bottle was intact, but when you spray it, it leaks bad!</li>
            <li> I just give myself a little squirt of this scent</li>
            <li> yet so it&#x27;s very hard to buy a perfume based on NEVER really hearing about it or smelling it...</li>
            <li> I past by</li>
            <li> I usually buy at Nordstrom&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I have been using Incanto Shine for the past 5 years and it has become my signature scent.  </li>
            <li> this one I think is fake it does not stay very long, I have bought this product b4 and everywhere I go</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for at least 3 years</li>
            <li> A timeless perfume (at least to me).</li>
            <li> For me, its not a girly flowery scent, its like a lady flowery scent, you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s subtle yet noticable.  </li>
            <li> Now everything on my dresser smells like Incanto Shine, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing, but I&#x27;d rather the money I spent went on me and not all over everywhere else.</li>
            <li> that if you spray perfume 1/3 of it ends up on your hands, not ideal.</li>
            <li> FAKE.</li>
            <li> This is fake and smells like alcohol and flowers.  </li>
            <li> its disappointing.</li>
            <li> Too bad they no longer sell these in those sets anymore.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m So disappointed.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> That&#x27;s what i wanttttt!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and was excited to get it today. I was a little bummed to see that the bottle leaks when I spray it, the smell of the fragrance is lighter than I expected and the alcohol smell is strong which leads me to believe that this might not be authentic....BUT with all that said I guess it is good enough and you get what you pay for. I took a chance with buying this perfume online and that&#x27;s ok I am cool with it but I would&#x27;ve rather put the $28 towards the real thing. As always though, the customer service is great and handled my issue with no problems. Thanks Amazon :-)</li>
            <li> Didnt get to use it though but pricing wise is good.</li>
            <li> This perfume was shipped very quickly and is 1/2 the price of what it sells for at Target, even with shipping costs.  The packaging/bottle is beautiful, and the incantu box was wrapped tightly in plastic so it was definitely new.  My teenage daughter is very picky, and I let her open a present before Christmas.  She loved this perfume, and so do I.  I would highly recommend it.  She was very concerned I would buy her a \\&quot;granny-type scent,\\&quot; but this perfume definitely has an appeal for younger, and also older people like me!</li>
            <li> I purchased these in mini sets of 4 (dream, shine, heaven and I can&#x27;t remember the 4th one) at Sephora way back in the day and loved it! Too bad they no longer sell these in those sets anymore.     A sweet subtle scent with a hint of citrus; it&#x27;s the only thing I&#x27;ve been using since.   I&#x27;d say, \\&quot;Give it a try!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This was such an amazing deal for this product. I love this perfume and Nordstrom recently stopped putting out this line by Salvatore Ferragamo. I&#x27;m so glad that i found this, and I will forsure be buying more in the near near future!</li>
            <li> the only reason i gave a 4 star is that the shipping is too slow. other than that, the product itself is great! i love this light scent!</li>
            <li> I really like this scent. It has a spicy hint that is nice for fall. At first I thought it was slightly masculine smelling but I really like it.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance and exactly what I expected. Please keep in mind that this is an eau de toilet, so it is not as strong as a eau de parfume or higher.</li>
            <li> My husband gave this perfume to me as anniversary flattery. It&#x27;s really super sexy, a little floral and has a lot of fruit  but not as much as to be  \\&quot;cloy\\&quot;. I widely recommend it for spring and summer... although it is a 2005 fragrance  I believe that it will be fashionable for many years.</li>
            <li> MY GIRLFRIEND LOVES THIS PERFUME!</li>
            <li> This smell is divine one of the best smile a man would like on a woman..yummy. .I would collect all these fragrances. .</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this smell!  It is a subtle, classy, youthful feminine smell. I work in a hospital setting.  Supposedly, we should not wear scents at the hospital, but since I love fragrances (and it&#x27;s a part of my daily routine), I tried wearing it at work.  I just give myself a little squirt of this scent so I would not trigger any allergic reaction to sensitive people.  When I come closer to my patients and co-workers, they would compliment me that they love my \\&quot;delightful\\&quot; smell. It gives me a sense of feeling fresh all day (but of course, if I want to, I would re-apply it in the afternoon).  Though it&#x27;s only a ETD, surprisingly, it lasts me a whole day--very subtle, but it lingers for a long time. When I am not at work, I sparingly spray this on multiple points of my body and it&#x27;s so-oh-heavenly!  My sweetheart loves the smell on me, too!  Give it a try and see if this scent is for you.</li>
            <li> Best scent! So fresh!!!everyone compliments it, great gift as it is not too potent, easy for everyone to love.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s young friend wanted me to order this for her ,as I use my account to buy other things that she wants ! She would not allow me to pay for this, as I wanted to buy this for her, for all the help when she helped us move ! She likes it so this is really her review !</li>
            <li> Wow!! By far the best thirty dollars I have ever spent on a perfume. Incanto Shine is a beautiful, strong, feminine fragrance and I thought was perfect for summer. All my friends are complimenting me on always smelling nice. Not a lot of product is required for a wonderful scent all day long.</li>
            <li> Wow, the only thing that I can say about this perfume is: AMAZING. The price excellent and everybody notice the smells. Get it, you won&#x27;t regret it, but I recommend that the only place where you can find it at the best price is AMAZON. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Smells amazingly fresh &amp; cool</li>
            <li> This perfum it is the mix of two ferragamos fragances, Charms (fruit fragance) and Dream (flower fragance) it is relly good and soft.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT INCANTO SHINE FROM NORDSTROM FOR ALMOST $80. I RECOMMEND BUYING IT FROM AMAZON. I BOUGHT IT LAST JANUARY AND IT IS JANUARY THIS YEAR AND IT REALLY LASTS A LONG TIME. THE SMELL IS NOT OVER WHELMING LIKE MOST PERFUMES AND IT IS A CLEAN BUT A SMALL SWEET SMELL. I RECOMMEND BUYING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE FROM AMAZON BECAUSE AMAZON HAS CHEAPEST PRICES.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend liked it a lot. Excellent fragrance, very sweet. It drives me nuts when she wears it. A must buy for the 20-35 woman.</li>
            <li> So happy to find this perfume online and less expensive for an even larger bottle than I had originally had. Package arrived in as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of this perfume for years.  Once Sephora stopped stocking it, I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is likely my favorite perfume ever. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ve ever gotten so many comments on a fragrance, and my (out of state) sister now uses it also. This will be your best choice ever. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The reviews were really nice for this perfume so i decided to give it a try, as the price was not bad.  I had to review this perfume, to add to the fantastic feedback,  it is a nice light pretty fragance, not too sweet not too strong, It&#x27;s subtle yet noticable.  Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Nice! It smells good. My girlfriend loves it! It&#x27;s a good choice for a young girl.Incanto Shine By Salvatore Ferragamo For Women, Eau De Toilette Spray, 3.4-Ounce Bottle</li>
            <li> I first smelled this perfume when I went to the Salvatore Ferragamo store on 5th Ave, and fell in love. It&#x27;s a really great fresh scent, perfect for the spring and summer. What I don&#x27;t like is the top of this bottle is made it a way that if you spray perfume 1/3 of it ends up on your hands, not ideal. It&#x27;s very wasteful. ::thumbs down to the packaging::</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume once at TJ Maxx just because the box was very pretty, but really loved this fresh and subtle smell. So when I ran out of it I decided to get a new one form Amazon. Where else can you get a large bottle of a brand perfume for just $26? I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This product, price, and timeliness exceeded my expectations! What a great surprise to find my favorite perfume at this price and delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> this one I think is fake it does not stay very long, I have bought this product b4 and everywhere I go ppl love it and it stays the whole day and night, without you have to put on anymore but this one, within an hour or two I literall have to smell myself to find if I have on a perfume, I kno it&#x27;s a woman&#x27;s perfume but I love it. When I use my Hanae Mori or john Varvatos  if I hang my shirt on the door, everytime I past by I smell it and that was the same thing with the incanto that I bought b4 this one. FAKE. I wont buy anything from u guys agai.n</li>
            <li> Love this scent! Initially received as a Christmas present a few years ago, smells AMAZING!! Sweet and sexy. The price offered on amazon was unbeatable, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. I typically pay 3x that for such a large bottle. Such a deal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34;, but very good for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of customer descriptions and reviews--and, I&#x27;m glad I did!  It&#x27;s crisp with fruity and flowery overtones, but not at all saccharine. It kind of reminds me of a girly CK One...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have an odd body chemistry and I have to be careful of any fragrances I wear (including laundry detergent); I can end up smelling like cat pee or (gasp) smelling gamy. This perfume is perfect for me! And, it lasts a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth giving it a shot!</li>
            <li> I am a perfume fanatic, and i would normally read the reviews before making a purchase, and to tell you, it is what they say. Very nice</li>
            <li> okay.... we don&#x27;t have &amp;#34;smellizon&amp;#34; (smell + amazon) yet so it&#x27;s very hard to buy a perfume based on NEVER really hearing about it or smelling it... so I click &amp;#34;add to cart&amp;#34; strictly based on reviewer&#x27;s comments from Amazon. The price was also exceptional too...  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  Love this new fragrance.  It&#x27;s light with a gentle sweetness but definitely has a presence on you. Lasts all day. It’s not flowery or spicy… and it’s NOT obnoxious either. I&#x27;ve only had a few days so no compliments yet but I love it and enjoy wearing it and that&#x27;s what counts.</li>
            <li> I was hesitating to buy this because I its online. But I ended up buying it anyways. The shipping is really fast. When I received it, I was expecting a girly scent. But when I smelled it, it smelled like a guys scent. its disappointing. But when I smelled it twice, it changes my judgement to the perfume. Its actually calming, yet awakening. For me, its not a girly flowery scent, its like a lady flowery scent, you know what I mean. (girly flowery is very sweet this is more formal) also, I tried spraying it on every corner of my room before I sleep, and guess what! I cant sleep at alL! I dont know why. but all in all this is a great perfume, but in a while you&#x27;ll get used to it, so its good to have more than one perfume &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Love this scent! It smells very fresh and isn&#x27;t overwhelming. Although, it only lasts about 4-6 hours so you may want to get an atomizer to reapply when you&#x27;re out &amp; about. I&#x27;ve worn this as my primary perfume for about 3 years now and still get tons of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> This is amazing, I love it, it is exactly what i expected. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful summer fragrance - took a chance on it ordering it online never having smelled it.  Boy, was I VERY pleasantly surprised when it came.  And the bottle is beautiful, also.  Great purchase.  Worn it every day since.</li>
            <li> While I love the brand and the scent is one of my most favorites, this bottle sucks.  This is the second time I have ordered this specific bottle and it leaks.  When you press the sprayer down you get it all over your hand and the bottle. Now everything on my dresser smells like Incanto Shine, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing, but I&#x27;d rather the money I spent went on me and not all over everywhere else.</li>
            <li> Smells like heaven.&lt;br /&gt;A co-worker had it on and my nose fell in love with it instantly.&lt;br /&gt;I just had to get it myself and am so pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> One of my favorites. The shipment was fast and well protected. I definitely would order again. I will search for other products and see what is out there.</li>
            <li> The duration of the fragrance is too short！</li>
            <li> excelent produts an service</li>
            <li> arrived quickly and i love it! perfect!</li>
            <li> I am a frequent purchaser of this particular fragrance, and the version I received this time seems off.  The perfume smells like bug spray, not the original way it normally smells when I order it.  Not sure if it&#x27;s because the vendor did something different, but I definitely will not order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon incanto shine in some store and bought it. since then the store stopped carrying it. i was very happy when i found it on amazon. i love this fragrance. i think it is definitely my favorite scent. every time i wear it, people always compliment my smell. it&#x27;s floral but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this fragrance and has used it for over a year or so . The price here at Amazon was very attractive, so I ordered her a couple bottles.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the smell! and the bottle is very nice and elegant. I bought it for my mom, my friend and am using it myself.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes. Such a clean, pretty smell. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> so light and fresh! promote delivery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for at least 3 years and I just love it! It is so fresh and nice. I receive a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> I keep buying this...I love the clean sweet smell</li>
            <li> Incanto shine  has s dazzling smell. I&#x27;ve been using this perfume  for years now and it is very affordable.  And I recommend it to everyone.  Thank you Amazon for carrying it and thank you for a good customer service.  Well done.</li>
            <li> I have received compliment after compliment after compliment when I wear this fragrance!  Everyone blurts out, \\&quot;Wow you smell great!  What perfume are you wearing?!?\\&quot;  I have gone through about 5 bottles of this perfume in 3 years.  It has become my go-to, signature scent!  On to the 6th!</li>
            <li> This is a lovely soft scent. One of my favorites. I usually buy at Nordstrom&#x27;s but it&#x27;s way cheaper here!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people on here are lying. This smells nothing ...nothing like the perfume I purchased years ago from sephora. This is fake and smells like alcohol and flowers.  I&#x27;m So disappointed.  The original smells glorious and when I seen it for only $29.00 I was  like wow!! What a deal. Do not buy this.  Snell nothing like the original</li>
            <li> A great gift, I loved walking into the kitchen and smelling it on my Aunt, she is usually very hard to buy for but she loved this.</li>
            <li> I wanted a new perfume, but I couldn&#x27;t find one in a department store that I really liked, so after reading online reviews, I ordered Incanto Shine on a whim. Based on the description and bottle, I was worried that it would be sickeningly sweet or smell too young (I&#x27;m 24), but I LOVE it. It works well with my body chemistry, and while it starts out sweet, it&#x27;s still sophisticated, and it turns warmer as the day progresses. I find it lasts a long time, and have received several compliments in the 2 days I&#x27;ve had it. I took a risk in buying a perfume without smelling it, but I&#x27;m so glad I did. Oh, and the bottle is HUGE for the price. I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> EL PERFUME LLEGO EN PERFECTO ESTADO, TENIA UNA BOTELLA ANTERIORMENTE Y LA FRAGANCIA ES LA MISMA, ES APROPIADO PARA ALGUIEN JOVEN Y QUE DESEA ALGO FRESCO, FLORAL Y MODERNO</li>
            <li> I have used this perfume for more than two years, but never bought it online. I was a little bit worried that the delivery and packaging would break it, but it turned out the bottle was still in good condition. And the scent was just the same as what I&#x27;ve bought in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Good experience to shop it online. I think I&#x27;ll continue to buy it here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this fragrance, however, when I received my shipment, the bottle was intact, but when you spray it, it leaks bad!</li>
            <li> wow,incredibly amazing,love it love it,beleive me it is one of my fave perfume now,im very picky in fragrance but this one catch my taste.</li>
            <li> Great value and I love this floral scent :)</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of Shine and let me just say that men love it. The scent is light but long lasting. Very feminine and unique. This one is. Keeper!</li>
            <li> This is a very HARD to find fragrance, it is also MY PERSONAL FAVORITE and to be able to get such a large bottle for the price blows me away!!!! Keep the great service going AMAZON thank you!!!</li>
            <li> I really liked smells and bottle of shape! Lot of people comment on my perfumes. So i might buy again next time too.</li>
            <li> wonderful scent, i saw it by a friend and once i smelled it i came home and ordered it the same night!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift to my girl and she told me that this is the best gift she has received this year.&lt;br /&gt;I think it is worthwhile in such a low price and use it as a gift for young girl.</li>
            <li> The product was received as expected, in a timely manner and well protected by packaging. Definitively, I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. Smells heavenly. It&#x27;s like what you would imagine a fairy to smell like, and the bottle is so pretty to look at. Feminine with a hint of fruity goodness but not too much... Magical and enchanting!</li>
            <li> I used this scent a few years ago and forgot how much I liked it. Happy to see it again on Amazon at such a great price. It&#x27;s a fresh, fruity, floral that is perfect for warmer weather. The decorative bottle is a nice touch, too.</li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance, I have been using it since 2007. It&#x27; s been one of my favorite ones, I always get a lot of compliments on it!</li>
            <li> sometimes is too strong.</li>
            <li> the bottle i received leaks everywhere when you try to spray it and the only scent i&#x27;m smelling is rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> very good, just the same as I have imagined</li>
            <li> Incanto Shine, I love Incanto but I think this one is not for, I just don&#x27;t know if i like it or not... good price.</li>
            <li> Everybody loves this perfume, some more price is reasonable, highly recommended. Light and nice to smell. Ferragamo perfumes are soooo nice.</li>
            <li> I adore this rare fragrance and at the current price it is a steal.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance my wife enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance!!! For the size of the bottle and the price....perfect! I want to try all the other fragrances to.</li>
            <li> Would recommend to anyone who likes soft scented, light floral perfumes. I would definitely buy it again for myself and as a gift.</li>
            <li> i bay this item to my girl and really like it</li>
            <li> I have been using Incanto Shine for the past 5 years and it has become my signature scent.  I&#x27;ve basically stopped wearing all my other scents. Chances are you will be the only person around using it because it is fairly obscure. It is light enough to use on your pulse points without being overpowering, smells very feminine, and lasts a long time.  Many people over the years have stopped me to ask what I am wearing because it smells so good. An added bonus is most men who give me a hug say \\&quot;god you smell great!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I are allergic to most perfumes, but neither of us have never had any reaction to this one. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This fragrance is by far my favorite scent. I was very excited to find such a great price for this product;  however, I am so disappointed that the spray mechanism does not work. When I sprayed the bottle the perfume leaked everywhere. The spritzer caused the perfume to leak all over my hands, and a blob of spray landed on my shirt. So much of the product it&#x27;s wasted with each spritz. If I could return this product I would instantly.  Buy this bottle of perfume from a department store.</li>
            <li> I love it. Smells great and no one can beat the price. Smells very light and sweet. But mature. Love it</li>
            <li> De las fragancias de Salvatore Ferragamo mi preferida es  Incanto Shine, me encanta, es una mezcla floral y frutal muy intensa. Me gustaría que durase un poco más. Llego en perfectas condiciones. muy recomendable.</li>
            <li> aside from it is way cheaper than any other perfumes that i like...im happy to have found it in amazon since most of the stores i went into does not carry this one. smells really great!</li>
            <li> I have to write it here.....My hubby for the first time ever asked me which perfume was I wearing...simply because he loved it....It has this great smell....which stays on and on.....</li>
            <li> my wife loves it i t s m e l l s g r e a t  l o l</li>
            <li> lovely scent. i can&#x27;t get enough of this!!</li>
            <li> The best perfume ever!!! Very light but sexy!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, and great service! Recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this because a friend of mine was wearing it and I really liked it. It&#x27;s not that expensive and it has a light sweet scent.</li>
            <li> Love this delightful summery scent. Brings a lot of compliments. Great price for it on Amazon too!</li>
            <li> I smelled this perfume on one of my customers and just had to have it!  Usually perfume smells funny on me (I guess it&#x27;s my ph)  but this one smells great.  Not only does it smell amazing but I ordered it and chose super saver shipping and received it the next day!!!!  Way to go Amazon, two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> The smell is not what I expected and it has a strong men&#x27;s kinda cologne scent mix with a light floral smell. The bottle top of the perfume broke off the first day and it and leaked everywhere. Overall its decent.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance. Also best value for the price.</li>
            <li> I have been in love with this product for over 5 years now. I think it is especially perfect for spring/summer. It&#x27;s fun and flirty scent its great for daytime AND nighttime fun!! The scent is not too intense that it will overwhelm others who are around you, however it&#x27;s not too light that the scent will go by unnoticed. Ultimately, this perfume is a great balance of making it&#x27;s presence known, but not in an overwhelming way. I also think it&#x27;s still just as amazing as it was years ago! A timeless perfume (at least to me). In my experience younger generations (teenagers-young adulthood) seem to prefer this perfume more than older individuals. I think that&#x27;s just the type of scent it is.</li>
            <li> I had never gotton so much compliments with a perfume like this. I loved it so much that im on my 3rd bottle!!! n since im a perfume/spray collector, i rarely finish even 1 bottle of perfume...n so to me, thats how great this perfume is. Btw this perfume last very long. The perfume packaging is pretty cool n cute♡ the scent itself is amazing. I would highly recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I never understood a clean fruity smell till I smelled this perfume.  It has a grapefruit spicy smell.  Can&#x27;t explain it but it smells good and it lasts all day long</li>
