            <li>Absolutely gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>So pigmented and I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This is a great product, it goes on smooth; then dries matt.</li>
            <li>This is amazing I tried it with my eos balm underneath and it doesn&#x27;t budge at all.</li>
            <li>but I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve eaten two meals, had it on for a 12 hours given my boyfriend many kisses</li>
            <li>and i plan to buy alot more of these. :)</li>
            <li>over all I love it and would recommend.</li>
            <li>I love this brand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than m.a.c</li>
            <li>i never ever leave reviews whether am satisfied or not</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Very pretty looking forward to getting more colors !</li>
            <li>You have to put on too many layers and not rub your lips together in order for it to look right.</li>
            <li>once dry it took this beautiful color ,</li>
            <li>It applies very well and sets in smooth !</li>
            <li>I even bought a different shade right after I received the first one because it was that good.</li>
            <li>first i received the product super fast, then magic happened , at first as i applied it</li>
            <li>It went on amazingly, spread evenly, and lasted a long time.</li>
            <li>Does smell kind of strange</li>
            <li>of them where very nice to apply with no issues but the two pinky shades timeless and especially bazaar where a little bit challenging.</li>
            <li>I love the color, it lasts longer if I only apply one or two coats and leave it be.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty though</li>
            <li>I recommend putting on chapstick first because it does dry out your lips, but I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>Very drying so moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s drying because it&#x27;s a very matte lip</li>
            <li>Its a very sticky matte lipstick and</li>
            <li>once product is on your lips it is a bit tacky and sticky but not so sticky that it&#x27;s a real problem.</li>
            <li>Those two colors came off a bit splotchy and you really need a bit of time to evenly apply them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a cheap dark purple lipstick for months that&#x27;s actually purple and not pink, and the black currant shade was perfect.</li>
            <li>so be sure to properly moisturize prior to applying</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented and very rich, however Black Current requires more then one coat which is why I&#x27;m only giving it 4 starts  </li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s a lot darker than expected it&#x27;s still a great shade and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>As far as the other shades they applied very evenly</li>
    </ol>

            <li> As far as the other shades they applied very evenly</li>
            <li> I put it on to see how long it last,it stayed on forever.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely long wear and once its dry there is basically no transfer, eating and drinking is not a problem.</li>
            <li> I would stay away from greasy foods as it may cause running but not loss of pigmentation because it will dry again.</li>
            <li> The product requires a few minuets to dry and smells like paint which is no big deal, you don&#x27;t smell its once its on your lips.</li>
            <li> Item arrived a lot sooner than expected, 5 days in advance.  </li>
            <li> Stays on won&#x27;t come off so be careful.  </li>
            <li> Not the color I expected</li>
            <li> , it was wet, kinda worked it to get a even color</li>
            <li> Looks like I&#x27;m wearing black lipstick not purple.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> It will remove color and in turn become very uneven.</li>
            <li> i was extreme skeptical</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very hard to spread throughout your lip</li>
            <li> these will be replacing this expensive collection i have!</li>

            <li> Looks like I&#x27;m wearing black lipstick not purple. Very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> So pigmented and I love it!</li>
            <li> Good color but not matte at all and it&#x27;s very hard to spread throughout your lip I would not recommend it</li>
            <li> Item arrived a lot sooner than expected, 5 days in advance.  I love the color, it lasts longer if I only apply one or two coats and leave it be. I applied A third and 30 minutes later and it began to Peel, but that wasn&#x27;t the case when I just applied one or two at the beginning and left my lips alone. Very drying so moisturizer. I think it&#x27;s drying because it&#x27;s a very matte lip so that&#x27;s bareable.</li>
            <li> It applies very well and sets in smooth ! Very pretty looking forward to getting more colors ! Thank you ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> Stays on won&#x27;t come off so be careful.  No complaints though. I am very happy with the color.</li>
            <li> Its a very sticky matte lipstick and I do not like it.. it&#x27;s a a beautiful color.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I absolutely love this product. I&#x27;ve been searching for a cheap dark purple lipstick for months that&#x27;s actually purple and not pink, and the black currant shade was perfect. It went on amazingly, spread evenly, and lasted a long time. I recommend putting on chapstick first because it does dry out your lips, but I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this purchase. I even bought a different shade right after I received the first one because it was that good. Does smell kind of strange but it fades away.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it goes on smooth; then dries matt. It will last all day, even through eating &amp;drinking. I put it on to see how long it last,it stayed on forever.</li>
            <li> Great color and coverage</li>
            <li> This is amazing I tried it with my eos balm underneath and it doesn&#x27;t budge at all. I&#x27;ve eaten two meals, had it on for a 12 hours given my boyfriend many kisses and i plan to buy alot more of these. :)</li>
            <li> Grate for the price. Highly pigmented and very rich, however Black Current requires more then one coat which is why I&#x27;m only giving it 4 starts  The product requires a few minuets to dry and smells like paint which is no big deal, you don&#x27;t smell its once its on your lips. once product is on your lips it is a bit tacky and sticky but not so sticky that it&#x27;s a real problem. This product is definitely long wear and once its dry there is basically no transfer, eating and drinking is not a problem. over all I love it and would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I love it!</li>
            <li> Not the color I expected</li>
            <li> I love this brand. It&#x27;s better than m.a.c</li>
            <li> Absolutely gorgeous color. One application and done. I would stay away from greasy foods as it may cause running but not loss of pigmentation because it will dry again.</li>
            <li> i never ever leave reviews whether am satisfied or not but gosh i have to!  I LOVE IT!! i am so impressed! first i received the product super fast, then magic happened , at first as i applied it i was extreme skeptical , it was wet, kinda worked it to get a even color then it just started transforming, ! once dry it took this beautiful color , now time to take it for a test run, started kissing my kids, nothing rubbed off, ate, drank, nothing intact, then i tried washing it off with soap and water! i promise nothing! kinda scared me abit, read the label Viola i used cleanser with oil based and it came off! i will be ordering all the colors!! a matter a fact am about to stack up in case they decide to discontinue! these will be replacing this expensive collection i have!</li>
            <li> I received my order on time. I love it.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s a lot darker than expected it&#x27;s still a great shade and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> to view them in person watch my lip swatches ------&amp;#62; https://youtu.be/YG7AF4t7msQ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of them where very nice to apply with no issues but the two pinky shades timeless and especially bazaar where a little bit challenging. Those two colors came off a bit splotchy and you really need a bit of time to evenly apply them. As far as the other shades they applied very evenly and i had no issues applying an even coat. When applying DO NOT press lips together at any moment before it dries !! It will remove color and in turn become very uneven. They can be a bit drying so be sure to properly moisturize prior to applying</li>
            <li> You have to put on too many layers and not rub your lips together in order for it to look right. The color is pretty though</li>
