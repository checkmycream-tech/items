            <li>This is one of those versatile fragrances good for dates,working out,work,school,Church, or just hanging with friends.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>However, I think this one is superior as a summer or daytime fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Great price, even better scent.</li>
            <li>Like the original, it has very good longevity.</li>
            <li>A nice cologne to add to the collection.</li>
            <li>Nice smell ...</li>
            <li>To me it smells better and more</li>
            <li>I think i get noticed more in warmer days.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this perfume, will buy it again.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite fragrances for daytime summer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>I had to compare it with something that you may have smiled before I would say CK one the original smell.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>Te package is very cool to, the fragrance is irresistible and sweet.</li>
            <li>The original Issey Miyake L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey was my signature scent for a number of years.  </li>
            <li>Bold scent, with sporty appeal.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I think most ladies and men will really like the scent, but you&#x27;re going to want to get your hands on a tester bottle or sample somewhere to check the longevity on your own skin.</li>
            <li>Great as an everyday or work or special occasions too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice classy scent that is modern, fresh, sporty, a bit different, and not too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>Very good perfume stands for a long time, I like it  very much, I am gonna try one million next time!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Very surprised at the clean scent.</li>
            <li>Very crisp grapefruit note and slightly spicy, light and doesn&#x27;t project too strongly at all.</li>
            <li>It smells very fresh and masculine.  </li>
            <li>Own other scents from maker and figured, why not.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li>It is a fresh and masculine smell.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to last too long, or maybe it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s not too strong.  </li>
            <li>The original is a little more flowery, hence, less masculine.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last as long as the real thing !!!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m 39 yrs old).  </li>
            <li>The downside is that after a few hours it will pretty much not be noticeable anymore.</li>
            <li>I was really quite pleased with the scent from this fragrance, especially since it was a blind buy.</li>
            <li>I was also able to verify the matching serial number from my bottle and box as legitimate, so the longevity being poor is NOT a result of my receiving a counterfeit.</li>
            <li>I own quite a few other frags which I can still smell far after the dry down much later into the day; YSL L&#x27;homme and Polo Blue being two that stand out in that department.</li>

            <li> Smells good at the beginning but too quickly the fragrance fades and smells stale.  Maybe that is just a characteristic of Eau de Toilette vs cologne?</li>
            <li> I was really quite pleased with the scent from this fragrance, especially since it was a blind buy. Very crisp grapefruit note and slightly spicy, light and doesn&#x27;t project too strongly at all. The downside is that after a few hours it will pretty much not be noticeable anymore. Yes I know what olfactory fatigue is, but trust me it&#x27;s got nothing to do with that. I own quite a few other frags which I can still smell far after the dry down much later into the day; YSL L&#x27;homme and Polo Blue being two that stand out in that department. I was also able to verify the matching serial number from my bottle and box as legitimate, so the longevity being poor is NOT a result of my receiving a counterfeit. Overall, I think most ladies and men will really like the scent, but you&#x27;re going to want to get your hands on a tester bottle or sample somewhere to check the longevity on your own skin.</li>
            <li> Got this as a bday present from my parents. (I&#x27;m 39 yrs old).  It&#x27;s a nice classy scent that is modern, fresh, sporty, a bit different, and not too overwhelming.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to last too long, or maybe it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s not too strong.  A nice cologne to add to the collection.</li>
            <li> I usually get the L&#x27;Eau D&#x27;lssey but I decided to try something new. Im always please with the smell and this is the only cologne I would get.</li>
            <li> This is one of those versatile fragrances good for dates,working out,work,school,Church, or just hanging with friends.&lt;br /&gt;Last all day on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;If I had to compare it with something that you may have smiled before I would say CK one the original smell.&lt;br /&gt;but To me it smells better and more classy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have the shower gel so when wearing both is a double threat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works well in all climate but in my opion I think i get noticed more in warmer days.Body heat make sit projects well.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as long as the real thing !!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, quality product.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume, will buy it again. Te package is very cool to, the fragrance is irresistible and sweet.</li>
            <li> Ii was open when i get it</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells great on me. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Great cologne for any occasion.  Bold scent, with sporty appeal.  Not overpowering.  I have been asked several times in the elevator at work, what cologne I am wearing?  They want to get it for someone as a gift.</li>
            <li> Very good perfume stands for a long time, I like it  very much, I am gonna try one million next time!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice smelling cologne! Can be worn for any occasion. Great for the summer! I receive compliments all the time! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. He loves it. He has been wearing it everyday! It smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Product in perfect condition and this rating is for the high quality product, perfect condition, good condition, the product is 100% recommended by me, and recommend it to all ................</li>
            <li> One of my favorite fragrances for daytime summer. It is a fresh and masculine smell. Good for everyday use. It lasts long throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The original Issey Miyake L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey was my signature scent for a number of years.  I still periodically use it.  However, I think this one is superior as a summer or daytime fragrance.  It smells very fresh and masculine.  The original is a little more flowery, hence, less masculine.  Like the original, it has very good longevity.</li>
            <li> Excelente perfume .....</li>
            <li> Nice smell ...&lt;br /&gt;Last long on you ...</li>
            <li> Took a chance on this scent. Own other scents from maker and figured, why not. I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase. Very surprised at the clean scent. Great as an everyday or work or special occasions too.</li>
            <li> Great price, even better scent.</li>
