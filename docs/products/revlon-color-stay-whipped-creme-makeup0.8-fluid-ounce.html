            <li>Buff 150 in this brand works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I always carry cotton balls in my purse to blot the sweat off and my foundation stays perfect.</li>
            <li>This foundation gives me a perfect, near-full coverage finish.</li>
            <li>using your fingers is just not the best idea if you want to avoid breakouts.</li>
            <li>shade is perfect</li>
            <li>over 50 and a heavier foundation coverage gives me a flawless makeup finish, which I accomplish with this product every time I use it.</li>
            <li>this foundation is very good for me.</li>
            <li>As well, I have very fair skin and can wear the Ivory or the buff.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and it covers great, creamy and sets flawlessly.</li>
            <li>My search for the ideal foundation is over.</li>
            <li>Good coverage!</li>
            <li>It hides redness, and discoloration beautifully too, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I sometimes use a primer or moisturizer but not always and still get a beautiful finish.</li>
            <li>Loved how it gave me a flawless complexion!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The coverage is great.</li>
            <li>- Great price - Coverage is medium/full, but not cakey.</li>
            <li>Great foundation.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>I even used a good moisturizer and primer before applying.</li>
            <li>None of those gave me a dewy look or good coverage.  </li>
            <li>It blends into the skin flawlessly, and it&#x27;s as smooth as butter.</li>
            <li>good quality and the price is correct</li>
            <li>and this does a good job of covering.</li>
            <li>Good coverage,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>This foundation not only matches my skin perfectly but, the formula is incredible as well.</li>
            <li>Love this color!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This never breaks me out, has a smooth matte finish with great coverage.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>I get the normal/dry skin kind.</li>
            <li>, I think it looks nice on my vanity.</li>
            <li>not quite perfect, but highly recommended.</li>
            <li>nothing is perfect haha favorite drugstore foundation ever...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also VERY easy to blend.</li>
            <li>Best foundation I&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels great, has a wonderful texture and finish-- it does not accentuate my fine lines, but it doesn&#x27;t provide lasting coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love Revlon, and really liked Revlon Colorstay</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>Great, Great Coverage especially for a drugstore foundation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found that it applies best right after wiping the face down with witch hazel, since it seems to apply best on softened skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li>Nothing to say except that the foundation arrived in perfect condition, quickly and it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I love this foundation.</li>
            <li>Perfect with proper applicator sponge and spreads evenly and stays on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a creamy liquid, but not runny or &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; (as you would imagine hearing whipped.)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>not make my skin any more oily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only one I can think of is that I had to get to shades and mix them to get my perfect color.  </li>
            <li>I love revlon colorstay in all forms.</li>
            <li>so went to Walmart to buy some more makeup .</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice, the formula is fantastic, and the</li>
            <li>I purchased this in Buff after using the liquid Colorstay in Buff for many years.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>The longer you wear it the better</li>
            <li>so it appear like there&#x27;s more product</li>
            <li>I love this foundation and would not even consider using another.</li>
            <li>I love the texture of this foundation.</li>
            <li>but for someone who needs a heavier coverage could like it better</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Revlon foundation.</li>
            <li>Love, love and I hope they never stop making this.</li>
            <li>On top of it all, this stuff stays on and stays rather matte even after I go to the gym.</li>
            <li>It looks better the longer</li>
            <li>the better</li>
            <li>It feels very light and comfortable on my face; I like it much better than the liquid foundation, which can feel a bit greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair skinned with a strong yellow undertone, and Revlon is the ONLY drugstore brand that makes foundations the match my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new foundation that would give my face a dewy look and great coverag.  </li>
            <li>I really love the texture of this and how easily it blends out.</li>
            <li>Great for Sensitive Skin!  </li>
            <li>This particular shade I ordered was too light, but the constancy is great.  </li>
            <li>Very true to it&#x27;s name, it will stay on-</li>
            <li>Love this product makes skin look supple, smooth and even</li>
            <li>It goes on light, but you can make it thicker for more coverage.  </li>
            <li>Applying with a brush, sponge, or fingers produces great results for a natural finish, medium coverage that is buildable.</li>
            <li>I love the coverage it provides and feels light on the skin.  </li>
            <li>But while Loreal True Match removes color from my face and looks chalky, this color has a bit more &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; to it and has a dewy, healthy finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good coverage and very lightweight.</li>
            <li>but I think the original Colorstay is still better.</li>
            <li>but, build able if you want medium to full coverage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to forget you have it on, because it&#x27;s so light and breathable on your face.</li>
            <li>and I have not found that this settles in fine lines at all.</li>
            <li>This formula can also be drying for the face, but doesn&#x27;t move and feels light on the face.</li>
            <li>I use a sponge to apply it and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>fantastic by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>This product arrived early and in good condition.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t oxidize on me and dries to a gorgeous, soft semi matte finish.</li>
            <li>I love Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay liquid foundation makeup, and have been wanting to try a whipped foundation since the product hit the drugstores, so when this came out I was ecatatic and purchased it right away.</li>
            <li>It is my new favorite foundation!</li>
            <li>being said, it is not like it&#x27;s &amp;#34;non-whipped&amp;#34; counterpart, the original Revlon Colorstay.</li>
            <li>I read tons of reviews before buying this and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>Stays looking fresh!  </li>
            <li>If you are fair skinned the only colors available are ivory and buff.</li>
            <li>I have luxury/pricy foundation products for special occasions</li>
            <li>I would also say my skin is kind of sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have a plastic bin full of foundations, but this is the one I grab every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;</li>
            <li>Overall a good product,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a full coverage product.</li>
            <li>This foundation is a dream come true.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty pale but with a lot of redness on my cheeks and the color Buff covers my face flawlessly.</li>
            <li>This is not only a better colormatch it lasts longer and is giving me better coverage than the liquid.  </li>
            <li>(I rub a blob on the top of my hand, then dab flat top brush and</li>
            <li>I think if you have normal to oily skin, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>Best long lasting foundation for this price.</li>
            <li>First off, this foundation lasts me forever!</li>
            <li>it lasts all day, it&#x27;s a great neutral colour, and it doesn&#x27;t highlight dry patches that much.</li>
            <li>The product list is not overly perfect, but not as bad as most (no parabens)!</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m not crazy about the packaging.</li>
            <li>Not that anyone cares, but I always find this information useful.</li>
            <li>This foundation truly stays fresh all day, no touch-ups needed.</li>
            <li>Seriously, I&#x27;ll accidently leave it on for a couple DAYS and it won&#x27;t irritate my (very fair) skin.</li>
            <li>Depending on where you purchase it, the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>With this, not only are you able to use ALL of the product you paid for, but the lid keeps it from drying out as well.</li>
            <li>Actually, provides a mostly matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;Looks</li>
            <li>Not only lasts all day, looks better as time goes by.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>This product gave me exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>A tub of foundation is really unsanitary and just asking for bacteria growth!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I love the packaging, the lasting power, and the mattifying effect this foundation provides.</li>
            <li>Overall I enjoyed using this foundation.</li>
            <li>I still stand by those products, and I so wanted to love this one, especially after reading the glowing reviews on almost every makeup review site out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>have never hoped more that a produce never be discontinued, though I know it&#x27;s inevitable with the drug store brands.</li>
            <li>so I was dying to try this when I first heard about it.</li>
            <li>At first I didnt know if I like this makeup</li>
            <li>After a few mins of letting it settle, I put a powder overit and iI&#x27;m good all day.</li>
            <li>I love using this foundation, I actually look forward to putting my face on and really hope they interchange the formula.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and still looks good throughout day, I personally think it looks better once it has been on for a while and settled.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not real strong but has a nice scent like all revlon products.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews on this.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it feels silky going on.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased and it is definitely one of the top drugstore foundations available.</li>
            <li>The coverage is medium to full and the finish is natural.</li>
            <li>I have some large pores and it fills and smoothes them out.</li>
            <li>The other foundations that I tried, but were not dewy, were: Loreal Visible Lift, Revlon ColorStay in a 1 oz bottle, Loreal True Match, and Maybelline Dream Smooth Mousse.  </li>
            <li>I have a hard time finding good foundation that doesn&#x27;t cost over $30.  </li>
            <li>Many of the shades do have a light pink undertone instead of yellow.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much it will come out looking Cakey.</li>
            <li>then there really is.</li>
            <li>I would much prefer a pump style bottle, but maybe the consistency of the product won&#x27;t work with that.</li>
            <li>And it really does stay on my skin.</li>
            <li>foundation also goes really well over sunscreen.</li>
            <li>but I actually really like it</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace more expensive designer foundations like Korres, and have found it to be an effective replacement.  </li>
            <li>It glides over the skin and melts right in, looking natural yet covering so well.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have (and the reason for the 4-star rating instead of 5) is that the packaging, while beautiful and elegant, is not very hygienic as you have to keep dipping your sponge (or brush or fingers,</li>
            <li>However, this is minor and not annoyingly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always set it with a setting powder and have had no problems with it lasting through a full 8 hour work day.</li>
            <li>Laura Mercier Silk Creme still does the job of lasting full coverage even if I have to accept the wrinkles that comes along with it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get five stars because Revlon really needs to do better in the formula for African American women.</li>
            <li>Going to switch when I run out it lasted all day thru 90 degrees and sweating in high humidity for the price</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy this product as it is comparable to high end make up line.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The packaging is far better than other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Especially when I use a flat top brush.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the most long lasting foundation I&#x27;ve tried).</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin looking matte all day, which I love because I have oily skin and no other product by any other drugstore brand has done this for me.</li>
            <li>buy this in ivory and besides Loreal True Match in porcelain, it is the only drugstore foundation I have ever found that is light enough for my super pale skin.</li>
            <li>need a full coverage foundation, due to acne scars, and I still suffer from adult acne, but now in my late 30&#x27;s also have the pleasure of entering the age of crows feet and forehead wrinkles, which my beloved Laura Mercier silk creme seemed to accentuate.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>was so excited to maybe find a fairly inexpensive product and go back to my Revlon roots, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t endorse this.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>I have true combination skin with an oily t-zone and dry patches on my cheeks, and this works well on all areas of my face.</li>
            <li>When I tried the Buff on my hand, it looked a little more neutral than the Medium and Natural Beige.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to makeup</li>
            <li>It highlights every dry spot and makes them look super crusty.</li>
            <li>Has worked well so far but still looking for a foundation that wear all day in high humidity with my oily skin</li>
            <li>I recommend you use a clean makeup spatula or some other way to get the product out--</li>
            <li>Cons:  - Per the superior coverage, it does feel a little heavy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like dipping my fingers repeatedly into a product, as it is less clean than a pump-style.</li>
            <li>The only qualm I have about this foundation is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much coverage as the Colorstay liquid foundation; I have some acne spots that aren&#x27;t covered as well.</li>
            <li>I used to be a Revlon Colorstay girl as a teenager and into my early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>And it really fills in pores (especially if you apply it in an upward stroke).</li>
            <li>which is a benefit for my busy schedule.</li>
            <li>Super long wearing, it is the only one I&#x27;ve ever tried where I didn&#x27;t have to touch up or apply powder throughout the day to keep it matte.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s super long lasting (and i sweat a</li>
            <li>Nice glass packaging but not ideal for travel.</li>
            <li>I went to a big barrel race, and forgot all my makeup I just started using Mac sweatproof for the main reason so it could last thru the heat ,humidity and riding horses.</li>
            <li>And the color is not dead on to my skin color but a close enough match to not give that ghostly look.</li>
            <li>Free shipping was unbelievably slow from Amazon tho.</li>
            <li>I have extremely oily skin, and this last pretty well on me(granted</li>
            <li>Good full coverage foundation, very thick texture so not great on dry skin unless you moisturise before.</li>
            <li>If you have normal to dry skin, get the Color stay with Softflex and use a sponge/beauty blender to apply it!</li>
            <li>Only downfall was that it takes a little bit to full dry.</li>
            <li>but I know others might: it does have a scent that is not particularly nice, but luckily it does not linger.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many foundations in the past few years, because I never wore foundations prior to this.</li>

            <li> , I think it looks nice on my vanity.</li>
            <li> not quite perfect, but highly recommended.</li>
            <li> nothing is perfect haha favorite drugstore foundation ever...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also VERY easy to blend.</li>
            <li> Best foundation I&#x27;ve tried so far!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels great, has a wonderful texture and finish-- it does not accentuate my fine lines, but it doesn&#x27;t provide lasting coverage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love Revlon, and really liked Revlon Colorstay</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Great, Great Coverage especially for a drugstore foundation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found that it applies best right after wiping the face down with witch hazel, since it seems to apply best on softened skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light</li>
            <li> Nothing to say except that the foundation arrived in perfect condition, quickly and it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I love this foundation.</li>
            <li> Perfect with proper applicator sponge and spreads evenly and stays on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a creamy liquid, but not runny or &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; (as you would imagine hearing whipped.)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> not make my skin any more oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only one I can think of is that I had to get to shades and mix them to get my perfect color.  </li>
            <li> I love revlon colorstay in all forms.</li>
            <li> so went to Walmart to buy some more makeup .</li>
            <li> The packaging is nice, the formula is fantastic, and the</li>
            <li> I purchased this in Buff after using the liquid Colorstay in Buff for many years.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> The longer you wear it the better</li>
            <li> so it appear like there&#x27;s more product</li>
            <li> I love this foundation and would not even consider using another.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this foundation.</li>
            <li> but for someone who needs a heavier coverage could like it better</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Revlon foundation.</li>
            <li> Love, love and I hope they never stop making this.</li>
            <li> On top of it all, this stuff stays on and stays rather matte even after I go to the gym.</li>
            <li> It looks better the longer</li>
            <li> the better</li>
            <li> It feels very light and comfortable on my face; I like it much better than the liquid foundation, which can feel a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair skinned with a strong yellow undertone, and Revlon is the ONLY drugstore brand that makes foundations the match my skin perfectly.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new foundation that would give my face a dewy look and great coverag.  </li>
            <li> I really love the texture of this and how easily it blends out.</li>
            <li> Great for Sensitive Skin!  </li>
            <li> This particular shade I ordered was too light, but the constancy is great.  </li>
            <li> Very true to it&#x27;s name, it will stay on-</li>
            <li> Love this product makes skin look supple, smooth and even</li>
            <li> It goes on light, but you can make it thicker for more coverage.  </li>
            <li> Applying with a brush, sponge, or fingers produces great results for a natural finish, medium coverage that is buildable.</li>
            <li> I love the coverage it provides and feels light on the skin.  </li>
            <li> But while Loreal True Match removes color from my face and looks chalky, this color has a bit more &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; to it and has a dewy, healthy finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good coverage and very lightweight.</li>
            <li> but I think the original Colorstay is still better.</li>
            <li> but, build able if you want medium to full coverage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to forget you have it on, because it&#x27;s so light and breathable on your face.</li>
            <li> and I have not found that this settles in fine lines at all.</li>
            <li> This formula can also be drying for the face, but doesn&#x27;t move and feels light on the face.</li>
            <li> I use a sponge to apply it and it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> fantastic by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> This product arrived early and in good condition.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t oxidize on me and dries to a gorgeous, soft semi matte finish.</li>
            <li> I love Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay liquid foundation makeup, and have been wanting to try a whipped foundation since the product hit the drugstores, so when this came out I was ecatatic and purchased it right away.</li>
            <li> It is my new favorite foundation!</li>
            <li> being said, it is not like it&#x27;s &amp;#34;non-whipped&amp;#34; counterpart, the original Revlon Colorstay.</li>
            <li> I read tons of reviews before buying this and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li> Stays looking fresh!  </li>
            <li> If you are fair skinned the only colors available are ivory and buff.</li>
            <li> I have luxury/pricy foundation products for special occasions</li>
            <li> I would also say my skin is kind of sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have a plastic bin full of foundations, but this is the one I grab every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;</li>
            <li> Overall a good product,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a full coverage product.</li>
            <li> This foundation is a dream come true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty pale but with a lot of redness on my cheeks and the color Buff covers my face flawlessly.</li>
            <li> This is not only a better colormatch it lasts longer and is giving me better coverage than the liquid.  </li>
            <li> (I rub a blob on the top of my hand, then dab flat top brush and</li>
            <li> I think if you have normal to oily skin, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> Best long lasting foundation for this price.</li>
            <li> First off, this foundation lasts me forever!</li>
            <li> it lasts all day, it&#x27;s a great neutral colour, and it doesn&#x27;t highlight dry patches that much.</li>
            <li> The product list is not overly perfect, but not as bad as most (no parabens)!</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m not crazy about the packaging.</li>
            <li> Not that anyone cares, but I always find this information useful.</li>
            <li> This foundation truly stays fresh all day, no touch-ups needed.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ll accidently leave it on for a couple DAYS and it won&#x27;t irritate my (very fair) skin.</li>
            <li> Depending on where you purchase it, the price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> With this, not only are you able to use ALL of the product you paid for, but the lid keeps it from drying out as well.</li>
            <li> Actually, provides a mostly matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;Looks</li>
            <li> Not only lasts all day, looks better as time goes by.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> This product gave me exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> A tub of foundation is really unsanitary and just asking for bacteria growth!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I love the packaging, the lasting power, and the mattifying effect this foundation provides.</li>
            <li> Overall I enjoyed using this foundation.</li>
            <li> I still stand by those products, and I so wanted to love this one, especially after reading the glowing reviews on almost every makeup review site out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> have never hoped more that a produce never be discontinued, though I know it&#x27;s inevitable with the drug store brands.</li>
            <li> so I was dying to try this when I first heard about it.</li>
            <li> At first I didnt know if I like this makeup</li>
            <li> After a few mins of letting it settle, I put a powder overit and iI&#x27;m good all day.</li>
            <li> I love using this foundation, I actually look forward to putting my face on and really hope they interchange the formula.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and still looks good throughout day, I personally think it looks better once it has been on for a while and settled.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real strong but has a nice scent like all revlon products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews on this.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it feels silky going on.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased and it is definitely one of the top drugstore foundations available.</li>
            <li> The coverage is medium to full and the finish is natural.</li>
            <li> I have some large pores and it fills and smoothes them out.</li>
            <li> The other foundations that I tried, but were not dewy, were: Loreal Visible Lift, Revlon ColorStay in a 1 oz bottle, Loreal True Match, and Maybelline Dream Smooth Mousse.  </li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding good foundation that doesn&#x27;t cost over $30.  </li>
            <li> Many of the shades do have a light pink undertone instead of yellow.  </li>
            <li> If you use too much it will come out looking Cakey.</li>
            <li> then there really is.</li>
            <li> I would much prefer a pump style bottle, but maybe the consistency of the product won&#x27;t work with that.</li>
            <li> And it really does stay on my skin.</li>
            <li> foundation also goes really well over sunscreen.</li>
            <li> but I actually really like it</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace more expensive designer foundations like Korres, and have found it to be an effective replacement.  </li>
            <li> It glides over the skin and melts right in, looking natural yet covering so well.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have (and the reason for the 4-star rating instead of 5) is that the packaging, while beautiful and elegant, is not very hygienic as you have to keep dipping your sponge (or brush or fingers,</li>
            <li> However, this is minor and not annoyingly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always set it with a setting powder and have had no problems with it lasting through a full 8 hour work day.</li>
            <li> Laura Mercier Silk Creme still does the job of lasting full coverage even if I have to accept the wrinkles that comes along with it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get five stars because Revlon really needs to do better in the formula for African American women.</li>
            <li> Going to switch when I run out it lasted all day thru 90 degrees and sweating in high humidity for the price</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product as it is comparable to high end make up line.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The packaging is far better than other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Especially when I use a flat top brush.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the most long lasting foundation I&#x27;ve tried).</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin looking matte all day, which I love because I have oily skin and no other product by any other drugstore brand has done this for me.</li>
            <li> buy this in ivory and besides Loreal True Match in porcelain, it is the only drugstore foundation I have ever found that is light enough for my super pale skin.</li>
            <li> need a full coverage foundation, due to acne scars, and I still suffer from adult acne, but now in my late 30&#x27;s also have the pleasure of entering the age of crows feet and forehead wrinkles, which my beloved Laura Mercier silk creme seemed to accentuate.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> was so excited to maybe find a fairly inexpensive product and go back to my Revlon roots, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t endorse this.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I have true combination skin with an oily t-zone and dry patches on my cheeks, and this works well on all areas of my face.</li>
            <li> When I tried the Buff on my hand, it looked a little more neutral than the Medium and Natural Beige.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to makeup</li>
            <li> It highlights every dry spot and makes them look super crusty.</li>
            <li> Has worked well so far but still looking for a foundation that wear all day in high humidity with my oily skin</li>
            <li> I recommend you use a clean makeup spatula or some other way to get the product out--</li>
            <li> Cons:  - Per the superior coverage, it does feel a little heavy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like dipping my fingers repeatedly into a product, as it is less clean than a pump-style.</li>
            <li> The only qualm I have about this foundation is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much coverage as the Colorstay liquid foundation; I have some acne spots that aren&#x27;t covered as well.</li>
            <li> I used to be a Revlon Colorstay girl as a teenager and into my early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> And it really fills in pores (especially if you apply it in an upward stroke).</li>
            <li> which is a benefit for my busy schedule.</li>
            <li> Super long wearing, it is the only one I&#x27;ve ever tried where I didn&#x27;t have to touch up or apply powder throughout the day to keep it matte.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s super long lasting (and i sweat a</li>
            <li> Nice glass packaging but not ideal for travel.</li>
            <li> I went to a big barrel race, and forgot all my makeup I just started using Mac sweatproof for the main reason so it could last thru the heat ,humidity and riding horses.</li>
            <li> And the color is not dead on to my skin color but a close enough match to not give that ghostly look.</li>
            <li> Free shipping was unbelievably slow from Amazon tho.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin, and this last pretty well on me(granted</li>
            <li> Good full coverage foundation, very thick texture so not great on dry skin unless you moisturise before.</li>
            <li> If you have normal to dry skin, get the Color stay with Softflex and use a sponge/beauty blender to apply it!</li>
            <li> Only downfall was that it takes a little bit to full dry.</li>
            <li> but I know others might: it does have a scent that is not particularly nice, but luckily it does not linger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many foundations in the past few years, because I never wore foundations prior to this.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that it takes even longer to dry or soak into my skin before I can put my powder and blush on.  </li>
            <li> A little messy when first opened, but the jar lets you use every last bit.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and blends well, and a little goes a long way; I feel like this product will last several months, at least half a year if not longer.</li>
            <li> It lasts ALL DAY LONG.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my uhum, somewhat mature skin though.  </li>
            <li> but I have yellow undertones and ivory is too pink.</li>
            <li> only is it not full coverage, it&#x27;s definitely not lasting coverage; even with a primer, I can still see every mark I was trying to cover by the end of the night, plus I think it&#x27;s made me break</li>
            <li> I have an oily t-zone, with dry patches on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> but if your skin is dry at all it looks cakey.  </li>
            <li> I use this and if my skin is too dry (do to proactive)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but still quite regularly - And one jar lasted me almost an entire year!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it over a primer and thin layer of powder (Google &amp;#34;Wayne Goss method&amp;#34; if you have questions about this) and it gives me a look that is neither too dewy or completely matte--very natural.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day and actually comes in a shade pale enough to match my skin tone!</li>
            <li> the only thing I dislike is the fact that it has little range of colors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am an over 50 year old women with dull looking skin.  </li>
            <li> I have pale skin, but did not buy the lightest color they had, because it had pink undertones, and mine is yellow, so I bought the foundation below.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for drier skin types unless you slather on the moisturizer, because this may slightly accentuate dry spots.</li>
            <li> Be careful because a little bit of this stuff goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Every other foundation has literally disappeared from my face after a couple hrs</li>
            <li> previously bought the 250 medium beige shade but that was too dark for me.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> This whipped formula is slightly darker than that.</li>
            <li> I have dry/combo skin, need medium coverage, and am slightly acne prone.</li>
            <li> I always add a little powder foundation over it to set it.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that this is a little darker for me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t mix with the sunscreen because it is so glide-y and requires so little pressure to apply.</li>
            <li> but it could be a little drying on me</li>
            <li> I tried it a few times, once with primer, once without, and once after some hardcore exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I also have some sun spots and a few blemish scars.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m applying it too heavy?  </li>
            <li> but this one is my choice in the everyday wear.</li>
            <li> (Note: By matte, I don&#x27;t mean it in the usual sense of that it my skin look dry, but instead it keeps my face dewy while preventing oiliness.</li>
            <li> However, I am still playing around with getting the shade correct for my somewhat pale winter skin.  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with the Revlon Colorstay liquid foundation (ONLY the one with Softflex)</li>
            <li> so it was weird for me to see such a neutral color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure about the staying power, because when I blow my nose, I can see some foundation on my tissue as well.</li>
            <li> Not very good coverage and a bit too oily...</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not really suitable for acne prone</li>
            <li> and I sweat badly at my hairline, under my eyes, above my lip, and my chin.</li>
            <li> The jar is very thick</li>
            <li> Coverage was poor.</li>
            <li> (Goodbye squeeze bottles or long glass containers that make it IMPOSSIBLE to use all the product!)</li>
            <li> I tried the regular 24 hour formula without the softflex and it was terrible too.</li>
            <li> Difficult to get on before it dries out.</li>
            <li> the lid is uncomfortable to use</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have worn Revlon Color Stay Liquid foundation for YEARS. I am shade buff 150. This whipped formula is slightly darker than that. This formula can also be drying for the face, but doesn&#x27;t move and feels light on the face. The coverage is great. I think I&#x27;ll be going back to the liquid formula for normal/dry skin though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for years and am obviously very happy with it! I bought this to replace more expensive designer foundations like Korres, and have found it to be an effective replacement.  Pros:  - Great price - Coverage is medium/full, but not cakey. - Spreadability is excellent.  Cons:  - Per the superior coverage, it does feel a little heavy. - I&#x27;m not crazy about the packaging. I don&#x27;t like dipping my fingers repeatedly into a product, as it is less clean than a pump-style.</li>
            <li> I love this foundation. Super long wearing, it is the only one I&#x27;ve ever tried where I didn&#x27;t have to touch up or apply powder throughout the day to keep it matte.  I have true combination skin with an oily t-zone and dry patches on my cheeks, and this works well on all areas of my face. I use a sponge to apply it and it goes on smoothly. The only complaint I have (and the reason for the 4-star rating instead of 5) is that the packaging, while beautiful and elegant, is not very hygienic as you have to keep dipping your sponge (or brush or fingers, whatever you use) into the jar, exposing all the makeup within to the bacteria on your applicator.</li>
            <li> this foundation is very good for me. it lasts all day, it&#x27;s a great neutral colour, and it doesn&#x27;t highlight dry patches that much. not quite perfect, but highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this color!  Perfect with proper applicator sponge and spreads evenly and stays on.</li>
            <li> First off, this foundation lasts me forever! A little goes a long way. The packaging is far better than other products I&#x27;ve used. (Goodbye squeeze bottles or long glass containers that make it IMPOSSIBLE to use all the product!) With this, not only are you able to use ALL of the product you paid for, but the lid keeps it from drying out as well. I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but still quite regularly - And one jar lasted me almost an entire year!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me back to the foundation itself. The name is a bit deceiving, I wouldn&#x27;t consider it &amp;#34;whipped.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s more like a creamy liquid, but not runny or &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; (as you would imagine hearing whipped.) It blends/applies well and NEVER makes me break out. Seriously, I&#x27;ll accidently leave it on for a couple DAYS and it won&#x27;t irritate my (very fair) skin. It&#x27;s easy to forget you have it on, because it&#x27;s so light and breathable on your face. (And did I mention your face won&#x27;t &amp;#34;melt&amp;#34; in the summertime heat.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it is not like it&#x27;s &amp;#34;non-whipped&amp;#34; counterpart, the original Revlon Colorstay. In that, it&#x27;s not a high-coverage foundation. If you have breakouts/scars you want covered, I&#x27;d recommend a concealer underneath this. But I don&#x27;t mind this, even though I have breakout-prone skin. I&#x27;d rather have some flaws visible than feel like I&#x27;m wearing a mask of makeup! Besides, my skin clears up faster while using this foundation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews on this.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it feels silky going on. That&#x27;s the only pro.&lt;br /&gt;Literally, within minutes of putting this stuff on, it had started flaking and caking. I tried it a few times, once with primer, once without, and once after some hardcore exfoliation. Same result every time.</li>
            <li> I read tons of reviews before buying this and was excited to try it. All I can say is yuuuuck. It makes you look like you have wrinkles in places that you don&#x27;t even have wrinkles. It highlights every dry spot and makes them look super crusty. I even used a good moisturizer and primer before applying. Coverage was poor. I am obsessed with the Revlon Colorstay liquid foundation (ONLY the one with Softflex) I get the normal/dry skin kind. I tried the regular 24 hour formula without the softflex and it was terrible too. Colors had completely different undertones too even though they were the same shade. If you have normal to dry skin, get the Color stay with Softflex and use a sponge/beauty blender to apply it! I think the softflex is discontinued so I buy it eBay now. Never gonna quit using it until I have to! Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to makeup so it was weird for me to see such a neutral color. Only downfall was that it takes a little bit to full dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last as advertised. Difficult to get on before it dries out. Showed every wrinkle.</li>
            <li> Best long lasting foundation for this price. Free shipping was unbelievably slow from Amazon tho.</li>
            <li> Love this product makes skin look supple, smooth and even</li>
            <li> I bought this at wallmart..&lt;br /&gt;But let me tell you.. this is gold in a jar&lt;br /&gt;Best aplication is with fingers&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super long lasting (and i sweat a lot)&lt;br /&gt;It gives such a porcelane finish... no parabens&lt;br /&gt;What else could i ask for? Oh the packaging&lt;br /&gt;But nothing is perfect haha favorite drugstore foundation ever...&lt;br /&gt;Revlon colorstay leave a cakey finish this is just perfect... 2 thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I have dry/combo skin, need medium coverage, and am slightly acne prone. This never breaks me out, has a smooth matte finish with great coverage. Lasts all day and actually comes in a shade pale enough to match my skin tone! Plus, the price is great! One jar lasts me about 2 months with daily use, and I am using with a brush for medium coverage.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  This particular shade I ordered was too light, but the constancy is great.  Covers and lasts throughout the day!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have an oily t-zone, with dry patches on my cheeks. I would also say my skin is kind of sensitive. I also have some sun spots and a few blemish scars. Not that anyone cares, but I always find this information useful. I have a plastic bin full of foundations, but this is the one I grab every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Awesome coverage. Especially when I use a flat top brush. (I rub a blob on the top of my hand, then dab flat top brush and apply.)&lt;br /&gt;No caking.&lt;br /&gt;Does not make my skin any more oily. Actually, provides a mostly matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;Looks fantastic by the end of the day. Not only lasts all day, looks better as time goes by.&lt;br /&gt;Does not appear or feel heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;The only one I can think of is that I had to get to shades and mix them to get my perfect color.  Not necessarily the foundation&#x27;s fault, but the only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; I can come up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will repurchase again and again.</li>
            <li> I am an over 50 year old women with dull looking skin.  I was looking for a new foundation that would give my face a dewy look and great coverag.  Not drying.  This foundation is it!  It goes on light, but you can make it thicker for more coverage.  I always moisturise my face after washing it with Oil of Olay Serum.  Then I apply my foundation.  I always add a little powder foundation over it to set it.  It does not look cakey on my skin.  It looks dewy.  It lasts ALL DAY LONG.  Stays looking fresh!  The other foundations that I tried, but were not dewy, were: Loreal Visible Lift, Revlon ColorStay in a 1 oz bottle, Loreal True Match, and Maybelline Dream Smooth Mousse.  None of those gave me a dewy look or good coverage.  This product gave me exactly what I was looking for. However, I am still playing around with getting the shade correct for my somewhat pale winter skin.  Many of the shades do have a light pink undertone instead of yellow.  When I tried the Buff on my hand, it looked a little more neutral than the Medium and Natural Beige.  I will try on my face tomorrow. I may just have to change the color of the powder that I use to set it.  I will not give up on the Revlon Whipped Creme Makeup though.  That&#x27;s a keeper!!</li>
            <li> This is my go to foundation. I love revlon colorstay in all forms. Liquid/whipped whatever. Its my and always will be my go to foundation.</li>
            <li> I went to a big barrel race, and forgot all my makeup I just started using Mac sweatproof for the main reason so it could last thru the heat ,humidity and riding horses. Couldn&#x27;t go home to get it so went to Walmart to buy some more makeup . I looked up best rated drugstore makeup and this popped  up , let me tell you I loved it!!!! Going to switch when I run out it lasted all day thru 90 degrees and sweating in high humidity for the price it&#x27;s awesome</li>
            <li> I have the hardest time finding a drugstore foundation that matches my skin color, and my skins undertone. I&#x27;m very fair skinned with a strong yellow undertone, and Revlon is the ONLY drugstore brand that makes foundations the match my skin perfectly. This foundation not only matches my skin perfectly but, the formula is incredible as well. It blends into the skin flawlessly, and it&#x27;s as smooth as butter. It&#x27;s very light but, build able if you want medium to full coverage. It hides redness, and discoloration beautifully too, and it lasts all day. I will say I would not recommend using a sponge to apply this foundation though. I like to use my fingers around my nose, and under my eyes and then I use a rounded blender brush to apply it to the rest of my face. Be careful because a little bit of this stuff goes a very long way. If you use too much it will come out looking Cakey. Overall I have no complaints about this product. The packaging is nice, the formula is fantastic, and the as I said; it matches my skin flawlessly. I will continue to use the foundation until Revlon discontinues it. Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased and it is definitely one of the top drugstore foundations available. Applying with a brush, sponge, or fingers produces great results for a natural finish, medium coverage that is buildable. It&#x27;s also VERY easy to blend. A little messy when first opened, but the jar lets you use every last bit. A problem that I don&#x27;t mind but I know others might: it does have a scent that is not particularly nice, but luckily it does not linger. I will continue to buy this product as it is comparable to high end make up line.</li>
            <li> This is the only foundation i will ever use. Works well on my oily skin</li>
            <li> Has worked well so far but still looking for a foundation that wear all day in high humidity with my oily skin</li>
            <li> Seal on container did not appear to be from manufacture.</li>
            <li> Nothing to say except that the foundation arrived in perfect condition, quickly and it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;Very good quality and the price is correct</li>
            <li> I purchased this in Buff after using the liquid Colorstay in Buff for many years.  The formula was changed in the liquid and it got too chalky and settled into lines I didn&#x27;t even know I had!  This is not only a better colormatch it lasts longer and is giving me better coverage than the liquid.  I apply it with my fingers and with a beautyblender sponge after using rosewater and a moisturizer.  Only thing is that it takes even longer to dry or soak into my skin before I can put my powder and blush on.  Maybe I&#x27;m applying it too heavy?  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my uhum, somewhat mature skin though.  As \\&quot;Mikey\\&quot; used to say, \\&quot;Try it, you&#x27;ll like it!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Great for Sensitive Skin!  I love the coverage it provides and feels light on the skin.  I use a stippling brush and sort of sponge paint my face in sections.  I suffer from rosacea and sometimes eczema on my face and this does a good job of covering.</li>
            <li> This foundation truly stays fresh all day, no touch-ups needed.</li>
            <li> My HG foundation. I have oily skin and it covers great, creamy and sets flawlessly. I sometimes use a primer or moisturizer but not always and still get a beautiful finish. After a few mins of letting it settle, I put a powder overit and iI&#x27;m good all day. It takes some wiping with baby wipes and witch hazel toner to remove it. I love the smell of it. It&#x27;s not real strong but has a nice scent like all revlon products. The longer you wear it the better it looks during the day. It doesn&#x27;t settle into lines. I have some large pores and it fills and smoothes them out. The jar is very thick so it appear like there&#x27;s more product then there really is. If you are fair skinned the only colors available are ivory and buff. I always used porcelain but I have yellow undertones and ivory is too pink. Buff 150 in this brand works perfectly. I love using this foundation, I actually look forward to putting my face on and really hope they interchange the formula. Every other foundation has literally disappeared from my face after a couple hrs but I&#x27;ve been wearing this all summer and I sweat badly at my hairline, under my eyes, above my lip, and my chin. I always carry cotton balls in my purse to blot the sweat off and my foundation stays perfect.</li>
            <li> Good coverage and very lightweight. I&#x27;m not really sure about the staying power, because when I blow my nose, I can see some foundation on my tissue as well. Overall a good product, but I think the original Colorstay is still better.</li>
            <li> Good full coverage foundation, very thick texture so not great on dry skin unless you moisturise before. Long lasting and still looks good throughout day, I personally think it looks better once it has been on for a while and settled. Nice glass packaging but not ideal for travel.</li>
            <li> Not very good coverage and a bit too oily...so it&#x27;s not really suitable for acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;And the lid is uncomfortable to use</li>
            <li> I was using a mid-range foundation but ran out and bought this Revlon Color Stay Whipped foundation after googling some reviews of drugstore foundations. This foundation gives me a perfect, near-full coverage finish. I use it over a primer and thin layer of powder (Google &amp;#34;Wayne Goss method&amp;#34; if you have questions about this) and it gives me a look that is neither too dewy or completely matte--very natural. I always set it with a setting powder and have had no problems with it lasting through a full 8 hour work day. My only gripe is the packaging. A tub of foundation is really unsanitary and just asking for bacteria growth! I would much prefer a pump style bottle, but maybe the consistency of the product won&#x27;t work with that. I recommend you use a clean makeup spatula or some other way to get the product out--using your fingers is just not the best idea if you want to avoid breakouts.</li>
            <li> I love Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay liquid foundation makeup, and have been wanting to try a whipped foundation since the product hit the drugstores, so when this came out I was ecatatic and purchased it right away. I&#x27;m very satisfied. It feels very light and comfortable on my face; I like it much better than the liquid foundation, which can feel a bit greasy. It goes on smoothly and blends well, and a little goes a long way; I feel like this product will last several months, at least half a year if not longer. And it really does stay on my skin. It doesn&#x27;t fade nor do I notice any transfer. It keeps my skin looking matte all day, which I love because I have oily skin and no other product by any other drugstore brand has done this for me. The only qualm I have about this foundation is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to have as much coverage as the Colorstay liquid foundation; I have some acne spots that aren&#x27;t covered as well. However, this is minor and not annoyingly noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love the packaging, the lasting power, and the mattifying effect this foundation provides. Depending on where you purchase it, the price is very reasonable. I love this foundation and would not even consider using another.</li>
            <li> Good coverage, but if your skin is dry at all it looks cakey.  I use this and if my skin is too dry (do to proactive) then I just use a tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this foundation. I think if you have normal to oily skin, you&#x27;ll love this.I have extremely oily skin, and this last pretty well on me(granted it&#x27;s not the most long lasting foundation I&#x27;ve tried). The coverage is medium to full and the finish is natural. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for drier skin types unless you slather on the moisturizer, because this may slightly accentuate dry spots. Overall I enjoyed using this foundation.</li>
            <li> Goes on like butter! It seemed to erase pores and lasts all day. Great foundation. I will definitely be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Loved how it gave me a flawless complexion!&lt;br /&gt;I previously bought the 250 medium beige shade but that was too dark for me.&lt;br /&gt;This shade is perfect</li>
            <li> too cakey! but for someone who needs a heavier coverage could like it better thn I did.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Revlon foundation. I&#x27;m over 50 and a heavier foundation coverage gives me a flawless makeup finish, which I accomplish with this product every time I use it. It&#x27;s my number one choice in the drug store line of makeup products for my every day makeup and I highly recommend it. I have luxury/pricy foundation products for special occasions but this one is my choice in the everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Best foundation I&#x27;ve tried so far! Been using it prob over a yr now! I love it! Good coverage! I keep trying ones on the side for the heck of it and never like them over this one...lol so I recommend you give it a wirl! (:</li>
            <li> I like the formula and its duration. the only thing I dislike is the fact that it has little range of colors.&lt;br /&gt; I have pale skin, but did not buy the lightest color they had, because it had pink undertones, and mine is yellow, so I bought the foundation below. The problem is that this is a little darker for me.</li>
            <li> This is all I use. I&#x27;ve tried so many foundations in the past few years, because I never wore foundations prior to this. This one doesn&#x27;t seem to leave me as oily and does last all day and evens the complexion. It&#x27;s a full coverage product. I don&#x27;t have to retouch all day and I have not found that this settles in fine lines at all. The product list is not overly perfect, but not as bad as most (no parabens)! Love, love and I hope they never stop making this. As well, I have very fair skin and can wear the Ivory or the buff. This product arrived early and in good condition.</li>
            <li> I used to be a Revlon Colorstay girl as a teenager and into my early 20&#x27;s.  I still stand by those products, and I so wanted to love this one, especially after reading the glowing reviews on almost every makeup review site out there.&lt;br /&gt;I need a full coverage foundation, due to acne scars, and I still suffer from adult acne, but now in my late 30&#x27;s also have the pleasure of entering the age of crows feet and forehead wrinkles, which my beloved Laura Mercier silk creme seemed to accentuate.&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to maybe find a fairly inexpensive product and go back to my Revlon roots, but unfortunately I can&#x27;t endorse this.&lt;br /&gt;Not only is it not full coverage, it&#x27;s definitely not lasting coverage; even with a primer, I can still see every mark I was trying to cover by the end of the night, plus I think it&#x27;s made me break out.&lt;br /&gt;It feels great, has a wonderful texture and finish-- it does not accentuate my fine lines, but it doesn&#x27;t provide lasting coverage.&lt;br /&gt;My Laura Mercier Silk Creme still does the job of lasting full coverage even if I have to accept the wrinkles that comes along with it.</li>
            <li> My search for the ideal foundation is over. This foundation is a dream come true. It glides over the skin and melts right in, looking natural yet covering so well. And it really fills in pores (especially if you apply it in an upward stroke). On top of it all, this stuff stays on and stays rather matte even after I go to the gym. (Note: By matte, I don&#x27;t mean it in the usual sense of that it my skin look dry, but instead it keeps my face dewy while preventing oiliness. No idea how that works!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy this in ivory and besides Loreal True Match in porcelain, it is the only drugstore foundation I have ever found that is light enough for my super pale skin. But while Loreal True Match removes color from my face and looks chalky, this color has a bit more &amp;#34;life&amp;#34; to it and has a dewy, healthy finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This foundation also goes really well over sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t mix with the sunscreen because it is so glide-y and requires so little pressure to apply. I&#x27;ve also found that it applies best right after wiping the face down with witch hazel, since it seems to apply best on softened skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never hoped more that a produce never be discontinued, though I know it&#x27;s inevitable with the drug store brands.</li>
            <li> I love Revlon, and really liked Revlon Colorstay but it could be a little drying on me so I was dying to try this when I first heard about it. It is my new favorite foundation! I&#x27;m pretty pale but with a lot of redness on my cheeks and the color Buff covers my face flawlessly. I don&#x27;t even have to use a concealer with this foundation. Some people don&#x27;t like the packaging but I actually really like it, I think it looks nice on my vanity. I really love the texture of this and how easily it blends out. It looks better the longer it&#x27;s on your face! It doesn&#x27;t oxidize on me and dries to a gorgeous, soft semi matte finish. Love love love it!</li>
            <li> Great, Great Coverage especially for a drugstore foundation. I definitely get compliments when I have it on. Very true to it&#x27;s name, it will stay on- which is a benefit for my busy schedule. It didn&#x27;t get five stars because Revlon really needs to do better in the formula for African American women. I understand that as a drugstore brand, I won&#x27;t get all of the luxuries and tones of some of the designer brands such as Bobbi Brown, Clinique, etc. But it does the job for the winter. I know afterwards, I will have to change. And the color is not dead on to my skin color but a close enough match to not give that ghostly look. But overall: A-</li>
            <li> At first I didnt know if I like this makeup but the ,ore I use it the better I like it.  I bought myself a foundation brush to apply it with and it makes the makeup look almost airbrushed.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding good foundation that doesn&#x27;t cost over $30.  I love this stuff!</li>
