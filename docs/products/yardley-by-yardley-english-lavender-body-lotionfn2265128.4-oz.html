            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I love Yardley lavender and cannot find the body lotion in stores.  </li>
            <li>Nice, light lavender scent, too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite because of the calming scent and easy absorption on the skin.</li>
            <li>The scent is lovely &amp; mild, not too sweet &amp; not too spicy but a very nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>For those that haven&#x27;t tried it, this lotion is lightly scented - sure to not offend anyone nearby.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be a bit more mild, like the soap - which I love and use every day.</li>
            <li>This product was shipped from the UK but arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>It could be my fault because my hands are not that strong anymore.</li>
            <li>It is a good price and the lotion is rich and very fragrant.  </li>
            <li>love it quick response would buy again</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lovely on the skin - not at all greasy - it just melts into the skin quickly with no sticky residue.</li>
            <li>I love lavender, and I love this fine old brand.</li>
            <li>This one is the original.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found the real thing!</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to get, but once you have it you will love the scent of the moisturizer and the added bonus of insect repellant!!</li>
            <li>I love this has such a nice soft scent and is soothing.</li>
            <li>I just love the fragrance of Yardley Lavender it is soft and gentle and goes on so light..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s refreshingly simple and clean and elegant.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this lotion, the Outback Steakhouse near me has this exact brand of hand soap in their ladies room</li>

            <li>It smells exactly like the lotion I always bought in London.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent, but it&#x27;s a little too strong for my allergies.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all overbearing and gives you an underlying moisturizer that&#x27;s also a scent that brings calm and peace to your busy life.</li>
            <li>The shipping date on this was much sooner than promised.</li>
            <li>Perhaps Yardleys has changed the formula but it does not smell much of lavender, just floral.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion</li>
            <li>Overall, a clean, fresh scent, just a little too potent for those of us with allergies.</li>
            <li>and I was so excited to find a lotion I could use from the same company!!!!</li>
            <li>Many other scented lotions are overpowering but not this one.</li>
            <li>Top does not open properly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love Yardley products and they are not easy to find.  </li>
            <li>I hope you enjoy it as much as I do in this world of fake scents and strong perfumes.</li>
            <li>I love Yardley products but they can be hard to find.</li>

            <li> Love the fragrance of lavender and nice and creamy plus long lasting.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance.  I am so glad to be able to get the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; thing online thru amazon</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion is not greasy and it smells just divine. Better than the cologne spray and soap. Recommended!</li>
            <li> Excellent, natural scent from the lavender gardens of England that serve the royal family. It&#x27;s not at all overbearing and gives you an underlying moisturizer that&#x27;s also a scent that brings calm and peace to your busy life. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do in this world of fake scents and strong perfumes. It&#x27;s refreshingly simple and clean and elegant. Goes well with the spray.</li>
            <li> This smells like a lavender and other-flower mix, but is nice.</li>
            <li> I love Yardley products and they are not easy to find.  I have not seen the lotion in years so when I saw this I was thrilled.  It is a good price and the lotion is rich and very fragrant.  It is also made in London as it should be.  Have ordered other yardley products which were a disappointment because the scent was odd and then came to find out it was made in India.  This one is the original.  Love that I found it.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It has the texture I was looking for.  However I can not get the pump to work, but I will find  way.  It could be my fault because my hands are not that strong anymore.</li>
            <li> I love this has such a nice soft scent and is soothing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother as a gift. She has been using Yardley Lavender Lotion for years but has not been able to find it locally for 2 years. I bought this in addition to the 4 pack of the lower priced flowering English lavender lotion. The shipping date on this was much sooner than promised. I was afraid it would not arrive before Christmas but it came about a week after I ordered it.</li>
            <li> This does not smell the same as previous bottles I have purchased. Perhaps Yardleys has changed the formula but it does not smell much of lavender, just floral.</li>
            <li> Arrived intact and well packaged</li>
            <li> Lottle stronger than expected</li>
            <li> English Lavender is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Top does not open properly.  The company sent a second one with the same problem.  The pump pumps if you fiddle around with it. Tolerable but not very usable!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this lotion, the Outback Steakhouse near me has this exact brand of hand soap in their ladies room and I was so excited to find a lotion I could use from the same company!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fairly thin lotion, but it&#x27;s moisturizing. I love the scent, but it&#x27;s a little too strong for my allergies. I was hoping it would be a bit more mild, like the soap - which I love and use every day. Overall, a clean, fresh scent, just a little too potent for those of us with allergies.</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to get, but once you have it you will love the scent of the moisturizer and the added bonus of insect repellant!!</li>
            <li> Wish to bottle was bigger!</li>
            <li> love it quick response would buy again</li>
            <li> Great Product, if you love lavender this is for you. Great smelling lotion and keeps my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> I just love this lavender lotion.  It&#x27;s the best one out there..</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of childhood memories.  This scent is not as I remember.  It is very faint,  and not peasant at all.  I threw it out.</li>
            <li> I love this. A bit spendy but it smells like the Yardley&#x27;s lavender that I grew up with. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I buy this lotion all the time.  It&#x27;s my favorite because of the calming scent and easy absorption on the skin.</li>
            <li> I love Yardley products but they can be hard to find. I&#x27;m so happy Amazon carries this wonderful lotion. For those that haven&#x27;t tried it, this lotion is lightly scented - sure to not offend anyone nearby. It&#x27;s lovely on the skin - not at all greasy - it just melts into the skin quickly with no sticky residue. Many other scented lotions are overpowering but not this one. The scent is lovely &amp; mild, not too sweet &amp; not too spicy but a very nice clean scent. This product was shipped from the UK but arrived very quickly. It&#x27;s hard to describe Yardley scents - there&#x27;s really nothing like them out there. Wonderful on all fronts. Sometimes the body wash can be found in some drug stores - R_t_ A_d for example. Try that before you give this as a gift. I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
            <li> i love Yardley products, especially the english lavender; i use this with the body spray for a longer lasting scent;  I definitely will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love Yardley lavender and cannot find the body lotion in stores.  Terrific product.</li>
            <li> I just love the fragrance of Yardley Lavender it is soft and gentle and goes on so light..my skin is so soft after applying..delivery was fast thank you !</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  The company I bought it from through Amazon is terrific!&lt;br /&gt;It came from the United Kingdom and arrived in 7 days.  Three weeks early.  I am very impressed with this company. I highly recommend this fragrance.  It smells exactly like the lotion I always bought in London.  So glad I found the real thing!</li>
            <li> My daughter who is sixteen loves this scent.  Bought her this for Easter gift along with soap and lotion.  Loved it!!</li>
            <li> Just what my wife needed and wanted.</li>
            <li> I love lavender, and I love this fine old brand. Every few years I try again.    There&#x27;s nothing to dislike, but this is not the Yardley&#x27;s of yore, which was bontanically based. All chemicals now.    As noted  by another reviewer, the pump sticks.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion, it&#x27;s thick and creamy and absorbs nicely into the skin, no greasy or wet feeling after I apply it. Nice, light lavender scent, too. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> At last I found the YARDLEY English Lavender skin lotion which I used for several years and then could not find.  BUT, as usual the pump does not work which is very frustrating.</li>
