            <li>On that note enter the most amazing product ever....</li>

            <li>This is a great Deodorant has a clean crisp smell that is not over powering and is effective against odor</li>
            <li>My eyes have been opened and I have made the switch. :-)</li>
            <li>I gifted my dad this perfume for his birthday.</li>
            <li>I been using degree since it was recommended to me by a friend and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>My favorite deoderant.  </li>
            <li>But for the love of God, please, please to the makers of Degree never stop making this product or the Arctic Edge!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW.</li>
            <li>so I can not give you any more info then that.</li>
            <li>At this price though, there are better deals elsewhere.</li>
            <li>I use deodorant without antiperspirant because I am allergic to most antiperspirant products.  </li>
            <li>My favorite Degree item in this line was rosemary/mint scented...</li>
            <li>I like the six-pack because I use more than one bathroom at home</li>
            <li>this is my favorite scent.</li>
            <li>THE STRONG PROTECTION THESE PROVIDE TO ME</li>
            <li>The product is fine, i like having backup and its cheaper to order this way.</li>
            <li>a couple years ago I stumbled across this particular deodorant and was very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Works great, solid scent.</li>
            <li>cheap way to buy my brand</li>
            <li>This pack is a great deal, especially on Subscribe &amp; Save.  </li>
            <li>Degree works great, applies comfortably and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I have found my new favorite!  </li>
            <li>Have used the Degree Anti-perspirant in the past and it is excellent.  </li>
            <li>smells great and keeps the pits dry.</li>
            <li>This product is just right for me!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll pay a whole lot more at the retail stores.</li>
            <li>I like that it is fresh and clean too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh smelling scent, and I have been told by my female friends that I smell good after applying this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent lasts a decent amount of time, but the antiperspirant is top notch.</li>
            <li>This Degree wins on all counts: It does not contain antiperspirant (which is what I prefer); it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin; it smells good; and it seems to last all day.</li>
            <li>Many other deodorants, especially the ones with antiperspirants and even some that are all natural, irritate me easily, this one has worked perfectly...</li>
            <li>If it proves to not matter in product performance I’ll revise my review to make note of it.</li>
            <li>it a shot, it might not be for you, but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>not only smells nice, but it works.</li>
            <li>He applies this at 4am every morning and he still smells fresh when he comes in at 6pm every evening.</li>
            <li>If its good enough for the British special forces underwear, then its good enough for my armpits!</li>
            <li>I found that Arm&amp;Hammer has a new Essentials product that is also aluminum free (as well as silver free) that not only smells better but lasts longer and causes no rash.</li>
            <li>returned it right after opening the box.</li>
            <li>Spend an extra buck or two and get the far superior anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li>deodorant is very sticky, and it dries under your armpit too quickly.</li>
            <li>When I first placed this item in my cart, it was just over $19 and was fulfilled by Amazon.</li>
            <li>AT FIRST.    </li>
            <li>I do recommend this as a great, long lasting deodorant.</li>
            <li>Firstly, I must start by saying that I&#x27;m a woman.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I do if I was doing something particularly active or strenuous, or if I&#x27;m going somewhere nice in the evening, but in reality I don&#x27;t need to.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is fresh, not too strong or overwhelming, but it isn&#x27;t a weak scent.</li>
            <li>basically if you don&#x27;t know the difference, deodorants only makes you smell good, while antiperspirants keeps you dry.</li>
            <li>i would recommend this product to anyone looking to feel fresh and clean all day long.</li>
            <li>Works very well for my armpit needs.</li>
            <li>I don’t know how much that had to do with how well it worked, but I know silver has anti-microbial properties.  </li>
            <li>Got here fast and cheaper than buying at the store.</li>
            <li>AND I KNOW VERY</li>
            <li>reasonable deodorant.  </li>
            <li>This works very well.</li>
            <li>Women&#x27;s deoderants really don&#x27;t work very well, and don&#x27;t always keep me from smelling the majority of the time; I&#x27;ll end up smelling like a mixture of must/sweat/and flowers/powder etc.</li>
            <li>This herbal scent is subtle but pleasant.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a white film and honestly gives all day long sweat protection.  </li>
            <li>Nice manly scent , last all day Long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Degree deodorant (not anti-perspirant) for many years because it was one of the few remaining products that does not contain aluminum.</li>
            <li>And of the few that I&#x27;ve found, most irritate my underarms.</li>
            <li>I tend to have a bit more sensitive skin than the average person and have never had any irritation issues with this deodorant.</li>
            <li>I assumed that was just a new marketing term for the silver, but don’t be fooled, it’s gone.  </li>
            <li>hard to say about this product because i love it, using it for years, get me what i need, the quality is high so do not know what else to say</li>
            <li>see images for both the old and new packaging so for a while</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty active and live in the South, where the heat is absolutely abysmal.</li>
            <li>the regular degrees in my opinion is better and long lasting than this product.    </li>
            <li>The stick is bluish but it goes on clear</li>
            <li>Description wasn&#x27;t clear.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to deodarant.  </li>
            <li>but this product is like old spice deodorant which caused my arm pit to swell</li>
            <li>BUT THESE PRODUCTS ARE COMPLETELY DIFERENT FRAGANCE AND DONT PROTECT AT ALL.........</li>
            <li>I thought all Degree products worked the same, but these &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; do not work very well.</li>
            <li>I do not have what I would consider to be sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Anyone that tells you this stuff works is not being truthful or is confusing it with another product.</li>
            <li>If I can get a hold of an older stick with Silver Ions, I’ll try some Left</li>
            <li>Without this, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d be able to sleep in the same bed as my husband!!  </li>
            <li>will buying this deodorant in the future and highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Its becoming hard to find deorderant without antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I’ve been using this stuff for a few years in various scents, cool rush was my favorite but is getting hard to find.  </li>
            <li>Degree is the first deodorant that I have purchased that gives you long lasting odor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this, along with other silver-based deodorants, for a few years, and found that they worked much better than anything else I tried.  </li>
            <li>; It has no unflattering white residue since it&#x27;s the clear style.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only bought from Amazon directly and not a 3rd-party re-seller, so look out who you buy from if you are worried about a knock-off.</li>
            <li>As an active man, Degree is one of the few deodorants that keeps me fresh all day long especially during a high humid, hot summer</li>
            <li>Price little higher than Wall Mart retail price.</li>
            <li>SKIN PEELING, IRRITATION, NOT LONG LASTING, OVERRATED TECHNOLOGY</li>

            <li> Its becoming hard to find deorderant without antiperspirant.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I’ve been using this stuff for a few years in various scents, cool rush was my favorite but is getting hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Degree is the first deodorant that I have purchased that gives you long lasting odor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this, along with other silver-based deodorants, for a few years, and found that they worked much better than anything else I tried.  </li>
            <li> ; It has no unflattering white residue since it&#x27;s the clear style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only bought from Amazon directly and not a 3rd-party re-seller, so look out who you buy from if you are worried about a knock-off.</li>
            <li> As an active man, Degree is one of the few deodorants that keeps me fresh all day long especially during a high humid, hot summer</li>
            <li> Price little higher than Wall Mart retail price.</li>
            <li> SKIN PEELING, IRRITATION, NOT LONG LASTING, OVERRATED TECHNOLOGY</li>
            <li> I was expecting dry solid not invisible.  </li>
            <li> For YEARS while using this product I have suffered from an occasional underarm rash that I actually chocked up to chafing due to a LACK of the product on my body.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the formulation changed somewhere along the line, and the Degree products with their &amp;#34;silver ion&amp;#34; technology are no longer available.</li>
            <li> We received a check for about 5 times the cost, and 6 coupons for free Degree deodorant, along with a letter saying they were sorry about our experiences.</li>
            <li> It works well and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS DEODORANT FOR A LONG TIME</li>
            <li> another reviewer I have suffered from hyper hydrosis for as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> With antiperspirant types, I look like a monkey, itching under my arms.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Without those items, this is just high priced deodorant of average (or less) quality.  </li>
            <li> The price was extremely affordable and we will definitely purchase it from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> When I reordered, I mistakenly bought this deodorant only variety because it was a little cheaper.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s to be expected it doesn&#x27;t work for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What I mean by that, is that it completely dissolves away within two hours and ceases to give you anymore protection.</li>
            <li> We know it&#x27;s the silver ions because we&#x27;ve tried the other varieties without it, and</li>
            <li> in other words if you don&#x27;t want to get musty get something with antiperspirants, use this type of product to add fragrances to yourself.</li>
            <li> Tried other styles and brands, sticking with this.</li>
            <li> I am a long-time user of gel antiperspirant deodorants and have not liked &#x27;greasy&#x27; solid formulas.  </li>
            <li> While it had the silver in it, it kept the odor down even without blocking perspiration.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worried about wetness for a few years now.  </li>
            <li> , waste of money gave it all away.</li>
            <li> I guess my only tiny complaint is that if I apply it, and then immediately pull a shirt over my head, I sometimes get a visible smear of deodorant on some random part of my shirt.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> and I’m giving it 3 due to the subtle dropping of the Silver Ions.  </li>
            <li> No smelly armpits or excessive sweat.</li>
            <li> it’s going to be hard to know what you will be getting without asking each seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find deodorant that isn&#x27;t also antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> hard to find in the retail stores.</li>
            <li> Sent a complaint to the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the boyfriend, he hated the way it felt on his skin, and it made his armpits turn red.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it, but I wanted antiperspirant, not deoderant...</li>
            <li> I’m guessing it was a cost saving measure; silver is expensive, although the quantity per bar had to be minuscule.  </li>
            <li> if you read this and think that this sounds fake, don&#x27;t buy it.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m stuck with six sticks of this crap that I can&#x27;t use.  </li>
            <li> I put it on in the morning at around 9 a.m., and by the time I walked to my classes from my dorm and all over campus, I smelled awful.</li>
            <li> gave the deoderant two weeks, and it&#x27;s still terrible and doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Besides that, the armpits on my shirts that I wore when I used this product continue to smell terrible when any heat starts to develop under my pits.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works very well for my armpit needs.</li>
            <li> Degree works great, applies comfortably and lasts a long time.  Happy.</li>
            <li> When I first placed this item in my cart, it was just over $19 and was fulfilled by Amazon. Now it&#x27;s $20.66, is being fulfilled by something called AmericaRx, and requires a shipping charge of over $10! That raises the per unit price from $3.29 to $5.15. I can get it cheaper at the local drugstore.</li>
            <li> The same deodorant I&#x27;ve used for years, finally got around to buying a pack of it from online to keep me covered for years.  Works great, solid scent.</li>
            <li> cheap way to buy my brand</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with it, but I wanted antiperspirant, not deoderant...</li>
            <li> I put this stuff on 13 hrs ago and my wife still smells it from across the room. Im a big guy who works in ware houses and this stuff is effective. Best deoderant ive ever had. If its good enough for the British special forces underwear, then its good enough for my armpits!</li>
            <li> Bought this for the boyfriend, he hated the way it felt on his skin, and it made his armpits turn red. Gave the rest of the tubes away</li>
            <li> This will keep you smelling good all day with no odor at all !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buying this deodorant in the future and highly recommend it</li>
            <li> As an active man, Degree is one of the few deodorants that keeps me fresh all day long especially during a high humid, hot summer</li>
            <li> Degree has updated the look of the packaging and the ingredients list for this deodorant.  They quietly dropped the Silver Ions (silver chloride) from the ingredients.  They replaced the “Silver Ions” logo on the front with “time-release molecules”.  I assumed that was just a new marketing term for the silver, but don’t be fooled, it’s gone.  I don’t know how much that had to do with how well it worked, but I know silver has anti-microbial properties.  If I can get a hold of an older stick with Silver Ions, I’ll try some Left/Right pit comparisons with and without the silver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see images for both the old and new packaging so for a while it’s going to be hard to know what you will be getting without asking each seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been using this stuff for a few years in various scents, cool rush was my favorite but is getting hard to find.  It works well and lasts a long time.  The stick is bluish but it goes on clear and I’ve never had any noticeable residue on my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;It was 5 stars and I’m giving it 3 due to the subtle dropping of the Silver Ions.  I’m guessing it was a cost saving measure; silver is expensive, although the quantity per bar had to be minuscule.  If it proves to not matter in product performance I’ll revise my review to make note of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Degree deodorant (not anti-perspirant) for many years because it was one of the few remaining products that does not contain aluminum. I came here to buy a 6-pack just to stock up but reading these reviews I had a revelation. For YEARS while using this product I have suffered from an occasional underarm rash that I actually chocked up to chafing due to a LACK of the product on my body. Rash&#x3D;chafing so I must need more degree applied! Obviously I misread the symptoms and see that I too have suffered a rash caused by this product and have so for years. I found that Arm&amp;Hammer has a new Essentials product that is also aluminum free (as well as silver free) that not only smells better but lasts longer and causes no rash. My eyes have been opened and I have made the switch. :-)</li>
            <li> Without this, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d be able to sleep in the same bed as my husband!!  He&#x27;s a sweater by nature, but something in the silver ion technology helps manage the odor in an incredible way.  We know it&#x27;s the silver ions because we&#x27;ve tried the other varieties without it, and...well...not even close!  This pack is a great deal, especially on Subscribe &amp; Save.  Beats the commissary price!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the freshness of Degree!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this, along with other silver-based deodorants, for a few years, and found that they worked much better than anything else I tried.  Unfortunately, the formulation changed somewhere along the line, and the Degree products with their &amp;#34;silver ion&amp;#34; technology are no longer available.</li>
            <li> Degree changed ingredients.  This item DOES NOT contain Silver Chloride or Titanium oxide as noted on the site. Posted feedback to Degree site; they just deleted all as the posts were all similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without those items, this is just high priced deodorant of average (or less) quality.  Look for Dove or Nivea, both offer Silver chloride and no aluminum product deodorants&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned it right after opening the box.</li>
            <li> Excellent deodo, was looking for a product without Aluminium and this worked, feels and smell great.  Many other deodorants, especially the ones with antiperspirants and even some that are all natural, irritate me easily, this one has worked perfectly...</li>
            <li> Great price, and function.</li>
            <li> Have used the Degree Anti-perspirant in the past and it is excellent.  When I reordered, I mistakenly bought this deodorant only variety because it was a little cheaper.  It&#x27;s wet, slimy, sticky, and completely ineffective.  Spend an extra buck or two and get the far superior anti-perspirant.</li>
            <li> Got here fast and cheaper than buying at the store. Works good lasts me all day</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to deodarant.  The Degree brand does not cause any itching for me, and lasts fairly well.</li>
            <li> I gifted my dad this perfume for his birthday. The fragrance is nyc and he also liked it , i am happy now</li>
            <li> Great product...Do u need a men&#x27;s deodorant that works effectively beyond 24 hrs then this is the ultimate product. #winner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using this deodorant for a while but the costs were getting out of control. Ordering online through Amazon brought the costs back into reason. Now I can get the deodorant I want again without being robbed. This product does a good job of preventing perspiration odor and sweat.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is the bomb!  It doesn&#x27;t leave a white film and honestly gives all day long sweat protection.  I have found my new favorite!  Recommended!</li>
            <li> Its becoming hard to find deorderant without antiperspirant.  This works great.</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells great and love the fact that it doesnt leave residues. but overall, it&#x27;s a disappoint.  THE DEODORANT WAS PEELING MY SKIN. LITERALLY, the deodorant was bleaching my skin( removing my arm pit skin).LOL.    I been using degree since it was recommended to me by a friend and fell in love with it. but this product is like old spice deodorant which caused my arm pit to swell and i stopped using it and move to degree. the regular degrees in my opinion is better and long lasting than this product.    ONE GOOD THING: GOES ON CLEAR AND SMELLS GREAT AT FIRST.    CONS: SKIN PEELING, IRRITATION, NOT LONG LASTING, OVERRATED TECHNOLOGY</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS DEODORANT FOR A LONG TIME AGO AND I KNOW VERY WELL HOW THESE SMELL AND THE STRONG PROTECTION THESE PROVIDE TO ME.... BUT THESE PRODUCTS ARE COMPLETELY DIFERENT FRAGANCE AND DONT PROTECT AT ALL......... SO DONT BUY IT, IF YOU DONT WANT TO LOSE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> I used to just use whatever was on sale or my mom purchased, but a couple years ago I stumbled across this particular deodorant and was very satisfied. I put it on when I wake up and in all honesty I don&#x27;t need to apply it again all day. I do if I was doing something particularly active or strenuous, or if I&#x27;m going somewhere nice in the evening, but in reality I don&#x27;t need to. Some say that this irritates, and that is all on a person-by-person basis. People&#x27;s skin are all different so it&#x27;s to be expected it doesn&#x27;t work for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is fresh, not too strong or overwhelming, but it isn&#x27;t a weak scent. It&#x27;s a fresh smelling scent, and I have been told by my female friends that I smell good after applying this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot, it might not be for you, but it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> Used subscribe and save, couldn&#x27;t beat the price! I am set on deodorant for awhile plus when I&#x27;m running low they&#x27;ll send me another shipment.</li>
            <li> reasonable deodorant.  While it had the silver in it, it kept the odor down even without blocking perspiration.  BUT... what is being delivered now  is not as advertised, as there is NO SILVER  in it now.  The online ingredient list says &amp;#34;silver chloride&amp;#34; ....  the six pack delivered to me  does NOT.</li>
            <li> Going back to the white solid.  I thought all Degree products worked the same, but these &amp;#34;sticks&amp;#34; do not work very well.</li>
            <li> My favorite deoderant.  Been sing for years now. Doesnt leave marks on clothes.  Great scent.</li>
            <li> I was at Target today and the shelf space for this product has seemed to dwindle.  I pray that they aren&#x27;t going to discontinue this item.  You might actually hear a grown man cry over this.  I always stock up on it while I&#x27;m out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like another reviewer I have suffered from hyper hydrosis for as long as I can remember.  I tried everything.  Clinical stuff to every stick on the market.  Even the stuff you put on at night.  That stopped the sweating for a short time, but I think my body became immune and back to embarrassing sweaty pits.  On that note enter the most amazing product ever....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It not only smells nice, but it works. I haven&#x27;t worried about wetness for a few years now.  So my guess is if it works and I&#x27;ll never stop using it, they&#x27;ll probably discontinue it.  That&#x27;s the way things seem to work these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you read this and think that this sounds fake, don&#x27;t buy it.  But for the love of God, please, please to the makers of Degree never stop making this product or the Arctic Edge!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW. The scent lasts a decent amount of time, but the antiperspirant is top notch.</li>
            <li> got a rash and it didn&#x27;t say it was a gel don&#x27;t bother, waste of money gave it all away.</li>
            <li> It is not an antiperspirant.  My BO was not welcomed!</li>
            <li> I smell beautiful... What can I say?</li>
            <li> smells great. great product. is only deodorant just so you know. basically if you don&#x27;t know the difference, deodorants only makes you smell good, while antiperspirants keeps you dry. in other words if you don&#x27;t want to get musty get something with antiperspirants, use this type of product to add fragrances to yourself.</li>
            <li> Great value. You&#x27;ll pay a whole lot more at the retail stores.</li>
            <li> I can only guess that it is being used. I do not use it so I can not give you any more info then that.</li>
            <li> I do not have what I would consider to be sensitive skin.  However, I itched immmediately upon application.  I tried to see if I could adapt to the deodorant, but my wife began to notice chemical burns at the application site.  I just wish I didn&#x27;t have six sticks of this.</li>
            <li> Degree is the first deodorant that I have purchased that gives you long lasting odor. Put it on once in the morning and it lasts all day.  I now use this brand and nothing else. At this price though, there are better deals elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Nice manly scent , last all day Long</li>
            <li> Simply put, my fiance loves this deodorant! No smelly armpits or excessive sweat. he swears by it and will only use Degree. The price was extremely affordable and we will definitely purchase it from Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Good product with a good price.</li>
            <li> I WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND THE DEGREE DEODORANT AT THE PRICE I GOT IT FOR AWESOME VALUE.</li>
            <li> I use deodorant without antiperspirant because I am allergic to most antiperspirant products.  Degree keeps me smelling great all day.</li>
            <li> I would avoid this product at all costs. We tried the Degree with Silver ion and it caused a burning rash. Had to wash it off and use aloe based lotion for several days. Stick to the aluminum based deodorants. Sent a complaint to the manufacturer. We received a check for about 5 times the cost, and 6 coupons for free Degree deodorant, along with a letter saying they were sorry about our experiences. It would seem this has been a problem for them when they react like that to a basic inquiry.</li>
            <li> This works very well. My husband is a truck driver who has to unload his truck as well. He applies this at 4am every morning and he still smells fresh when he comes in at 6pm every evening. It smells very good too! I do recommend this as a great, long lasting deodorant.</li>
            <li> I am a long-time user of gel antiperspirant deodorants and have not liked &#x27;greasy&#x27; solid formulas.  I also was looking for a silver-based deodorant molecule rather than an aluminum one.  The research I have seen notes that silver formulas are the ones proven clinically to kill or reduce the bacteria that cause odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviews here seem to be &#x27;all over the place&#x27; as to comfort, effectiveness and customer satisfaction.  My favorite Degree item in this line was rosemary/mint scented...but that is no longer on offer.  This herbal scent is subtle but pleasant.  I do not experience any stinging from use and I find that it works all day, while also reducing my perspiration.  The product is non-staining.  I like the six-pack because I use more than one bathroom at home and I also travel.  This product is just right for me!</li>
            <li> Always buy this - works great for me year in and year out.  Tried other styles and brands, sticking with this.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I must start by saying that I&#x27;m a woman. I&#x27;m pretty active and live in the South, where the heat is absolutely abysmal. Women&#x27;s deoderants really don&#x27;t work very well, and don&#x27;t always keep me from smelling the majority of the time; I&#x27;ll end up smelling like a mixture of must/sweat/and flowers/powder etc. So, I decided to swipe up a men&#x27;s line and see how it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This deodorant is very sticky, and it dries under your armpit too quickly. What I mean by that, is that it completely dissolves away within two hours and ceases to give you anymore protection. I put it on in the morning at around 9 a.m., and by the time I walked to my classes from my dorm and all over campus, I smelled awful. As another lady poster said, it was like an oniony type smell. In between one of my classes I HAD to go wash my armpits for fear that everyone would smell me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the deoderant two weeks, and it&#x27;s still terrible and doesn&#x27;t work well. Besides that, the armpits on my shirts that I wore when I used this product continue to smell terrible when any heat starts to develop under my pits. I can&#x27;t even wear them anymore because this deodorant didn&#x27;t do what it said it would! On to Dove Clinical Strength.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find deodorant that isn&#x27;t also antiperspirant. And of the few that I&#x27;ve found, most irritate my underarms. This Degree wins on all counts: It does not contain antiperspirant (which is what I prefer); it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin; it smells good; and it seems to last all day. I guess my only tiny complaint is that if I apply it, and then immediately pull a shirt over my head, I sometimes get a visible smear of deodorant on some random part of my shirt.</li>
            <li> good $$$ deal. It&#x27;s a deodorant rather than an antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;So it D/N irritate my skin. With antiperspirant types, I look like a monkey, itching under my arms. lol</li>
            <li> This is the most useless deodorant I have ever used.  It&#x27;s so ineffective, it seems like I start to stink even sooner than if I didn&#x27;t use any deodorant.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Anyone that tells you this stuff works is not being truthful or is confusing it with another product.</li>
            <li> I was expecting dry solid not invisible.  Invisible solids irritate my skin and don&#x27;t work for me at all.  Now I&#x27;m stuck with six sticks of this crap that I can&#x27;t use.  Description wasn&#x27;t clear.</li>
            <li> smell good look good.</li>
            <li> hard to say about this product because i love it, using it for years, get me what i need, the quality is high so do not know what else to say</li>
            <li> smells great and keeps the pits dry.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite scent. and the protection lasts all day. hard to find in the retail stores. so i ordered a 6-pack. i would recommend this product to anyone looking to feel fresh and clean all day long.</li>
            <li> Works well and doesn&#x27;t leave a scent that is overpowering to the senses either.I like that it is fresh and clean too.</li>
            <li> Have used it for years and is still just like day one when I started using it...</li>
            <li> Price little higher than Wall Mart retail price.</li>
            <li> I am not a Antipersperant guy. This is a great Deodorant has a clean crisp smell that is not over powering and is effective against odor</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price, &#x27;nuff said :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make it the day</li>
            <li> This is the only deodorant I buy anymore. I like it because it doesn&#x27;t stain clothes with a &amp;#34;wet spot.&amp;#34; It has no unflattering white residue since it&#x27;s the clear style. It lasts all day for me and smells great! I&#x27;ve only bought from Amazon directly and not a 3rd-party re-seller, so look out who you buy from if you are worried about a knock-off. I tend to have a bit more sensitive skin than the average person and have never had any irritation issues with this deodorant.</li>
            <li> Not solid white.  Just an FYI.</li>
            <li> Best deodorant ever used. By the end øf night still protected</li>
            <li> Good price, Good product description.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this Deodorant!!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The product is fine, i like having backup and its cheaper to order this way.</li>
    </ol>
