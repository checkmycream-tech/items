            <li> I wish I had tried this a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft even after using heavy duty hairspray.</li>
            <li> Every other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried has tons of chemicals, such as propylene glycol, which I don&#x27;t want to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products and I keep coming back to Garnier.</li>
            <li> If anything it takes out my red dye faster than any other shampoo that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> For me to give something a *bad* review, it has to do more than not live up to its hype-</li>
            <li> it has to have a marked negative effect.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The 25 ounce bottle is rather large and annoying to handle, so I kept my old 13-ounce bottle around and use the big one to refill it.</li>
            <li> hair- the other one does not so it can&#x27;t be blamed on the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand on my color treated hair!</li>
            <li> I never even have pimples on my face much less under my hair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Me &amp;#</li>
            <li> Usually, my hair gets weighed down easily by bad shampoos or it becomes dry and the waves become less defined.  </li>
            <li> My head is all broken out and it&#x27;s been that way for weeks</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s broken both of us</li>
            <li> so I was looking for a shampoo we could both use that wouldn&#x27;t be very expensive.  </li>
            <li> My bad, I thought the prices would be competitive.  </li>

            <li> This shampoo works really well for dry and colored hair. It doesn&#x27;t strip out any color, keeps it looking healthy and shiny, and smells REALLY good. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and really do love it!</li>
            <li> It smells great, feels great and my demi permanent hair dye is still going strong after 6 weeks! I wouldn&#x27;t use any other brand on my color treated hair!</li>
            <li> Everything went as specified when the purchase was made.</li>
            <li> The only product that we&#x27;ve found that creates a literal color shield and is designed for use with colored hair.</li>
            <li> I have my hair dyed teal and this shampoo really makes a big difference in how long it lasts.  I tried another brand&#x27;s color-retaining shampoo, and when I switched to this it made a huge difference.  The 25 ounce bottle is rather large and annoying to handle, so I kept my old 13-ounce bottle around and use the big one to refill it.</li>
            <li> Great product, on time</li>
            <li> It works for my type of hair but it doesn&#x27;t help the color stay longer and now Amazon Subscribe and save isn&#x27;t carrying it</li>
            <li> This is a good shampoo works great on my hair great price also, This is my second bottle of this shampoo</li>
            <li> great product as it does the job very well at a decent price.  I use this all the time and it leaves my hair feeling clean and natural.  Also, I dye my hair and this shampoo get my hair clean with not effects to my color.</li>
            <li> My bad, I thought the prices would be competitive.  I didn&#x27;t realize the cost of this item would be twice as much as Walmart, Target or Vons.  I will never buy this product online again.</li>
            <li> I love &amp;#34;Garnier Fructis Color Shield shampoo!!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great.The extract in this shampoo does&lt;br /&gt;feel minty earthy from root to tip of the hair. The&lt;br /&gt;color stays natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T. M.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Leaves hair soft smooth silky and shining!</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo for about a year now.  It&#x27;s the only shampoo that I use because it keeps my hair shiny and moisturized just enough.  I have long, fine, wavy hair, that I would classify as \\&quot;normal\\&quot; (not too dry, not too oily).  Usually, my hair gets weighed down easily by bad shampoos or it becomes dry and the waves become less defined.  This shampoo preserves my highlights very well.  I tried the Redken brand of color protecting shampoo as well and it didn&#x27;t work very well in comparison to this shampoo.  I highly recommend this to those who have color-treated hair and are looking for moisturizing and nice smelling shampoo.</li>
            <li> This lathers up very nicely.  I wish I had tried this a long time ago.  I will not switch back.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> For me to give something a *bad* review, it has to do more than not live up to its hype- it has to have a marked negative effect.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for a month.&lt;br /&gt;My husband used it too because he&#x27;s a guy and he uses whatever is in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I said to him&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Honey, I think I&#x27;m going to have to get rid of this shampoo.  My head is all broken out and it&#x27;s been that way for weeks and I just can&#x27;t take it anymore!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He replied &amp;#34;You know, I&#x27;ve been having itchy bumps on MY head.  I never even have pimples on my face much less under my hair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Me &amp;#34;Have you been using my color shield shampoo and conditioner?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Him &amp;#34;Is it in the shower?  Then yes!&amp;#34;  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I have no idea what they put in this stuff but it&#x27;s broken both of us out.&lt;br /&gt;Only one of us colors her hair- the other one does not so it can&#x27;t be blamed on the color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer Beware!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I use the same shampoo (she is 6) so I was looking for a shampoo we could both use that wouldn&#x27;t be very expensive.  I ordered this and so far it is working out great.  My daughter can use it and I can also use it on my color treated hair.  It smells great too!</li>
            <li> Every other shampoo I&#x27;ve ever tried has tons of chemicals, such as propylene glycol, which I don&#x27;t want to use. I&#x27;ve tried other products and I keep coming back to Garnier.</li>
            <li> This is very good for colored hair; really protects and saves the color.  Works so well!  I like all Garnier products, including the hair color</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this shampoo a few months, but I really like it. It leaves my hair soft even after using heavy duty hairspray. Plus, it is a large bottle that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The only thing this shampoo fortifies is evidence that your hair has been trashed after one use!</li>
            <li> Bought this for myself love it and it works great does everything it promises to do although found a better brand</li>
            <li> I purchased the shampoo about a year ago and my haircolor right now is red. I have not seen any difference in using the shampoo. If anything it takes out my red dye faster than any other shampoo that I&#x27;ve used. I actually love the conditioner because it leaves my hair shinier And softer.</li>
