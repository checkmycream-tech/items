            <li>Throughout the day, my hair got more oily though.</li>
            <li>Uhm... I think it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>My hair is so silky and soft and smells great too.</li>
            <li>I wish they had a leave in treatment, but overall this is an awesome product and worth it, order more</li>
            <li>The shampoo was fine, smelled great as usual, but the conditioner was not that great.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s true with any conditioner I think!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many top of the line hair shampoo and conditioner without success.</li>
            <li>(By the way, both bottles contain 530mL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the shower, I could easily de-tangle my hair with my fingers.</li>
            <li>love these shampoos and for the volume you receive they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The texture felt like that cheap conditioner you would get at the dollar store.</li>

            <li>good for sensitive skin , dandruff hair or eczema</li>

            <li>and it smells fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use this as I heard many positive reviews on it.</li>
            <li>my new favorite</li>
            <li>Love the smell, lather, and it makes hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Absolutely awesomeness!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the next day and there is still sign of the scent there :) !</li>
            <li>My hair washes out soft and the scent is wonderful and not like the typical vanilla, musky</li>
            <li>I have definitely tried a wide variety of shampoo and conditioners, and this is some of the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It was pricy, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I have dry hair and these products are amazing.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny, and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I initially bought travel sizes of this set when I was visiting Taiwan and fell in love with the scent.</li>
            <li>Really!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through sooooo many different kinds trying to find the ones that will do what they say they will.</li>
            <li>first time.  </li>
            <li>I was nervous at first, as I used shiseido and it didn&#x27;t agree with my hair</li>
            <li>It was smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I love how soft and silky this left my hair and how much more healthy it looked after a few uses.</li>
            <li>My hair became shine and smooth after only 2 days of using these product.</li>
            <li>The real test was blow drying</li>
            <li>Also, you don&#x27;t need quite too much of shampoo because it lathers really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With this I used it once and my hair was insanely soft, shiny, moisturized, thicker with more volume, and the scent is nothing short of divine!</li>
            <li>I live in NY with a very humid weather pretty much through out the year.</li>
            <li>Let air dry my hair with NO products after and OMG super silky soft straight hair!!!</li>
            <li>I have dyed hair that is colored purple and blue and it washes it nicely and leaves it very soft, i had a problem with that hair because it was extremely dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightly fragrant &amp; not too heavy.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny and no DANDRUFF!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even need to use the conditioner and my hair is soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy thin hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>The set is wonderful to use especially the scent that&#x27;s left behind after use.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item for the missus to use as a new hair care product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as I had hoped, and it makes my hair feel weird a day after.&lt;br /&gt;However, after washing it, it does feel really nice, but as I said, it doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using it, my hair feels very soft.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, I will update how long it lasts (for those who don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday, like myself).</li>
            <li>I was expecting two new bottles of high quality shampoo and conditioner, because I&#x27;ve used this stuff before and loved it and that&#x27;s why I was willing to pay almost $30 for two bottles of only 550ml, but what I got was disappointing.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have with it is if I use too much of the conditioner, it made my hair feel</li>
            <li>so, so soft and</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used in which it leaves my hair silky soft and untangled while bathing (I&#x27;ve used cheap stuff to the more expensive stuff!).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricy, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this set from a Japanese store and am amazed with how much life it breathed back into my hair!</li>
            <li>so it started getting more dry and dull.</li>
            <li>My fly-away hairs  have also calmed down and my scalp is more smoother and less dry looking.</li>
            <li>I still love it and hope the shedding isn&#x27;t due to the shampoo, but in comparison to the other brands I&#x27;ve used (Fekkai, Molto Bene, Daenggimeori Ki Gold to name a few)</li>

            <li> After using it for a long while, my hair felt softer, cleaner &amp; fluffier.</li>

            <li> (I have straight-ish wavy black asian hair if you&#x27;re curious.)</li>
            <li> I am an Chinese woman with a very thick dry hair.</li>
            <li> but this stuff is the money maker hands down.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was way less than satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Usually my hair would dry frizzy, but it didn&#x27;t frizz at all when it dried.</li>
            <li> I as well have a dandruff problem and one day I itched my scalp pretty bad</li>
            <li> Only downside is that they are a little oily so people with oily hair should be wary.</li>
            <li> just seems like average shampoo to me, and it&#x27;s too expensive for what it gives.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> I have dense hair with thin strains and it is wavy/curly.</li>
            <li> Too expensive for the size and quality.</li>

            <li> Love this shampoo/conditioner, everything about it. I have dry hair and these products are amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing wonderful product!!!</li>
            <li> love these shampoos and for the volume you receive they are worth every penny. My hair is so soft and shiny and no DANDRUFF!! my new favorite</li>
            <li> Love it since I started to use it</li>
            <li> I honestly love this shampoo and conditioner. I have dyed hair that is colored purple and blue and it washes it nicely and leaves it very soft, i had a problem with that hair because it was extremely dry. I as well have a dandruff problem and one day I itched my scalp pretty bad and when I went to wash it with this shampoo it felt amazing! I had no issues whatsoever and it actually calmed it.</li>
            <li> I really, really love this product! My hair is soft, shiny, and smooth.  It smells really good. It&#x27;s a little pricy, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> nice product, love it</li>
            <li> I initially bought travel sizes of this set when I was visiting Taiwan and fell in love with the scent. After using it for a long while, my hair felt softer, cleaner &amp; fluffier. It&#x27;s very lightly fragrant &amp; not too heavy. The only issue I have with it is if I use too much of the conditioner, it made my hair feel flat~ but that&#x27;s true with any conditioner I think!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as I had hoped, and it makes my hair feel weird a day after.&lt;br /&gt;However, after washing it, it does feel really nice, but as I said, it doesn&#x27;t last long.&lt;br /&gt;It just seems like average shampoo to me, and it&#x27;s too expensive for what it gives.&lt;br /&gt;Most likely will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a believer!!! I washed my hair then conditioned left on for ten minutes rinsed out. Let air dry my hair with NO products after and OMG super silky soft straight hair!!! Normally my hair gets wavy and a little dry when using other shampoos!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for the missus to use as a new hair care product. The fragrance is lovely and intoxicating. She loves both the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good. After using it, my hair feels very soft.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. Really! I&#x27;ve gone through sooooo many different kinds trying to find the ones that will do what they say they will. I have dry and somewhat damaged hair that needs a little bit of volume and thickening, and I&#x27;ve tried every American product under the sun to try to just get damage control, and forget about finding something that can tackle all of those issues. With this I used it once and my hair was insanely soft, shiny, moisturized, thicker with more volume, and the scent is nothing short of divine! I&#x27;m never using another shampoo or conditioner ever again because I&#x27;ve found THE ONE(s) lol!</li>
            <li> I have definitely tried a wide variety of shampoo and conditioners, and this is some of the best I&#x27;ve used. I haven&#x27;t cut my hair in a really long time so it started getting more dry and dull. I recently purchased this set from a Japanese store and am amazed with how much life it breathed back into my hair! My hair is so silky and soft and smells great too. I got compliments from coworkers, they asked me what I use!</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy thin hair that tangles easily. This is the ONLY shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used in which it leaves my hair silky soft and untangled while bathing (I&#x27;ve used cheap stuff to the more expensive stuff!). I don&#x27;t even need to use the conditioner and my hair is soft and very manageable. The scent is also light, pleasant and fragrant and lingers in your hair most of the day. I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair... so, so soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;ve given it 4 is because my hair seems to shed a lot with this shampoo. I still love it and hope the shedding isn&#x27;t due to the shampoo, but in comparison to the other brands I&#x27;ve used (Fekkai, Molto Bene, Daenggimeori Ki Gold to name a few) I seem to shed a lot more hair. I will continue to use, hope the shedding remedies itself.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.  Love the smell, lather, and it makes hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Absolutely awesomeness!! I am an Chinese woman with a very thick dry hair. I&#x27;ve tried many top of the line hair shampoo and conditioner without success. My hair became shine and smooth after only 2 days of using these product. I live in NY with a very humid weather pretty much through out the year. These babe are now my must have going forward!!!</li>
            <li> Too expensive for the size and quality. I was expecting two new bottles of high quality shampoo and conditioner, because I&#x27;ve used this stuff before and loved it and that&#x27;s why I was willing to pay almost $30 for two bottles of only 550ml, but what I got was disappointing. The shampoo was fine, smelled great as usual, but the conditioner was not that great. The conditioner was way less than satisfactory. The texture felt like that cheap conditioner you would get at the dollar store. I would exchange it or try to get my money back but I just won&#x27;t buy from here anymore.</li>
            <li> This is probably my favorite shampoo and conditioner set. It smells amazing and leaves my hair shiny and smooth. Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> good for sensitive skin , dandruff hair or eczema</li>
            <li> My hair washes out soft and the scent is wonderful and not like the typical vanilla, musky, argon oil smells you get on the market.  Have I seen miracles with my hair? Well, that&#x27;s a question we all have to ask ourselves whenever we try diff. beauty products.</li>
            <li> I have always used korean hair products and have been very satisfied with the results.&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the reviews for this product and price comparison I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I was more then pleased with the results.  You will get immediate results from using this product&lt;br /&gt;the first time.  Hair is smooth and the scent is fragrant yet light.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever purchased - wish it was more available in the states</li>
            <li> I have used pureology and everything in between and by far this is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used. I am caucasian I have dense hair with thin strains and it is wavy/curly. The smell is amazing, I will update how long it lasts (for those who don&#x27;t wash your hair everyday, like myself). The feeling after rinsing the conditioner off was as if I used a $40 deep conditioner. The real test was blow drying and I was super impressed my hair is full of volume, shiny, and bouncy. I was nervous at first, as I used shiseido and it didn&#x27;t agree with my hair but this stuff is the money maker hands down.</li>
            <li> Love, will keep buying</li>
            <li> The set is wonderful to use especially the scent that&#x27;s left behind after use.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this as I heard many positive reviews on it. It was pricy, but I think it&#x27;s worth it. So I washed my hair and the scent is so lovely! I still smell it on my hair as if I just washed it and it&#x27;s been 6 hours already! I&#x27;ve never had a shampoo that had a smell that lasted on so long and it smells fresh and clean! As others have described it, it smells kind of floral, cherry blossom maybe? Some kind of flower. (By the way, both bottles contain 530mL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of the shower, I could easily de-tangle my hair with my fingers. Usually my hair would dry frizzy, but it didn&#x27;t frizz at all when it dried. It was smooth and soft. My fly-away hairs  have also calmed down and my scalp is more smoother and less dry looking. (I have straight-ish wavy black asian hair if you&#x27;re curious.) Also, you don&#x27;t need quite too much of shampoo because it lathers really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review was helpful!! :)&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATED**&lt;br /&gt;So it&#x27;s the next day and there is still sign of the scent there :) ! Throughout the day, my hair got more oily though. I would still buy because results are amazing!</li>
            <li> I love how soft and silky this left my hair and how much more healthy it looked after a few uses. I wish they had a leave in treatment, but overall this is an awesome product and worth it, order more so I don&#x27;t t n anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! It smells amazing and leaves my hair feeling very soft! Only downside is that they are a little oily so people with oily hair should be wary.</li>
            <li> Uhm... I think it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this shampoo, After her aunt and her mom smelled it they bought some for themselves.</li>
