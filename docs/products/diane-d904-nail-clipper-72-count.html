            <li>72 exactly.. nice quality for the price.  </li>
            <li>The great price helped us be able to buy more clippers and send more kits.</li>
            <li>Thought they would be cheaply made but are good clippers</li>
            <li>The clippers came in a nice container which was easy to store until we needed them.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better quality but these suit my purposes.  </li>
            <li>The clippers themselves work really well, so we&#x27;re happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>we seem to have too many needs for those...</li>
            <li>So happy to have ordered them and thanks in part to you</li>
            <li>Much better than the 99 cent ones from the store and a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>With the ability to have clippers everywhere, my nails are nice and clean, and getting longer.  </li>
            <li>Joke or no joke, these are pretty good clippers.  </li>
            <li>Works great for sending in &amp;#34;Relief Supply Kits&amp;#34;; quality as good as what I buy locally but 72 count means I won&#x27;t be searching for these every time we get ready to send of a package of 20 relief kits!</li>
            <li>Received very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was very glad to see that they do a nice job of clipping nails with no rough edges.  </li>
            <li>These clippers work fine.  </li>
            <li>They are a nice size but not as large as some nail clips I have used.  </li>
            <li>My nails are brittle and always snagging at things, so I like to have clippers available everywhere.</li>
            <li>the clippers are smaller than they look but they work great</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem cheap at all.</li>
            <li>These work great for basic nail clippers.</li>
            <li>Many many many many many sharp nail clippers.</li>
            <li>and, it gave me a wonderful item to give away in small gifts.</li>
            <li>They cut clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are good basic fingernail clippers that get the job done.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat this price and the quality is not bad either.</li>
            <li>Was received quickly.  </li>
            <li>Because of the low price, we were able to make more health kits with the money we had.</li>
            <li>These are really quality clippers and such a great price.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly, well packaged, as described.</li>
            <li>They definitely work best on naked nails.</li>
            <li>at any rate the clippers were well packaged, just the right size, included a nail file and were not as flimsy as easy to fall apart as Trim brand nail clippers and the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>The clippers work well with a nice snap, and the pin-hook holding the lever is stronger than on many other cheap clippers where it tends to bend with more than moderate pressure.</li>
            <li>These are great little clippers.</li>
            <li>I want these for an event because I wanted fresh clippers for each customer as I wasn&#x27;t going to sterilize them there.  </li>
            <li>Even the storage bin is nice enough to use as-is.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t work well for adult toenails but are okay for fingernails.</li>
            <li>It is as good as could be expected.  </li>
            <li>many nail clippers, I am filled with such joy,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but the price was right for adding them to sample bags.</li>
            <li>The small file is a nice touch, though I prefer longer files with a more sandy texture.&lt;br /&gt;Nice, sturdy clippers.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great little clippers!  </li>
            <li>and I love having extra, quick delivery</li>
            <li>The clippers are good quality and the price per item is much less than I&#x27;ve seen anywhere else.</li>
            <li>Nice as any single pack that you find in the stores.</li>
            <li>So, I bought a giant tub of them :-)</li>
            <li>Exactly as listed.</li>
            <li>Will consider buying more next year.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased for a much higher price.</li>
            <li>Thanks Diane!</li>
            <li>When I first shopped them they were $35 for the tub of 72.  </li>
            <li>these are pretty damned high-quality nail clippers for about a quarter each.</li>
            <li>Very helpful!</li>
            <li>I got them because I am a Jamberry Nails Independent Consultant and they are good for parties and favors, but I would definitely use them myself too!</li>
            <li>The tub of 72 is a good heavy tub that will last you a good long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I put a ribbon about 12&amp;#34; long through the hole so it can be hung on my gear shift in my car or found easily in my purse.</li>
            <li>I have enough for a lifetime, but the price was right!</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical that these were going to be of good quality, but they are surprisingly well made.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>I bought these as a joke, and from a little frustration of never being able to find a pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li>like normal nail clippers to me.  </li>
            <li>They are sharp and work just fine.</li>
            <li>It always seems like I&#x27;m purchasing new clippers every couple of months as they somehow seem to disappear from my desk.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not flimsy or cheap, but basic, standard size clippers.  </li>
            <li>they seem to work so far!</li>
            <li>I was also glad that they have the small hole where you can attach it to a keychain if you like.</li>
            <li>soon as I saw these, I realized they are the same ones I had years ago as a teen, and then in more recent years.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and clip cleanly.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sharp and give a clean cut.</li>
            <li>So far used five clippers, they all worked well.</li>
            <li>Now I can supply my whole neighborhood for the cost of a dozen clippers at the local drug store!!</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well these were made for the price of the lot.</li>
            <li>I tried a different one for each nail and they all worked very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are much better than the ones I’ve been getting at the drug store lately.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price, but they are very sturdy and sharp.</li>
            <li>They all seem to be sharp and have a nice firm punch.  </li>
            <li>Decent quality for extremely low price per unit.</li>
            <li>I put some on my key chains and in the random places I usually look for them and gave some away and still have many put away for safe keeping!</li>
            <li>They do not come apart when you twist them for use, and are pretty sharp.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sorta cheap, but since it&#x27;s steel, it&#x27;s sort of hard to screw that up, and thus they&#x27;re perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t caused any issues, I just wash my hands after using (which you should be doing anyway - all that dirt hiding under your nails is out in the open now).</li>
            <li>nails are pretty normal not banged up not too thick not too thin.&lt;br /&gt;Gets</li>
            <li>Sharp, plenty of clippers, and much much cheaper than buying individually.</li>
            <li>I rarely leave reviews for anything because I&#x27;m lazy, BUT...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to a cheap chrome covering or actual metal bits from manufacturing.</li>
            <li>I have decided to reorder, as these will make great stocking stuffers, and small thank you gifts, especially for a guy, which I seem to have a hard time picking up small items for.  </li>

            <li> I bought these as a joke, and from a little frustration of never being able to find a pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li> like normal nail clippers to me.  </li>
            <li> They are sharp and work just fine.</li>
            <li> It always seems like I&#x27;m purchasing new clippers every couple of months as they somehow seem to disappear from my desk.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not flimsy or cheap, but basic, standard size clippers.  </li>
            <li> they seem to work so far!</li>
            <li> I was also glad that they have the small hole where you can attach it to a keychain if you like.</li>
            <li> soon as I saw these, I realized they are the same ones I had years ago as a teen, and then in more recent years.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and clip cleanly.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp and give a clean cut.</li>
            <li> So far used five clippers, they all worked well.</li>
            <li> Now I can supply my whole neighborhood for the cost of a dozen clippers at the local drug store!!</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well these were made for the price of the lot.</li>
            <li> I tried a different one for each nail and they all worked very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are much better than the ones I’ve been getting at the drug store lately.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price, but they are very sturdy and sharp.</li>
            <li> They all seem to be sharp and have a nice firm punch.  </li>
            <li> Decent quality for extremely low price per unit.</li>
            <li> I put some on my key chains and in the random places I usually look for them and gave some away and still have many put away for safe keeping!</li>
            <li> They do not come apart when you twist them for use, and are pretty sharp.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sorta cheap, but since it&#x27;s steel, it&#x27;s sort of hard to screw that up, and thus they&#x27;re perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t caused any issues, I just wash my hands after using (which you should be doing anyway - all that dirt hiding under your nails is out in the open now).</li>
            <li> nails are pretty normal not banged up not too thick not too thin.&lt;br /&gt;Gets</li>
            <li> Sharp, plenty of clippers, and much much cheaper than buying individually.</li>
            <li> I rarely leave reviews for anything because I&#x27;m lazy, BUT...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to a cheap chrome covering or actual metal bits from manufacturing.</li>
            <li> I have decided to reorder, as these will make great stocking stuffers, and small thank you gifts, especially for a guy, which I seem to have a hard time picking up small items for.  </li>
            <li> Not super high quality</li>
            <li> The clippers work well, the file is a little small, but for the price I cannot really complain much.</li>
            <li> There is a little file with a curved end to clean underneath fingernails that can be rotated out and there is a hole on the end or the clippers so they can be placed on a keychain or small hook.  </li>
            <li> They are MUCH better quality than the last bulk batch I got and they are less expensive.  </li>
            <li> We pack shoebox gifts for Operation Christmas Child, and, part of that, my husband makes small fishing kits for older boys&#x27; boxes.  </li>
            <li> These 72 nail clippers went a long way to helping us make the kits.  </li>
            <li> and I expect to have extras to give away and plenty to stock all our drawers for a long time to come.  </li>
            <li> Specifically, I put 10 fingernail clippers into my desk drawer, and less than two years later they&#x27;re ALL GONE.</li>
            <li> They were just what I expected and worked well.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback is that these guys are a little small, which makes them hard to hold when you have large hands.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!  </li>
            <li> They are not fancy, but they are sharp and work quite well.  </li>
            <li> They are just a sharp and work just as well as the one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I purchased these clippers to distribute along with other items, in gift bags.  </li>
            <li> But given the price, these are hard to beat, given the price of a single set elsewhere.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t let me down!</li>
            <li> I am a Jamberry independent consultant and these clippers have a little bit of a hard time cutting through the Jamberry wrap and my natural nail.</li>
            <li> My wife and I kept having trouble finding the nail clippers, so I bought this bowl of 72 clippers as a joke</li>
            <li> I will never have trouble finding a set of clippers again.</li>
            <li> Well it was because I never could find the few pair of clippers we have.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp, and now I&#x27;ll never run out!</li>
            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t bad and they&#x27;re very inexpensive compared to other Nail Clippers.</li>
            <li> Small to handle but work well.</li>
            <li> No more, where is the nail clipper?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never need to buy another pair of clippers, or look too hard for one.</li>
            <li> This bucket of 72 fingernail clippers solves that problem, at least for a while.  </li>
            <li> At least whoever is stealing my clippers is going to be taking inexpensive ones from now on.</li>
            <li> I got tired of constantly having my clippers taken, breaking them, and/or losing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After paying $3.00 EACH for bad quality clippers at the drug store every few weeks</li>
            <li> Grooming and self care, when things are tough it can be so helpful.</li>
            <li> I was tired of looking for nail clippers around the house.  </li>
            <li> Tired of looking for affordable nail clippers when they are lost from pockets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get a few years off from my dirty rotten black-hearted family stealing my clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got tired of not knowing where my nail clippers had run off to!</li>
            <li> Who can truly go wrong with nail clippers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After cutting your nail it gives them a weird jagged edge.</li>
            <li> I hate when I lose or can not find nail clippers.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very nice product. Would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Nail clippers break on me all the time, and I can&#x27;t seem to keep them where I need them. So, I bought a giant tub of them :-)</li>
            <li> Decent quality for extremely low price per unit. I always carry Nail Clippers and they often fall out of my pocket so I got these. The quality isn&#x27;t bad and they&#x27;re very inexpensive compared to other Nail Clippers. Now I always can find clippers...</li>
            <li> We purchased these to put in backpacks we were putting together for the homeless. They seemed to be good quality and fit our purpose perfectly.</li>
            <li> Works great for sending in &amp;#34;Relief Supply Kits&amp;#34;; quality as good as what I buy locally but 72 count means I won&#x27;t be searching for these every time we get ready to send of a package of 20 relief kits!</li>
            <li> Great price, and they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Exactly as listed. They work like they should work. A great value.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected!  I want these for an event because I wanted fresh clippers for each customer as I wasn&#x27;t going to sterilize them there.  They were just what I expected and worked well.  Well made.</li>
            <li> I was tired of looking for nail clippers around the house.  Kids would &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; them and I wouldn&#x27;t get them back.  I decided to purchase these based on the reviews that were posted. I was worried about quality and sharpness.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.  They are of good quality.  I&#x27;ve had better quality but these suit my purposes.  They are sharp and clip cleanly.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.  Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Great price and product.  Was received quickly.  Will consider buying more next year.  I got these to pack in Operation Christmas Child shoeboxes.</li>
            <li> Tired of looking for affordable nail clippers when they are lost from pockets. Bought these at a good price and haven&#x27;t had to looks for affordable clippers for a while. THEY WORK WELL. ALSO.</li>
            <li> Wife picked these up, now with 5 kids and a careless husband, there are still more than enough clippers around! They cut clean.</li>
            <li> These area actually very nice nail clippers. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much for the price, but they are very sturdy and sharp. Nice as any single pack that you find in the stores.</li>
            <li> My wife and I kept having trouble finding the nail clippers, so I bought this bowl of 72 clippers as a joke so we would never run out of clippers. Joke or no joke, these are pretty good clippers.  They are not fancy, but they are sharp and work quite well.  Now we have good, functional nail clippers in every bathroom, the kitchen &amp;#34;junk&amp;#34; drawer, desk drawers and cars.  I would definitely buy again, but will probably never need to do so!</li>
            <li> I am using these for a humanitarian project was so pleased to find them in bulk at a great price. They arrived yesterday and I was very satisfied with the quality. They are just a sharp and work just as well as the one&#x27;s I have purchased for a much higher price. I have decided to reorder, as these will make great stocking stuffers, and small thank you gifts, especially for a guy, which I seem to have a hard time picking up small items for.  Thanks Diane!</li>
            <li> I will never have trouble finding a set of clippers again. They&#x27;re sharp and give a clean cut. The only drawback is that these guys are a little small, which makes them hard to hold when you have large hands.</li>
            <li> I gave these to my brother as a gift. Not the best quality out there. After cutting your nail it gives them a weird jagged edge.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal! The clippers work well with a nice snap, and the pin-hook holding the lever is stronger than on many other cheap clippers where it tends to bend with more than moderate pressure. All 72 clippers were in the bin. Even the storage bin is nice enough to use as-is. These should last years.</li>
            <li> they seem to work so far!</li>
            <li> Great service project item.</li>
            <li> I have a problem.  My family can&#x27;t leave my stuff along.  Specifically, I put 10 fingernail clippers into my desk drawer, and less than two years later they&#x27;re ALL GONE. This bucket of 72 fingernail clippers solves that problem, at least for a while.  I gave them each a handful with instructions to leave the ones in my desk drawer alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are good basic fingernail clippers that get the job done.  They&#x27;re not flimsy or cheap, but basic, standard size clippers.  The tub of 72 is a good heavy tub that will last you a good long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully I&#x27;ll get a few years off from my dirty rotten black-hearted family stealing my clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware; the price on these fluctuates.  When I first shopped them they were $35 for the tub of 72.  Then I looked later and it was only $21.  Keep your eye on it over a matter of weeks and you&#x27;ll get the best price.  I paid $21.</li>
            <li> I purchased these clippers to distribute along with other items, in gift bags.  I was very happy with the quality  of the clippers.  I was also glad that they have the small hole where you can attach it to a keychain if you like. I would definitely recommend these clippers.</li>
            <li> I hate when I lose or can not find nail clippers.  Now I have all that I will ever need for the rest of my life.  They are sharp and work just fine.</li>
            <li> I got tired of constantly having my clippers taken, breaking them, and/or losing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After paying $3.00 EACH for bad quality clippers at the drug store every few weeks I decided to buy a box. They didn&#x27;t let me down! Great quality, great &#x27;spring&#x27; in them, and very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Sharp, plenty of clippers, and much much cheaper than buying individually. Which depends on the current Amazon price of course. One detraction for the item is it leaves tiny metallic specks on my fingers after using. I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to a cheap chrome covering or actual metal bits from manufacturing. So far it hasn&#x27;t caused any issues, I just wash my hands after using (which you should be doing anyway - all that dirt hiding under your nails is out in the open now).</li>
            <li> Received very quickly.  Great product at a cheap price.  Giveaway at fishing tourney.  Something simple fisherman use and appreciate.  Attached to bungee cord with clip.</li>
            <li> We put these in health kits for missions. I have not used them so I don&#x27;t know how they perform. The price was great and I would buy them again for health kits.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product when you have a large family and the nail clippers can never be found. The clippers work well, the file is a little small, but for the price I cannot really complain much. I put some on my key chains and in the random places I usually look for them and gave some away and still have many put away for safe keeping!</li>
            <li> I rarely leave reviews for anything because I&#x27;m lazy, BUT... these are pretty damned high-quality nail clippers for about a quarter each. They&#x27;re sorta cheap, but since it&#x27;s steel, it&#x27;s sort of hard to screw that up, and thus they&#x27;re perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus if you&#x27;re like me you lose your nail clippers CONSTANTLY. Now I&#x27;ll never have to worry again.</li>
            <li> My nails are brittle and always snagging at things, so I like to have clippers available everywhere. These are very sharp, and now I&#x27;ll never run out! I keep some in my purse, as they make wonderful portable emergency scissors.</li>
            <li> the clippers are smaller than they look but they work great</li>
            <li> The family is thrilled and I&#x27;m never going to be without clippers again.</li>
            <li> Small to handle but work well.</li>
            <li> Purchased to add to Operation Christmas Child shoeboxes that we are making to send to children in need all over the world. They are the perfect compact size for children. They don&#x27;t work well for adult toenails but are okay for fingernails.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy for umcor health kits.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent quality and price for umcor health kits.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what we needed. We pack shoebox gifts for Operation Christmas Child, and, part of that, my husband makes small fishing kits for older boys&#x27; boxes.  These 72 nail clippers went a long way to helping us make the kits.  The clippers came in a nice container which was easy to store until we needed them.  The clippers themselves work really well, so we&#x27;re happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered 2 containers of these to be used as part of a health kit sent to disaster areas all over the world. The great price helped us be able to buy more clippers and send more kits. Thank you!</li>
            <li> These clippers work fine.  The price was great and I expect to have extras to give away and plenty to stock all our drawers for a long time to come.  I was very glad to see that they do a nice job of clipping nails with no rough edges.  They are a nice size but not as large as some nail clips I have used.  They all seem to be sharp and have a nice firm punch.  There is a little file with a curved end to clean underneath fingernails that can be rotated out and there is a hole on the end or the clippers so they can be placed on a keychain or small hook.  I put a ribbon about 12&amp;#34; long through the hole so it can be hung on my gear shift in my car or found easily in my purse.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that these were going to be of good quality, but they are surprisingly well made. They don&#x27;t seem cheap at all. I got them because I am a Jamberry Nails Independent Consultant and they are good for parties and favors, but I would definitely use them myself too!</li>
            <li> I have 4 children and I love having extra, quick delivery</li>
            <li> Great buy and great clippers!!!  Purchased for give-aways with Jamberry</li>
            <li> Thought they would be cheaply made but are good clippers</li>
            <li> If you need a lot of clippers for any reason, this is a great deal. The clippers are good quality and the price per item is much less than I&#x27;ve seen anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I ordered these nail clippers to include in kits for Church World Service.  They will be used for victims of disaster and those in need....we seem to have too many needs for those...at any rate the clippers were well packaged, just the right size, included a nail file and were not as flimsy as easy to fall apart as Trim brand nail clippers and the price is very reasonable.  So happy to have ordered them and thanks in part to you 50 Health Kits were submitted.</li>
            <li> Happy with product...fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a joke, and from a little frustration of never being able to find a pair of clippers.  They&#x27;re great little clippers!  Much better than the 99 cent ones from the store and a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Our church collects items for health kits to distribute to disaster victims.  A clipper is required for the kits.  Because of the low price, we were able to make more health kits with the money we had.</li>
            <li> These are really quality clippers and such a great price.  Good conversation piece too.</li>
            <li> Worked well for baby shower guest gift bag.</li>
            <li> Great for our Jamberry Nails orders.</li>
            <li> These may not be the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever bought, but they are pretty good for the price. It always seems like I&#x27;m purchasing new clippers every couple of months as they somehow seem to disappear from my desk. At least whoever is stealing my clippers is going to be taking inexpensive ones from now on.</li>
            <li> Did I need 72 nail clippers? The answer is no. But given the price, these are hard to beat, given the price of a single set elsewhere. I will probably never need to buy another set for quite a while. Not super high quality but I will give them a 5 star rating anyways, they do the job. And at @ 24 cents apiece how can you lose.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly, well packaged, as described. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Built bags to give to the homeless.  Very helpful!</li>
            <li> Whatever happens in my life I have the disappearing nail clipper issue solved.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t the best nail clippers out there but the price was right for adding them to sample bags. I am a Jamberry independent consultant and these clippers have a little bit of a hard time cutting through the Jamberry wrap and my natural nail. They definitely work best on naked nails.</li>
            <li> Yes, you&#x27;ve probably guessed it. I got tired of not knowing where my nail clippers had run off to! That, and, it gave me a wonderful item to give away in small gifts. Who can truly go wrong with nail clippers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as I saw these, I realized they are the same ones I had years ago as a teen, and then in more recent years. The small file is a nice touch, though I prefer longer files with a more sandy texture.&lt;br /&gt;Nice, sturdy clippers. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the quantity and price. They&#x27;re very good.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> It saved my marriage.  jk love you honey!</li>
            <li> Good price, good clippers</li>
            <li> Very nice for the price.  Needed them to ship with our personal care kits for World Relief and we are shipping around 80 kits this year so this helped out a lot with our budget.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> These are surprisingly good quality clippers for the price.  They are MUCH better quality than the last bulk batch I got and they are less expensive.  They do not come apart when you twist them for use, and are pretty sharp.  I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t beat this price and the quality is not bad either. I was doing 40 manicure kits as shower favors and needed a lot of clippers for not a lot of money. This was a great buy.</li>
            <li> Many many many many many sharp nail clippers. My wife will never find that the kids have stolen all the nail clippers again.</li>
            <li> This is another item&lt;br /&gt;I send to our food bank.  Grooming and self care, when things are tough it can be so helpful.</li>
            <li> It is as good as could be expected.  So far used five clippers, they all worked well.</li>
            <li> Now I can supply my whole neighborhood for the cost of a dozen clippers at the local drug store!!</li>
            <li> I bought these (based on several recommendations) to include in our Operation Christmas Child shoe box gifts.  They appear to be sturdy and not something prone to break within a very short period of time.  I believe they&#x27;ll be a nice addition to the &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34; items for boys and girls.</li>
            <li> Purchased to donate to a local shelter. These work great for basic nail clippers. I was surprised how well these were made for the price of the lot.</li>
            <li> These are great little clippers. I tried a different one for each nail and they all worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;These are much better than the ones I’ve been getting at the drug store lately.</li>
            <li> I have enough for a lifetime, but the price was right!</li>
            <li> Perfect for a mission project.</li>
            <li> Time is money...I have ten in each drawer now. I&#x27;ll never need to buy another pair of clippers, or look too hard for one.</li>
            <li> Finally I can put fingernail clippers everywhere and not have to go searching for some. I find myself biting or peeling a piece of fingernail off often and it never ends well. Well it was because I never could find the few pair of clippers we have. This sure solved that problem! They are good quality too, I was impressed when I first tried them.</li>
            <li> 72 exactly.. nice quality for the price.  No more, where is the nail clipper?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails are pretty normal not banged up not too thick not too thin.&lt;br /&gt;Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Twas a week before Christmas, when all through the drawer,&lt;br /&gt;Not a nail clipper in sight, do I go to the store?&lt;br /&gt;The thought of battling crowds was a tad bit too much,&lt;br /&gt;Instead off to Amazon, where you buy things with one touch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched for nail clippers and found listings a many,&lt;br /&gt;What amount do I want? One? Three? Five? Or TWENTY??&lt;br /&gt;I looked at the price and read each review,&lt;br /&gt;Then settled on the pack of Seventy-two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So many nail clippers, I am filled with such joy,&lt;br /&gt;I feel like a Christmas kid opening their toy!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like you to have one, and share my delight.&lt;br /&gt;Merry Christmas to all, and to all a well groomed night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seem like normal nail clippers to me.  I&#x27;m quite happy, and my family seemed happy with theirs too.</li>
            <li> I must have my fingernails neatly clipped, or I tend to bite them.  Yes, I know, yuck.  With the ability to have clippers everywhere, my nails are nice and clean, and getting longer.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> Have and will buy again!!</li>
