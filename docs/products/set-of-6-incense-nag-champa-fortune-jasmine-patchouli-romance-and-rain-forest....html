            <li>AMAZING SET!</li>

            <li>great way to get a sample and pick a winner before buying ALOT more!</li>
            <li>The scents are so delightful and I am a HUGE fan of incense.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>Now the Patchouli smelled good while burning as did the Nag Champa</li>
            <li>but the ones that do smell good?</li>
            <li>Will leave a room smelling good for hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of most patchouli scents, but this one is actually good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect when I&#x27;m in the mood for incense, but nothing too sweet.</li>
            <li>I still have an adequate supply and the smell and quality is superb.</li>
            <li>These incense are fantastic, they all smell great and burn even.  </li>
            <li>Smells amazing and calming.</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with amazon.com and all products ever purchased, have been good quality.  </li>
            <li>and that was nice</li>
            <li>And if you&#x27;ve ever smelled patchouli and loved it and have never been able to find that patchouli again, try this because it might be that this is the one you remember.    </li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t impressed with any of the fragrances in this set.</li>
            <li>Nice to burn after work to relax you.</li>
            <li>nice variety pack.  </li>
            <li>34;CHASE YOU OUTTA THE HOUSE&amp;#34;, I did however find an aquantance that liked the scents, so I gave them for Christmas.</li>
            <li>loved most all the sents</li>
            <li>Nice incense collection.</li>
            <li>This smells like jasmine, and it is very strong.</li>
            <li>Romance - I smell mostly synthetic, perfumey rose.</li>
            <li>some of the security tags were not secured though,  the baggies inside the box were great because you could re-close them to keep them fresh</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of refreshing.    </li>
            <li>I liked it better when burning it together with Satya Sai Baba&#x27;s Celestial.)    </li>
            <li>These incense sticks are by far THE BEST out there!  </li>
            <li>This incense is STRONG!</li>
            <li>These are some strong incense aromas!</li>
            <li>Has a pack of NagC and its some good quality sticks, burns for a while with decent smoke and doesnt fall apart, good stuff.</li>
            <li>They light up really easy and smell really good</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and would highly recommend it for anyone looking for good incense.</li>
            <li>This sampler box was ok.</li>
            <li>B0016D4RQS Set of 6 Incense Nag Champa Sunrise Sandalwood Midnight Patchouli Celestial By Satya]] is a much better sampling of Satya&#x27;s flavors.     </li>
            <li>This is probably the most famous incense of all time.</li>
            <li>To my nose it&#x27;s earthy with exotic spices and vanilla.</li>
            <li>This would be a great gift for that person you really don&#x27;t like...    </li>
            <li>My favorite of all the scents in this sampler.</li>
            <li>I think Song of Sudan incense are better smelling,</li>
            <li>the rainforest and regular nag champa has to be the best incense i have ever smelled bar none.   </li>
            <li>lol You can&#x27;t do to much when they are &amp;#34;too weak&amp;#34; but burn more.</li>
            <li>and I keep finding myself grabbing one of those over these mostly because of the burn</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand of incense....</li>
            <li>add to your cart now!!! :)</li>
            <li>I love buying incense in packs like this.</li>
            <li>Excellent selection of 6 different fragrance experiences.</li>
            <li>It is an appropriate fragrance for a lady&#x27;s boudoir.</li>
            <li>Try this if you really love the smell of jasmine.</li>
            <li>I love this incense, the scents are awesome and I will be ordering more shortly!</li>
            <li>If you love incense, this is the package for you.</li>
            <li>in the end most are too perfume.</li>
            <li>Love nag champa scents.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found many satya scents I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Incense.</li>
            <li>I love ordering my incense from this company.</li>
            <li>and I love the variety.</li>
            <li>my favorite incense makers..</li>
            <li>but even those smell pretty good in comparison.  </li>
            <li>These incenses smell wonderful and burn for a long time.  </li>
            <li>For the price you pay for these, you get a lot of incense and they all smell pretty good.</li>
            <li>really helps scent up a room pleasantly.</li>
            <li>These are pretty strong incense and are good for hiding smells.</li>
            <li>one of the scents is very sweet (but i threw the package away before i could find the name of it).</li>
            <li>It smells great, but make sure you have a window open.</li>
            <li>but both did not have the strong scent I am used to from Satya.</li>
            <li>But these were packaged all together and smelled strongly of soap....</li>
            <li>and ha dthey not smelled sooooo strongly of soap</li>
            <li>I like all my incense to be strong</li>
            <li>I like jasmine, but this one was a bit too strong for me.</li>
            <li>Not as good as homemade incense but decent as a backup after you&#x27;ve already purchased them.</li>
            <li>Each incense is of high quality and provides a fair amount of scented smoke.</li>
            <li>fast shipping very pleased w product</li>
            <li>I only liked about two of the smells, but even the ones I liked were somewhat overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very strong, but it is very pure, so it won&#x27;t give you that feeling like you need to cough.</li>
            <li>Most of the vendors selling this on Amazon will offer it with Super Saver Shipping.    </li>
            <li>this set is a little sweeter scented...but perfect in every way....</li>
            <li>I light the incense downstairs and let the scent drift upstairs.</li>
            <li>This allows me to enjoy and critique on all levels.</li>
            <li>When my family started trickling in they all commented on the cheap perfume smell.</li>
            <li>of the 6 types i enjoy 5 of them.  </li>
            <li>(yes I time them, lol), I will be sticking with Supper Hits (my understanding they are made by the same company).</li>
            <li>A scent you can enjoy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the boxes are smaller than i thought but still a great product</li>
            <li>I most likely would have loved them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more very soon :}</li>
            <li>This is a very nice multi pack of different smells.</li>
            <li>But the other 5 were great smelling and really strong.</li>
            <li>Bought these for a very decent price and in my opinion some are okay</li>
            <li>nothing special</li>
            <li>burns well and long, fresh this year stamped and make my house smell great for a loong time.   </li>
            <li>I really like this one and will continue to purchase more.    </li>
            <li>However, for a floral it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>I wish these were the same quality as their Super Hits.&lt;br /&gt;The boxes were in good condition for given as gifts for friends (the super hits box I got wasn&#x27;t)</li>
            <li>the shipping was quick</li>
            <li>love these scents b/c they cannot be found where i currently reside unless i travel home ty :}</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased it to try out some new scents, but [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This is a soft, almost powdery fragrance with a rosy top note and a sweet bottom note that might be sandalwood and vanilla.</li>
            <li>I like this one just as much!!</li>
            <li>We liked the romance so much we ordered 3 more single packs of it.</li>
            <li>I would burn this on rare occasion.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>and I love the natural ones like this.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price difference for me.</li>
            <li>My favorite incense by far.</li>
            <li>all worth the try.</li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of pinon incense, only spicier.    </li>
            <li>My favorite so far is the Jasmine and Patchouli</li>
            <li>scent was far too overwhelming and gave me a headache</li>
            <li>This sampler is a good buy if you want to try out some of Satya Sai Baba&#x27;s other offerings.</li>
            <li>Price was right too.</li>
            <li>Came right away, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>These are all very strong, and burn for a long time.</li>
            <li>I love this set of incense not only because it includes Nag Champa</li>
            <li>The nice thing about this is we can smell the incense at full strength (downstairs) all the way to barely perceptible (opposite end of house upstairs).</li>
            <li>After having enjoyed the Nag Champa Sunrise Sandalwood Midnight Patchouli Celestial set, I wanted to try these different scents from Satya.</li>
            <li>If only I could pick a favorite.</li>
            <li>talk about the real deal!  </li>
            <li>romantic is my favorite.</li>
            <li>First I have to state this,  </li>
            <li>They burn pretty short, but are so potent, it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>I love incense, used it for a LONG time.</li>
            <li>This multiple scent pack is a great way to try other Satya fragances.</li>
            <li>Only reason for the one star less is as these are some great incense sticks, but just not the aromas for me.</li>
            <li>Thanks again.</li>
            <li>You may be wondering why I&#x27;m telling you all this, but it is relevant later in the review....    </li>
            <li>I thought perhaps the cheap floral aroma would mellow as it made it&#x27;s way to the opposite end of the upstairs.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really into incense</li>
            <li>It smells too much like a women&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the price here.</li>
            <li>; if they are &amp;#34;too strong&amp;#34; than just don&#x27;t burn the whole incense and you will also save money, or don&#x27;t sit o close to them.</li>
            <li>I do whole</li>
            <li>It is intense.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like any of these except the nag champs blue original.</li>
            <li>I usually buy four of the six fragrances (Nag Champa, Fortune, Jasmine, and Patchouli) in another brand, and to be honest, these just aren&#x27;t as fragrant as the ones I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li>That black smoke was more than a bit off putting to me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly like all of the odors</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not as partial to this 6 pack of Satya Sai Baba incense as I am to the other 6 pack, but I like them a good deal.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s personal opinion, and some of the sticks did have a burn smell strong enough to cover the dipped scents.</li>
            <li>I was going to use these to test a new exhaust fan I installed in my bathroom.</li>
            <li>These smell better than the cheap stuff I&#x27;ve been buying randomly.  </li>
            <li>They are very natural</li>
            <li>There were a few packages with new wrapping and different types of sticks that burning heavier and they definitely weren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The scents are exactly as described for about 1/3 the price the single box packs would normally run.</li>
            <li>Clean burning, won&#x27;t turn black when lighting, I like.</li>
            <li>I never entertained this type of item before and was really surprised by the quality of the scents.  </li>
            <li>reminds me of some old school music stores like Vintage Vinyl in St. Louis.  </li>
            <li>didnt really like it, because they all smelled about the same.</li>
            <li>was reading they have another sample group like this one, when the ones I have are near gone</li>
            <li>Nag Champa is by far</li>
            <li>These are a bit more expensive but are well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Next I will older the 12 pack</li>
            <li>heartly suggest this particular collection, only to get a feel of the scents offered.  </li>
            <li>This is on the masculine side, but barely so.</li>
            <li>: This is a great resiny fragrance with a very woody base.</li>
            <li>The red box smells SO gross and seriously lingers for days but the pink and green boxes smell INCREDIBLE.</li>
            <li>We live in a single story home with a finished walk-out basement that has an open staircase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scents are fine a little better than less expensive ones but incense are a hit and miss and that is why you need to try all of them,  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> and I keep finding myself grabbing one of those over these mostly because of the burn</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of incense....</li>
            <li> add to your cart now!!! :)</li>
            <li> I love buying incense in packs like this.</li>
            <li> Excellent selection of 6 different fragrance experiences.</li>
            <li> It is an appropriate fragrance for a lady&#x27;s boudoir.</li>
            <li> Try this if you really love the smell of jasmine.</li>
            <li> I love this incense, the scents are awesome and I will be ordering more shortly!</li>
            <li> If you love incense, this is the package for you.</li>
            <li> in the end most are too perfume.</li>
            <li> Love nag champa scents.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found many satya scents I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Incense.</li>
            <li> I love ordering my incense from this company.</li>
            <li> and I love the variety.</li>
            <li> my favorite incense makers..</li>
            <li> but even those smell pretty good in comparison.  </li>
            <li> These incenses smell wonderful and burn for a long time.  </li>
            <li> For the price you pay for these, you get a lot of incense and they all smell pretty good.</li>
            <li> really helps scent up a room pleasantly.</li>
            <li> These are pretty strong incense and are good for hiding smells.</li>
            <li> one of the scents is very sweet (but i threw the package away before i could find the name of it).</li>
            <li> It smells great, but make sure you have a window open.</li>
            <li> but both did not have the strong scent I am used to from Satya.</li>
            <li> But these were packaged all together and smelled strongly of soap....</li>
            <li> and ha dthey not smelled sooooo strongly of soap</li>
            <li> I like all my incense to be strong</li>
            <li> I like jasmine, but this one was a bit too strong for me.</li>
            <li> Not as good as homemade incense but decent as a backup after you&#x27;ve already purchased them.</li>
            <li> Each incense is of high quality and provides a fair amount of scented smoke.</li>
            <li> fast shipping very pleased w product</li>
            <li> I only liked about two of the smells, but even the ones I liked were somewhat overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> The scent is very strong, but it is very pure, so it won&#x27;t give you that feeling like you need to cough.</li>
            <li> Most of the vendors selling this on Amazon will offer it with Super Saver Shipping.    </li>
            <li> this set is a little sweeter scented...but perfect in every way....</li>
            <li> I light the incense downstairs and let the scent drift upstairs.</li>
            <li> This allows me to enjoy and critique on all levels.</li>
            <li> When my family started trickling in they all commented on the cheap perfume smell.</li>
            <li> of the 6 types i enjoy 5 of them.  </li>
            <li> (yes I time them, lol), I will be sticking with Supper Hits (my understanding they are made by the same company).</li>
            <li> A scent you can enjoy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the boxes are smaller than i thought but still a great product</li>
            <li> I most likely would have loved them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering more very soon :}</li>
            <li> This is a very nice multi pack of different smells.</li>
            <li> But the other 5 were great smelling and really strong.</li>
            <li> Bought these for a very decent price and in my opinion some are okay</li>
            <li> nothing special</li>
            <li> burns well and long, fresh this year stamped and make my house smell great for a loong time.   </li>
            <li> I really like this one and will continue to purchase more.    </li>
            <li> However, for a floral it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I wish these were the same quality as their Super Hits.&lt;br /&gt;The boxes were in good condition for given as gifts for friends (the super hits box I got wasn&#x27;t)</li>
            <li> the shipping was quick</li>
            <li> love these scents b/c they cannot be found where i currently reside unless i travel home ty :}</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased it to try out some new scents, but [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This is a soft, almost powdery fragrance with a rosy top note and a sweet bottom note that might be sandalwood and vanilla.</li>
            <li> I like this one just as much!!</li>
            <li> We liked the romance so much we ordered 3 more single packs of it.</li>
            <li> I would burn this on rare occasion.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> and I love the natural ones like this.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price difference for me.</li>
            <li> My favorite incense by far.</li>
            <li> all worth the try.</li>
            <li> It kind of reminds me of pinon incense, only spicier.    </li>
            <li> My favorite so far is the Jasmine and Patchouli</li>
            <li> scent was far too overwhelming and gave me a headache</li>
            <li> This sampler is a good buy if you want to try out some of Satya Sai Baba&#x27;s other offerings.</li>
            <li> Price was right too.</li>
            <li> Came right away, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> These are all very strong, and burn for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this set of incense not only because it includes Nag Champa</li>
            <li> The nice thing about this is we can smell the incense at full strength (downstairs) all the way to barely perceptible (opposite end of house upstairs).</li>
            <li> After having enjoyed the Nag Champa Sunrise Sandalwood Midnight Patchouli Celestial set, I wanted to try these different scents from Satya.</li>
            <li> If only I could pick a favorite.</li>
            <li> talk about the real deal!  </li>
            <li> romantic is my favorite.</li>
            <li> First I have to state this,  </li>
            <li> They burn pretty short, but are so potent, it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> I love incense, used it for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> This multiple scent pack is a great way to try other Satya fragances.</li>
            <li> Only reason for the one star less is as these are some great incense sticks, but just not the aromas for me.</li>
            <li> Thanks again.</li>
            <li> You may be wondering why I&#x27;m telling you all this, but it is relevant later in the review....    </li>
            <li> I thought perhaps the cheap floral aroma would mellow as it made it&#x27;s way to the opposite end of the upstairs.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really into incense</li>
            <li> It smells too much like a women&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the price here.</li>
            <li> ; if they are &amp;#34;too strong&amp;#34; than just don&#x27;t burn the whole incense and you will also save money, or don&#x27;t sit o close to them.</li>
            <li> I do whole</li>
            <li> It is intense.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like any of these except the nag champs blue original.</li>
            <li> I usually buy four of the six fragrances (Nag Champa, Fortune, Jasmine, and Patchouli) in another brand, and to be honest, these just aren&#x27;t as fragrant as the ones I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> That black smoke was more than a bit off putting to me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly like all of the odors</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as partial to this 6 pack of Satya Sai Baba incense as I am to the other 6 pack, but I like them a good deal.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s personal opinion, and some of the sticks did have a burn smell strong enough to cover the dipped scents.</li>
            <li> I was going to use these to test a new exhaust fan I installed in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> These smell better than the cheap stuff I&#x27;ve been buying randomly.  </li>
            <li> They are very natural</li>
            <li> There were a few packages with new wrapping and different types of sticks that burning heavier and they definitely weren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The scents are exactly as described for about 1/3 the price the single box packs would normally run.</li>
            <li> Clean burning, won&#x27;t turn black when lighting, I like.</li>
            <li> I never entertained this type of item before and was really surprised by the quality of the scents.  </li>
            <li> reminds me of some old school music stores like Vintage Vinyl in St. Louis.  </li>
            <li> didnt really like it, because they all smelled about the same.</li>
            <li> was reading they have another sample group like this one, when the ones I have are near gone</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is by far</li>
            <li> These are a bit more expensive but are well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Next I will older the 12 pack</li>
            <li> heartly suggest this particular collection, only to get a feel of the scents offered.  </li>
            <li> This is on the masculine side, but barely so.</li>
            <li> : This is a great resiny fragrance with a very woody base.</li>
            <li> The red box smells SO gross and seriously lingers for days but the pink and green boxes smell INCREDIBLE.</li>
            <li> We live in a single story home with a finished walk-out basement that has an open staircase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scents are fine a little better than less expensive ones but incense are a hit and miss and that is why you need to try all of them,  </li>
            <li> The Fortune, Romance and Rain Forest put off a black smoke that I am sure is not good for me at all.</li>
            <li> They last long and the aromas stays throughout the room for hours to come after it burns out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but not great either.</li>
            <li> The price is okay for the ratio of good to bad sticks, thick and thin.</li>
            <li> I always get them on time if not early.</li>
            <li> They burn for a long time (1 hour or so).  </li>
            <li> In the past Satya had made such good products and now this I do so hope I just got a bad batch</li>
            <li> Dry and flaking away too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s earthy, mysterious, a little spice, and has a honey like sweetness to it.</li>
            <li> The classic blue box incense, a reliably high quality fragrance, you know what to expect and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.    </li>
            <li> Long lasting, heady, and just plain smells divine!</li>
            <li> some other stuff I can&#x27;t identify.</li>
            <li> I have ordered the other 6 pack before too...</li>
            <li> : I said this in my review for the other 6 pack, and I&#x27;ll say it again:</li>
            <li> Thought I would try some other scents but</li>
            <li> I average 40-60 minutes per stick.  </li>
            <li> They really fill the room with pleasurable smells without overdosing or smelly perfumey like the less expensive ones I used to buy at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> Hands down.</li>
            <li> One stick will scent about half my house.</li>
            <li> and they did not put off the black smoke</li>
            <li> dont get me wrong, there are a few that i am not real crazy about</li>
            <li> You can find these six packages of incense down in the waste container of our building if you need some...</li>
            <li> they were a little bit ripe in smell.</li>
            <li> A little smoky.</li>
            <li> The cologne aspect isn&#x27;t overpowering, nor is the celery (green note) so don&#x27;t be put off by my description.</li>
            <li> and it only gets worse.</li>
            <li> I started burning this a few minutes before everyone got home.</li>
            <li> Jasmine -Strong, overpowering, sickening floral</li>
            <li> And a few of the sticks had a hard time staying lit, even though there was very little humidity or wind that day.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect I read a lot of reviews before I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I usually use them during chakra balancing or mediation.</li>
            <li> I found the rainforest, romance and the jasmine a tad too overpowering for my small house</li>
            <li> I love the smell of incense, but these sticks are just smelling awful.</li>
            <li> My roommates hate me, but I&#x27;m so freaking calm from all this incense that I couldn&#x27;t give two hoots.</li>
            <li> (At least by itself.</li>
            <li> Burns slow.</li>
            <li> this stuff makes all of the other incense i used to burn look and smell like a bad imitation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Some are subtle and some may make you choke.</li>
            <li> sadly the pink romance box was a fail.  </li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong.</li>
            <li> but, sad to say I doubt it.</li>
            <li> The nag champa scent smelled like dirty armpits and made me gag.</li>
            <li> Slightly disappointing, shipping wasn&#x27;t the fastest either..</li>
            <li> These seem to be of inferior quality or (hopefully) just a bad batch.</li>
            <li> The perfume used for the smell makes them really bad - as if you are burning soap in the house.</li>
            <li> I am sadly disappointed with this collection of incense.</li>
            <li> Talk about being disappointed that would be me.</li>
            <li> hate to say this</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever smelled patchouli and hated it, try this and see if it changes your mind.</li>
            <li> Horrible smelling incense!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These are great incense. You can burn one and have the scent last all day. Unlike the pack of 500 that is sold on here. I just wish that they came in a larger lot.</li>
            <li> Did not get the ones i wante 😔</li>
            <li> I never entertained this type of item before and was really surprised by the quality of the scents.  Thanks again.</li>
            <li> I love this set of incense not only because it includes Nag Champa but it also gives variety so you can change what sticks your burning.</li>
            <li> This sampler box was ok. I&#x27;m glad I purchased it to try out some new scents, but [[ASIN:B0016D4RQS Set of 6 Incense Nag Champa Sunrise Sandalwood Midnight Patchouli Celestial By Satya]] is a much better sampling of Satya&#x27;s flavors.     We live in a single story home with a finished walk-out basement that has an open staircase. I light the incense downstairs and let the scent drift upstairs. The nice thing about this is we can smell the incense at full strength (downstairs) all the way to barely perceptible (opposite end of house upstairs). This allows me to enjoy and critique on all levels. You may be wondering why I&#x27;m telling you all this, but it is relevant later in the review....    Now on to the scents:    Nag Champa - This is probably the most famous incense of all time. To my nose it&#x27;s earthy with exotic spices and vanilla. It has a sweetness to it, but it&#x27;s not cloying in anyway. I detect practically no floral. This is medium strength. One stick will scent about half my house. I really like this one and will continue to purchase more.    Romance - I smell mostly synthetic, perfumey rose. However, for a floral it&#x27;s not bad. I can be in the same room with it and not be overwhelmed so that&#x27;s a good thing. It is of medium-high strength and scents about 3/4 of my house. I would burn this on rare occasion. Won&#x27;t buy again, but won&#x27;t throw it in the trash either.    Rain Forest - I like this scent. It&#x27;s earthy and aquatic at the same time. This incense definitely suits it&#x27;s name. Another medium strength scent. Will burn this on occasion and will buy again.    Fortune - Don&#x27;t quite know how to describe this one. It smells like men&#x27;s cologne mixed with celery and some other stuff I can&#x27;t identify. The cologne aspect isn&#x27;t overpowering, nor is the celery (green note) so don&#x27;t be put off by my description. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but not great either. I probably will give the rest of this box away. The scent is light-medium. Only smelled up one room upstairs.    Jasmine -Strong, overpowering, sickening floral and it only gets worse. I started burning this a few minutes before everyone got home. When my family started trickling in they all commented on the cheap perfume smell. I let the stick continue to burn only to have the upstairs end up smelling of urine. I thought perhaps the cheap floral aroma would mellow as it made it&#x27;s way to the opposite end of the upstairs. Well, I was wrong. Instead it smelled like someone (or alot of someones)had peed their pants and had been sitting in it for hours. It smelled like an outhouse upstairs and you needed a gas mask to go downstairs. This would be a great gift for that person you really don&#x27;t like...    Patchouli Forest - My favorite of all the scents in this sampler. I&#x27;m not a fan of most patchouli scents, but this one is actually good! It&#x27;s earthy, mysterious, a little spice, and has a honey like sweetness to it. This is on the masculine side, but barely so. Medium-high strength. It scents the upstairs well, but isn&#x27;t overpowering. Will be buying again obviously.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice multi pack of different smells. The rain forest and romance are my favorites. The wife even likes the overpowering jasmine one. We liked the romance so much we ordered 3 more single packs of it. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I am sadly disappointed with this collection of incense. After having enjoyed the Nag Champa Sunrise Sandalwood Midnight Patchouli Celestial set, I wanted to try these different scents from Satya. These seem to be of inferior quality or (hopefully) just a bad batch. I recommend the above mentioned set, hoping that they have not changed their quality standards for all their products.</li>
            <li> of the 6 types i enjoy 5 of them.  Has a pack of NagC and its some good quality sticks, burns for a while with decent smoke and doesnt fall apart, good stuff.</li>
            <li> Came right away, exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Talk about being disappointed that would be me. The Fortune, Romance and Rain Forest put off a black smoke that I am sure is not good for me at all. The Fortune smelled to me like starter fluid. Now the Patchouli smelled good while burning as did the Nag Champa and they did not put off the black smoke but both did not have the strong scent I am used to from Satya. I have not yet used the Jasmine. I just ordered the Set of 6 Incense Nag Champa Sunrise Sandalwood Midnight Patchouli Celestial By Satya to give it a try but, I am not hopeful. In the past Satya had made such good products and now this I do so hope I just got a bad batch but, sad to say I doubt it. That black smoke was more than a bit off putting to me.</li>
            <li> These are pretty strong incense and are good for hiding smells. The nag champa scent smelled like dirty armpits and made me gag. But the other 5 were great smelling and really strong. I think Song of Sudan incense are better smelling,</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with amazon.com and all products ever purchased, have been good quality.  Have a nice day !!!</li>
            <li> We use incense daily and I love the natural ones like this.  They really fill the room with pleasurable smells without overdosing or smelly perfumey like the less expensive ones I used to buy at the grocery store.  Worth the price difference for me.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really into incense but I know in the 60s they were a little bit ripe in smell. I was going to use these to test a new exhaust fan I installed in my bathroom. I have since replaced the regular scent articles you buy from the supermarket with 1 stick of incense every 3 to 5 days. It creates quite a different atmosphere.</li>
            <li> These incense are fantastic, they all smell great and burn even.  I am very pleased with this product and would highly recommend it for anyone looking for good incense.</li>
            <li> My favorite incense by far. There were a few packages with new wrapping and different types of sticks that burning heavier and they definitely weren&#x27;t as good.</li>
            <li> I average 40-60 minutes per stick.  These smell better than the cheap stuff I&#x27;ve been buying randomly.  I like the smokey aroma...reminds me of some old school music stores like Vintage Vinyl in St. Louis.  These are a bit more expensive but are well worth it.  If only I could pick a favorite.</li>
            <li> smells like incense.  nothing special</li>
            <li> talk about the real deal!  this stuff makes all of the other incense i used to burn look and smell like a bad imitation.  dont get me wrong, there are a few that i am not real crazy about but even those smell pretty good in comparison.  but the ones that do smell good? they smell REAL good.  burns well and long, fresh this year stamped and make my house smell great for a loong time.   arrived ontime and well packed and would buy again! great way to get a sample and pick a winner before buying ALOT more! the rainforest and regular nag champa has to be the best incense i have ever smelled bar none.   A++ impulse buy.</li>
            <li> Great variety and the scents are wonderful!</li>
            <li> Totally a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I love incense, used it for a LONG time. But these were packaged all together and smelled strongly of soap.... didnt really like it, because they all smelled about the same. Had they not been packaged together and ha dthey not smelled sooooo strongly of soap I most likely would have loved them.</li>
            <li> Horrible smelling incense!  Dry and flaking away too</li>
            <li> This sampler packet of incense is just what a home needs to set the mood for a relaxed evening with friends</li>
            <li> AMAZING SET! nag champa is the best out of all!!! will buy that one individually</li>
            <li> These incenses smell wonderful and burn for a long time.  The only one we can&#x27;t stand is Jasmine.  It smells too much like a women&#x27;s bathroom.</li>
            <li> romantic is my favorite. the shipping was quick</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the price here. If you like the scents in this pack, you should get it. I have enough sticks to last me months.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what to expect I read a lot of reviews before I decided to give it a try. First I have to state this,  I like all my incense to be strong I don&#x27;t get people that comment about incense being &amp;#34;too strong&amp;#34; if they are &amp;#34;too strong&amp;#34; than just don&#x27;t burn the whole incense and you will also save money, or don&#x27;t sit o close to them. lol You can&#x27;t do to much when they are &amp;#34;too weak&amp;#34; but burn more. The strength on these are fine.&lt;br /&gt;That being said I could only give these 3 stars I felt the burn time was too short about 30 min. At the same time I bought a box of Supper Hits same size as these and they burned 50-65 min and that was nice (yes I time them, lol), I will be sticking with Supper Hits (my understanding they are made by the same company). I kept wanting these to burn longer the burn time seemed too short every time I burned one.&lt;br /&gt;I hate to say this but I have a lot of incense I buy from dollar stores and Wal-Mart and I keep finding myself grabbing one of those over these mostly because of the burn time.&lt;br /&gt;The scents are fine a little better than less expensive ones but incense are a hit and miss and that is why you need to try all of them,  I have ones I bought at dollar stores for at 40 for a buck that I love.&lt;br /&gt;I was reading they have another sample group like this one, when the ones I have are near gone I will order them and give them a try too because as I stated incense are a hit and miss and you should try them all. I wish these were the same quality as their Super Hits.&lt;br /&gt;The boxes were in good condition for given as gifts for friends (the super hits box I got wasn&#x27;t) some of the security tags were not secured though,  the baggies inside the box were great because you could re-close them to keep them fresh where as with the Supper Hits bag I got you could not re-close to keep fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Over all worth the try.</li>
            <li> I have ordered the other 6 pack before too...I like this one just as much!! This is my favorite brand of incense....They have a great smell...and burn perfectly...Next I will older the 12 pack so I can enjoy all of them!!! I would recommend this to anyone...this set is a little sweeter scented...but perfect in every way....do not hesitate...add to your cart now!!! :)</li>
            <li> I love buying incense in packs like this. Smells amazing and calming. Recommend this for anyone</li>
            <li> Excellent selection of 6 different fragrance experiences. Each incense is of high quality and provides a fair amount of scented smoke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not as partial to this 6 pack of Satya Sai Baba incense as I am to the other 6 pack, but I like them a good deal. This is a sample selection of six 15 gram boxes of incense. Most of the vendors selling this on Amazon will offer it with Super Saver Shipping.    Fortune: This is a woody, citrusy scent with just a hint of sweetness. It&#x27;s kind of refreshing.    Romance: This is a soft, almost powdery fragrance with a rosy top note and a sweet bottom note that might be sandalwood and vanilla. It is an appropriate fragrance for a lady&#x27;s boudoir. I also like to use it while drawing a bubble bath.    Rain Forest: This is a great resiny fragrance with a very woody base. It&#x27;s perfect when I&#x27;m in the mood for incense, but nothing too sweet. It kind of reminds me of pinon incense, only spicier.    Nag Champa: The classic blue box incense, a reliably high quality fragrance, you know what to expect and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.    Patchouli Forest: I said this in my review for the other 6 pack, and I&#x27;ll say it again: this ain&#x27;t your drugstore&#x27;s patchouli. If you&#x27;ve ever smelled patchouli and hated it, try this and see if it changes your mind. And if you&#x27;ve ever smelled patchouli and loved it and have never been able to find that patchouli again, try this because it might be that this is the one you remember.    Jasmine Blossom: This smells like jasmine, and it is very strong. Try this if you really love the smell of jasmine. Like, a lot. I like jasmine, but this one was a bit too strong for me. (At least by itself. I liked it better when burning it together with Satya Sai Baba&#x27;s Celestial.)    I can definitely see myself getting some of these in the 30 gram boxes in the future. This sampler is a good buy if you want to try out some of Satya Sai Baba&#x27;s other offerings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been burning Satya Nag Champa for years and I have yet to find another incense I like as well. Long lasting, heady, and just plain smells divine! This multiple scent pack is a great way to try other Satya fragances. Price was right too. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They light up really easy and smell really good</li>
            <li> Great selection and great value. These are all very strong, and burn for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this incense, the scents are awesome and I will be ordering more shortly! I bought two boxes of six last time but I think I will try the 12 pack next.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t impressed with any of the fragrances in this set. I usually buy four of the six fragrances (Nag Champa, Fortune, Jasmine, and Patchouli) in another brand, and to be honest, these just aren&#x27;t as fragrant as the ones I&#x27;m used to. And a few of the sticks had a hard time staying lit, even though there was very little humidity or wind that day.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent deal for these wonderful fragrances. The scents are exactly as described for about 1/3 the price the single box packs would normally run. If you love incense, this is the package for you.</li>
            <li> Nice to burn after work to relax you. I usually use them during chakra balancing or mediation. The scent is over powering and doesn&#x27;t smell like wood burning. A scent you can enjoy.</li>
            <li> smell so great!  definitely will buy again.  not too smokey.  nice variety pack.  no problems with them going out before theyve finished burning</li>
            <li> I have yet to run out of this item after about 2 months. I still have an adequate supply and the smell and quality is superb. Would definitively buy again.</li>
            <li> The item was as advertised and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> fast shipping very pleased w product&lt;br /&gt;they burn great and the smells are all wonderful&lt;br /&gt;the boxes are smaller than i thought but still a great product</li>
            <li> There is a lot to choose from with all these scents in one package. They are very natural scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some are subtle and some may make you choke. You decide which ones you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I have decided, that I am a fan and would order more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seal of approval from me! A+</li>
            <li> For me, just get the Nag Champa and forget the rest.  Thought I would try some other scents but in the end most are too perfume.</li>
            <li> For the price you pay for these, you get a lot of incense and they all smell pretty good. They burn pretty short, but are so potent, it doesn&#x27;t matter. Will leave a room smelling good for hours.</li>
            <li> I do whole heartly suggest this particular collection, only to get a feel of the scents offered.  I found the rainforest, romance and the jasmine a tad too overpowering for my small house My husband said that they could &amp;#34;CHASE YOU OUTTA THE HOUSE&amp;#34;, I did however find an aquantance that liked the scents, so I gave them for Christmas. The Fortune also had the over done perfume, but not a &amp;#34;chase you outta the house&amp;#34; like the others.  The rest of the collection are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Been trying several different types of incense&#x27;s looking for a pleasing smell. Bought these for a very decent price and in my opinion some are okay and some give you a spitting headache. They are a pungent smell. Maybe you like but I will not be purchasing these incense again</li>
            <li> These smell wonderful, but I can&#x27;t help but feel they all smell very similar?</li>
            <li> The red box smells SO gross and seriously lingers for days but the pink and green boxes smell INCREDIBLE. Next time am going to try to find the green/pink individually.</li>
            <li> loved most all the sents</li>
            <li> Love nag champa scents. Jasmine blossom is a great scent. So is romance and rain forest. I love all the scents within the nag champa line but these variety packs are always awesome!</li>
            <li> Bought this item as a gift for my sister. She loves all the different scents. Will reorder for myself soon.</li>
            <li> I only liked about two of the smells, but even the ones I liked were somewhat overwhelming.  Wish the didn&#x27;t smell somewhat all the same.  Slightly disappointing, shipping wasn&#x27;t the fastest either..wouldn&#x27;t recommend the product or the seller.</li>
            <li> all of these smell awesome. im not a big incense fan but you can actually smell the difference in them. one of the scents is very sweet (but i threw the package away before i could find the name of it). i recommend these.</li>
            <li> I will be adding this to my &amp;#34;monthly&amp;#34; ordering list!! lol The scents are so delightful and I am a HUGE fan of incense.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found many satya scents I don&#x27;t like. I didn&#x27;t like any of these except the nag champs blue original. Patchouli was alright. These scents and quality are great, just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This incense is STRONG! It smells great, but make sure you have a window open. Wow! It is intense. You get a lot for your purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Incense. Hands down. And it&#x27;s truly Indian.</li>
            <li> I like the Nag Champa. This pack offers a wide variety of smells to tone your day. Clean burning, won&#x27;t turn black when lighting, I like.</li>
            <li> love these scents b/c they cannot be found where i currently reside unless i travel home ty :} I&#x27;ll be ordering more very soon :}</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly like all of the odors but that&#x27;s personal opinion, and some of the sticks did have a burn smell strong enough to cover the dipped scents. The price is okay for the ratio of good to bad sticks, thick and thin. Not as good as homemade incense but decent as a backup after you&#x27;ve already purchased them.</li>
            <li> love all the scents!! really helps scent up a room pleasantly. enough to share with friends. i will order again</li>
            <li> I love ordering my incense from this company. I always get them on time if not early. They smell great and I love the variety. My favorite so far is the Jasmine and Patchouli</li>
            <li> These incense sticks are by far THE BEST out there!  No comparison to what I used to buy in the store.  They burn for a long time (1 hour or so).  The scent is very strong, but it is very pure, so it won&#x27;t give you that feeling like you need to cough.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of incense, but these sticks are just smelling awful. The perfume used for the smell makes them really bad - as if you are burning soap in the house. You can find these six packages of incense down in the waste container of our building if you need some...</li>
            <li> sadly the pink romance box was a fail.  scent was far too overwhelming and gave me a headache</li>
            <li> Nag Champa is by far my favorite incense makers.. I purchased a different batch this time around and chose these different boxes of incense. These are some strong incense aromas! They last long and the aromas stays throughout the room for hours to come after it burns out. Only reason for the one star less is as these are some great incense sticks, but just not the aromas for me.</li>
            <li> My roommates hate me, but I&#x27;m so freaking calm from all this incense that I couldn&#x27;t give two hoots. Took the stress off of studying for an Organic Chemistry final. THAT&#x27;S saying something.</li>
            <li> Nice incense collection. Burns slow. A little smoky. Great scents.</li>
