            <li>i have received this item at a discount price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review/opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>and I thought it would look nice on straightened hair.</li>
            <li>however it sure does smell good.</li>
            <li>and I have had a lot of people ask me what kind of shampoo I am using.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>Now my hair feels kind of gunky.</li>
            <li>It does smell nice though.</li>
            <li>I purchased this at a discounted rate in trade for an honest review.</li>
            <li>Nice product, works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Leaves a nice shine on hair, and seems to soften the hair some too.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind of a \\&quot;green\\&quot; smell with a touch of mint?)    </li>
            <li>For me, it worked nicely</li>
            <li>but honestly this is by far the best mist I have ever bought for my hair!!!</li>
            <li>I honestly wasn&#x27;t sure what this product would be good for, but when I straighten my hair, I do enjoy a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Wow this stuff is truly amazing!!!</li>
            <li>most of these products have really nice smells</li>
            <li>I loved the scent and the product made my hair feel so silky smooth.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and the spray makes me look better.</li>
            <li>It is very light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I tried many $20 products and they did nothing but leave my hair looking like a grease ball</li>
            <li>The smell was just okay...</li>
            <li>so that was okay.</li>
            <li>recommend this product if you are looking for healthier appearing hair.&lt;br /&gt;-1smileycat :-)</li>
            <li>It works more like a hair spray in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Herbal Essences naked mist for shine has a wonderful smell – lightly refreshing – not overpowering or cloying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought this shine mist would be like the many others I have tried and would make my hair seem more greasy looking than shiny.</li>
            <li>It does, however, give a shinier appearance to my hair, and makes my hair look healthy, just keeps it frizzy and tangly.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this spray is that the scent is really pleasant, to my nose anyway.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really place it, but the spritz is pleasant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There wasn&#x27;t much noticeable shine, but that was quite ok since my hair still looked really good.</li>
            <li>This product is light to give it a refreshing shine...</li>
            <li>It has a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li>and it was mild to moderate at best.  </li>
            <li>You live and learn until you find what works for you!!Thanks for hearing my honest review!</li>
            <li>It works well for her and is something she can easily apply before school.</li>
            <li>It sprays on easily and evenly.</li>
            <li>The five ounce container is easy to transport and tuck in a desk drawer.</li>
            <li>and it did spry on easily.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a difference, either, in how easily I could brush through my hair after I applied it versus without.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair frizz free, really soft, very shiny and it smells great!</li>
            <li>She has shoulder length fine hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, wavy, color treated hair.</li>
            <li>This was a wonderful hidden surprise and one that sold me on the product.</li>
            <li>The part I like best is that it leaves your hair feeling very soft and not stiff like a hair spray would.</li>
            <li>Even used with as light a hand as I can manage, they tended to make my hair look and feel oily rather than</li>
            <li>The fragrance is a light lemon herbal.</li>
            <li>It is silicone free and doesn&#x27;t seem to add the build up that needs a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference in shine.</li>
            <li>It also made it feel smooth (like it used to feel just after I had my hair dyed).</li>
            <li>This Shine Mist is certainly affordable and for the money you get pretty good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So when I was presented with the opportunity to test out this product I was excited - because its designed to provide shiny without the weight and greasiness.</li>
            <li>I put it on freshly washed hair and the tangles just disappear making my hair so easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>I am going to continue using it and try spraying a little more on until I figure out the best amount to use to keep my hair looking good, adding a little shine without looking greasy.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and most products weigh my hair down and make it look even more fine than it already is.</li>
            <li>It was very light, though, and I didn&#x27;t really smell it after a minute</li>
            <li>I liked the bit of added volume better that I got from using it on my wet hair, so I don&#x27;t think I will use it on dry, unless I need to smooth fly aways in a ponytail or updo, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and smelling nice.</li>
            <li>while it doesn&#x27;t really give our hair a lot of shine, it does give it a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>(the smell is pretty strong ...</li>
            <li>It seemed like it had a little more body, plus my waves and curls looked good.</li>
            <li>Naked Sheer Mist is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li>He wears his hair longish on top like many tween and teen boys, and so sometimes it needs some taming.</li>
            <li>This works better than water, and his hair actually does look cleaner and shinier, so I&#x27;m glad I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t generally wash my hair every day, so I thought it might be nice to freshen</li>
            <li>Used when dry, I have had good results.</li>
            <li>I used this on my dry hair and thought that it gave it a good shine and a nice little refreshing.</li>
            <li>If you have fine hair, use very sparingly.</li>
            <li>but I have used a light mist of this every day since it arrived and my hair really does shine.</li>
            <li>This spray did nothing to calm the fly-aways.</li>
            <li>Smile.</li>
            <li>It felt soft and looked healthy, but did not look like I had any product in my hair.</li>
            <li>I just bought my first bottle from a retailer and now buying again just because it worked so nice and made my hair soft and shinny and smells great.it really works .</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, wavy hair that can become more \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; than wavy if the weather isn&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice shins after flat ironing!</li>
            <li>I really liked the fragrance and was anxious to give my hair a healthy added shine.</li>
            <li>I like this best when I have let my hair air dry and need to take the dry frizz out and make it look pretty for a ponytail or with a headband.</li>
            <li>and you have a product that most will not find necessary or useful.</li>
            <li>I tried a little of this spray because the price was good</li>
            <li>I love this Sheer Shine Spray!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>and like it had been more recently cleaned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t the end-all-be-all product I&#x27;d hoped for, but it definitely adds shine without oiliness, and I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Less is more with fine hair.</li>
            <li>, I sprayed some on first</li>
            <li>and while I thought it gave superior shine, it is sort of messy and takes longer.  </li>
            <li>but it does make it feel good without being heavy.</li>
            <li>The scent was pleasant enough for me but overall the product was just so-so.</li>
            <li>I appreciated the ease of use and it did make my hair feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I thought it more effective on dry hair than wet and have been using it to freshen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is maybe slightly girly, but it&#x27;s mostly just clean and neutral, not at all perfumey.</li>
            <li>decided to try this spray on a day where I knew I was pretty much housebound and would just be home cleaning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It made both of our hair soft, but she definitely got more shine than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been fortunate to have been able to review a few shine products.</li>
            <li>It has a nice &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34;, slightly flower scent; not too perfumed but there is a scent</li>
            <li>I had more luck using it on those days where I needed to blow dry it</li>
            <li>Herbal Essences usually makes good quality products at reasonable prices.  </li>
            <li>It also works great on my little girl&#x27;s hair for pretty much the same purpose, I spray and brush her hair before we head to school.</li>
            <li>This Shear Shine really works.</li>
            <li>This leave on conditioner promises increased shine with gentle conditioning.</li>
            <li>not so much.</li>
            <li>I tried varying amounts and really didn&#x27;t see any increase in shine or improvement in hair quality.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of shine, but the way it made my hair feel and smell made up for it.</li>
            <li>This is supposed to be a light mist, but I do not think it is substantial enough for my hair needs.</li>
            <li>mist has only a light scent.</li>
            <li>mist has only a light scent.</li>
            <li>The scent of this is a little strong at first, but it seems like it fades out scent wise pretty quickly and leaves just a hint of it behind once my hair dries, which is an aspect I do like.</li>
            <li>My hair is very long and fine.</li>
            <li>I use the lightest of spritzes at the roots and more generous application midway down.</li>
            <li>are so many other products out there!</li>
            <li>it could become your new go-to product!    </li>
            <li>I like a light misting of this spray when I do not want to put any styling product in my hair after washing &amp; I let it just air dry.  </li>
            <li>no it&#x27;s not going to do wonders or make a hairstyle, but I felt like it did what it advertised in a decent way.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that the HE Naked Sheer Shine Mist has no parabens and colorants and was the reason I wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>and it did seem to give it a bit more conditioning and control, but nothing that was noticeable enough that I would be likely to use it again.</li>
            <li>Add to this its high price (5 ounces for 5 bucks)</li>
            <li>I tried a light spray of this on my dry hair and it gave it not so much a shine as a wet look that personally I don&#x27;t find too appealing.</li>
            <li>it made my usually unruly hair relax -- feeling soft, fresh &amp; clean (thanks to its citrusy scent!).  </li>
            <li>I LOVE spritzing my 10 year old son before I send up BACK upstairs to actually comb his hair before leaving for school.</li>
            <li>Normally I equate shiny hair with oily hair, but decided to try this anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t help at all with frizz, and in fact made my curly hair tangle more than normal when left on to air dry.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t see any difference in shine when I used it on wet hair, so I tried it on dry hair.</li>
            <li>While other people seem to have had some success with this product, it really doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my hair.  </li>
            <li>, it didn&#x27;t dry hard like some products, and the scent was pleasant and didn&#x27;t effect my allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product, used lightly and on dry hair, definitely imparted some shine to my hair.</li>
            <li>Some of the reviewers mentioned that it is a good late afternoon spritz to put on dry hair for some added shine.  </li>
            <li>As it turns out, I simply cannot live without this mist!!</li>
            <li>Instead of using it as my primary product after I shower, I&#x27;ll probably continue to use it in between washings to give it that little shine and boost.</li>
            <li>While it had a light fragrance and was ease to apply it did little to provide a shine.  </li>
            <li>Both myself and my 5 year old daughter use it.</li>
            <li>of them made our hair soft, but the Herbal Essences Shine Mist was the easiest to use.  </li>
            <li>My hair is healthy/normal, naturally wavy, not colored or treated.  </li>
            <li>I have old thinning hair.</li>
            <li>As far as my hair goes, after use I like the feel but the look and fragrance</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light instead of heavy.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised that my hair did not looking greasy or oily at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I tried it on dry hair first, and that didn&#x27;t work out for me because my hair gets</li>
            <li>The main objective of this product seems to be - to give you shiny hair.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my hair dry and it was a little better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m African American and most products designed for my hair type are too heavy.</li>
            <li>I just finished my first bottle (several months after this initial post and with daily use).</li>
            <li>little later on, I sprayed it on my dry hair just to see if I could acquire some shine and see how it performs, but it had more of a smoothing effect.</li>
            <li>Although my hair is fine, it does take a few minutes to dry.  </li>

            <li>I have better luck with putting a few drops of argan oil (or similar oils) into my palms and then rubbing it on wet hair.</li>
            <li>i first used it as a leave in-spray conditioner after i washed and towel dried my hair.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t do too much for my hair, I have very curly hair these days and work from home so usually let it air dry.</li>
            <li>My hair is kinda thin, so I have to go easy with these types of sprays because it will look greasy</li>
            <li>My hair is kinda thin, so I have to go easy with these types of sprays because it will look greasy</li>
            <li>/&gt;This doesn&#x27;t seem like a product I&#x27;d want to use on wet hair, so I&#x27;ve used it only on dry hair, like I&#x27;d use hairspray but using much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have thin hair that is also fine.</li>
            <li>Skip this if you have thin or fine hair.</li>
            <li>Not quite as much as I would like, but still, makes it look a little glossier.  </li>
            <li>There MIGHT have been a little difference, but I really can&#x27;t say if it was or if I wanted it to be.</li>

            <li> I tried many $20 products and they did nothing but leave my hair looking like a grease ball</li>
            <li> The smell was just okay...</li>
            <li> so that was okay.</li>
            <li> recommend this product if you are looking for healthier appearing hair.&lt;br /&gt;-1smileycat :-)</li>
            <li> It works more like a hair spray in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences naked mist for shine has a wonderful smell – lightly refreshing – not overpowering or cloying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought this shine mist would be like the many others I have tried and would make my hair seem more greasy looking than shiny.</li>
            <li> It does, however, give a shinier appearance to my hair, and makes my hair look healthy, just keeps it frizzy and tangly.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this spray is that the scent is really pleasant, to my nose anyway.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really place it, but the spritz is pleasant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There wasn&#x27;t much noticeable shine, but that was quite ok since my hair still looked really good.</li>
            <li> This product is light to give it a refreshing shine...</li>
            <li> It has a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li> and it was mild to moderate at best.  </li>
            <li> You live and learn until you find what works for you!!Thanks for hearing my honest review!</li>
            <li> It works well for her and is something she can easily apply before school.</li>
            <li> It sprays on easily and evenly.</li>
            <li> The five ounce container is easy to transport and tuck in a desk drawer.</li>
            <li> and it did spry on easily.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference, either, in how easily I could brush through my hair after I applied it versus without.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair frizz free, really soft, very shiny and it smells great!</li>
            <li> She has shoulder length fine hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, wavy, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> This was a wonderful hidden surprise and one that sold me on the product.</li>
            <li> The part I like best is that it leaves your hair feeling very soft and not stiff like a hair spray would.</li>
            <li> Even used with as light a hand as I can manage, they tended to make my hair look and feel oily rather than</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a light lemon herbal.</li>
            <li> It is silicone free and doesn&#x27;t seem to add the build up that needs a clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference in shine.</li>
            <li> It also made it feel smooth (like it used to feel just after I had my hair dyed).</li>
            <li> This Shine Mist is certainly affordable and for the money you get pretty good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So when I was presented with the opportunity to test out this product I was excited - because its designed to provide shiny without the weight and greasiness.</li>
            <li> I put it on freshly washed hair and the tangles just disappear making my hair so easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> I am going to continue using it and try spraying a little more on until I figure out the best amount to use to keep my hair looking good, adding a little shine without looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and most products weigh my hair down and make it look even more fine than it already is.</li>
            <li> It was very light, though, and I didn&#x27;t really smell it after a minute</li>
            <li> I liked the bit of added volume better that I got from using it on my wet hair, so I don&#x27;t think I will use it on dry, unless I need to smooth fly aways in a ponytail or updo, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and smelling nice.</li>
            <li> while it doesn&#x27;t really give our hair a lot of shine, it does give it a healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> (the smell is pretty strong ...</li>
            <li> It seemed like it had a little more body, plus my waves and curls looked good.</li>
            <li> Naked Sheer Mist is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> He wears his hair longish on top like many tween and teen boys, and so sometimes it needs some taming.</li>
            <li> This works better than water, and his hair actually does look cleaner and shinier, so I&#x27;m glad I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t generally wash my hair every day, so I thought it might be nice to freshen</li>
            <li> Used when dry, I have had good results.</li>
            <li> I used this on my dry hair and thought that it gave it a good shine and a nice little refreshing.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair, use very sparingly.</li>
            <li> but I have used a light mist of this every day since it arrived and my hair really does shine.</li>
            <li> This spray did nothing to calm the fly-aways.</li>
            <li> Smile.</li>
            <li> It felt soft and looked healthy, but did not look like I had any product in my hair.</li>
            <li> I just bought my first bottle from a retailer and now buying again just because it worked so nice and made my hair soft and shinny and smells great.it really works .</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that can become more \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; than wavy if the weather isn&#x27;t perfect.</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice shins after flat ironing!</li>
            <li> I really liked the fragrance and was anxious to give my hair a healthy added shine.</li>
            <li> I like this best when I have let my hair air dry and need to take the dry frizz out and make it look pretty for a ponytail or with a headband.</li>
            <li> and you have a product that most will not find necessary or useful.</li>
            <li> I tried a little of this spray because the price was good</li>
            <li> I love this Sheer Shine Spray!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> and like it had been more recently cleaned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the end-all-be-all product I&#x27;d hoped for, but it definitely adds shine without oiliness, and I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Less is more with fine hair.</li>
            <li> , I sprayed some on first</li>
            <li> and while I thought it gave superior shine, it is sort of messy and takes longer.  </li>
            <li> but it does make it feel good without being heavy.</li>
            <li> The scent was pleasant enough for me but overall the product was just so-so.</li>
            <li> I appreciated the ease of use and it did make my hair feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I thought it more effective on dry hair than wet and have been using it to freshen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is maybe slightly girly, but it&#x27;s mostly just clean and neutral, not at all perfumey.</li>
            <li> decided to try this spray on a day where I knew I was pretty much housebound and would just be home cleaning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It made both of our hair soft, but she definitely got more shine than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been fortunate to have been able to review a few shine products.</li>
            <li> It has a nice &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34;, slightly flower scent; not too perfumed but there is a scent</li>
            <li> I had more luck using it on those days where I needed to blow dry it</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences usually makes good quality products at reasonable prices.  </li>
            <li> It also works great on my little girl&#x27;s hair for pretty much the same purpose, I spray and brush her hair before we head to school.</li>
            <li> This Shear Shine really works.</li>
            <li> This leave on conditioner promises increased shine with gentle conditioning.</li>
            <li> not so much.</li>
            <li> I tried varying amounts and really didn&#x27;t see any increase in shine or improvement in hair quality.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of shine, but the way it made my hair feel and smell made up for it.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be a light mist, but I do not think it is substantial enough for my hair needs.</li>
            <li> mist has only a light scent.</li>
            <li> mist has only a light scent.</li>
            <li> The scent of this is a little strong at first, but it seems like it fades out scent wise pretty quickly and leaves just a hint of it behind once my hair dries, which is an aspect I do like.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and fine.</li>
            <li> I use the lightest of spritzes at the roots and more generous application midway down.</li>
            <li> are so many other products out there!</li>
            <li> it could become your new go-to product!    </li>
            <li> I like a light misting of this spray when I do not want to put any styling product in my hair after washing &amp; I let it just air dry.  </li>
            <li> no it&#x27;s not going to do wonders or make a hairstyle, but I felt like it did what it advertised in a decent way.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the HE Naked Sheer Shine Mist has no parabens and colorants and was the reason I wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> and it did seem to give it a bit more conditioning and control, but nothing that was noticeable enough that I would be likely to use it again.</li>
            <li> Add to this its high price (5 ounces for 5 bucks)</li>
            <li> I tried a light spray of this on my dry hair and it gave it not so much a shine as a wet look that personally I don&#x27;t find too appealing.</li>
            <li> it made my usually unruly hair relax -- feeling soft, fresh &amp; clean (thanks to its citrusy scent!).  </li>
            <li> I LOVE spritzing my 10 year old son before I send up BACK upstairs to actually comb his hair before leaving for school.</li>
            <li> Normally I equate shiny hair with oily hair, but decided to try this anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help at all with frizz, and in fact made my curly hair tangle more than normal when left on to air dry.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t see any difference in shine when I used it on wet hair, so I tried it on dry hair.</li>
            <li> While other people seem to have had some success with this product, it really doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my hair.  </li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t dry hard like some products, and the scent was pleasant and didn&#x27;t effect my allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product, used lightly and on dry hair, definitely imparted some shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviewers mentioned that it is a good late afternoon spritz to put on dry hair for some added shine.  </li>
            <li> As it turns out, I simply cannot live without this mist!!</li>
            <li> Instead of using it as my primary product after I shower, I&#x27;ll probably continue to use it in between washings to give it that little shine and boost.</li>
            <li> While it had a light fragrance and was ease to apply it did little to provide a shine.  </li>
            <li> Both myself and my 5 year old daughter use it.</li>
            <li> of them made our hair soft, but the Herbal Essences Shine Mist was the easiest to use.  </li>
            <li> My hair is healthy/normal, naturally wavy, not colored or treated.  </li>
            <li> I have old thinning hair.</li>
            <li> As far as my hair goes, after use I like the feel but the look and fragrance</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light instead of heavy.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised that my hair did not looking greasy or oily at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it on dry hair first, and that didn&#x27;t work out for me because my hair gets</li>
            <li> The main objective of this product seems to be - to give you shiny hair.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my hair dry and it was a little better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and most products designed for my hair type are too heavy.</li>
            <li> I just finished my first bottle (several months after this initial post and with daily use).</li>
            <li> little later on, I sprayed it on my dry hair just to see if I could acquire some shine and see how it performs, but it had more of a smoothing effect.</li>
            <li> Although my hair is fine, it does take a few minutes to dry.  </li>
            <li> Cristophe Professional Extra Strength Hair Serum]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have better luck with putting a few drops of argan oil (or similar oils) into my palms and then rubbing it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> i first used it as a leave in-spray conditioner after i washed and towel dried my hair.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do too much for my hair, I have very curly hair these days and work from home so usually let it air dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is kinda thin, so I have to go easy with these types of sprays because it will look greasy</li>
            <li> My hair is kinda thin, so I have to go easy with these types of sprays because it will look greasy</li>
            <li> /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t seem like a product I&#x27;d want to use on wet hair, so I&#x27;ve used it only on dry hair, like I&#x27;d use hairspray but using much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that is also fine.</li>
            <li> Skip this if you have thin or fine hair.</li>
            <li> Not quite as much as I would like, but still, makes it look a little glossier.  </li>
            <li> There MIGHT have been a little difference, but I really can&#x27;t say if it was or if I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> It is long, past the middle of my back and very wavy.</li>
            <li> It not only makes your hair shine all day long, but it also works as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I could not use it long enough to know if it made my hair shiny.  </li>
            <li> I expected the Naked Sheer Shine to be a product in a similar vein</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and maybe a little shiny, and it actually stays looking combed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I’ve used this a few times on newly shampooed hair and have not yet noticed any difference.  </li>
            <li> After using the Herbal Essences Naked Sheer Shine Mist for a couple of weeks not much of a difference was noticed in shine or conditioning or friz control</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t use it with the other Herbal Essences Naked product, so the outcome may have been different if I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is simple to use and can be used on wet or damp</li>
            <li> My wife has long hair</li>
            <li> Next time, I tried it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> Not bad, not ideal.</li>
            <li> also tried this on wet hair and it either made no difference or left my hair oily looking when dry.</li>
            <li> One was super expensive and theoretically contained Argan Oil, and another was [[ASIN:B009G0E9CK</li>
            <li> Just 2-3 Sprays for me (I have very long hair) and 1-2 for my daughter who&#x27;s hair is to her shoulder blades.</li>
            <li> i also did spray it on my dry hair before styling and it helped with the tangles and tamed frizziness.  </li>
            <li> I like that it has no silicone because that tends to dry out my hair if I use it often.  </li>
            <li> I spray Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Awapuhi Moist Mist on my dry hair and \\&quot;scrunch\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Even if I use gel or mousse and then let it air dry, it looks a combination of blah and frizz.</li>
            <li> Once my hair was dry</li>
            <li> It may be used on either wet or dry</li>
            <li> However there was only a slight boost in shine.</li>
            <li> I did try it on both wet and on dry</li>
            <li> I blow dry it to straighten it, so once I sprayed this on, it was wet enough to mess up my blowdrying job and made it frizzy again.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t add any detangling or conditioning effects, and if it added any shine at all, it was minimal.</li>
            <li> And those products are greasy and heavy and leave my hair flat.</li>
            <li> I cannot just let my hair air dry because no matter what, it will look like a frizzy yucky mess.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for other people.</li>
            <li> My Har ended up looking and feeling extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any other products.</li>
            <li> I sprayed it on my (combed) hair after getting out of the shower, ran my fingers through my hair a few times, and then let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was going to be bad because it was so cheap</li>
            <li> Later, when I took my hair down it did feel like it had been conditioned, so at least that part worked; but quite frankly I do not like an oily hair appearance.</li>
            <li> It does not weigh down my hair at all, and it did make it look nicer</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> It was not weighted down, nor greasy looking.</li>
            <li> It makes our hair appear less damaged, giving it a healthier sheen.  </li>
            <li> The results were comparable but at about half the price.    </li>
            <li> Odd combination.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, long and wavy.  </li>
            <li> I wish it would add a little bit of shine to it though.</li>
            <li> A little shinier, but at what cost?</li>
            <li> However, I saw little change in my hair.</li>
            <li> I think the marketing folks are trying to get a little oh-la-la factor across to the consumer</li>
            <li> It did tend to separate my hair into strands, which hair also does when it is oily.&lt;br /&gt;There was very little fragrance</li>
            <li> I don’t usually carry products around with me</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t sprayed a lot so far because I was afraid of the greasy look that usually happens with shine products.</li>
            <li> I seriously doubted any spray could add a shine to your hair</li>
            <li> It would be nicer if it was subtle, but I could smell it all day.  </li>
            <li> It made it frizzy, and frizzy is not good when you have curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I saw very little result from using Herbal Essences Shine Mist.</li>
            <li> the past, I&#x27;ve used other spray product that are supposed to make my hair shiny, and I have been disappointed in them.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin.</li>
            <li> My curly hair hated this product when applied to wet hair.  </li>
            <li> For me, I an detect no scent on my hair although there is a faint scent while spraying.</li>
            <li> but it was a bit disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I refuse to feel bad about my experience{This one is not for me.}</li>
            <li> , I was almost in shock that it did not look bad at all.</li>
            <li> but it just didn&#x27;t do anything  for my hair:(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product but it just didn&#x27;t do anything  for my hair:(</li>
            <li> I love this Sheer Shine Spray! Both myself and my 5 year old daughter use it. It makes our hair look shiny and super healthy and smells great!!! Just 2-3 Sprays for me (I have very long hair) and 1-2 for my daughter who&#x27;s hair is to her shoulder blades. I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I gave this product four stars instead of five because it claims to be a shine mist but I didn&#x27;t see any shine at all. However, it is a great spray! It made my hair smell nice throughout the day and helped control the frizz. I spray it when I get out of the shower and then sometimes later on throughout the day. It leaves my hair feeling soft and smelling nice. I wish it would add a little bit of shine to it though. Good product over all.</li>
            <li> I just bought my first bottle from a retailer and now buying again just because it worked so nice and made my hair soft and shinny and smells great.it really works .</li>
            <li> I had read good things about this product but it did nothing for shine on my hair. Maybe it works for other people.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair shiny and it smells great</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice shins after flat ironing! Use only a bit or it ges stringy</li>
            <li> Works well, and the smell is very nice.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this hairspray!  i first used it as a leave in-spray conditioner after i washed and towel dried my hair. it made my usually unruly hair relax -- feeling soft, fresh &amp; clean (thanks to its citrusy scent!).  i also did spray it on my dry hair before styling and it helped with the tangles and tamed frizziness.  the smell is just invigorating, i just have to say it again!! :) **i have received this item at a discount price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review/opinion of the product.**</li>
            <li> Naked shine, I bought this from Amazon on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know when you have that lack luster hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this spray helps to put the shine back in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wash your hair and spray before drying your hair, you will see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great and you will get that shine that you want everyone to be envious of .</li>
            <li> Wow this stuff is truly amazing!!! Leaves my hair frizz free, really soft, very shiny and it smells great! I thought this product was going to be bad because it was so cheap but honestly this is by far the best mist I have ever bought for my hair!!! I tried many $20 products and they did nothing but leave my hair looking like a grease ball but this stuff is simply amazing!!!! :-)</li>
            <li> This Shine Mist is certainly affordable and for the money you get pretty good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter and I both tested it. She has shoulder length fine hair and I&#x27;ve got mid-back length crone hair (meaning my gray hair is doing some sort of weird go-it&#x27;s-own-direction thing), AND the Shine Mist worked better for her than for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It made both of our hair soft, but she definitely got more shine than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been fortunate to have been able to review a few shine products. One was super expensive and theoretically contained Argan Oil, and another was [[ASIN:B009G0E9CK Cristophe Professional Extra Strength Hair Serum]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of them made our hair soft, but the Herbal Essences Shine Mist was the easiest to use.  The Christophe product you had to apply with your hands, and while I thought it gave superior shine, it is sort of messy and takes longer.  Either one would be a good affordable choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;♥♥ For my daughter I prefer the spray on shine. It works well for her and is something she can easily apply before school. (she&#x27;s 14)</li>
            <li> I used this on my dry hair and thought that it gave it a good shine and a nice little refreshing. It does not weigh down my hair at all, and it did make it look nicer and like it had been more recently cleaned. The smell was just okay... most of these products have really nice smells and this one was just so-so. It was very light, though, and I didn&#x27;t really smell it after a minute so that was okay. This product is light to give it a refreshing shine... no it&#x27;s not going to do wonders or make a hairstyle, but I felt like it did what it advertised in a decent way. Instead of using it as my primary product after I shower, I&#x27;ll probably continue to use it in between washings to give it that little shine and boost.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that is also fine. I tried a little of this spray because the price was good and I thought it would look nice on straightened hair. My Har ended up looking and feeling extremely greasy. Skip this if you have thin or fine hair.</li>
            <li> After using the Herbal Essences Naked Sheer Shine Mist for a couple of weeks not much of a difference was noticed in shine or conditioning or friz control however it sure does smell good.</li>
            <li> I like the sorta-fruity fragrance. Can&#x27;t really place it, but the spritz is pleasant. My hair is unmanageable without washing, but my wife likes to use this to freshen up when she doesn&#x27;t have time to wash her hair.</li>
            <li> Personally,I do not care for this product! Smells horrible,does nothing for my hair! Sorry,this is not for me!There are so many other products out there! I refuse to feel bad about my experience{This one is not for me.} You live and learn until you find what works for you!!Thanks for hearing my honest review! Kudos to Amazon for always giving 101%!!Aline F</li>
            <li> I received the Herbal Essences Naked Sheer Shine Mist thru the Vine Voice program.  My girls and I have used this and we all agree - while it doesn&#x27;t really give our hair a lot of shine, it does give it a healthy glow.  It makes our hair appear less damaged, giving it a healthier sheen.  It is simple to use and can be used on wet or damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product if you are looking for healthier appearing hair.&lt;br /&gt;-1smileycat :-)</li>
            <li> I seriously doubted any spray could add a shine to your hair but I have used a light mist of this every day since it arrived and my hair really does shine. The part I like best is that it leaves your hair feeling very soft and not stiff like a hair spray would. It smells really good too and I have had a lot of people ask me what kind of shampoo I am using. This stuff overcomes any shampoo spray. Nice product. I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences Naked Sheer Mist is a wonderful product. It not only makes your hair shine all day long, but it also works as a leave in conditioner. It also nourishes your hair and feels like you have put nothing in your hair. I have very fine hair and most products weigh my hair down and make it look even more fine than it already is. The Herbal Essences Naked Sheer leaves my hair shiny and conditioned.</li>
            <li> I like a light misting of this spray when I do not want to put any styling product in my hair after washing &amp; I let it just air dry.  It gives my hair just a tiny bit of control so it&#x27;s not fly-away wavy.  It has a nice &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34;, slightly flower scent; not too perfumed but there is a scent so if you don&#x27;t like scent (&amp;/or this one), you may not like this.  My hair is healthy/normal, naturally wavy, not colored or treated.  I like that it has no silicone because that tends to dry out my hair if I use it often.  It&#x27;s not a miracle shiner but it does make it feel good without being heavy.</li>
            <li> A little shinier, but at what cost? Now my hair feels kind of gunky. It does smell nice though.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this spray is that the scent is really pleasant, to my nose anyway.  Second, I noticed that it did add some shine to my hair.  Not quite as much as I would like, but still, makes it look a little glossier.  And third, it does provide some styling benefit, like a not-too-heavy hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the past, I&#x27;ve used other spray product that are supposed to make my hair shiny, and I have been disappointed in them.  Even used with as light a hand as I can manage, they tended to make my hair look and feel oily rather than just shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had no such problems with this spray.  My hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel oily, even when I get up the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t seem like a product I&#x27;d want to use on wet hair, so I&#x27;ve used it only on dry hair, like I&#x27;d use hairspray but using much less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the end-all-be-all product I&#x27;d hoped for, but it definitely adds shine without oiliness, and I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> My curly hair hated this product when applied to wet hair.  It made it frizzy, and frizzy is not good when you have curly hair.  I tried it on my hair dry and it was a little better.  It works more like a hair spray in my opinion.  I could not use it long enough to know if it made my hair shiny.  The smell was too strongl.  It would be nicer if it was subtle, but I could smell it all day.  Plus it made hubby sneeze. I would not pick this up again.</li>
            <li> I have old thinning hair. Smile. I have used this product a lot and it is as advertised. This Shear Shine really works. I love it. I can recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I purchased this at a discounted rate in trade for an honest review. This product is great for adding shine without making your hair look oily. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love the shine that this mist gives!</li>
            <li> Feels great for my hair. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This leave on conditioner promises increased shine with gentle conditioning. It sprays on easily and evenly. The fragrance is a light lemon herbal. I am not especially fond of it but it does not overwhelm. It may be used on either wet or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, wavy, color treated hair. I appreciated the ease of use and it did make my hair feel soft and smooth. However there was only a slight boost in shine. I thought it more effective on dry hair than wet and have been using it to freshen. The five ounce container is easy to transport and tuck in a desk drawer. Less is more with fine hair. I use the lightest of spritzes at the roots and more generous application midway down. It is silicone free and doesn&#x27;t seem to add the build up that needs a clarifying shampoo. Although my hair is fine, it does take a few minutes to dry.  As far as my hair goes, after use I like the feel but the look and fragrance not so much. 3.5 stars</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences usually makes good quality products at reasonable prices.  I expected the Naked Sheer Shine to be a product in a similar vein but it was a bit disappointing.  While it had a light fragrance and was ease to apply it did little to provide a shine.  My wife has long hair and I had her apply it to one side just to see the difference and it was mild to moderate at best.  This product basically contains water along with a few oils and fragrance but it is not enough to really warrant its use.  Add to this its high price (5 ounces for 5 bucks) and you have a product that most will not find necessary or useful.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that the HE Naked Sheer Shine Mist has no parabens and colorants and was the reason I wanted to try it. I really liked the fragrance and was anxious to give my hair a healthy added shine. I honestly didn&#x27;t see any difference in shine when I used it on wet hair, so I tried it on dry hair. There MIGHT have been a little difference, but I really can&#x27;t say if it was or if I wanted it to be. Mind you, I didn&#x27;t use it with the other Herbal Essences Naked product, so the outcome may have been different if I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was one benefit, though. This product works great as a detangler. I put it on freshly washed hair and the tangles just disappear making my hair so easy to comb through. This was a wonderful hidden surprise and one that sold me on the product.</li>
            <li> While other people seem to have had some success with this product, it really doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my hair.  My hair is thick, long and wavy.  I tried varying amounts and really didn&#x27;t see any increase in shine or improvement in hair quality.  I did try it on both wet and on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say that it didn&#x27;t make my hair frizzy, it didn&#x27;t dry hard like some products, and the scent was pleasant and didn&#x27;t effect my allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with no noticeable difference in my hair, I can&#x27;t see any reason to use this product</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do too much for my hair, I have very curly hair these days and work from home so usually let it air dry. I tried a light spray of this on my dry hair and it gave it not so much a shine as a wet look that personally I don&#x27;t find too appealing. I had more luck using it on those days where I needed to blow dry it, I sprayed some on first and it did seem to give it a bit more conditioning and control, but nothing that was noticeable enough that I would be likely to use it again. The scent was pleasant enough for me but overall the product was just so-so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American and most products designed for my hair type are too heavy. My hair is thin. And those products are greasy and heavy and leave my hair flat. So when I was presented with the opportunity to test out this product I was excited - because its designed to provide shiny without the weight and greasiness. It delivers. It&#x27;s a mist and it&#x27;s not oily. It&#x27;s light instead of heavy. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. The best part is the smell, which is divine.</li>
            <li> Nice product, works as advertised.  Leaves a nice shine on hair, and seems to soften the hair some too.</li>
            <li> I loved the scent and the product made my hair feel so silky smooth. I didn&#x27;t see a whole lot of shine, but the way it made my hair feel and smell made up for it.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I saw very little result from using Herbal Essences Shine Mist. It has a nice fresh scent. It is very light and non-greasy. However, I saw little change in my hair. My hair is very long and fine. This spray did nothing to calm the fly-aways. However, it did add a tiny bit of shine. This is supposed to be a light mist, but I do not think it is substantial enough for my hair needs. Maybe it is for yours.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that can become more \\&quot;frizzy\\&quot; than wavy if the weather isn&#x27;t perfect. I spray Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Awapuhi Moist Mist on my dry hair and \\&quot;scrunch\\&quot; it just a bit to re-active the waviness (and eliminate the \\&quot;frizz\\&quot;) on humid days. For me, it works like a charm! I did likewise with this product. The results were comparable but at about half the price.    Now, if you have sensitivities/allergies to fragrance, you may want to smell this in-store before buying it here (the smell is pretty strong ... it&#x27;s kind of a \\&quot;green\\&quot; smell with a touch of mint?)    For me, it worked nicely but I have very specific needs that this seems to cater to. At this price, you should give it a try ... it could become your new go-to product!    UPDATE: I just finished my first bottle (several months after this initial post and with daily use). As it turns out, I simply cannot live without this mist!! I literally just added three more bottles to my cart!</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences naked mist for shine has a wonderful smell – lightly refreshing – not overpowering or cloying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is part of their Naked line – I don’t know what that means.  Though the ingredient list is alphabet soup I still want the convenience of an over-the-counter product and not have to cook up a batch of DIY in my kitchen.  The label says there is ZERO percent silicone and colorants.  I guess this is the naked part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve used this a few times on newly shampooed hair and have not yet noticed any difference.  Some of the reviewers mentioned that it is a good late afternoon spritz to put on dry hair for some added shine.  I don’t usually carry products around with me so all I can do is pass along this information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions are in English and French but the bottom line is that the product is made in Mexico.  I think the marketing folks are trying to get a little oh-la-la factor across to the consumer but in reality it’s just another middle of the road hair product. Not bad, not ideal.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, but I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference in shine. I tried it on dry hair first, and that didn&#x27;t work out for me because my hair gets frizzy-- I blow dry it to straighten it, so once I sprayed this on, it was wet enough to mess up my blowdrying job and made it frizzy again. Next time, I tried it on wet hair. It didn&#x27;t add any detangling or conditioning effects, and if it added any shine at all, it was minimal. I have better luck with putting a few drops of argan oil (or similar oils) into my palms and then rubbing it on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I honestly wasn&#x27;t sure what this product would be good for, but when I straighten my hair, I do enjoy a nice shine. I also don&#x27;t generally wash my hair every day, so I thought it might be nice to freshen up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually haven&#x27;t seen a noticeable difference and have stopped using it on me, but I LOVE spritzing my 10 year old son before I send up BACK upstairs to actually comb his hair before leaving for school. He wears his hair longish on top like many tween and teen boys, and so sometimes it needs some taming. This works better than water, and his hair actually does look cleaner and shinier, so I&#x27;m glad I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is maybe slightly girly, but it&#x27;s mostly just clean and neutral, not at all perfumey.</li>
            <li> I like this best when I have let my hair air dry and need to take the dry frizz out and make it look pretty for a ponytail or with a headband. It makes my hair soft and maybe a little shiny, and it actually stays looking combed. It also works great on my little girl&#x27;s hair for pretty much the same purpose, I spray and brush her hair before we head to school. The scent is nice and the spray makes me look better. Score!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the point in this spray, does not smell good.</li>
            <li> The main objective of this product seems to be - to give you shiny hair. Normally I equate shiny hair with oily hair, but decided to try this anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give a shine to the hair and it becomes a bit sticky before it dries. It did tend to separate my hair into strands, which hair also does when it is oily.&lt;br /&gt;There was very little fragrance and it did spry on easily. Later, when I took my hair down it did feel like it had been conditioned, so at least that part worked; but quite frankly I do not like an oily hair appearance.</li>
            <li> I thought this shine mist would be like the many others I have tried and would make my hair seem more greasy looking than shiny. I was pleasantly surprised that my hair did not looking greasy or oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally I cannot just let my hair air dry because no matter what, it will look like a frizzy yucky mess. It is long, past the middle of my back and very wavy. Even if I use gel or mousse and then let it air dry, it looks a combination of blah and frizz. Odd combination. Needless to say, I have never been able to be a wash and go person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this spray on a day where I knew I was pretty much housebound and would just be home cleaning. I sprayed it on my (combed) hair after getting out of the shower, ran my fingers through my hair a few times, and then let it air dry. I didn&#x27;t use any other products. Once my hair was dry and I took a look in the mirror, I was almost in shock that it did not look bad at all. It seemed like it had a little more body, plus my waves and curls looked good. It did not look frizzy and did not look blah. It was not weighted down, nor greasy looking. It felt soft and looked healthy, but did not look like I had any product in my hair. This shine mist may turn me into a wash and go person!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little later on, I sprayed it on my dry hair just to see if I could acquire some shine and see how it performs, but it had more of a smoothing effect. I liked the bit of added volume better that I got from using it on my wet hair, so I don&#x27;t think I will use it on dry, unless I need to smooth fly aways in a ponytail or updo, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There wasn&#x27;t much noticeable shine, but that was quite ok since my hair still looked really good. I am going to continue using it and try spraying a little more on until I figure out the best amount to use to keep my hair looking good, adding a little shine without looking greasy. I haven&#x27;t sprayed a lot so far because I was afraid of the greasy look that usually happens with shine products. My hair is kinda thin, so I have to go easy with these types of sprays because it will look greasy quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mist has only a light scent. I don&#x27;t mind that. It smells good, but people around you probably won&#x27;t smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically only buy salon products, but I can see using regularly, if it continues to work so well and doesn&#x27;t cause buildup.with shine products.

            <li> I am always nervous about sprays because they inevitably seem to make my hair look and feel greasy. This product, used lightly and on dry hair, definitely imparted some shine to my hair. It also made it feel smooth (like it used to feel just after I had my hair dyed). There seem to be fewer flyaways after I use this. For me, I an detect no scent on my hair although there is a faint scent while spraying. The spray is very fine which for me is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried this on wet hair and it either made no difference or left my hair oily looking when dry. Used when dry, I have had good results. I also found that this spray revives my hair a bit in the afternoon before office meetings. If you have fine hair, use very sparingly.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work on my hair as I had hoped. It didn&#x27;t help at all with frizz, and in fact made my curly hair tangle more than normal when left on to air dry. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference, either, in how easily I could brush through my hair after I applied it versus without. It does, however, give a shinier appearance to my hair, and makes my hair look healthy, just keeps it frizzy and tangly. The scent of this is a little strong at first, but it seems like it fades out scent wise pretty quickly and leaves just a hint of it behind once my hair dries, which is an aspect I do like.</li>
