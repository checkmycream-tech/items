            <li>A miracle in a tub...works great and wish we could purchase in the United States.</li>
            <li>And did I mention how great it smells?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective and often clears up a rash within 24 hours.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent, but is not over-scented, so we had no reaction to any added perfumes.  </li>
            <li>good purchase, we order two at a time.</li>

            <li>This cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>Great product, goes on smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li>This time, I got wise, and now I use Sudocrem with every diaper change, and we haven&#x27;t had rash in more than 6 weeks now.</li>
            <li>It is a good value and our customers love it at All-Scripts Pharmacy in Kissimmee, FL.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without sudocrem, an excellent product</li>
            <li>Excellent cream for so many things, especially nappy rash, just a bit pricey.  </li>
            <li>I have used this on my grand children and find that the mother&#x27;s are now asking me to get more.  </li>
            <li>I found that the excema I had on my hands was better also, so I started using it when that would flare up...</li>
            <li>it worked better than the prescription creams I had.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what &#x27;chilblains&#x27; were, but it sure sounded like a flaky snake oil treatment to me.</li>
            <li>More rash.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad the product hasn&#x27;t changed over the decades.</li>
            <li>It clears up diaper rash very quickly and can be used in armpits and in baby fat rolls to keep out moisture.</li>
            <li>On the upside, it did smell nice, so I was willing to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cream is the best product out there especially for diaper rash and the skin in the hot climate instead of lotion</li>
            <li>This is good and no matter for baby or adult!</li>
            <li>GREAT THAT WE CAN FINALLY BUY SUDACREM HERE IN THE US !!!!</li>
            <li>Best babycream &amp; all round go to it cream for the family.</li>
            <li>Sudocrem is very smooth, so it goes on gently.  </li>
            <li>Most people who do not like this product are not using it as intended and unfortunately think it should be doing miracles rather than the excellent job it does.</li>
            <li>I simply can&#x27;t live without it, it works like magic on diaper rash or reddness or anything caused by the diaper..</li>
            <li>And I did try different store products that are popular here in the US.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Takes a while to get from the UK to the US, but worth the wait...</li>
            <li>Outstanding for rashes, and any minor scrapes or burns.  </li>
            <li>Nice texture and scent, seems to help clear up minor diaper rashes.</li>
            <li>I have dry, chapped irritable fair skin (especially in winter) that also tends to break out.</li>
            <li>Not willing to go without this item again, I ordered a four-pack to have some in the first aid kit and to make sure I NEVER run out.</li>
            <li>This cream works very well.</li>
            <li>so far it seems to calm the skin wherever I apply it.</li>
            <li>It worked very well and seemed to speed up the healing process because of the high zinc content.</li>
            <li>I used it on my kids &amp; grand daughter &amp; now buying it again for the expected one!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The diaper-rash-of-rage was gone in a few days, and I stopped using the Sudocrem, returning to a more run-of-the-mill zinc paste.</li>
            <li>I have not yet tested it on sunburn or rashes (or chilblains!), but highly, HIGHLY recommend it for stubborn, sensitive diaper rashes.</li>
            <li>(This baby butt is as sensitive as they come, and we have been battling rash since day 1!)</li>
            <li>It is very strange that it is only available to purchase online in the US.  </li>
            <li>And it goes a LONG way - using a thin smear with 10-15 diaper changes a day, my original tub is still more than half full.</li>
            <li>My baby&#x27;s tushy has been rash clear since I started using Sudocrem.</li>
            <li>omg within a week the baby was clear of rash.</li>
            <li>Both of my daughters have horribly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My candida infection had cleared up completely.</li>
            <li>This is the best nappy (diaper) cream ever, I hate the US stuff that&#x27;s like jelly, sudocrem clears up babies bum with just one application</li>
            <li>Since that trip 12 years ago, I have requested family members who pass though England to bring me home some, and that not possible, I have made repeat orders, this is the first time through Amazon-and it won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
            <li>Generally overnight i see a near complete healing of diaper rash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also soothing for burns and general antiseptic needs.</li>
            <li>, you only need a tiny amount to clear the skin up..love it!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for diaper rash, sunburns or any other skin ailments.</li>
            <li>She has some really bad rashes sometimes, and the creams that worked for my boys did nothing for my fair skinned girl.  </li>

            <li> She has some really bad rashes sometimes, and the creams that worked for my boys did nothing for my fair skinned girl.  </li>
            <li> I have used Eucerin, and this product has a pretty thick consistency like that-</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about this cream - I received it from a friend of my sister-in-law (a complete stranger to me!)</li>
            <li> The rash came back, as I expected it to, by this point.</li>
            <li> This just works and is ESSENTIAL for parents of diaper crapping aged children.</li>
            <li> Now I gift other future moms with Sudocrem.</li>
            <li> Back to the other stuff.</li>
            <li> Our European caregivers for our elderly mother insisted on this product for her care and it has worked preventing our mothers skin from breaking down.  </li>
            <li> except it seems MUCH more soothing to my usually impossible skin.</li>
            <li> Soon after birth, she got a diaper rash that hardly cleared completely until I started using Sudocrem.</li>
            <li> it caused my 90 year old mothers rash to get worse.</li>
            <li> The jar boasts that it&#x27;s a cure for &#x27;nappy rash&#x27;, burns, rashes, and &#x27;chilblains&#x27;, as well as a few other things.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I have to use pampers, it often results in a little rash but when I apply this cream, it&#x27;s gone in no time.</li>
            <li> Our son had horrible diaper rash when he was a newborn and none of the ointments and creams available in the US seemed to work.  </li>
            <li> I used this for my daughter&#x27;s chicken skin on the backs of her arms and no more chicken skin.</li>
            <li> I am shocked at how poorly this stuff performed.</li>
            <li> Then I had a terrible burn from radiation, due to breast cancer, and had almost none.  </li>
            <li> It takes awhile to get it because it ships from overseas so expect a few weeks wait, however you won&#x27;t be disappointed in what this cream does!</li>
            <li> I run a small daycare at home and one of my moms brought this cream from Puerto Rico and allow me to use it on one of the babies that had a horrible rash, that turn out to be a yeast inFection.</li>
            <li> 12 years ago while traveling in England, my baby had the Worst diaper rash!  </li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t live without sudocrem, an excellent product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best for babie&#x27;s diper rash.</li>
            <li> The best diaper cream ever! I&#x27;ve used it on both of my kids and have never had diaper rash on either one.</li>
            <li> Only thing that helped my baby with diaper rash. Recommended to all parents looking for a solution</li>
            <li> Excellent cream for so many things, especially nappy rash, just a bit pricey.  It takes awhile to get it because it ships from overseas so expect a few weeks wait, however you won&#x27;t be disappointed in what this cream does!</li>
            <li> It was great and I will keep on buy and using this product until you can&#x27;t buy it again. Yep</li>
            <li> Sudocrem is a great product.  It is very strange that it is only available to purchase online in the US.  We always used this in Europe.  Most people who do not like this product are not using it as intended and unfortunately think it should be doing miracles rather than the excellent job it does.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by friends for my husband&#x27;s bed sore. It worked very well and seemed to speed up the healing process because of the high zinc content.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product! Works wonders with almost immediate results. I highly recommend this product for diaper rash, sunburns or any other skin ailments.</li>
            <li> I have used this on my grand children and find that the mother&#x27;s are now asking me to get more.  It&#x27;s one cream that supercedes all others when it comes to diaper rash.</li>
            <li> A miracle in a tub...works great and wish we could purchase in the United States. Works on sun burns, diaper rash, you name it.</li>
            <li> Our son had horrible diaper rash when he was a newborn and none of the ointments and creams available in the US seemed to work.  Then my sister was visiting from France and she had a pot of Sudocrem for her daughter which she gave to us to use and within a couple days our son&#x27;s rash was healed. It is the only butt paste we use, even if we have to have it shipped internationally!</li>
            <li> Wonderful Deal!!! And shi</li>
            <li> Outstanding for rashes, and any minor scrapes or burns.  The very best for babies diaper rash.</li>
            <li> Well I got.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I wish I knew of Sudocrem the day my baby was born. Soon after birth, she got a diaper rash that hardly cleared completely until I started using Sudocrem. And I did try different store products that are popular here in the US. Now I gift other future moms with Sudocrem. Totally believe in this product, because I&#x27;ve seen it work. My baby&#x27;s tushy has been rash clear since I started using Sudocrem.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last 20 years. My ex s-i-l was English and his family always provided it. Remember I said &#x27;ex&#x27;, well that was done, so I began having traveling customers bring it home to me.  Then I had a terrible burn from radiation, due to breast cancer, and had almost none.  Went on my beloved Amazon, and it was there!, I am so happy to say my burn healed beautifully! Thank you for having this product!</li>
            <li> 12 years ago while traveling in England, my baby had the Worst diaper rash!  I couldn&#x27;t find my go-to cream that I used at home, The lady at Boots suggested Sudocrem.  It worked like magic...and not just on the diaper rash.  I found that the excema I had on my hands was better also, so I started using it when that would flare up...it worked better than the prescription creams I had.  Sudocrem is very smooth, so it goes on gently.  It has a pleasant scent, but is not over-scented, so we had no reaction to any added perfumes.  Since that trip 12 years ago, I have requested family members who pass though England to bring me home some, and that not possible, I have made repeat orders, this is the first time through Amazon-and it won&#x27;t be the last.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Best cream for diaper rash EVER!!! We have also used to put on standard burns. We have used all sorts of brands, but nothing comes close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes a while to get from the UK to the US, but worth the wait...</li>
            <li> Both of my daughters have horribly sensitive skin. This has been the only cream that i have trusted to take care of my kids bottoms. Generally overnight i see a near complete healing of diaper rash.</li>
            <li> it caused my 90 year old mothers rash to get worse. had to discontinue after 3 days, wish it had worked.</li>
            <li> This cream works very well. Sometimes when I have to use pampers, it often results in a little rash but when I apply this cream, it&#x27;s gone in no time.</li>
            <li> She has some really bad rashes sometimes, and the creams that worked for my boys did nothing for my fair skinned girl.  This however, does the trick every time.</li>
            <li> Before we move here from Europe I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t find any here so I got lots with me. Now that I found it here I think I&#x27;m gonna save some space in my bags! I simply can&#x27;t live without it, it works like magic on diaper rash or reddness or anything caused by the diaper.. I just love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best nappy (diaper) cream ever, I hate the US stuff that&#x27;s like jelly, sudocrem clears up babies bum with just one application, you only need a tiny amount to clear the skin up..love it!</li>
            <li> I run a small daycare at home and one of my moms brought this cream from Puerto Rico and allow me to use it on one of the babies that had a horrible rash, that turn out to be a yeast inFection. Nothing that the doctor gave this babys mom worked, but as soon as we started putting sudocrem(also known as Dermocrem in Puerto Rico) omg within a week the baby was clear of rash. I buy them now in any way possible. here in Florida you can&#x27;t find them so I send for them in Puerto Rico. It works wonders on EVERYTHING. I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE</li>
            <li> I am shocked at how poorly this stuff performed. My candida infection had cleared up completely. But I applied some of this cream, thinking it might help prevent future outbreaks. OUCH! Almost immediately, the red bumps and pain have returned. BEWARE, BEWARE, BEWARE.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> I have dry, chapped irritable fair skin (especially in winter) that also tends to break out. My hands get irritated too, and eczema can be a problem-especially during the cold-but even in summer as well.  I have used Eucerin, and this product has a pretty thick consistency like that-except it seems MUCH more soothing to my usually impossible skin. I am even trying it on some healing acne patches-so far it seems to calm the skin wherever I apply it. And that&#x27;s a good thing!</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing. It clears up diaper rash very quickly and can be used in armpits and in baby fat rolls to keep out moisture. Wonderful stuff.</li>
            <li> Not as affective as the 1st time use.</li>
            <li> Our European caregivers for our elderly mother insisted on this product for her care and it has worked preventing our mothers skin from breaking down.  good purchase, we order two at a time.</li>
            <li> This cream is the best product out there especially for diaper rash and the skin in the hot climate instead of lotion</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it -- felt like putting sticky paste on my skin.  Didn&#x27;t seem like you could get it soaked into your skin.  Didn&#x27;t help me.</li>
            <li> GREAT THAT WE CAN FINALLY BUY SUDACREM HERE IN THE US !!!! Best babycream &amp; all round go to it cream for the family. Kills &amp; cures all Diaper rash!!! I used it on my kids &amp; grand daughter &amp; now buying it again for the expected one!!!</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical about this cream - I received it from a friend of my sister-in-law (a complete stranger to me!) after she saw me blog about a baby butt-rash that would not die.  The jar boasts that it&#x27;s a cure for &#x27;nappy rash&#x27;, burns, rashes, and &#x27;chilblains&#x27;, as well as a few other things. I wasn&#x27;t sure what &#x27;chilblains&#x27; were, but it sure sounded like a flaky snake oil treatment to me. On the upside, it did smell nice, so I was willing to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream. Is. Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diaper-rash-of-rage was gone in a few days, and I stopped using the Sudocrem, returning to a more run-of-the-mill zinc paste. The rash came back, as I expected it to, by this point. (This baby butt is as sensitive as they come, and we have been battling rash since day 1!) Sudocrem cleared it up in record time again. Back to the other stuff. More rash. This time, I got wise, and now I use Sudocrem with every diaper change, and we haven&#x27;t had rash in more than 6 weeks now. I am a convert. And it goes a LONG way - using a thin smear with 10-15 diaper changes a day, my original tub is still more than half full. And did I mention how great it smells? Not willing to go without this item again, I ordered a four-pack to have some in the first aid kit and to make sure I NEVER run out. I have not yet tested it on sunburn or rashes (or chilblains!), but highly, HIGHLY recommend it for stubborn, sensitive diaper rashes.</li>
            <li> Good seller, good product. My son uses when he was born. Continue buying.</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on reviews.  I used this for my daughter&#x27;s chicken skin on the backs of her arms and no more chicken skin. Great product, goes on smooth and creamy.  Purchase, packaging and shipping were wonderful.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is good and no matter for baby or adult!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my baby!!</li>
            <li> We ask for an antiseptic cream and some friends recommend us Sudocrem and now we recommend it, Alonso our baby too, we love it!</li>
            <li> It is a good value and our customers love it at All-Scripts Pharmacy in Kissimmee, FL.</li>
            <li> i use it for my toddler since birth with each diaper change..its just perfect. my toddler never had diaper rash because of it</li>
            <li> I use this on my child to treat and prevent diaper rash. It&#x27;s very effective and often clears up a rash within 24 hours. It&#x27;s also soothing for burns and general antiseptic needs. My mother used this on me and I&#x27;m glad the product hasn&#x27;t changed over the decades. This just works and is ESSENTIAL for parents of diaper crapping aged children.</li>
