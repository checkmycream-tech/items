    <ol>
            <li> Its ok.  Nothing to write home about.  It is also not easily dispense.  A pump would be ideal for this size.</li>
            <li> I mixed both of these together with the silicon mix and straightened my hair (biracial with 3Cish curl pattern/kinky). My hair was super shiny the whole time it was straigtened without having to add oil etc to my hair weighing it down. Now that it&#x27;s curly  again I mixed all three together again and sat under the dryer about 30 mins and it&#x27;s super soft/managable. I wouldn&#x27;t however overuse due to protein buildup.</li>
            <li> I only use Dominican, Spanish and Brazilian deep conditioners and I absolutely love Kanechom Conditioners. They leave your hair soft, moisturized and healthy. I think I&#x27;ve tried them all and I have not found one that left me disappointed.</li>
            <li> great smell and leaves your hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but not a magic</li>
            <li> The kids were broken. Didn&#x27;t even get to use it.</li>
            <li> Thin... like the silicone mix better... i mix them... works ok</li>
            <li> Thanks great product fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived a day late and the top to one of the jars was closed crooked so some spilled out. It&#x27;s filled to the top so it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. Only a little spilled out. You get a lot for the price though!</li>
            <li> Best conditioners I have ever used, both of them work equally well on my daughter&#x27;s 3a hair and my 4b texturized hair</li>
            <li> Makes hair super soft, love it!</li>
            <li> These two mixed together was great</li>
            <li> so far i&#x27;ve used the butter treatment. made hair feel pretty good. my cousin says she mixes both together. i&#x27;ll be trying that next.  the containers are huge by the way. plus!</li>
            <li> Delivery was super quick.  Love these conditioners.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast service. Will buy again</li>
            <li> I would not recommend these to anyone. Both smell gross, and the goats milk made me gag. Tried both together and each alone and got no results.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer and easier to style than before.  i can go straight or natural with ease.</li>
            <li> I love the Karite Butter.  Can&#x27;t wait to try the goat milk product.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews. Mixed the Silicon Mix and the Kanechom Goat Milk conditioner together and let sit for 30 minutes with a plastic cap on my head  once I flat ironed my hair it looked Gorgeous! So much shine and body I had a lot of compliments that day on my hair I also used it (Silicone Mix with Kanechom Shea Butter mixed together) on my five year old niece&#x27;s hair let it sit for 30 minutes rinsed out then styled as usual my sister called the next day wanting to know what I put on her baby&#x27;s hair it was no longer dry it was soft and easy to comb through. This is a great product try it you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells good! But did nothing special for my hair.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is great. It is cranky without being really heavy and is great for co washing my bundled extensions before I distribute them. I also just it with the silicone mix by  Avanti.</li>
            <li> I ordered three of the Kanechom products, I love the Kanechom line. All three that I ordered smells amazing! These two are my favs. I will continue to use for a very long time. Both are keepers for me.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect combo. I use both of these along with the Silicon creme, for an amazing deep conditioning treatment. My curls are lusciously soft.</li>
            <li> I actually used them together sat under the hair dryer with a shower cap on for about 15-20 min and it made my hair so soft and silky, when I run out which will take a while ( very big jars) I will be purchasing more</li>
            <li> Worked great!  I did a mixture of this and Silicon Mix.  Gave some to a friend to try and she is a convert!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!! I have 4b/4c natural hair and it leaves my hair so soft and moisturized, and scents of both of the hair masks smell really good</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my 6 biracial daughters hair!!</li>
            <li> The only I have, is that one of the containers wasn&#x27;t closed properly and some product spilled in the box.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair super soft and healthy looking...every woman with 4c hair should be using these!</li>
            <li> My hair feels like silk. It amazing</li>
