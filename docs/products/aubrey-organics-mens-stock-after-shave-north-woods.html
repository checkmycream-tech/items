    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The SMELL itself is WONDERFUL.</li>
            <li>This fits the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Best of all, it&#x27;s a bargain compared to the fancy brand aftershaves.</li>
            <li>This aftershave has a pleasant fragrance and feels very good on the face.  </li>
            <li>Great inexpensive After Shave.</li>
            <li>great my husband loves them</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, good for the environment and not tested on animals!</li>
            <li>Pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>BUT OTHERWISE SMELLS GOOD..</li>
            <li>Great fragrance that&#x27;s animal testing free.</li>
            <li>Nice splash but scent dwindles on me after 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice but</li>
            <li>I would gladly purchase a cologne of this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I sure wish I could.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I absolutely love all the rest of their products.</li>
            <li>If you want this as an after shave, you will absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the fraquance and being a liquid!</li>
            <li>The scent is ok.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s why I love it on him.</li>
            <li>great fragrance, manly not a prissy !</li>
            <li>I recommend you allow your face to dry after shaving before you apply; it will feel more tingly... great scent!</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband because I initally liked the scent, but it really is super strong so after he shaves I ask him to stay away for a while so it dissipates.</li>
            <li>No harsh ingredients and a great scent.  </li>
            <li>This has very mild astringent qualities.</li>
            <li>I like strong aftershaves that burn quite a bit.</li>
            <li>You will like it if you like just a clean smell.</li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasant, but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>It is more woodsy and earth (and better in my opinion) than their blue scent called City Rhythms.    </li>
            <li>Not the Mysore Sandalwood scent that you would normally expect, more herbal.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty nice (for a natural product) and helped cool my face after a shave.</li>
            <li>you want something very light and natural...</li>
            <li>Will order again and recommend to anyone looking for a fresh outdoor smell.</li>
            <li>here is a manly after shave, the scent is for lack of a better word handsome, i would recommend to any guy who wants to impress and inspire those who may be close and personal.</li>
            <li>Decided this fraquance sounded interested for an after shave.</li>
            <li>I expected a nice pine woodsy scent</li>
            <li>If you want it as a powerful cologne, despite the fact it smells incredible, it is just not strong enough.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this after shave for my husband for years - he wanted something simple to do whatever aftershave does to his face after he shaves, and after his old scent was discontinued he asked me to pick a smell that I liked.  </li>
            <li>However, after trying other traditional/alcohol-based after-shaves, I&#x27;ve determined that the classic \\&quot;sting\\&quot; is better on my face.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>My skin feels cool and medicated with just enough sting to know it&#x27;s doing its thing.  </li>
            <li>It is masculine but didn&#x27;t smell very woodsy to me.</li>
            <li>The smell is weakish and mostly dissipates in a few minutes.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a &amp;#34;stronger&amp;#34; liquid aftershave for many years, but decided to try something new that wasn&#x27;t so harsh.  </li>
            <li>However since this fragrance smells a lot like Brut I decided to mix a little of these together(more North Woods than Brut) and sure enough it lasts longer when you do this and still retains the North Woods scent.</li>
            <li>The closest natural alternative to Drakkar that I have found so far.</li>
            <li>I bought this on Amazon because my local Whole Foods ran out.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is simple, clean smelling, not soapy or heavy, not headache-y, and very cooling -</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my Husband&#x27;s sensitive skin after shaving and he said it was gentler then his regular non-natural aftershave products.</li>
            <li>Got it because I use Natural Dry Pine Deodorant, but smell is non-existent.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I know, I know, it&#x27;s not a cologne, it&#x27;s an after shave. However, Aubrey Organics does not make a cologne and I was hoping this could be used as one. It cannot. The smell is weakish and mostly dissipates in a few minutes.    The SMELL itself is WONDERFUL. I would gladly purchase a cologne of this fragrance. I sure wish I could. It is more woodsy and earth (and better in my opinion) than their blue scent called City Rhythms.    HOWEVER, I absolutely love all the rest of their products. I use their shampoo, conditioner, lotions, shaving cream, facial cleanser (wife uses this one), hair gel, and deodorant.    If you want this as an after shave, you will absolutely love this. If you want it as a powerful cologne, despite the fact it smells incredible, it is just not strong enough.    Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very experienced with Aftershave but this seems to work alright.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance that&#x27;s animal testing free.</li>
            <li> This has very mild astringent qualities. I recommend you allow your face to dry after shaving before you apply; it will feel more tingly... great scent!</li>
            <li> I prefer a liquid after shave lotion. Decided this fraquance sounded interested for an after shave. I ordered it, not sure if I would like. Not dissapointed I tried it. Great inexpensive After Shave. Enjoy the fraquance and being a liquid! Will order again and recommend to anyone looking for a fresh outdoor smell.</li>
            <li> here is a manly after shave, the scent is for lack of a better word handsome, i would recommend to any guy who wants to impress and inspire those who may be close and personal.</li>
            <li> I used this for several months, but ultimately determined that I needed something stronger. It smells pretty nice (for a natural product) and helped cool my face after a shave. However, after trying other traditional/alcohol-based after-shaves, I&#x27;ve determined that the classic \\&quot;sting\\&quot; is better on my face.&lt;br /&gt;If you want something very light and natural... then I&#x27;d recommend it. It&#x27;s just not for me anymore.</li>
            <li> Got it because I use Natural Dry Pine Deodorant, but smell is non-existent.  Performs so-so otherwise.  :-(</li>
            <li> Nice splash but scent dwindles on me after 20 minutes. Not the Mysore Sandalwood scent that you would normally expect, more herbal.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t make me itch due to a skin allergy I developed.This was everything I was hoping for. Pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> Arrived 1/4 empty. It had leaked out during shipment. The fragrance is not all that bad but my husband did not care for it. I donated it out.</li>
            <li> No harsh ingredients and a great scent.  It is a lot less expensive too.  The closest natural alternative to Drakkar that I have found so far.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband because I initally liked the scent, but it really is super strong so after he shaves I ask him to stay away for a while so it dissipates.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s bad, either.</li>
            <li> SCENT DOESNT LAST LONG BUT OTHERWISE SMELLS GOOD..</li>
            <li> great my husband loves them</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, good for the environment and not tested on animals!</li>

The scent is very pleasant, but not overwhelming.  My skin feels cool and medicated with just enough sting to know it&#x27;s doing its thing.  Best of all, it&#x27;s a bargain compared to the fancy brand aftershaves. Even if you&#x27;re not into the &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; label you should give this a try.</li>
            <li> This aftershave has a pleasant fragrance and feels very good on the face.  I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my Husband&#x27;s sensitive skin after shaving and he said it was gentler then his regular non-natural aftershave products. The scent is nice but not really what I was expecting. It is masculine but didn&#x27;t smell very woodsy to me.</li>
            <li> great fragrance, manly not a prissy !</li>
            <li> This aftershave is very weak in my opinion. I like strong aftershaves that burn quite a bit. The scent was not at all what I expected. I expected a nice pine woodsy scent but it actually smells like Irish spring bar soap to me. You will like it if you like just a clean smell.</li>
            <li> The scent is ok.  Biggest drawback:  no atomizer.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon because my local Whole Foods ran out.  I&#x27;ve purchased this after shave for my husband for years - he wanted something simple to do whatever aftershave does to his face after he shaves, and after his old scent was discontinued he asked me to pick a smell that I liked.  This stuff is simple, clean smelling, not soapy or heavy, not headache-y, and very cooling - no spice, all pine, but without the danger of smelling like Pine Sol.  It&#x27;s the antithesis of Axe (gag) and that&#x27;s why I love it on him.</li>
