            <li> Keeps hair soft and manageable and gray hair does not yellow.</li>
            <li> best ever! Glad I could find it again after using it many many years ago.</li>
            <li> My husband loves Roffler products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 35 years and love it. I have not found another product that makes my hair feel as clean as this shampoo does after I have used it. My wife has even got to the point where she is now using it also.</li>
            <li> Only thing I might complain about was the lid was slightly loose&lt;br /&gt;and leaked a teaspoon of shampoo in the sealed bag.&lt;br /&gt;It was not a problem. Fast service-exact product.&lt;br /&gt;Very Happy.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for a couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;It controls excess oil better than any other product.</li>
            <li> The product is fine however, the shipping was less.  The container lid was not secured and the product leaked.  It was securely wrapped so it did not damage the shipping container.  Not a big deal but I thought you would like to know.</li>
            <li> My husband is blessed with a head full of hair and thanks to this shampoo his locks are shiny and look great but I have a hard time finding it local...with the convenience of home delivery...buying it at Amazon is a win win~</li>
            <li> My teen daughter&#x27;s thick, long hair was very difficult to get clean until we found this great shampoo. Now her hair is shiny and beautiful. This shampoo has a wonderful fragrance too!! We never buy anything else!</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo especially for dark brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;Price was good, well pakaged, and arrived timely.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder.</li>
            <li> Good bargain I use to buy this from my hair sylist and around same price but for a 14oz. bottle. Good lather and great just been to the barber smell</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> I have used for over 20 years and love it. Would not use any other shampoo but have trouble finding it locally.</li>
            <li> My barber introduced me to this product and I have used it for many years and continued to purchase it from him. My barber retired  a number of years ago, but he suggested an another shop that carried Roffler products. Finally last year this shop ceased carrying this product and I was at a loss, having used this product for about 20 years. (Could not find any other shops in town that carried Roffler.)&lt;br /&gt;Was very glad to find the product on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;The product produces thick suds and has a pleasant smell. It is fairly economical, only requireing a drop about the size of a dime to produce enough suds for a good shampooing.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Great shampoo, originally recommended by my barber but once I moved to another state started ordering online.  Great customer service.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product! I have oily hair and helps with that a lot. It also has a good smell!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, have used for years on course gray hair.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended!</li>
            <li> What a great hair shampoo.  Once you try this product you will keep using it for life.  Your hair will just PLAIN LOVE it.</li>
