            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>That was surprising because the bentonite is a very fine consistancy.</li>
            <li>Great quality at a great price and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This is really nice for my acne.</li>
            <li>I am using this to make my own deodorant.  </li>
            <li>It was nice.</li>
            <li>nicely sealed.</li>
            <li>any clay is important for good health  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered at a great price.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite bentonite clay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hopefully this will be available again soon!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>The clay adds an astringent to the face bar, and gives the shaving bar some slip for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>My first bentonite clay purchase and I am not disappointed. :)</li>
            <li>This product was much better than a clay I purchased at a higher price.</li>
            <li>The next day I gave it another good stir with a plastic fork and the lumps eventually disappeared.</li>
            <li>Full package, factory sealed.</li>
            <li>My clay would always come out super lumpy</li>
            <li>Quick shipment, product just as described, would order again.</li>
            <li>i love this product and most definitely will be ordering it again.  </li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>I did some of research and finally decided to just add warm water, mix, and let the clay sit overnight.</li>
            <li>I would also love If I can buy 2 pounds or more at once from a drop down menu.</li>
            <li>I used this on my face and I feels super clean, I also used this with my toothpast; same clean feeling as my face.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that I would be able to do more bentonite facials in place of my regular exfoliating, but I guess I&#x27;ll have to keep exfoliation as a part of my regular skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>Have used it for a yellow jacket sting and made a paste and put on bottom of feet for detox and really love the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>And the skin is clear &amp; smooth.  </li>
            <li>This clay makes my skin so much better and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The clay is very fine, almost tasteless, and mixes very easily.  </li>
            <li>It is a natural substance straight from nature.</li>
            <li>Tried this product for the first time, so whether it is good or bad, I will have to try again.</li>

            <li> I have heard you can ingest at low amounts, but I&#x27;m not interested in trying this.  </li>
            <li> I have other internal detox steps I take.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it took at least a year off my face!</li>

            <li> Everything I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to do a bath detox, then I discovered that you can put it in your hair along with other products for a &amp;#34;co-wash&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I used the bentonite clay in two soaps, one was a shaving bar for men and the other was a face bar.</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way!</li>
            <li> but I did notice after rinsing the clay off my face that it was trying to remove the dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about the clay was that it was very difficult to mix.</li>
            <li> SO disappointed because I bought 8 of them!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is really nice for my acne. I tried tons of different products from the store, but it either didn&#x27;t keep the acne away or hurt my skin. This clay makes my skin so much better and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  I am using this to make my own deodorant.  Its working very nicely.</li>
            <li> any clay is important for good health  I call clay the invisible Docter</li>
            <li> This seems to be a quality product.  I used it in the shaving soap I make for my husband and son and it performed well and did what it was supposed to do (slip).</li>
            <li> excellent qualify clay, use it on facials and skin powders.</li>
            <li> Great quality at a great price and fast shipping! I use this for everything, but specifically to  make diaper rash cream and face masks. I love it!</li>
            <li> I used the clay as a facial. It was nice. Felt good on the skin. It didnt give me jaw dropping results but I did notice after rinsing the clay off my face that it was trying to remove the dead skin cells. I was hoping that I would be able to do more bentonite facials in place of my regular exfoliating, but I guess I&#x27;ll have to keep exfoliation as a part of my regular skin care regimen. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about the clay was that it was very difficult to mix. That was surprising because the bentonite is a very fine consistancy. My clay would always come out super lumpy no matter what I mixed it with. I did some of research and finally decided to just add warm water, mix, and let the clay sit overnight. The next day I gave it another good stir with a plastic fork and the lumps eventually disappeared.</li>
            <li> Tried this product for the first time, so whether it is good or bad, I will have to try again.</li>
            <li> nicely sealed. good product.</li>
            <li> i use this product on skin breakouts it works well,i have been using it for about 3 weeks now. i could not find this product in any store.</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised.  Arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to do a bath detox, then I discovered that you can put it in your hair along with other products for a &amp;#34;co-wash&amp;#34;. What I discovered is that all bentonite clay is created equal. For some reason this clay does NOT react to the added products as those I saw on video, which might explain why it was so inexpensive. SO disappointed because I bought 8 of them!</li>
            <li> Please stock this back up! This is my favorite bentonite clay. I use this in my clay hair cleansing mix! It leaves my hair so smooth and silky. I would also love If I can buy 2 pounds or more at once from a drop down menu. (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this will be available again soon! Thanks.</li>
            <li> Received my order faster than I expected. Exactly what I ordered at a great price.</li>

            <li> Got here on time. It works great on my face and hair. I&#x27;m satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Good quality . Note it is gray which will color your soap or product</li>
            <li> Good product and service</li>

            <li> i love this product and most definitely will be ordering it again.  i use it when i soak my feet in epsom salts each week.  i add the bentonite clay, lavender oil, tea tree oil, and vinegar.</li>

            <li> This clay is THE BEST for cleaning &amp; detoxing from head to toe....YES you can put this on your hair &amp; all over the body.  Hair results are wonderful!!
