            <li>Expedited quickly, too!</li>

            <li>Gentle cleanser that really cleanses!!!!  </li>
            <li>Another product that I loved was their matt finish Uber Dry Sunscreen SPF 20.</li>
            <li>so I go through twice as much!!</li>
            <li>Such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>I rarely ever write reviews</li>
            <li>I love how clean it makes my skin feel and totally helps with preventing breakouts!</li>
            <li>This review is based on my first impression.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like chamomile.</li>
            <li>stuff is so gentle, and leaves my skin feeling soft, fresh and clean w/o stripping away all the&lt;br /&gt;natural oils and causing the skin to tighten.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Why are they discontinuing their most effective products and replacing them with crap like this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to go to Proactiv+ for an effective BPO product, but wanted something gentle and botanical for my off days.</li>
            <li>Cant use soap or most cleansers because they dry my skin&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even though it cost more than your average product, I do believe it&#x27;s worth it</li>
            <li>Upon consistent use, it actually helps my complexion to appear not only clear, but also soft, smooth, giving it a more even tone!</li>
            <li>I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you are after a gentle soothing cleanser with chamomile and natural herbal extracts, you&#x27;d be better off at your local health food store, because this Chamomile Cleansing Lotion by Peter Thomas Roth is just.....shampoo!</li>
            <li>Gentle, thorough cleansing from the skin care experts.</li>
            <li>Face is much smoother for my wife.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
            <li>Even washes makeup really well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very obtain satisfactory result.</li>
            <li>Not for everyday usage if you have sensitive skin, good product</li>
            <li>I think this cleanser is better than the other gentle cleansers made by Peter Thomas Roth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with any skin type.  </li>
            <li>Face actually feels soooooo nice and soft after unlike any other cleanser I have tried.</li>
            <li>first, I did not like my washing experience with this product, but after giving it a chance, I feel compelled to correct my initial review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin clean and smooth without irritating it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mixed race and my skin is generally healthy but can be a little oily in the summer months.</li>
            <li>The description states, \\&quot;Chamomile Cleansing Lotion with soothing chamomile and natural herbal extracts for all skin types including sensitive.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This face wash helps me maintain soft, acne free skin without any harsh ingredients.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase this item again and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Having acne prone oily skin, I decided to try the chamomile after reading reviews that it helped others with similar type skin, thus far I have seen no improvement going in over two months.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to leave my previous review below as I feel there is still some useful info for potential buyers and those suffering from acne-prone or oily-combination</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my skin when I use it</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> PTR always delivers.  Such an amazing product. Gentle cleanser that really cleanses!!!!  Expedited quickly, too!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, and a little oily. Cant use soap or most cleansers because they dry my skin&lt;br /&gt;out, which makes the oil glands overproduce oil.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is so gentle, and leaves my skin feeling soft, fresh and clean w/o stripping away all the&lt;br /&gt;natural oils and causing the skin to tighten.&lt;br /&gt;I only use a small amount, lima bean size blob, and lukewarm water.&lt;br /&gt;It smells strange, not at all like chamomile, it if any gets in my mouth, the taste is aweful, but it really&lt;br /&gt;makes my face look good.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is to correct my previous review written below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I did not like my washing experience with this product, but after giving it a chance, I feel compelled to correct my initial review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can almost replace my Proactiv+ with this Chamomile cleansing lotion. It controls my acne without drying my skin. It leaves my skin feeling clean and supple. Upon consistent use, it actually helps my complexion to appear not only clear, but also soft, smooth, giving it a more even tone! I think this cleanser is better than the other gentle cleansers made by Peter Thomas Roth. I will definitely purchase this item again and highly recommend it. Very effective product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to leave my previous review below as I feel there is still some useful info for potential buyers and those suffering from acne-prone or oily-combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to swear by Peter Thomas Roth&#x27;s products when they (the BPO line) cleared up my acne problem of 10 years. Then they discontinued it! Another product that I loved was their matt finish Uber Dry Sunscreen SPF 20. They discontinued that too! Why are they discontinuing their most effective products and replacing them with crap like this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to go to Proactiv+ for an effective BPO product, but wanted something gentle and botanical for my off days. So, trustingly, I decided to try this Chamomile Cleansing lotion. I have yet to see how my skin responds to this product over the long term. This review is based on my first impression. The description states, \\&quot;Chamomile Cleansing Lotion with soothing chamomile and natural herbal extracts for all skin types including sensitive.\\&quot;  This morning, it literally felt like I was washing my face with Suave shampoo. This cleanser has a pearlescent appearance that reminds me of shampoo. The odor is not of chamomile, or oat, or coconut extracts. This cleanser smells like....Suave shampoo! It even lathers like shampoo! (Unlikeother cleansers from this company.)  I am very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give it chance to see if it betters my complexion, and if it does happen to help me achieve that peaches &amp; cream glow, I will recant &amp; give it a better review; but in the meantime, I&#x27;ll list the ingredients &amp; let you decided for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Water, Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate, Sodium Trideceth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betain, Glycerin, Lauramide DEA, Glycol Stearate, Stearamide AMP, Oleic Acid, Coconut Acid, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria) Flower Extract, Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract, Symphytum Officinale Extract, Propylene Glycol, Butylene Glycol, Carbomer, Disodium EDTA, Triethanolamine, Methylparaben, Sodium Hydroxide, Propylparaben, Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are after a gentle soothing cleanser with chamomile and natural herbal extracts, you&#x27;d be better off at your local health food store, because this Chamomile Cleansing Lotion by Peter Thomas Roth is just.....shampoo!</li>
