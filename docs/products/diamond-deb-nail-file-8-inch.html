            <li>Great product - does the job</li>

            <li>not having it.&lt;br /&gt;I found that they are still available on Amazon and was delighted.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for making these wonderful nail files available.</li>
            <li>This is the kind of file my Grandmother taught me to file my nails with.</li>
            <li>nice quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve needed a file for the ol&#x27; toenails as well as fingernails for a while and often these kind of files are prohibitively expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to understand</li>
            <li>Nice to have so many.  </li>
            <li>A good nail file which does the job quickly.</li>
            <li>I like many, have had my 8&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love the Diamond Deb Nail file.</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>I pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Simply the very best nail file on the planet.</li>
            <li>and I love them both.</li>
            <li>Love it and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I had one of these nail files that I bought many years ago.</li>
            <li>I was so glad to be able to purchase another one here at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over thirty years and still love it.</li>
            <li>I was glad these are still available!</li>
            <li>So much more of a refined finished product than an emery board.</li>
            <li>So much better than an emery board</li>
            <li>I got it fast and am happily keeping my nail neat and trimmed.</li>
            <li>Love this one.</li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Still love it.  </li>
            <li>THE BEST AND ONLY...</li>
            <li>BUT You will not find a better value.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t exactly rave over it, but it&#x27;s just a good file.</li>
            <li>the perfect file - fine grit, keeps nails from splitting, flexible enough to get under toenails too.  </li>
            <li>Believe it or not,  I was still using my original one!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve sure gotten my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li>Having three sizes also makes it easy to put one in your purse, car and bathroom.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend buying this brand.</li>
            <li>This Diamond Deb doesn&#x27;t have as fine a finish on it.  </li>
            <li>They are made cheaply in China .</li>
            <li>So happy to finally have another one after 35 years.  </li>
            <li>Leaves your nails quite not as smooth as some of the others I have used.  </li>
            <li>of them lasts like or has the smooth feel of a Diamond Deb.  </li>
            <li>It does not become smooth</li>
            <li>It works great as it is much more efficient than an emery board, but doesn&#x27;t rough up the nail edge.</li>
            <li>not quite the quality as the early diamond debs but still files good</li>
            <li>The surface allows me to file my nails quickly and keeps the filed edges smooth.</li>
            <li>and they didn&#x27;t get good reviews last time</li>
            <li>It was shipped  rather quickly also.  </li>
            <li>I will have to use it for quick removal, then resort to another file for finishing the job.</li>
            <li>I have had these nail files many times and don&#x27;t want any other kind.  </li>
            <li>Neither side is fine enough to do neat, comfortable look.</li>
            <li>It has done the job of filing and shaping my fingernails easily and professionally for all these years.</li>
            <li>more coarse than when made in U.S.</li>
            <li>This file is exactly like the one I purchase for myself in 1968</li>
            <li>THANKS!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what my mother wanted and I couldn&#x27;t find it in any store.</li>
            <li>This is exactly the product I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have even used it to smooth plastic and metal that was snagging on something, and it still had the strength and oomph of its early days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And the order came fast, fast, fast!!</li>
            <li>and it is almost the same good quality as the old one, although the new one is made in China.</li>
            <li>I have gone through so many &#x27;retail nail files&#x27; in the past and was not expecting much more from this particular product.</li>
            <li>They are very good files and will last a very long time if my past experience proves true!  </li>
            <li>and I like how it still comes with a coarse and fine side.</li>
            <li>ordered some from this site and am very upset.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This seller had an eight inch one for a reasonable price and included a case.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>and he gave me his whole dissertation on Diamond Deb.  </li>
            <li>have had so many other nail files along the way.  </li>
            <li>The file seems to be just a bit thicker and a bit more stiff than my old one, but it has the same filing surface that I know and love.</li>
            <li>The new one is thicker, the diamond crystals are larger so it gives a rougher cut, and the point on the end meant for cleaning under your nails is rounded, so it doesn&#x27;t clean as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>In my opinion this is the only brand of nail files worth buying.</li>
            <li>would like a refund for the new ones I ordered ...</li>
            <li>Oh well, if I do, I will keep that one and give the new ones away.</li>
            <li>I prefer these files to many files on the market and they last a very long time!!  </li>
            <li>And I have a bit of my early Christmas shopping done too!</li>
            <li>brand of nail file in my family for the last 80 years that I am aware of.  </li>
            <li>so I never did buy new ones to replace my old one</li>
            <li>I have 8 now,  6 old ones and two new ones.  </li>
            <li>They do seem to be just like the old ones only a little better because they are new.  </li>
            <li>She has had an old one for 20 years.</li>
            <li>I have natural nails, not artificial!!!&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, this one and hers are identical</li>
            <li>and my decades-old case was still soft and pliable.</li>
            <li>I have an old Diamond Deb, stamped made in the USA.</li>
            <li>I had an old Diamond Deb that I had used for years</li>
            <li>but I thought they are so old they should be replaced.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still keep the old ones.  </li>
            <li>just like their old ones.</li>
            <li>I lost my old Diamondeb file and looked online to find another</li>
            <li>I have one that is probably 25 years old and it finally has worn out, so I decided that i needed a new one.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected, and delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li>Hers  has been around for at least 60 years and it still in tip top shape and is the same Diamond Deb brand as this one.</li>
            <li>I have several of these that are very very old.  </li>
            <li>Yes, They will eventually have to be replaced, they will cost a little more than other look-alike files...</li>
            <li>I threw my original file away over five years ago because it finally became dull.  </li>

            <li> I bought this for my mother-in-law. She has had an old one for 20 years. This replaced the warn out one.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, and delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> I have this file in 4&amp;#34; and 6&amp;#34; and now I have it in 8&amp;#34;. They are the best nail files ever!</li>
            <li> Good quality nail file.</li>
            <li> I like many, have had my 8&amp;#34; Diamond Deb nail files for at least 30 years. They are made in the USA. I have two 6&amp;#34; ones as well.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered some from this site and am very upset.&lt;br /&gt;I would like a refund for the new ones I ordered ... They are made cheaply in China . THE METAL PIECES HAVE COME OFF WHILE I AM FILING AND CUT INTO AND STUCK IN THE SIDES OF MY NAIL BEDS.. DANGEROUS LIKE LITTLE RAZOR BLADES AND VERY PAINFUL and it has happened with two I have used. Very poor craftsmanship. Had I not been capable with magnifying glass and fine tweezers, I would have had to go to the hospital emergency room to get them out!!!! I am extremely upset and disappointed. Had I used them on my poor 97 yo mother in the nursing home it would have been devastating. I have natural nails, not artificial!!!&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE ADVISE!!!!!</li>
            <li> What can I say more than it&#x27;s a good nail file. No problems here. I can&#x27;t exactly rave over it, but it&#x27;s just a good file.</li>
            <li> I love the Diamond Deb Nail file. Had one for years but lost it.</li>
            <li> I bought this after having used my grandmother&#x27;s diamond nail file every time I go to her house. Hers  has been around for at least 60 years and it still in tip top shape and is the same Diamond Deb brand as this one. As far as I can tell, this one and hers are identical so I expect it to last forever. It works great as it is much more efficient than an emery board, but doesn&#x27;t rough up the nail edge.</li>
            <li> more coarse than when made in U.S.</li>
            <li> I had one years ago, as a hairstylist, and was never able to get another one like I had in the extra long length.  So happy to finally have another one after 35 years.  Believe it or not,  I was still using my original one!</li>
            <li> This file is exactly like the one I purchase for myself in 1968 and I love it.  I threw my original file away over five years ago because it finally became dull.  I don&#x27;t see any difference with Made in USA vs. Made in China.  So happy to have another (I ordered two).</li>
            <li> this is my go to file now!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> This Diamond Deb doesn&#x27;t have as fine a finish on it.  Leaves your nails quite not as smooth as some of the others I have used.  I would order it again though because I like Diamond Deb nail files.</li>
            <li> It was perfect tell I lost it</li>
            <li> Nail file was everything I had hoped fore. Looks as though it may hold up well. One side could have been a little finer grit, but this will do. I pleased with it. It was shipped  rather quickly also.  THANKS!</li>
            <li> Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what my mother wanted and I couldn&#x27;t find it in any store. I was happy to find it online here.&lt;br /&gt;  And she&#x27;s happy to have this file.</li>
            <li> it is just what I was looking for.  I had one like this one for 40 years and lost it.  So happy to find another just like the one I lost.</li>
            <li> Simply the very best nail file on the planet. I have two sizes and I love them both. They last forever.</li>
            <li> the perfect file - fine grit, keeps nails from splitting, flexible enough to get under toenails too.  My mother gave me one &amp;#62;60 yr ago  I still have it, but finally wore it down enough that I needed a replacement.  I&#x27;ll die before this one wears out - maybe I can will it to my granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Great product - does the job</li>
            <li> Disappointed. File creates uneven nail. Neither side is fine enough to do neat, comfortable look.</li>
            <li> It does the job smooth cutting snag eliminating. long lasting unobtainable locally. have had 1 or 2 previously. thank you.</li>
            <li> Best nail file ever for aggressive use.  Love it and will buy again.</li>
            <li> I had one of these nail files that I bought many years ago. It continued to function beautifully, but I somehow lost it. I was so glad to be able to purchase another one here at Amazon. The file seems to be just a bit thicker and a bit more stiff than my old one, but it has the same filing surface that I know and love. The surface allows me to file my nails quickly and keeps the filed edges smooth. My only tiny tiny complaint is that the blue-and-clear plastic case that came with it is quite brittle and broke as I was taking it out of the packaging. That is a small thing and certainly doesn&#x27;t affect the function of the file itself. It&#x27;s just a bit annoying that this new case failed immediately and my decades-old case was still soft and pliable. Still, I think the file itself deserves five stars. I&#x27;d buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> not quite the quality as the early diamond debs but still files good and I like how it still comes with a coarse and fine side.</li>
            <li> A good nail file which does the job quickly.</li>
            <li> I like a metal diamond file and am happy with it though I&#x27;d rather it had finer grit on one side.</li>
            <li> I have had these nail files many times and don&#x27;t want any other kind.  I even gave them to friends for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have an old Diamond Deb, stamped made in the USA. The one I just received, stamped CHINA, is inferior to the one I already have which is at least 30 years old. The new one is thicker, the diamond crystals are larger so it gives a rougher cut, and the point on the end meant for cleaning under your nails is rounded, so it doesn&#x27;t clean as well. I will have to use it for quick removal, then resort to another file for finishing the job. Too bad, because I went to a lot of trouble to find the Diamond Deb.</li>
            <li> I buy these all the time.  These are the only files we will use.  My husband plays the guitar and he swears by them.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over thirty years and still love it. The diamond dust files your nails perfectly. Having three sizes also makes it easy to put one in your purse, car and bathroom. It&#x27;s a must have!</li>
            <li> The best.  Never wear out!!</li>
            <li> These files are hard to come by!  I had an old Diamond Deb that I had used for years and now I cannot find it.  I prefer these files to many files on the market and they last a very long time!!  I ordered 3 of them.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe this nail file still exsisted!  And the order came fast, fast, fast!!</li>
            <li> Great!  I was glad these are still available!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t received this yet, but I know I&#x27;m going to like it since I cannot find the one I had.</li>
            <li> So much more of a refined finished product than an emery board.</li>
            <li> This is exactly the product I was looking for. My father had one years ago and I wanted to replace it. Diamond deb files last for ever. So much better than an emery board</li>
            <li> I got my Damond Deb about 1970.  I lost it about a year ago when my cat took it somewhere, and have been mourning it ever since.&lt;br /&gt;I had looked in stores for one several times to give as gifts and never found any, si when I lost it, I thought they weren&#x27;t being made anymore. Believe me, if I knew they were still being made, it would not have taken me a day to go out and buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had so many other nail files along the way.  Trying them out or getting one for the purse, the car, etc.  Even one that was supposed to have ruby crystals imbedded!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of them lasts like or has the smooth feel of a Diamond Deb.  I have even used it to smooth plastic and metal that was snagging on something, and it still had the strength and oomph of its early days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am getting two 8\\&quot; ones and a 6\\&quot; 6 pcak.  Never again will I be without my Diamond Deb!  And I have a bit of my early Christmas shopping done too! ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course you know what this means.... I will find the missing Diamond Deb the day after I get this shipment.  Sigh.  Oh well, if I do, I will keep that one and give the new ones away. 42 years I&#x27;ve had that file, and I would still prefer it above all others!</li>
            <li> Diamond Deb nail files are the best. This seller had an eight inch one for a reasonable price and included a case. I got it fast and am happily keeping my nail neat and trimmed. A must for a gardener. Thanks.</li>
            <li> In my opinion this is the only brand of nail files worth buying. I have one that is probably 25 years old and it finally has worn out, so I decided that i needed a new one. It has done the job of filing and shaping my fingernails easily and professionally for all these years. I would strongly recommend buying this brand.</li>
            <li> They are very good files and will last a very long time if my past experience proves true!  what more can I say!</li>
            <li> great nail file!  It does not become smooth like many other files do which of course renders them useless!  Love this one.</li>
            <li> We misplaced our Diamond Deb nail file we have had for 40 years and were at a loss not having it.&lt;br /&gt;I found that they are still available on Amazon and was delighted.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon for making these wonderful nail files available. They are great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T Clark</li>
            <li> Purchased as gift and she loved it! Great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Works great. I&#x27;d buy it again and recommend it to friends. Just what I&#x27;ve been looking for for several years.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these files in 1975.  Still use. Still love it.  I paid $2.00 for it back then and I&#x27;ve sure gotten my money&#x27;s worth!</li>
            <li> This is the kind of file my Grandmother taught me to file my nails with. Best file made in my book!</li>
            <li> Very easy to understand</li>
            <li> I found this size inconveniently long, so I returned it and got the 6&amp;#34; instead.</li>
            <li> I have several of these that are very very old.  They work great but I thought they are so old they should be replaced.  I know they sold and moved their company and they didn&#x27;t get good reviews last time I checked  so I never did buy new ones to replace my old one but now I see they have good reviews again so I guess they improved and went back to what they used to be.  They do seem to be just like the old ones only a little better because they are new.  I&#x27;ll still keep the old ones.  I keep one in my travel bag, my bathroom and my purse.  My husband keeps on in his travel bag and his dresser and his desk.  Nice to have so many.  I have 8 now,  6 old ones and two new ones.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Good file but should have purchased the next shortest size.  Eight inches is a lot of nail file to fan around.</li>
            <li> very nice. just like their old ones. nice quality.</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many &#x27;retail nail files&#x27; in the past and was not expecting much more from this particular product.But upon delivery the quality and duribility is superior in all respect! I expect that this product will perform well for a long time.</li>
            <li> Diamond Deb has been the ...check that...THE BEST AND ONLY...brand of nail file in my family for the last 80 years that I am aware of.  My Dad was a band leader back in the 1920&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s.  He worked the same band circuit as Guy Lombardo and Lawrence Welk. He was always meticulously groomed and dressed in public.  As a boy I picked up one of his Diamond Deb files at home and he gave me his whole dissertation on Diamond Deb.  I have used nothing else for decades.  You will get years of service from one Diamond Deb. Yes, They will eventually have to be replaced, they will cost a little more than other look-alike files...BUT You will not find a better value.  Try a cheaper file and you will be back for a Diamond Deb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve needed a file for the ol&#x27; toenails as well as fingernails for a while and often these kind of files are prohibitively expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one gets the job done, is sturdy and affordable. Excellent.</li>
            <li> I lost my old Diamondeb file and looked online to find another and it is almost the same good quality as the old one, although the new one is made in China.</li>
            <li> no better file anywhere!</li>
