            <li>WITH THE HIGH PRICE OF A HAIRCUT TODAY, THIS IS A WELCOME FRIEND IN MY HOME.</li>
            <li>glad there was one available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I got  it fast and for good price,,,,I plan to use it when I am on the road which is quite often</li>
            <li>/&gt;delivery was fast and the price was fair...</li>
            <li>Everything I said here is absolutely true!</li>
            <li>Moreimportently, it was easy enoughto use that I could get rid of the shaggy look.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do too well when I first took it out of the package, but have found that the more I use it the better it trims.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Cheap, easy to use.</li>
            <li>and it works fine for me but</li>
            <li>THEY WORK JUST FINE FOR MY HEAD.</li>
            <li>What a huge disapointment.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to operate and clean up is a breeze.</li>
            <li>Just-A-Trim sent me a quality product and performed quality customer service to completly make my recent purchase a great experience.</li>
            <li>This is a cheap, impractical device.</li>
            <li>I have have purchased Just A Trim in the passed and I can unequivocally say that this item is not as well made, it is in fact cheaply made</li>
            <li>Mytrips to the barber now go to make sure that the back of my head looks as good as the front.</li>
            <li>Although this product is all right, I have seen better.  </li>
            <li>The blades last quite a while;  I was able to order blades about a year ago, but I have not been able to find any more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;like the instructions say use it like a comb and take your time , remove and clean the guide and clean the blade often to keep it from getting clogged with hair&lt;</li>
            <li>This item really doesnt work like it claims, the trimmer pulls the hair more than it does cuts it.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Not bad this article, but says it is error proof and</li>
            <li>Just use the little duster thing they provide to wipe off the hair and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
            <li>Sits up on the counter, doesn&#x27;t take up much room and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Put fresh batteries in as per the instructions, and the machine didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>and they responded promptly and satisfied my needs completely.</li>
            <li>However, the convenience and safety of this product make it well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The motor doesn&#x27;t run smoothly, even on brand new batteries.</li>
            <li>Hard to Find, but great product.  </li>
            <li>I try to wait 3 weeks, but my hair is short and that is the most mileage I can get out of a salon haircut.  </li>
            <li>You can comb/trim and then comb with a regular comb and see how much more hair you want to take out.  </li>
            <li>I bought one of these several years ago and was extremely satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>I know this isn&#x27;t exactly what the Just-A-Trim was designed for, but I use mine for my cats.</li>
            <li>I bought my first one of these about 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>But the first time I dropped this one, all but 2 of the teeth broke off the plastic sleeve.</li>
            <li>After many years of use, the first finally wore out.</li>
            <li>I had the first one for almost 10 years and never had a problem with it.  </li>
            <li>This too is a very small and nice and easy to use groomer to have on hand.</li>
            <li>Have used this trimmer before and was satisfied, however this time it appears the trimmer had beeb around too long</li>
            <li>All it did was pull my hair out as the motor isn&#x27;t strong enough</li>
            <li>Hope yours has a nice tight trimming adjustment slide.</li>
            <li>Nothing too much to say about this product.</li>
            <li>I have two very furry cats and they tend to get mats in their fur.</li>
            <li>It works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>This product really does fill a market niche and enables metered hair removal.</li>
            <li>I am being way too generous in giving one star for the slightest good thing this guy is doing, which he is probably forced to do by Amazon.</li>
            <li>Also, in 10 years I&#x27;m sure I dropped the other trimmer  ore than once, and had lost a tooth because of it.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend not buying this product.</li>
            <li>They are all new sealed in the box and never opened.</li>
            <li>Even if this product broke down after a few months, you would still get your money&#x27;s worth because you are able to extend the time til you get a new haircut.  </li>
            <li>I am a 73 year old man with a full head of hair and, I cut and have been cutting my own hair for years with the Just A Trim trimer</li>
            <li>Even for that, it after just one month quick working entirely and after that I used it as a back stratcher until the extended handle broke.</li>
            <li>Since you are in actuality combing the trimmer in the direction that you want it to go, you can actually see how much is coming out after each run through.  </li>
            <li>But then, Just a trim doesn&#x27;t argue with me,so I think Justatrim will be with me a long timesince it seems very durable!</li>
            <li>I still have my old one.</li>
            <li>I used it probably 60 times in 10 years to lightly, or sometimes heavily trim my head hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used the half shears/comb and that worked a little but the Just a Trim trimmer handles that hands down incredibly.  </li>
            <li>The ONLY downside is that when the blades dull you must replace the whole product as replacement blades aren&#x27;t available.</li>
            <li>If the manufacturer would only make one with a longer handle and a heavy duty clipper, they would have a huge market.</li>
            <li>Only problem is that it is a real pain to open to replace batteries.</li>
            <li>and when I&#x27;m done I clean the hair from the sink and flush it down the toilet so the sink drain doesn&#x27;t get clogged with hair</li>
            <li>the first thing I did to my son who has 2 years of age were many cockroaches in her hair by cutting him with this article.</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair for an older lady/65 and a week after a haircut, my hair has gotten full again and looks like it needs another trim.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, quiet, and works quickly and won&#x27;t hurt them.</li>
            <li>It was actually still working fine, but I had to squeeze it tightly to keep the battery connection firm, so I bought this one as a replacement.</li>

            <li> It was actually still working fine, but I had to squeeze it tightly to keep the battery connection firm, so I bought this one as a replacement.</li>
            <li> My hair is not that thick, and it was certainly much thicker 10 years ago, so obviously they have cheapened the quality to the point that you cannot trim head-hair.  </li>
            <li> and/or the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough to cut hair.</li>
            <li> Mine came with a loose triming guide slide, which slides out of place when using.</li>
            <li> I had the same experience as a previous reviewer who bought a non-functional product.  </li>
            <li> I used it only for trimming hair \\&quot;down below\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> This doggone thing works, if you are careful and don&#x27;t get into a rush</li>
            <li> would I go through the trouble of re-packaging and sending back a $12dlls product?</li>
            <li> No more \\&quot;too\\&quot; short bangs.</li>
            <li> like any trimmer you should use trimmer oil or 3 in 1 oil on the blade to keep it sharp longer</li>
            <li> If you are careless or a klutz it will take a chunk out of your hair and leave a large nick.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> Only problem is replacement blades are not available, so you just have to buy a new one when the blades stop cutting.</li>
            <li> I used to go for a hair cut every month and a half, but now I can keep my \\&quot;do\\</li>
            <li> I have my shaggy bangs in 2 minutes or less.  </li>
            <li> I did consider just keeping it, or just throwing it away, but this is SO wrong, and this is so upsetting that I am actually going through the trouble of writing this review and returning the item because a) this people shouldn&#x27;t get away with it, and b)to prevent another customer from having the same experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess it just needed to be used a little to loosen up the cutters.  </li>
            <li> These little items can pay for themselves after a few months.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Was a waste of money I think.</li>
            <li> I was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for and this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had never had such a poor experience on amazon.</li>
            <li> He does not have very thick or long hair</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great product, thank you!</li>
            <li> I had the same experience as a previous reviewer who bought a non-functional product.  Put fresh batteries in as per the instructions, and the machine didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I have owned two of these Just A Trim trimers and have wore two of them out!! I use them a lot. I am a 73 year old man with a full head of hair and, I cut and have been cutting my own hair for years with the Just A Trim trimer it does a great job!!! .......Charlie</li>
            <li> Nothing too much to say about this product. It gets the job done. It&#x27;s easy to operate and clean up is a breeze. Just use the little duster thing they provide to wipe off the hair and you&#x27;re good to go! This will trim any hair that you have on your body. The extending handle is also a plus.</li>
            <li> This doggone thing works, if you are careful and don&#x27;t get into a rush It will give you a very nice trim. If you are careless or a klutz it will take a chunk out of your hair and leave a large nick. Mine came with a loose triming guide slide, which slides out of place when using. always my luck...if a product has an anomoly it is this one that I will receive. Can&#x27;t sell this one short though, it works just be heedful of its potential to nick when using it. Hope yours has a nice tight trimming adjustment slide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend only 1 change to the device -- shorter &amp;#34;combs&amp;#34; for guys like me who want to achieve a shorter trim! I&#x27;ve actually shortened one of the combs with sandpaper or saw! [have used this product for many years]!</li>
            <li> Just-A-Trim sent me a quality product and performed quality customer service to completly make my recent purchase a great experience. I will not hesitate to order again from this company. I had to contact this company with questions about product and they responded promptly and satisfied my needs completely.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do too well when I first took it out of the package, but have found that the more I use it the better it trims.  I guess it just needed to be used a little to loosen up the cutters.  I used to go for a hair cut every month and a half, but now I can keep my \\&quot;do\\&quot; up by myself and save $30.  I plan on getting another one if this one ever conks out.</li>
            <li> This trimmer can keep your hair looking well trimmed 365 days a year! Your barber will not be seeing you quite as often. Pays for itself over and over.</li>
            <li> Tried this product and it does not cut hair. Must be something wrong with it. Waste of my money. Would highly recommend not buying this product.</li>
            <li> For a man that has embarrassing back hair, this product helps solve the problem. If the manufacturer would only make one with a longer handle and a heavy duty clipper, they would have a huge market.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 2 years for my bangs.I love it. It allows me cut them the length I want, when I want to. No more \\&quot;too\\&quot; short bangs. I only ordered another as I couldn&#x27;t find replacement blades for the one I had.This product is great.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have very thick hair for an older lady/65 and a week after a haircut, my hair has gotten full again and looks like it needs another trim.  I try to wait 3 weeks, but my hair is short and that is the most mileage I can get out of a salon haircut.  About 4 months ago, I bought this product as I wanted to give it a try.  Since you are in actuality combing the trimmer in the direction that you want it to go, you can actually see how much is coming out after each run through.  You can comb/trim and then comb with a regular comb and see how much more hair you want to take out.  Also I always tells the haircutter to make my bangs shaggy, but no one ever seems able to do that.  I have used the half shears/comb and that worked a little but the Just a Trim trimmer handles that hands down incredibly.  I have my shaggy bangs in 2 minutes or less.  Even if this product broke down after a few months, you would still get your money&#x27;s worth because you are able to extend the time til you get a new haircut.  It is quite remarkable.  Sits up on the counter, doesn&#x27;t take up much room and easy to use.  I love it!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Justatrim has saved me a great deal of money, as I can do my own hairstyling and the upkeep. When you have short hair, it requires a lot of maintenance.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo2XTKEHDHZ8XIO]]Great Product, if you&#x27;re like me and need something to help trim body hair this is a pretty nice and handy tool.  It&#x27;s Cheap, easy to use. What else is there to say!?</li>
            <li> jUST a TRIMcuts downonmy trips to the barber consequently  Isaved enough money in one month to pay for JUST A TRIM 2timres over.  Moreimportently, it was easy enoughto use that I could get rid of the shaggy look.  Mytrips to the barber now go to make sure that the back of my head looks as good as the front. If I were married,then I wouldn&#x27;t need to worry about the side of myhead that I can&#x27;tsee!  But then, Just a trim doesn&#x27;t argue with me,so I think Justatrim will be with me a long timesince it seems very durable!</li>
            <li> This is a cheap, impractical device. The motor doesn&#x27;t run smoothly, even on brand new batteries.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works like a dream. It can go everywhere. If your arm can reach it this trimmer can handle it. Also it runs quiet. I&#x27;ll buy a second as a backup.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these several years ago and was extremely satisfied with it.  I wanted an second one for travel and assumed they would be identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the new one looks just like my old one, its performance was terrible.  The cutting edge extends too far out and the trim shield can&#x27;t cover it making it almost unusable and even painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just seems shoddy. What a huge disapointment.  Thank goodness I still have my old one.</li>
            <li> We purchased the Hair Trimmer as a gift.  Dad had one that finally wore out after several years of use, and I tried to purchase another in the retail stores, but was unsuccessful... glad there was one available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Have used this trimmer before and was satisfied, however this time it appears the trimmer had beeb around too long and the blades were dull. A waste of money this time!</li>
            <li> One for me and 4 for my friends, completely satisfied</li>
            <li> Tried this on my grandson who just needed a trim around his ears, it pulled the hairs on his head. He does not have very thick or long hair so I though it would work for us. Was a waste of money I think.</li>
            <li> Probably the greatest product ever sold on \\&quot;As Seen on TV\\&quot;. Works like a charm for trimming hair.  Only problem is replacement blades are not available, so you just have to buy a new one when the blades stop cutting.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let them fool you! This is a piece of junk! All it did was pull my hair out as the motor isn&#x27;t strong enough and/or the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough to cut hair. I used it only for trimming hair \\&quot;down below\\&quot;! Even for that, it after just one month quick working entirely and after that I used it as a back stratcher until the extended handle broke. Then I threw it away! Everything I said here is absolutely true!</li>
            <li> I know this isn&#x27;t exactly what the Just-A-Trim was designed for, but I use mine for my cats. I *love* it! I have two very furry cats and they tend to get mats in their fur. Trying to get them out using a comb just pulls at their skin and they don&#x27;t like it. I tried to use regular pet trimmers, but the cord gets in the way and the louder noise scares them. The Just-A-Trim is perfect! It&#x27;s small, quiet, and works quickly and won&#x27;t hurt them. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it!</li>
            <li> This too is a very small and nice and easy to use groomer to have on hand. Works well, uses regular batteries when needed and I like when added to trimming.</li>
            <li> Did not get any assesores</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for,  I got  it fast and for good price,,,,I plan to use it when I am on the road which is quite often</li>
            <li> Nice compact trimmer that works.  Only problem is that it is a real pain to open to replace batteries.</li>
            <li> These little items can pay for themselves after a few months. They are a great between haircut tool. They are not meant to be a barbers haircutting tool but for home use it is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done with this because I&#x27;ve bought three of these and they all have broken. Wish I could find something like it that worked.</li>
            <li> This item really doesnt work like it claims, the trimmer pulls the hair more than it does cuts it. Not worth the money</li>
            <li> Does a great job my dad uses it all the time.&lt;br /&gt;delivery was fast and the price was fair...&lt;br /&gt;A must have for men/boys</li>
            <li> used these some years ago, loved it then, love it now</li>
            <li> I have one of these and it works fine for me but like any trimmer you should use trimmer oil or 3 in 1 oil on the blade to keep it sharp longer&lt;br /&gt;like the instructions say use it like a comb and take your time , remove and clean the guide and clean the blade often to keep it from getting clogged with hair&lt;br /&gt;I use mine over the bathroom sink and when I&#x27;m done I clean the hair from the sink and flush it down the toilet so the sink drain doesn&#x27;t get clogged with hair</li>
            <li> I have have purchased Just A Trim in the passed and I can unequivocally say that this item is not as well made, it is in fact cheaply made and I doubt that I will ever purchase this item again!</li>
            <li> Saves a lot of money on haircuts.</li>
            <li> Hard to Find, but great product.  Do not know why this is so difficult to find now.  This was the 3rd time that I have purchased this product.  Went ahead and bought 2.</li>
            <li> Although this product is all right, I have seen better.  I will rather use the Twinkle Hair Trimmer; it works better&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> I bought my first one of these about 10 years ago.  I used it probably 60 times in 10 years to lightly, or sometimes heavily trim my head hair.  It was actually still working fine, but I had to squeeze it tightly to keep the battery connection firm, so I bought this one as a replacement. After only a couple months, I tried to use it and the blades kept jamming (the motor turns but it just slips and grinds and the blades stop).  My hair is not that thick, and it was certainly much thicker 10 years ago, so obviously they have cheapened the quality to the point that you cannot trim head-hair.  Also, in 10 years I&#x27;m sure I dropped the other trimmer  ore than once, and had lost a tooth because of it.  But the first time I dropped this one, all but 2 of the teeth broke off the plastic sleeve.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. It works very well for me. I wish they have one level smaller attachment. The trick seems to be having fully charged batteries. Once the batteries lose some power the cutter does not seem to work as well which might be why some others were having issues. I use fully charged rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE 2ND ONE I HAVE PURCHASED. THEY WORK JUST FINE FOR MY HEAD. IT IS AMAZING JUST HOW NICELY YOU CAN CUT YOUR OWN HAIR WITH THIS ITEM. WITH THE HIGH PRICE OF A HAIRCUT TODAY, THIS IS A WELCOME FRIEND IN MY HOME.</li>
            <li> Not bad this article, but says it is error proof and the first thing I did to my son who has 2 years of age were many cockroaches in her hair by cutting him with this article.</li>
            <li> I have cut my sons&#x27; hair for years, but struggled with the area ate the very back of their necks and around their ears. This trimmer makes that a breeze without the worry of nicks or cuts. The ONLY downside is that when the blades dull you must replace the whole product as replacement blades aren&#x27;t available. However, the convenience and safety of this product make it well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Works very well. I use it to trim between haircuts. This is my second &#x27;JUST A TRIM&#x27;. After many years of use, the first finally wore out. I was pleased to locate a replacement for it.</li>
            <li> Just A Trim The Mistake-Proof Hair Trimmer, 1 trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Item was not working, the metal base plate that let the battery poitive to negative pole was absent. Therefore the product does not work as the one I had before. I was a waste of my money. Very disappointed</li>
            <li> This trimmer doesn&#x27;t have enough power to do any type of trimming.  You get what you pay for and this was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had never had such a poor experience on amazon. The packaging was opened, and when I was putting the batteries I realized that there was some pieces of hair on the machine!!!! This is such a terrible thing. I contacted the seller before putting up this review, and basically he said I am a lier!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;We have double checked the product before send it to FBA and Amazon warehouse They are all new sealed in the box and never opened. We believe you may not satasify with the product ...&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would I go through the trouble of re-packaging and sending back a $12dlls product? I did consider just keeping it, or just throwing it away, but this is SO wrong, and this is so upsetting that I am actually going through the trouble of writing this review and returning the item because a) this people shouldn&#x27;t get away with it, and b)to prevent another customer from having the same experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this is not getting one star is because the seller offered a refund after calling me a lier. I am being way too generous in giving one star for the slightest good thing this guy is doing, which he is probably forced to do by Amazon. If someone is reading this from Amazon prime you should know that this seller made you look really bad.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with it.  It does as advertised. This product really does fill a market niche and enables metered hair removal.</li>
            <li> This item works great for between haicut trims.  Very easy to use, great price, stretch those haircuts out save money</li>
            <li> I have used it twice  already and it does a nice job; and its easy</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Just A Trim trimmer.  I had the first one for almost 10 years and never had a problem with it.  Comes in really handy when you just can&#x27;t make it to the barber shop.</li>
            <li> I had one about twenty years, it wore out.  Had to get a replacement.  Excellent for trimming between hair cuts.</li>
            <li> It met my expectations and is a good deal.</li>
            <li> This is the second Just a Trim Trimmer I have bought.  It is a great grooming item.  The blades last quite a while;  I was able to order blades about a year ago, but I have not been able to find any more.</li>
