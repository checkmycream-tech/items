            <li>It&#x27;s not as harsh as the walnut type scrubs I&#x27;ve used, yet more gritty than microbead scrubs.  </li>
            <li>using other &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; products, I&#x27;ve never had such a smooth, almost polished feel before.</li>
            <li>I use this three times a week and results are seen from having a few breakouts to literally only three more left on my skin.</li>

            <li> I know that that&#x27;s a strange description of a skin care product</li>
            <li> I have Seborrhoeic dermatitis and have spots on my eyebrows and the area between that produce dry, scaly skin flakes.</li>
            <li> I wanted to add that after just one use, all of my dry skin flakes were gone.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my sister before buying it for myself because she gets dry patches on her face, she started using it once a week</li>
            <li> but I definitely would cut down on the usage.</li>
            <li> and it seems to leave my skin brighter and helps my dark spots fade faster.</li>
            <li> This exfoliator helps with removing dead skin cells, which also means bacteria and all that other yucky stuff that comes along with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a face junk and it veryimportant to exfoliate your face to remove dead dead cells.you</li>
            <li> This exfoliating cleanser is not too harsh on my skin</li>
            <li> Have use this a few times since the instruction says to use 1-2 times per week.  </li>
            <li> and I have been testing out a few Swiss Botany products lately</li>
            <li> I try to exfoliate at least twice a week because I need to keep my pores unclogged (avoid acne &amp; blackheads) and increase cell renewal/turnover.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll know what I mean if you have oily skin!</li>

            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve used exfoliating cleansers before and either they didn&#x27;t feel like they were doing exfoliating or the &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; orwhatever they put in them were too big and I would find them later in my hair! This product has found the perfect medium and it works but yet still feels gentle. The bottle says to use 1 to 2 times a week, but I&#x27;ve used it several days in a row when I feel like I need extra exfoliating after too much sun or when I feel like my face needs a good scrub and it has never irritated my sensitive skin. This is going to stay on my reorder list for sure!!!</li>
            <li> I received item on timeand was packaged very well. I really love this product, It&#x27;s not harsh on the face. I&#x27;m a face junk and it veryimportant to exfoliate your face to remove dead dead cells.you will see a difference after the first use, bright and radiate skin. Inset his product on my hands also. Received this production change for an review. I would highly recommend this product and will be purchasing other items Swis Botany.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice now. by only using it twice, I have noticed a difference in my skin. Not only is it smoother, but it is also helped my acne. Another thing I love about this product is that is has a nice and light scent. Swiss Botany has never disappointed me with their products and I will continue being their customer!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product by Swiss Botany. I have only used it 4 times and I have never been happier with a product than this. My skin went from oily to normal. There is a nice brightness to my face and it has also helped me even out my skin tone. I highly recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> This is more than a five star product.  I couldn&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  It&#x27;s a nice pretty light green color and has a nice gentle scent. When i first used it I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect - I&#x27;ve used different exfoliating products like walnut scrubs and microbead scrubs but this is something different.  It&#x27;s in between.  It&#x27;s not as harsh as the walnut type scrubs I&#x27;ve used, yet more gritty than microbead scrubs.  Light pressure gives you lighter exfoliation or more firm pressure will give you a little extra.&lt;br /&gt;Despite using other &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; products, I&#x27;ve never had such a smooth, almost polished feel before. It&#x27;s kind of amazing.  My husband, a former walnut scrubber, loves this one too.  He is now using it twice a week after he shaves and loves it and makes me feel how smooth his skin is - this is not something he&#x27;s ever done before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*This product is a total winner.  If you are only going to try one new product, make it this one.*&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser as directed which is  1-2 Times a week , and WOW of all the product&#x27;s by swiss botany this is the most fast acting the first time I used it I saw results. I&#x27;ve received microdermabrasion with crystals and this is that in a bottle. If your looking to glow this is it!</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel really clean and seems to reduce blemishes (probably the tea tree in it.</li>
            <li> There is nothing I have tried from Swiss Botany that does not work as promised. I love love love!. This is a very nice, gentle exfoliating cleanser that removes my dry, flaky skin. I have Seborrhoeic dermatitis and have spots on my eyebrows and the area between that produce dry, scaly skin flakes. This is wonderful for this and I am appreciative to have gotten to use this product. I wanted to add that after just one use, all of my dry skin flakes were gone. I am going to continue using this on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I try to exfoliate at least twice a week because I need to keep my pores unclogged (avoid acne &amp; blackheads) and increase cell renewal/turnover.  This exfoliator is effective for my skin.  I love that the grains are super tiny and not scratchy feeling, but I know it&#x27;s doing its job.  The scent is pleasant, very light.  Right after I exfoliate, I will either put on a mask (if I have time) or go straight to serum, then moisturizer.  It makes my skin feel smooth and renewed, ready for the next step!!</li>
            <li> Smells so refreshing and amazing and so gentle. This is the first time an exfoliator feels gentle and still be able to remove all these impurities on my face without irritating my face. This exfoliating cleanser is not too harsh on my skin and I can easily use it to exfoliate my skin by applying it in a circular motion (tip: whenever you are applying it in a circular motion, make sure that you start in going out and pulling your skin UPWARDS to prevent sagging; think of it as a mini face lift). This exfoliator helps with removing dead skin cells, which also means bacteria and all that other yucky stuff that comes along with it. I use this three times a week and results are seen from having a few breakouts to literally only three more left on my skin. I can&#x27;t wait to see more results.&lt;br /&gt;*item purchased at a discount in return for my 100% honest review.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this, just enough &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; to not damage the skin but makes my skin feel super soft and clean. Very effective</li>
            <li> Just lovely.  I know that that&#x27;s a strange description of a skin care product but that was my first reaction.  Most of the exfoliating products that I have tried are too grainy.  This product is very fine.  i felt like i got a mini microdermabrasion done.  I must mention that Swiss Botany is a cruelty free company which is very important to me.</li>
            <li> I love this Micropolish Cleansing Exfoliator!  I am a beauty blogger so I test out an obscene amount of products and I have been testing out a few Swiss Botany products lately and I have been super impressed!&lt;br /&gt;I am 41 years old with oily and blemish prone skin.  I also suffer from Melasma (hyperpigmentation).  I have been using this Exfoliator twice a week in addition to the Swiss Botany Mandelic Acid Facial Cleansing Gel &amp; Purifying Facial Toner and I love the results!  This Exfoliator gives my skin that extra bit of exfoliation that it needs especially to help deal with my Melasma.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and looking fresh and new.&lt;br /&gt;This Micropolish Cleansing Exfoliator combined with the Swiss Botany Mandelic Acid Facial Cleansing Gel &amp; Purifying Facial Toner is a &amp;#34;Dream Team&amp;#34; of products!  I would highly recommend any or all of them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I did receive this product complimentary or at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, I was not paid in anyway and my thoughts and opinions are my own.***</li>
            <li> Have use this a few times since the instruction says to use 1-2 times per week.  I really like the smell and the fine grit really help my face feel fresh.  Excited to see the long term benefit of using the whole bottle, but so far, I am really happy with how it makes my face feel and feel that it really compliment my skin care regiment.</li>
            <li> I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  I&#x27;m very impressed by their customer service.  They emailed me with details on how to use the product. The item arrived quickly.  I&#x27;m very impressed.  I use this right after a shower and you can feel it working.  My face feels freshly cleansed without any irritation.  I will continue to use and highly recommend to family and friends.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser for exfoliating and removing dead skin cells. It has a grainy sandy feel that is gentle but effective at exfoliating my skin. My face felt soft and smooth afterwards. I loved it. This exfoliating cleanser felt just like the stuff you would use for an at home dermabrasion. It works great. I had no problems with it at all. After cleansing my face first, I would apply this stuff to my face and gently massage it around in circular motions. I loved how it felt like I was removing all my dead skin cells and any dirt hiding. I applied moisturizer after exfoliating. I bought this with a discount and I am so happy too. I highly recommend it for people looking for a great exfoliating product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my sister before buying it for myself because she gets dry patches on her face, she started using it once a week or when she saw the patched. I bought a bottle for myself and started using it almost every night with no problems. My face feels very smooth and I use their moisturizer twice a day.It&#x27;s not harsh and it foams a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister actually started using it every day with no side effects. The bottle states to use it once to twice a week. I have tried a lot of face scrubs and I will only use this one from now on.</li>
            <li> This exfoliator has a very clean light scent and gentle polishing beads that thoroughly clean my skin. I use it 2x/week to exfoliate my skin and I am so happy with the way that my skin looks and feels. The ingredients are awesome and I am so pleased with Swiss Botany!</li>
            <li> The exfoliating clearer works so good , this the finest sand you can have and still cleanse so well. My skin feels so cleaned.</li>
            <li> Such a delightful smell upon opening the bottle. I&#x27;ve been reaching for this more and more it seems. Exfoliating my oily skin is super important to me, I tend to get a &amp;#34;build up&amp;#34;. You&#x27;ll know what I mean if you have oily skin! This removes excess oil and dirt and leaves my skin looking clear and bright. It is not harsh, so it should be good for sensitive skin as well. *I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback. All thoughts/opinions are my own entirely.</li>
            <li> Excellent exfoliator!  The grit in it is very fine, so it can be used on the lips too.  My face feels very clean and smooth after I use it, and it does not tear up my face like a lot of other types I have used have.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of leaving my skin nice and soft, and I do moisturize immediately after washing my face but after using it twice within the same week, I felt like it dried my face out so I only use it once a week, sometimes every 2 weeks and it seems to leave my skin brighter and helps my dark spots fade faster. Overall, a good product but I definitely would cut down on the usage.</li>
            <li> I love thi product . And I&#x27;m happy with it it make my skin feel fresh and clean , make my skin soft after using it. I might going order it again when I&#x27;m out of it. Thank you for your product. And I love the smell its natural.thanks again.and I&#x27;m glad I tried this product</li>
