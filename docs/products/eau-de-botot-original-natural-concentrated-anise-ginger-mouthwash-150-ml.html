    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This mouthwash is the best ever.  </li>
            <li>It does a wonderful job of killing the &#x27;morning after cigar funk&#x27;.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wonderful.  </li>
            <li>so attractive!</li>
            <li>It looks great in a photo-shoot by the by!</li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>Pungent in taste but very effective.</li>
            <li>bought two bottles on a whim (good reviews, sounded like a quality product) and will continue to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a good rinse.</li>
            <li>Very refreshing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t doubt the product is effective, but this is an &amp;#34;acquired&amp;#34; taste.</li>
            <li>but honestly I thought it would have a fuller taste.</li>
            <li>spoon+ in warm water does the trick (8oz.).</li>
            <li>Nice muted flavor.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really wonderful, and so much more pleasant than the chemical sting that comes with your average drugstore brands of mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still not quite sure if i&#x27;d buy again or not.</li>
            <li>I will admit I was not immediately impressed, having found it \\&quot;lacking in punch and precision\\&quot; and not especially concentrated.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s kind of a kick that it was developed for King Louis XIV or XV and is still great.</li>
            <li>Not something many of us are probably used to.</li>
            <li>But now it&#x27;s my favorite mouthwash.</li>
            <li>They should take the coloring out of it, that is not needed for sure.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s a nice unique flavor and scent.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels very clean</li>
            <li>My mouth feels nice and clean afterward and it takes the smell and taste of smoking out of your mouth easily.</li>
            <li>Great action,great taste,totally natural,</li>
            <li>Extremely strong and invigorating.  </li>
            <li>Very economical.  </li>
            <li>This has a unique, indulging taste.  </li>
            <li>But, it helps keep your teeth clean feeling without fluoride.</li>
            <li>Strong and fresh.</li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>It leaves my mouth feeling clean &amp; fresh.</li>
            <li>This product is absolutely extraordinary.</li>
            <li>With this you can mix to your pleasure, no crazy alcohol burn, just a sweet herbal feeling that must be tried to believe.</li>
            <li>, my breath is fine, I really want to remove bacteria, so Botot is</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t taste sugary or overly powerful burning with alcohol.</li>
            <li>My dentist smelled of the fresh flavor of Botot, so I started using it,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>Leaves my mouth feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>and you keep buying it and buying it, but we need fresh breath right?  </li>
            <li>A bit pricey but 100% better than the regular store brands.</li>
            <li>perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered my first bottle on 12-11</li>
            <li>It takes a little more than a few drops to really work, but it is great.</li>
            <li>However, the toothpaste and mouthwash have a very fresh,licorice flavor (anise).</li>
            <li>This mouthwash is intense, and you have to rinse your mouth out after you use it.</li>
            <li>It is very concentrated.</li>
            <li>but it works - and works very well.</li>
            <li>And one more thing -- I can&#x27;t begin to explain why, but my wife and kid absolutely insist that the aroma that wafts off a cup of the stuff reminds them of Chinatown, as in down on Canal Street, not \\&quot;forget it,</li>
            <li>You can also modulate the strength using more or less water.</li>
            <li>The product description and ingredient list above are bizarre because they are both far from the truth.</li>
            <li>You can decide if you want it weak or strong (like your coffee) but go strong</li>
            <li>Dilute with little water to get a better result.</li>
            <li>The flavor is pleasantly fresh and natural, with dominant notes of anise, cinnamon and clove without the heavy, sugary and candied quality of most commercial mouthwashes and toothpastes.  </li>
            <li>You only need a cap-full (and the cap is not nearly as deep as it looks), mixed into a cup of warm/hot water and you can barely taste it when you&#x27;re swishing it around, but once you&#x27;re done your mouth feels cool and clean.  </li>
            <li>In the past it seemed the ingredients in this mouthwash were more natural.  </li>
            <li>I put a few (5-6) drops in a small glass of warm water, and it works very, very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I smoke and have frequent meetings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When the bottle is empty simply fill with you favorite red mouth rinse</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this concentrated mouthwash as an alternative to the run of the mill stuff at the local chain grocery and drug stores.</li>
            <li>You will spend more over time using one of the  other &#x27;swill in a big plastic jug&#x27; brands of mouthwash.</li>
            <li>But if you put a quarter teaspoon or so in a few ounces of water hot enough to make tea, well then -- POW!  </li>

            <li> My biggest complaint with mouthwash is that they don&#x27;t last very long, maybe a month (33 servings with Scope)</li>
            <li> My ONLY complaint is the taste.</li>
            <li> Main complaints are that it uses saccharin which leaves bad aftertaste (for me) and it is filled with artificial colors.</li>
            <li> I like mine with a little pow</li>
            <li> My mistake was thinking a few drops in a glass of water would do the trick --</li>
            <li> No more harsh mouthwashes.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t worry about bad breath as much as before using this product.</li>
            <li> bought a small plastic container (Muji) so that I can carry this with me to work/travel.</li>
            <li> I put a small splash of water in my cup and shake in 4 or 5 drops.  </li>
            <li> Purchased here as I could not find it elsewhere, have used it in the past.  </li>
            <li> Not really my kind of flavor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Botot toothpaste and mouthwash for at least eight years now.</li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s on another level!</li>
            <li> Wrong</li>
            <li> I get tired of artificial mint every night and every morning.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this item.</li>
            <li> YES REALLY EXPENSIVE AROUND HERE (VANCOUVER CANADA)!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month and I&#x27;m still not quite sure if i&#x27;d buy again or not. If it were cheaper I definitely would, but considering the price i&#x27;ll wait till it&#x27;s gone and see if I miss it. It doesn&#x27;t taste sugary or overly powerful burning with alcohol. My mouth feels nice and clean afterward and it takes the smell and taste of smoking out of your mouth easily. And it&#x27;s a nice unique flavor and scent.</li>
            <li> developped in France early 20th century, my family has been using this mouthwash everyday generation after generation.&lt;br /&gt;Should be distributed all around the world.Great action,great taste,totally natural,what else! YES REALLY EXPENSIVE AROUND HERE (VANCOUVER CANADA)! However this is the only one I want to use..</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but 100% better than the regular store brands. Pungent in taste but very effective. Dilute with little water to get a better result.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint with mouthwash is that they don&#x27;t last very long, maybe a month (33 servings with Scope) and you keep buying it and buying it, but we need fresh breath right?  Wrong, my breath is fine, I really want to remove bacteria, so Botot is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered my first bottle on 12-11 and it still has about half left, I simply fill my cup of water (less than halfway) to rinse with, sprinkle several drops in and voila, instant mouthwash!  You can decide if you want it weak or strong (like your coffee) but go strong, it&#x27;s yummy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, you may want to drink it but don&#x27;t because you&#x27;d swallow those loosened food particles along with it and that&#x27;s just gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this with no reservations unless you have no idea what these flavors taste like, that might be the only reason I see why someone may not like it.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this concentrated mouthwash as an alternative to the run of the mill stuff at the local chain grocery and drug stores. I will admit I was not immediately impressed, having found it \\&quot;lacking in punch and precision\\&quot; and not especially concentrated. \\&quot;Acceptable, but no better\\&quot; I said.      OK, I was wrong.  The flavor is pleasantly fresh and natural, with dominant notes of anise, cinnamon and clove without the heavy, sugary and candied quality of most commercial mouthwashes and toothpastes.  My mistake was thinking a few drops in a glass of water would do the trick -- nope, it does not.  But if you put a quarter teaspoon or so in a few ounces of water hot enough to make tea, well then -- POW!  Now you&#x27;re cooking.      My one quibble remains the price.  Delivered, it takes about a Sam Jackson to buy a bottle that will last 30 days or so.  Seems like a lot, but I will admit I&#x27;m hooked and now buy a couple bottles every couple of months to support my Botot habit. And one more thing -- I can&#x27;t begin to explain why, but my wife and kid absolutely insist that the aroma that wafts off a cup of the stuff reminds them of Chinatown, as in down on Canal Street, not \\&quot;forget it, Jake.\\&quot;  Darned if I understand what they&#x27;re talking about.</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth feeling clean &amp; fresh. My ONLY complaint is the taste. It tastes very similar to black licorice. Not really my kind of flavor.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is the bee&#x27;s knees!  You only need a cap-full (and the cap is not nearly as deep as it looks), mixed into a cup of warm/hot water and you can barely taste it when you&#x27;re swishing it around, but once you&#x27;re done your mouth feels cool and clean.  It&#x27;s really wonderful, and so much more pleasant than the chemical sting that comes with your average drugstore brands of mouthwash.  Seriously, it&#x27;s on another level!</li>
            <li> No more harsh mouthwashes. With this you can mix to your pleasure, no crazy alcohol burn, just a sweet herbal feeling that must be tried to believe. You owe it to yourself to try this.</li>
            <li> I get tired of artificial mint every night and every morning.  This has a unique, indulging taste.  this is actually a concentrate and lasts a very long time.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Botot toothpaste and mouthwash for at least eight years now. I don&#x27;t like having to pay shipping charges. However, the toothpaste and mouthwash have a very fresh,licorice flavor (anise). My mouth feels very clean and I don&#x27;t worry about bad breath as much as before using this product. And it&#x27;s kind of a kick that it was developed for King Louis XIV or XV and is still great.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is intense, and you have to rinse your mouth out after you use it. But, it helps keep your teeth clean feeling without fluoride. I would recommend this mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t doubt the product is effective, but this is an &amp;#34;acquired&amp;#34; taste. I tried using it several times, but I just couldn&#x27;t stand the flavor. Not something many of us are probably used to.</li>
            <li> This mouthwash is the best ever.  It takes a little more than a few drops to really work, but it is great.</li>
            <li> It is very concentrated. It does a wonderful job of killing the &#x27;morning after cigar funk&#x27;. With average use a bottle will last for several months, so don&#x27;t let the price scare you. You will spend more over time using one of the  other &#x27;swill in a big plastic jug&#x27; brands of mouthwash.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely extraordinary.</li>
            <li> My dentist smelled of the fresh flavor of Botot, so I started using it,&lt;br /&gt;and it&#x27;s wonderful.  Just a drop in water, and you know why the French&lt;br /&gt;are so attractive!</li>
            <li> Strong and fresh. You can also modulate the strength using more or less water. One of our favourites!</li>
            <li> Main complaints are that it uses saccharin which leaves bad aftertaste (for me) and it is filled with artificial colors. Bothe are not needed. For what it is, it seems overpriced.</li>
            <li> Not bad but honestly I thought it would have a fuller taste.I&#x27;d like to give it a 3.5 but will have to settlr for a 3.</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t great but it works - and works very well. It is concentrated. I put a few (5-6) drops in a small glass of warm water, and it works very, very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a small plastic container (Muji) so that I can carry this with me to work/travel. it&#x27;s reassuring to know that I have it with me. I smoke and have frequent meetings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two bottles on a whim (good reviews, sounded like a quality product) and will continue to buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good stuff indeed.</li>
            <li> The product description and ingredient list above are bizarre because they are both far from the truth. The ingredient list on the back of the bottle says that it contains saccharin, CI 42051, which a synthetic blue dye that is actually banned in the U.S. because it induces an allergic reaction, CI 16255, which a synthetic red dye that is banned in the U.S. because it is carcinogen, and CI 19410, which is a synthetic yellow dye. This product should be banned. If someone corrects me, I will remove this review. I am going to try to get my money back from the seller. We will see what happens.</li>
            <li> About a table spoon+ in warm water does the trick (8oz.). I like mine with a little pow thus why I added the \\&quot;+\\&quot; sign! Once again the vintage label and glass bottle give the established appearance on any bathroom setting. Some will  inevitably ask about it once they see the label.  When the bottle is empty simply fill with you favorite red mouth rinse and no one is the wiser. It looks great in a photo-shoot by the by!</li>
            <li> But now it&#x27;s my favorite mouthwash. Nice muted flavor.  Leaves my mouth feeling fresh. I put a small splash of water in my cup and shake in 4 or 5 drops.  Very economical.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Purchased here as I could not find it elsewhere, have used it in the past.  However I don&#x27;t remember that it contained sodium saccharin, one of the ingredients I was trying to avoid using.  In the past it seemed the ingredients in this mouthwash were more natural.  It didn&#x27;t taste the same as I remembered either - won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Extremely strong and invigorating.  Very refreshing.</li>
            <li> They should take the coloring out of it, that is not needed for sure. It is a good rinse.</li>
