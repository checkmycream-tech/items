            <li>I really really love this product!</li>
            <li>I know I wasn&#x27;t going to find something as amazing for a cheaper price</li>
            <li>It is a lot softer on the skin than a wash cloth, which was a nice change.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was a nice cleansing sponge otherwise</li>
            <li>these are awesome, I have really messed up skin and this helps speed up healing time for acne and exfoliates well.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a very soft sponge to rinse your face, this would be perfect.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product I have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than my clarisonic.</li>
            <li>Love these exfoliants.</li>
            <li>I have very oily and acne prone skin and this sponge is great for my skin.</li>
            <li>I love the bamboo charcoal Dew Puff.</li>
            <li>but it seems to make my face break out more.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use these products when I was 15 &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love this sponge.</li>
            <li>I thought it would have more grit to exfoliate</li>
            <li>Make sure to soak them until they are fully cellulose, if you don&#x27;t you can damage them and shorten their life span.</li>
            <li>got this dew puff and the original and both were really nice.</li>
            <li>This is the one I went with, and so far, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Gentle scrubber loved it</li>
            <li>I received the first sponge of this type from my Julep nail polish subscription - Ireally liked it</li>
            <li>Very nice facial sponge</li>
            <li>My skin is so clean smooth radiant</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find anything special about this particular kind of sponge for the skin.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean after using this without feeling like I scraped my face off.</li>
            <li>This would be great if you are looking for gentle exfoliation or have skin too sensitive for a cleansing brush.</li>
            <li>and my skin felt really nice, soft and clean after.</li>
            <li>not harsh on the skin but feels nice and exfoliating.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still got a good amount of life in it, and I fully expect it to last three months as advertised.</li>
            <li>I love these things, gentle exfoliation at it</li>
            <li>Plus, my skin feels super clean after I use it.</li>
            <li>Leaves face feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Since I started using all of them around the same time, I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s helping the best, but all three have definitely smoothed out my complexion</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve received it, I&#x27;ve drastically changed my facial routine, so I can&#x27;t be certain what&#x27;s worked the best, but I can tell you that I&#x27;ve NEVER seen my face as clear as it is now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and helps smooth my skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the calm before the storm</li>
            <li>My skin is so much more radiant and clear.</li>
            <li>but otherwise, I&#x27;m not unhappy with it.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.  </li>
            <li>even tho it was 8.99, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>and I liked the product enough to try it again.</li>
            <li>I have very large pores and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>This sponge felt soft and gentle and I believe I got much better cleansing with this than with my fingers.</li>
            <li>I used it for about three months (not sure whether they should be replaced more frequently than that) and loved it.</li>
            <li>They were very gentle and worked pretty well in terms of cleansing my skin.</li>
            <li>I tried this on a whim and after the first use I noticed an immediate difference.</li>
            <li>First sponge for my face washing</li>
            <li>The first sponge I received worked well</li>
            <li>:) If you have sensitive skin I highly recommend using these to avoid products and gently exfoliate.</li>
            <li>This sponge is super soft...</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone with large pores!</li>
            <li>Does not exofoliaye properly, too smooth</li>
            <li>but the puff is simple and light)</li>
            <li>but it dries out my face too much even though I have oily skin.</li>
            <li>This is so gentle on my skin, but cleanses it so well, even when I use without product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it every morning in the shower before my cleanser for a gentle exfoliation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>I bought the Sephora brand sponges to see if they would last better and so far they have.</li>
            <li>Have used a Buf Puf in the past, which is great for sloughing off old skin cells and keeping the complexion clear.  </li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviewers here, mine fell apart in just about two weeks of use.</li>
            <li>B003QOTDB4 Neutrogena Deep Clean Long-Last Shine Control, Cleanser/mask, 6 Ounce (</li>
            <li>The string attached to it makes it easy to hang up and dry, preventing the growth of bacteria from having it sit damp in one spot all day.</li>
            <li>All on its own, literally without soap or cleanser, this sponge will help to heal and clear your skin - and even with cleanser, the microscopically dissolving natural vegetable sponge will not leave your skin dry.</li>
            <li>and it comes with a small, attached string that allows me to hang it on my shower attachment which makes it handy</li>
            <li>It was also relaxing in a sense to wash my face with this soft sponge first thing in the morning and at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>After doing a little research I discovered this product which is much more reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular sponge.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean my skin at all and NEVER dries even after a whole day of squeezing and hanging to dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m realistic and</li>
            <li>So I was looking for a cheaper alternative to buying a new clarisonic 3.</li>
            <li>I love this little guy!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and rosacea</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for everyone - male, female, young and old, problem skin or smooth.</li>
            <li>I have gone through dozens of products claiming to clear my blackheads and reduce the size of my pores.</li>
            <li>it works!&lt;br /&gt;She has now clear skin and everyone has noticed.  </li>
            <li>Her self esteem has skyrocketed; acne is very damaging for a over sensitive teen girl.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin at all.</li>
            <li>This sponge just didn&#x27;t do anything for my face, it was much too gentle and left my skin feeling like I had not cleaned well enough.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin, so maybe this might work for people who have more delicate skin.</li>
            <li>I purchased this a week ago and it has already completely fell apart.</li>
            <li>I guess I would just recommend it for those who have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This product provides a gentle face scrub and stretches the life of your facial cleanser since you only need a dab.  </li>
            <li>I tried the asian clay one and didn&#x27;t like the texture of that one, it felt too soft.</li>
            <li>It is only part of a pretty extensive skin care routine that I have, so I can&#x27;t say what part of the improvement in my skin is due to this, but I definitely think it contributes.</li>
            <li>I changed a couple of things about my skin routine when I got this, but my skintone has really evened out and the amount of blemishes have gone down dramatically.</li>
            <li>It is also larger than the Julep sponge and so far has lasted 2x as long.</li>
            <li>but when it&#x27;s wet, it gets very soft.  </li>
            <li>Less expensive than a Clair sonic, more gentle and travels well.  </li>
            <li>This product is less expensive than other Konjac sponges, but it performs just as great.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Phenomenal cleansing and exfoliation power in this inexpensive sponge! All on its own, literally without soap or cleanser, this sponge will help to heal and clear your skin - and even with cleanser, the microscopically dissolving natural vegetable sponge will not leave your skin dry. I highly recommend this for everyone - male, female, young and old, problem skin or smooth. It feels good, will do you no harm, and biodegrades.</li>
            <li> I have very large pores and acne prone skin. This is by far the best product I have ever used. I have gone through dozens of products claiming to clear my blackheads and reduce the size of my pores. None of which have worked. I tried this on a whim and after the first use I noticed an immediate difference. My skin is so much more radiant and clear. This is so much better than my clarisonic. I highly recommend this to anyone with large pores!</li>
            <li> love it! will be buying again! not harsh on the skin but feels nice and exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Does not exofoliaye properly, too smooth</li>
            <li> Leaves face feeling clean and fresh. It&#x27;s not harsh on the skin at all.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad about it - Just didn&#x27;t notice any change in my skin&#x27;s condition or complexion. It is a lot softer on the skin than a wash cloth, which was a nice change.</li>
            <li> Have used a Buf Puf in the past, which is great for sloughing off old skin cells and keeping the complexion clear.  This sponge just didn&#x27;t do anything for my face, it was much too gentle and left my skin feeling like I had not cleaned well enough.  I have oily skin, so maybe this might work for people who have more delicate skin.</li>
            <li> Love these exfoliants. Everyone needs one in their life!</li>
            <li> This product provides a gentle face scrub and stretches the life of your facial cleanser since you only need a dab.  Less expensive than a Clair sonic, more gentle and travels well.  (I like the Clairsonic as well but the puff is simple and light)</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this particular sponge. Like many of the other reviewers here, mine fell apart in just about two weeks of use. I bought the Sephora brand sponges to see if they would last better and so far they have. This sponge is just too flimsy and cannot hold up to being hung to dry as it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a nice cleansing sponge otherwise and that is why I repurchased a konjac sponge in a different brand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a handy sponge -- a good size and it comes with a small, attached string that allows me to hang it on my shower attachment which makes it handy and I don&#x27;t have the problem of having to use a washcloth for my face AND body.  I&#x27;m not sure how it is for exfoliating as it seems a little too soft for that but otherwise, I&#x27;m not unhappy with it.  I probably could have done some legwork and found one at a local pharmacy for a few $$$ less.</li>
            <li> Great sponge! This is my second time I have purchased it. Love it! I have very oily and acne prone skin and this sponge is great for my skin. First sponge for my face washing that I could truly say that has worked for my skin. It&#x27;s long lasting also. Give it a try, you will love it! I will purchase it over and over.</li>
            <li> I love the bamboo charcoal Dew Puff. It&#x27;s gentle and helps smooth my skin. The texture is soft when wet but still firm. I tried the asian clay one and didn&#x27;t like the texture of that one, it felt too soft.</li>
            <li> I like the texture of the sponge but it dries out my face too much even though I have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I received the first sponge of this type from my Julep nail polish subscription - Ireally liked it but when I went to replace it, I was dismayed by the cost.  After doing a little research I discovered this product which is much more reasonably priced.  It is also larger than the Julep sponge and so far has lasted 2x as long.</li>
            <li> This is great for exfoliating. I have very sensitive skin and rosacea so I have to be careful not to irritate it. It exfoliates well and it is very gentle (as long as you don&#x27;t rub too hard).</li>
            <li> Very nice facial sponge</li>
            <li> I purchased this a week ago and it has already completely fell apart. I am a fan of Konjac Sponges and have used different brands before. I would not recommend this one. Extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> It does a good job lathering up your face wash but it doesn&#x27;t work any miracles.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean my skin at all and NEVER dries even after a whole day of squeezing and hanging to dry. That&#x27;s not sanitary.</li>
            <li> I have the worst combination overly sensitive skin.  I can only use Loccitane products and thank god for them!!  /this sponge is the most incredible product.  My skin is so clean smooth radiant it is like velvet!!. I use my Loccitane she butter cleanser and go to work.  I am going to order the volcanic sponge next.  Worth the price.  You saved me!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen Boucher&lt;br /&gt;Madawaska Maine</li>
            <li> This product has greatly improved my skin.  I use with a charcoal and volcanic ash cleanser, and it is awesome!</li>
            <li> As good as the fancy Boscia sponge, but about a 1/4 of the price.  What&#x27;s not to like?  It doesn&#x27;t foam or have any sort of charcoal residue rinse out of it. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s really any advantage / difference to the charcoal sponge over the plain one (although I use with mine with my facial cleanser, so maybe there would be if I used this alone?).</li>
            <li> I have been using this every day and I see no difference in my pores or blemishes.  No difference after a month of using. It may work for others but does not seem to do anything for me.  Seems to be a waste of money and I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> So I was looking for a cheaper alternative to buying a new clarisonic 3. I&#x27;m realistic and I know I wasn&#x27;t going to find something as amazing for a cheaper price but I was hoping to come close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this dew puff and the original and both were really nice. They were very gentle and worked pretty well in terms of cleansing my skin. I used them with my regular face wash and my skin felt really nice, soft and clean after. The only thing I was a little disappointed about was that it didn&#x27;t help with my acne but I guess it didn&#x27;t make it worse so it wasn&#x27;t too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They both lasted me about 2.5 months or so and I think they are a great bargain for the price. They were also really fun to see turn from dry and tough to soft and squishy! I would recommend these!</li>
            <li> This is so gentle on my skin, but cleanses it so well, even when I use without product. I&#x27;ve used sponges to wash my face before, but they tend to dry my skin out if I use too often. I use the Konjac sponge twice a day, and I&#x27;ve yet to have this problem. I&#x27;ve had it for close to a month now and it&#x27;s still got a good amount of life in it, and I fully expect it to last three months as advertised. I changed a couple of things about my skin routine when I got this, but my skintone has really evened out and the amount of blemishes have gone down dramatically. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> This sponge is super soft...but it seems to make my face break out more. My skin is super sensitive so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just getting stuff cleaned out and it&#x27;s the calm before the storm or if it just isn&#x27;t for me...so I use is on my body instead.</li>
            <li> Gentle scrubber loved it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading up on these recently, and I haven&#x27;t found them on Amazon until just the other month or so. This is the one I went with, and so far, I&#x27;m happy with the purchase. Since I&#x27;ve received it, I&#x27;ve drastically changed my facial routine, so I can&#x27;t be certain what&#x27;s worked the best, but I can tell you that I&#x27;ve NEVER seen my face as clear as it is now. I&#x27;ve never had REALLY troubled skin, and I still get the occasional blemish even now, but my face is definitely smoother. I use this sponge in the morning, with just water, and then in the evening I remove my makeup and use [[ASIN:B003QOTDB4 Neutrogena Deep Clean Long-Last Shine Control, Cleanser/mask, 6 Ounce (Pack of 2)]]. Twice a week I also use [[ASIN:B003UZ4R24 Boscia Luminizing Black Mask 2.8 oz]]. Since I started using all of them around the same time, I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s helping the best, but all three have definitely smoothed out my complexion and I&#x27;m very happy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just too bad I didn&#x27;t use these products when I was 15 &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love these things, gentle exfoliation at it&#x27;s best</li>
            <li> these are awesome, I have really messed up skin and this helps speed up healing time for acne and exfoliates well. will buy again</li>
            <li> even tho it was 8.99, it&#x27;s worth it. although, I perfer the white one cause I use it with my facial cleanser. its a super weird feeling but you get use to it. doesnt feel like it would exfoliate your skin but it does...</li>
            <li> I have a teen daughter who has acne since she hit puberty.&lt;br /&gt;She used Procactive skin products and it did not work at all. I took her to two dermathologists;  they prescribed oral and topic antiobotics and expensive prescription creams; it made her acne worse.  I also took her to an esthetician who only wanted me to buy her expensice skin products.  She also tried over the counter stuff; i bought every brand and nothing.  This has been the only product that has worked for her.  I discovered it by accident and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;Its very simple to use, and it works!&lt;br /&gt;She has now clear skin and everyone has noticed.  Her self esteem has skyrocketed; acne is very damaging for a over sensitive teen girl.</li>
            <li> Would purchase it again.  My skin feels so clean after using this without feeling like I scraped my face off.</li>
            <li> I really really love this product! Washing my face will never be the same again. Washing my face with this sponge is like getting a massage on face every day. Plus, my skin feels super clean after I use it. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker. This product won&#x27;t clear up years of suffering from severe acne, but I have had less minor breakouts since using it.</li>
            <li> This is a great Konjac sponge for acne prone skin. I used it for about three months (not sure whether they should be replaced more frequently than that) and loved it. I used this product in conjunction with The Body Shop&#x27;s Vitamin E Cleanser and their Vitamin C Facial Polish. Both of those products are sub par in my opinion, but I think that this sponge boosted their performance. This sponge felt soft and gentle and I believe I got much better cleansing with this than with my fingers. It was also relaxing in a sense to wash my face with this soft sponge first thing in the morning and at the end of the day. This would be great if you are looking for gentle exfoliation or have skin too sensitive for a cleansing brush. The string attached to it makes it easy to hang up and dry, preventing the growth of bacteria from having it sit damp in one spot all day. This product is less expensive than other Konjac sponges, but it performs just as great.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference that it made on my skin at all and my skin is acne prone and combination to oily. I didn&#x27;t find anything special about this particular kind of sponge for the skin. I guess I would just recommend it for those who have sensitive skin and they don&#x27;t want to use a face brush for the face.</li>
            <li> Very happy.  Wrks great n doesnt rub skin too harsh.  I wld buy another one in future.</li>
            <li> Great at helping to control oils and combat acne.  I use this in combination with my Amonche black soap or Dudu Osun black soap.</li>
            <li> I love this sponge. I have been using it twice a day for the last 4 months and it&#x27;s still in great shape. I don&#x27;t have acne-prone skin, but I did notice after a couple weeks that I have less blackheads on my nose. I&#x27;ve also found that it lathers my face soap so well that I actually use much less soap than I did before. I also like that I can use this sponge without face soap and it still cleans well; my face never feels oily after just using the sponge and water. I will definitely buy another one when this one wears out or starts getting grimy.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed. I didn&#x27;t notice any change in my skin and after only a couple weeks a big rip formed in the sponge.</li>
            <li> The first sponge I received worked well and I liked the product enough to try it again. Unfortunately the second sponge was pretty much hollow, only 1/3 substance of the first and only lasted 2 weeks before breaking into small pieces too hard to use. I would try again but am weary, I don&#x27;t know if this is common or just a brand thing.</li>
            <li> I love this little guy! I use it every morning in the shower before my cleanser for a gentle exfoliation. It is only part of a pretty extensive skin care routine that I have, so I can&#x27;t say what part of the improvement in my skin is due to this, but I definitely think it contributes. My skin is smoother, less oily, and my blemishes are less noticeable. I would recommend this to people with sensitive skin who want to exfoliate without harsh chemicals or acid.&lt;br /&gt;How I use it: In the shower I wet and squeeze out the sponge and, without adding any cleanser, scrub my face in small circles, using the corners to get behind my ears, under my eyes, and along my nose. Thats it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.  I thought it would have more grit to exfoliate but when it&#x27;s wet, it gets very soft.  If you&#x27;re looking for a very soft sponge to rinse your face, this would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This is really great! It&#x27;s so gentle on the skin. Make sure to soak them until they are fully cellulose, if you don&#x27;t you can damage them and shorten their life span. Should last you a solid 3 months. :) If you have sensitive skin I highly recommend using these to avoid products and gently exfoliate.</li>
