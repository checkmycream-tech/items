            <li>I already mention, how nice it smells.....</li>
            <li>It smells great, clean -- and makes luxorious bubbles.  </li>
            <li>am so very glad to be able to find this through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It smells good, makes the skin soft, and is a great bubble bath.  </li>
            <li>stuff is GREAT for a person who likes a great non-baby smelling bubble bath, but who doesn&#x27;t need soooo many bubbles that you could keep an anvil afloat.  :-)</li>
            <li>Smells heavenly, clean and seaside-ish, good bubble, and the water is the perfect blue.</li>
            <li>It used to have a squeeze top to prevent accidentally overpouring, which also would help.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite indulgance, My Ocean water.</li>
            <li>Love it.......</li>
            <li>Started buying this in Germany 30 years ago still incredibly refreshing as bubble bath or bathing gel.</li>
            <li>I discovered this in Germany many years ago and brought some home.  </li>
            <li>And, now, it is available!  </li>
            <li>I found this item as a sample when traveling in Europe and fell in love with it.  </li>
            <li>I just love Algemarin.</li>
            <li>&#x27;Absolutely love it</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this bubble bath.  </li>
            <li>The 750ml one is currently a better deal at $24.</li>
            <li>Marshall fields &amp; Company also carried it for many years......</li>
            <li>Ok, I wasn&#x27;t doing a real great job reading when I ordered this, because I ONLY take showers.  </li>
            <li>This will always be in my shower!  :-)</li>
            <li>I just love this product.</li>
            <li>Better than Vita Bath.  </li>
            <li>said \\&quot;People in the US that know about it, think of it as something exotic, though in Germany it is sold in drugstores and supermarkets\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>My husband is enjoying this product every day on his returning from work.</li>
            <li>People in the US that know about it, think of it as something exotic, though in Germany it is sold in drugstores and supermarkets.    </li>
            <li>Turns your bathroom into an exotic spa.</li>
            <li>I love this product, the softness of the water it has a silky feel.  </li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful and it makes your skin so clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>It smells fresh -- not cloyingly sweet -- great for a soak in the tub.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing aromatherapy, as well as great soft skin with a great fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It is kind of cool.</li>
            <li>Have loved this product, ever since I first visited Germany in the 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Most of us know that when we take a bubble bath, what&#x27;s important?</li>
            <li>I felt that this was useful to know, because it&#x27;s probably best not to encourage the 3rd party sellers to overcharge on this product.</li>
            <li>Too strong.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite bubble bath because it turns the water a beautiful aqua blue and smells clean.</li>
            <li>and you sink into a nice hot bath of nothing....</li>
            <li>It tints the water a nice blue color, and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Great bubbles that last and smells like heaven!</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth after a bath.</li>
            <li>A great German bath product.</li>
            <li>It easily rinses clean.</li>
            <li>I just love the clean fresh sent,as well as the relaxing feeling</li>
            <li>will order this algemarin bubble bath again and again and again, absolut love it, smells great and turns the water in a pretty blue color</li>
            <li>Algemarin is worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>Algemarin Foam Bath is a wonderful product and I have been using it for past 20 years off and on.</li>
            <li>The suds are amazing and the water is a lovely blue.  </li>
            <li>I love the blue bathwater and truly feel like I am bathing in the warm sea.</li>
            <li>This foams up nicely and turns your bath water into a lovely shade of blue.</li>
            <li>The scent is beautiful and unlike any other I have found and it isn&#x27;t floral or cloying in any way.  </li>
            <li>If It was $15 fine, but at almost $25 for this, I had to wonder if it was really worth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not floral or sweet smelling, or like anything you&#x27;ll find at mall bath and body shops.</li>
            <li>It smells like the Sea and some sweet nuances.</li>
            <li>Fast arrival love this product</li>
            <li>I appreciate the clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very distinctive; if you don&#x27;t like strong scents (like the Badedas brand shower gel), this may not be for you.  </li>
            <li>It is fresh and calming.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is a luxury  bath product I am worth.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Through trial and error, I&#x27;ve figured out the right amount.</li>
            <li>I found that a two to three inch circle in the tub below the spout is about right.</li>
            <li>It turns the water blue (kids LOVE it!), smells up the whole house, and makes glorious bubbles.  </li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling smooth and the water changes colors to a light blue.</li>
            <li>High quality bath gel that dissolves quickly in the water, with a scent that is herbal and fresh.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty container, the scent is delightful, a little goes a long way (as with MOST European Products!!).</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll probably drop the bottle repeatedly getting the outer lid off, but there is fortunately an inner screw top.</li>
            <li>Then -- I was able to find it occasionally on the internet.  </li>
            <li>of the shipping - Really!</li>
            <li>I love the blue water it makes and the smell is heavenly ...</li>
            <li>I ususually use Badedas (It&#x27;s been harder to find sufficient shipping time from Germany), so I have tried this kind,</li>
            <li>The smell is exotic enough that you feel you are in a mineral bath.</li>
            <li>I have loved this bubble bath for years and Amazon is one of the few places to find it.  </li>
            <li>But it smells so ocean-fresh, has such a cool deep-blue tint, and leaves skin feeling so soft and clean, that it&#x27;s worth it to pay $25 a bottle here in the States.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not necessary, really, but it is kind of fun to bathe in blue water.</li>
            <li>and I hope to be able to skip the lotion during this winter&#x27;s dry, cracking skin season.  </li>
            <li>It smells similar to Badedas, but not as strong</li>
            <li>Prior to Amazon, the only place I could purchase it was in Canada when visiting extended family...and for more money than what I can find on here!  </li>
            <li>There are no directions on how much to use.</li>
            <li>I have used this item for a very looooonnnnggg time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the bubble bath to use when you need a real escape.</li>
            <li>It is very similiar in smell to Badedas (pine, horsechestnut type smell, think forest-like on a rainy afternoon day)</li>
            <li>You do not have to use much.  </li>
            <li>Softens tired skin, moisturizes and the best part - turns your water blue</li>
            <li>The only problem with this bubble bath is that it&#x27;s kind of addictive.</li>
            <li>Unlike so many other &#x27;strictly feminine&#x27; products, this one is unisex.  </li>
            <li>I have no sense of smell, so I can&#x27;t comment on this, but many other reviews support this opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is very soothing without being over powering, yet mild enough for our kids&#x27; skin!</li>
            <li>Not only is is refreshing and relaxing at the same time-</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to come across Algemarin over 30 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend item even with the price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It is a little expensive but the ingredients make your skin feel great and the fragrance is clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>and this really makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I was having trouble finding my favorite shower gel, so I tried this one.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>I ordered from this company for Mother&#x27;s Day and it took 7 days to get to Colorado from New York state.</li>
            <li>As always a great product although the packaging could be improved--an extra decorative cap that falls off the real cap confuses the issue and is just a waste of plastic, while the actual cap you measure with is not clearly identified for this purpose.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft - its a must try!</li>
            <li>Everyone I&#x27;ve shared it with loves it, including my 3 year old grandson and picky allergic friend!</li>
            <li>I first encountered it as a German exchange student in the &#x27;80s.</li>
            <li>These bubbles stayed the entire time (25 mins) and the water turns a lovely shade of deep blue.</li>
            <li>the bottle size is a bit large for handling in the shower, I transferred to a smaller container.  </li>
            <li>and it never gets old.</li>
            <li>I had to test it out of course, and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>My husband likes it for soaking after a long day to relieve joint pain as much as I do.</li>
            <li>Bottle too big &amp; clumsy, liquid definitely too blue, I prefer Vitabath which has the same good smell.</li>
            <li>Product is super-thick and concentrated; under the large wide cap is a tiny, thimble-sized screw cap and ONE thimbleful of this stuff is plenty to tint, scent, and bubble-ize</li>
            <li>The price seems a bit daunting but the bottle is huge and a very small amount is all that is necessary per bath.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not necessarily negative, but the cost-to-benefit starts to become harder to justify if you&#x27;re looking for crazy-dense super-bubbles.&lt;br /</li>

            <li> The suds are amazing and the water is a lovely blue.  </li>
            <li> I love the blue bathwater and truly feel like I am bathing in the warm sea.</li>
            <li> This foams up nicely and turns your bath water into a lovely shade of blue.</li>
            <li> The scent is beautiful and unlike any other I have found and it isn&#x27;t floral or cloying in any way.  </li>
            <li> If It was $15 fine, but at almost $25 for this, I had to wonder if it was really worth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not floral or sweet smelling, or like anything you&#x27;ll find at mall bath and body shops.</li>
            <li> It smells like the Sea and some sweet nuances.</li>
            <li> Fast arrival love this product</li>
            <li> I appreciate the clean, fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very distinctive; if you don&#x27;t like strong scents (like the Badedas brand shower gel), this may not be for you.  </li>
            <li> It is fresh and calming.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is a luxury  bath product I am worth.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Through trial and error, I&#x27;ve figured out the right amount.</li>
            <li> I found that a two to three inch circle in the tub below the spout is about right.</li>
            <li> It turns the water blue (kids LOVE it!), smells up the whole house, and makes glorious bubbles.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling smooth and the water changes colors to a light blue.</li>
            <li> High quality bath gel that dissolves quickly in the water, with a scent that is herbal and fresh.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty container, the scent is delightful, a little goes a long way (as with MOST European Products!!).</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably drop the bottle repeatedly getting the outer lid off, but there is fortunately an inner screw top.</li>
            <li> Then -- I was able to find it occasionally on the internet.  </li>
            <li> of the shipping - Really!</li>
            <li> I love the blue water it makes and the smell is heavenly ...</li>
            <li> I ususually use Badedas (It&#x27;s been harder to find sufficient shipping time from Germany), so I have tried this kind,</li>
            <li> The smell is exotic enough that you feel you are in a mineral bath.</li>
            <li> I have loved this bubble bath for years and Amazon is one of the few places to find it.  </li>
            <li> But it smells so ocean-fresh, has such a cool deep-blue tint, and leaves skin feeling so soft and clean, that it&#x27;s worth it to pay $25 a bottle here in the States.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not necessary, really, but it is kind of fun to bathe in blue water.</li>
            <li> and I hope to be able to skip the lotion during this winter&#x27;s dry, cracking skin season.  </li>
            <li> It smells similar to Badedas, but not as strong</li>
            <li> Prior to Amazon, the only place I could purchase it was in Canada when visiting extended family...and for more money than what I can find on here!  </li>
            <li> There are no directions on how much to use.</li>
            <li> I have used this item for a very looooonnnnggg time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the bubble bath to use when you need a real escape.</li>
            <li> It is very similiar in smell to Badedas (pine, horsechestnut type smell, think forest-like on a rainy afternoon day)</li>
            <li> You do not have to use much.  </li>
            <li> Softens tired skin, moisturizes and the best part - turns your water blue</li>
            <li> The only problem with this bubble bath is that it&#x27;s kind of addictive.</li>
            <li> Unlike so many other &#x27;strictly feminine&#x27; products, this one is unisex.  </li>
            <li> I have no sense of smell, so I can&#x27;t comment on this, but many other reviews support this opinion.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is very soothing without being over powering, yet mild enough for our kids&#x27; skin!</li>
            <li> Not only is is refreshing and relaxing at the same time-</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to come across Algemarin over 30 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend item even with the price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It is a little expensive but the ingredients make your skin feel great and the fragrance is clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> and this really makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding my favorite shower gel, so I tried this one.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> I ordered from this company for Mother&#x27;s Day and it took 7 days to get to Colorado from New York state.</li>
            <li> As always a great product although the packaging could be improved--an extra decorative cap that falls off the real cap confuses the issue and is just a waste of plastic, while the actual cap you measure with is not clearly identified for this purpose.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin so soft - its a must try!</li>
            <li> Everyone I&#x27;ve shared it with loves it, including my 3 year old grandson and picky allergic friend!</li>
            <li> I first encountered it as a German exchange student in the &#x27;80s.</li>
            <li> These bubbles stayed the entire time (25 mins) and the water turns a lovely shade of deep blue.</li>
            <li> the bottle size is a bit large for handling in the shower, I transferred to a smaller container.  </li>
            <li> and it never gets old.</li>
            <li> I had to test it out of course, and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it for soaking after a long day to relieve joint pain as much as I do.</li>
            <li> Bottle too big &amp; clumsy, liquid definitely too blue, I prefer Vitabath which has the same good smell.</li>
            <li> Product is super-thick and concentrated; under the large wide cap is a tiny, thimble-sized screw cap and ONE thimbleful of this stuff is plenty to tint, scent, and bubble-ize</li>
            <li> The price seems a bit daunting but the bottle is huge and a very small amount is all that is necessary per bath.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not necessarily negative, but the cost-to-benefit starts to become harder to justify if you&#x27;re looking for crazy-dense super-bubbles.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I use it all the time, especially after a long day.</li>
            <li> So the product last a long time.</li>
            <li> And it lasts for quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> As long as there is not a prioce increase we will continue to purchase from them.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling silky all day long</li>

            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is a common drugstore item in Germany, costing about the same as Irish Spring or Dove body washes.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter.  What I like about it is that it makes the water very blue.  It&#x27;s not overly bubbly (which I don&#x27;t care for with other bubble bath soap).  It smells good, makes the skin soft, and is a great bubble bath.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Started using this when I lived in Europe and couldn&#x27;t find it here.  It is a little expensive but the ingredients make your skin feel great and the fragrance is clean and fresh.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As always a great product although the packaging could be improved--an extra decorative cap that falls off the real cap confuses the issue and is just a waste of plastic, while the actual cap you measure with is not clearly identified for this purpose. It used to have a squeeze top to prevent accidentally overpouring, which also would help.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite indulgance, My Ocean water. It is fresh and calming.&lt;br /&gt;I Love it.......&lt;br /&gt;If you like a nice Bath, this is what you need.</li>
            <li> This is a great, refreshing, nondrying shower gel and it immediately became a favorite. My only complaint is the bottle- wide and flat and guaranteed to fall over for no good reason. You&#x27;ll probably drop the bottle repeatedly getting the outer lid off, but there is fortunately an inner screw top. Next time I&#x27;ll try to get a different-shaped bottle, but I will definitely buy it again. It&#x27;s terrific stuff.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I cannot get enough of this product! Not only is is refreshing and relaxing at the same time-after you bath with it, your whole home smells amazing!!! It makes my skin so soft - its a must try! Great bubbles that last and smells like heaven!</li>
            <li> This one smells magnificent. I use it all the time, especially after a long day. It&#x27;s relaxing and invigorating at the same time. Can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to come across Algemarin over 30 years ago.  My sister had it in her apartment in Cambridge, MA.  I never forgot it, and when I found it in the Colonial Pharmacy in Harvard Square twenty years later, I was hooked again.  The suds are amazing and the water is a lovely blue.  The scent is totally relaxing.  I used to travel with a bit because I did not have a tub at home.  Now I use it for every bath.</li>
            <li> Started buying this in Germany 30 years ago still incredibly refreshing as bubble bath or bathing gel. Smells great!</li>
            <li> I discovered this in Germany many years ago and brought some home.  Afterwards I would have friends bring it to me when they traveled there.  Then -- I was able to find it occasionally on the internet.  And, now, it is available!  I NEVER take a bath without it.  My DRY skin does not itch or peel. It smells great, clean -- and makes luxorious bubbles.  And it lasts for quite a long time.  Excellent!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite bubble bath because it turns the water a beautiful aqua blue and smells clean. It seems a little expensive but it&#x27;s not because you only need to use a couple teaspoons.</li>
            <li> My grandmother bathed us in this when we were children growing up in West Berlin.  It turns the water blue (kids LOVE it!), smells up the whole house, and makes glorious bubbles.  I&#x27;m so happy to be able to buy it in the states.  Everyone I&#x27;ve shared it with loves it, including my 3 year old grandson and picky allergic friend!</li>
            <li> Smell is already, color is awesome.</li>
            <li> My reward for a long hard day of work ! I found this item as a sample when traveling in Europe and fell in love with it.  I love the blue bathwater and truly feel like I am bathing in the warm sea. Terrific ..</li>
            <li> As bubble bath goes, this is the Cadillac of bubble baths. The aroma is nice and it produces lots of bubbles.  One point, though. There are no directions on how much to use. Through trial and error, I&#x27;ve figured out the right amount. I found that a two to three inch circle in the tub below the spout is about right. Add this to the bathwater as soon as you begin to fill the tub. It&#x27;ll be about 50 cents per bath.  Algemarin contains food coloring to turn the water blue. This is for aesthetics, I suppose. It&#x27;s not necessary, really, but it is kind of fun to bathe in blue water. My skin feels smooth after a bath.</li>
            <li> Amazing bubble bath. Turns the water blue which is so relaxing!  Great fragrance and at the best price. One bottle lasts me months.</li>
            <li> Our family grew up with this bubble bath.  Prior to Amazon, the only place I could purchase it was in Canada when visiting extended family...and for more money than what I can find on here!  SO happy it&#x27;s available!  Algemarin is worth every penny!  A little bit goes a long way, so it lasts a long time.  The smell is very soothing without being over powering, yet mild enough for our kids&#x27; skin!</li>
            <li> I just love Algemarin. It&#x27;s not floral or sweet smelling, or like anything you&#x27;ll find at mall bath and body shops. I use it especially after working out, a day of gardening or doing other yard work, and during the cold nights of winter. So relaxing it&#x27;s almost medicinal. This is the only bath additive I will use.</li>
            <li> highly recommend item even with the price. A little goes a long way. I have used this item for a very looooonnnnggg time.</li>
            <li> I was having trouble finding my favorite shower gel, so I tried this one.  It&#x27;s pricey, but the scent is really addictive.  It&#x27;s very distinctive; if you don&#x27;t like strong scents (like the Badedas brand shower gel), this may not be for you.  If you&#x27;re tired of floral shower gels, try this one.  &#x27;Absolutely love it (and so does my husband).</li>
            <li> Algemarin Foam Bath is a wonderful product and I have been using it for past 20 years off and on. It is sometimes difficult to find in USA. I ordered from this company for Mother&#x27;s Day and it took 7 days to get to Colorado from New York state. I had ordered the product the Wednesday before Mother&#x27;s Day and did not expect it to be there on Mother&#x27;s Day - yet also did not expect it to be there the Thursday after Mother&#x27;s Day - shipping was $12.95 - which the customer service person that I had called told me that was a bargain since she said that the company paid the other half (?) of the shipping - Really! did she think I was born yesterday?  I did not get the tracking number for my package emailed to me even though the customer service person that I spoked to when I called on the 6th day said that it had been sent to me in my email. It was sent after my call. I am disappointed and will not order from this company again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Algemarin for years.  As the other reviewer said, it&#x27;s really hard to find in the U.S., but anyone that&#x27;s tried it will go to any lengths to find it.  I have ordered it over the internet, but this was the best price that I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied. My daughter also bought this product. Excellent product, fair price from dealer. As long as there is not a prioce increase we will continue to purchase from them.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years and years and it never gets old. Softens tired skin, moisturizes and the best part - turns your water blue so you truly feel you are in an ocean oasis.</li>
            <li> My 7-year-old and I are hooked on Algemarin. I first encountered it as a German exchange student in the &#x27;80s. It is a common drugstore item in Germany, costing about the same as Irish Spring or Dove body washes. But it smells so ocean-fresh, has such a cool deep-blue tint, and leaves skin feeling so soft and clean, that it&#x27;s worth it to pay $25 a bottle here in the States. One bottle lasts FOREVER. Product is super-thick and concentrated; under the large wide cap is a tiny, thimble-sized screw cap and ONE thimbleful of this stuff is plenty to tint, scent, and bubble-ize the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the bubble bath to use when you need a real escape. It soothes, invigorates, and just has that \\&quot;tonic and refreshing\\&quot; aesthetic going like few other products.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this bubble bath.  The scent is wonderful and it makes your skin so clean and soft.  I bought it on a whim now it is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t describe why it is so amazing, but it is.  The price seems a bit daunting but the bottle is huge and a very small amount is all that is necessary per bath.  The scent is beautiful and unlike any other I have found and it isn&#x27;t floral or cloying in any way.  The bath water turns a beautiful colour and it is excellent for sore muscles and joints.  Unlike so many other &#x27;strictly feminine&#x27; products, this one is unisex.  My husband likes it for soaking after a long day to relieve joint pain as much as I do.</li>
            <li> This is some very interesting stuff. It smells like the Sea and some sweet nuances. It leaves your skin feeling smooth and the water changes colors to a light blue. It is kind of cool. There is also a little novelty in the fact that it comes from Germany.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful, looks wonderful, softens skin, great bubbling foam cleansing, doesn&#x27;t leave film in bath tub, I really like it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend. She is on a two month trip to Scotland where she has a shower but no bath, so I wanted to get this for when she returns. I had to test it out of course, and was pleasantly surprised. It tints the water a nice blue color, and smells amazing. There are two sizes on amazon that I saw. The 750ml one is currently a better deal at $24. (Even though the picture they have is for 500ml). Its pricey for bubble bath, but you wont regret it.</li>
            <li> disgusting blue that will not wash off my dry skin and the paper label is all over my shower floor.  Back to Vita Bath.</li>
            <li> When I was in Germany years ago this product was in our Hotel Room.......I just love the clean fresh sent,as well as the relaxing feeling you get from this product. So glad I found it here again!!!! Marshall fields &amp; Company also carried it for many years......</li>
            <li> No one in my family is without Algemarin. It smells fresh -- not cloyingly sweet -- great for a soak in the tub.</li>
            <li> Best bath EVER with this stuff. Smells heavenly, clean and seaside-ish, good bubble, and the water is the perfect blue. I&#x27;ve used it every night on myself and my daughter with excema and neither of us has had any skin irritation. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Bottle too big &amp; clumsy, liquid definitely too blue, I prefer Vitabath which has the same good smell.</li>
            <li> I really do not like the fragrance...very chemical.</li>
            <li> I have loved this bubble bath for years and Amazon is one of the few places to find it.  High quality bath gel that dissolves quickly in the water, with a scent that is herbal and fresh.</li>
            <li> Great smell and color.</li>
            <li> Too strong. Smells great. But my SO looked like she was swimming in ink.</li>
            <li> Ok, I wasn&#x27;t doing a real great job reading when I ordered this, because I ONLY take showers.  This Bubble Bath works as shower gel as well and it is great stuff!  It leaves your skin feeling silky all day long and I hope to be able to skip the lotion during this winter&#x27;s dry, cracking skin season.  It smells similar to Badedas, but not as strong and I love Badedas too!  Becasue the bottle size is a bit large for handling in the shower, I transferred to a smaller container.  Love it!  This will always be in my shower!  :-)</li>
            <li> YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOUR Tub/shower will be COBALT BLUE (temporarily!!) as your skin will. Yes! it&#x27;s pricey. But, ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh my the scent, the softening, the loveliness of this product is too luxurious. It&#x27;s wonderful.....and sensuous. It&#x27;s a nice gift for someone who loves time in the tub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A family member, purchased this for me, 1 time, and I was hooked. I was ill at the time and it just lifted up my spirits and made me smell and feel so much better. I just love this product. It&#x27;s a pretty container, the scent is delightful, a little goes a long way (as with MOST European Products!!). I highly recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also try : https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000066SYA/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s01?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;Did I already mention, how nice it smells.....and how long the scent lasts on the bathers[[ASIN:B0006NYCT6 Algemarin Bubble Bath 25.36oz bubble bath by Algemarin]] skin????</li>
            <li> I have used this product since 1986.  Very relaxing aromatherapy, as well as great soft skin with a great fragrance.  Better than Vita Bath.  A great German bath product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 and this really makes my skin soft. Like the fragrance. I soak in a bubble bath almost every night. Helps me relax.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent and feel. It makes for a relaxing bubble bath soak. Tense? No problem. It easily rinses clean. You have to try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to fuss over the price of anything, but I must say that reviewer \\&quot;J. Swofford\\&quot; made a point that almost made me skip this purchase (at $24.70/bottle). He/she (that is to say I&#x27;m not sure. I&#x27;m not implying that \\&quot;J. Swofford\\&quot; is trans-gendered) said \\&quot;People in the US that know about it, think of it as something exotic, though in Germany it is sold in drugstores and supermarkets\\&quot;. I felt that this was useful to know, because it&#x27;s probably best not to encourage the 3rd party sellers to overcharge on this product. If It was $15 fine, but at almost $25 for this, I had to wonder if it was really worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my girlfriend (who likes to sit in a bubble bath reading her Kindle), had recently expressed concern about the bubbly-ness  of whatever stuff we got from Sephora. So, I got the Algemarin stuff for her as a surprise. She WAS surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;* It Smells GREAT (says my GF)! I have no sense of smell, so I can&#x27;t comment on this, but many other reviews support this opinion.&lt;br /&gt;* It makes a generous amount of bubbles...but you have to dump a generous amount of product under the running water to get this.&lt;br /&gt;* Turns the water a Smurfy blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;* Mo&#x27; produc &#x3D; mo&#x27; bubbles. It&#x27;s not necessarily negative, but the cost-to-benefit starts to become harder to justify if you&#x27;re looking for crazy-dense super-bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;* A little overpriced for an item that is COMMON in Germany. I&#x27;m get that it&#x27;s imported, but its also \\&quot;just\\&quot; soap (and it&#x27;s common soap). I truly hope you understand what I&#x27;m trying to convey. I&#x27;ve bought plenty of imported (NOT from Asia) items in my lifetime (perfumes, foods, clothing, jewelry, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is GREAT for a person who likes a great non-baby smelling bubble bath, but who doesn&#x27;t need soooo many bubbles that you could keep an anvil afloat.  :-)</li>
            <li> Have used it for years... The best!</li>
            <li> My husband is enjoying this product every day on his returning from work. Smells like in expensive spa.</li>
            <li> The best bubble bath in the world! I love the blue water it makes and the smell is heavenly ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this stuff. I can&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> The only problem with this bubble bath is that it&#x27;s kind of addictive. The smell is wonderful and it makes the water a beautiful blue shade. On tough days at work, I can&#x27;t wait to get home and draw a hot bath with Algemarin bubble bath.</li>
            <li> Several years back while working in Germany, I came across Algemarin.  I immediately became hooked on it&#x27;s scent and the incredible suds it makes in the tub.  You can lay in the tub for quite a while without the water running and Algemarin suds will keep together.      People in the US that know about it, think of it as something exotic, though in Germany it is sold in drugstores and supermarkets.    The quality is first-rate.</li>
            <li> This foams up nicely and turns your bath water into a lovely shade of blue. My grandson adores it because of the color. I appreciate the clean, fresh scent. Turns your bathroom into an exotic spa. The only drawback is the price.</li>
            <li> Just tried Algemarin in my bath....turned the bath blue and swept me away!  So relaxing!  It did not make lasting bubbles, but smells heavenly....like a spa!</li>
            <li> I ususually use Badedas (It&#x27;s been harder to find sufficient shipping time from Germany), so I have tried this kind, It is very similiar in smell to Badedas (pine, horsechestnut type smell, think forest-like on a rainy afternoon day) Most of us know that when we take a bubble bath, what&#x27;s important? That the bubbles stay. I HATE when you&#x27;ve had a long day and you sink into a nice hot bath of nothing....These bubbles stayed the entire time (25 mins) and the water turns a lovely shade of deep blue. I hope this review helped.</li>
            <li> I love this product, the softness of the water it has a silky feel.  The smell is exotic enough that you feel you are in a mineral bath. You do not have to use much.  Just one or two capfuls in your bath. So the product last a long time. I would definately recommend it.  It is a luxury  bath product I am worth.</li>
            <li> Have loved this product, ever since I first visited Germany in the 60&#x27;s. It is a bathing experience.</li>
            <li> will order this algemarin bubble bath again and again and again, absolut love it, smells great and turns the water in a pretty blue color</li>
            <li> Fast arrival love this product</li>
            <li> I am a soaker!  I couldn&#x27;t find this online for at least 7 years....so happy I found it again on amazon!  The best bubble bath!  Soooo relaxing and soothing!  Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have used this product (algemarin bath foam) for years and would not like to be without.  It is a clean smelling luxuriant product that makes my bath delightful and more comforting.&lt;br /&gt;I am so very glad to be able to find this through Amazon.  I also use the Algemarin shower gel and talc.  Refreshing!</li>
