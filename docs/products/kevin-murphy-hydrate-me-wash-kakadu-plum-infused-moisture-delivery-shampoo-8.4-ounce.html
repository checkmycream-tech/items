            <li>The price, snazzy bottle with cap on the bottom, directions in five languages (LOL), ingredients that make me hungry (LOL), and wonderful fragrance tells me this is a higher-end hair product...  </li>

            <li>If you color your hair this a great shampoo to save your color.</li>

            <li>Win! :)</li>
            <li>Does a great job making my hair shiny and nice.</li>
            <li>It does have a good fragrance.</li>
            <li>so the cap is on the very top.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>My hairdresser got me started on this, and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love what they do for my finicky hair!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy with the $25-$30 price, but I can tell a huge difference if I use something else.</li>
            <li>But this stuff never made my hair look great, so I&#x27;m sticking with the pricier shampoo that makes my hair fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping, great product and price!</li>
            <li>My hairdresser broke out on her own and this is the line she now uses.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the product and it leaves my hair feeling nice</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner are fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and the rinse.</li>
            <li>It also smells unbelievably good, not overpowering but fresh.</li>
            <li>At 41, I can&#x27;t recall when my hair was in better condition.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li>I happen to absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>Probably 80% of what I love about it is the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients - but I&#x27;m not a chemist,  </li>
            <li>, I love this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>so you can feel better about what&#x27;s going in your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell is ok if plum infusion is your thing, not mine.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for years and am very familiar with the shampoo and packaging.</li>
            <li>I think the bottle is kind of cool -</li>
            <li>Heck, it makes mine look pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I do like the bottle design a lot--super easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used multiple Kevin Murphy products and for the most part they are great.</li>
            <li>It smells great and it gets any amount of buildup out without a second wash.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also paraben and sulfate free</li>
            <li>If this shampoo is not making your hair look long, silky, flowing, beautiful, ravishing, ultra-shiny, glistening, blowing in the wind, and smelling like a spring bouquet can you blame the product ???  </li>
            <li>but when I read about Kakadu Plums and Sunflower Seeds, I&#x27;m ready for a snack !!!  </li>
            <li>I was this excited about a product.</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>A great shampoo that doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m even loving the curls, because they&#x27;re soft, shiny, and touchable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super concentrated, so it lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>This has made it very challenging to find a good balance between what is good for my hair, and what is good for my scalp - use scalp-friendly product, end up with dull hair; use hair-friendly product, end up with angry, itchy, flaky scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great day of and definitely helps my hair look and feel good in this dry desert air I live in.</li>
            <li>My issue is, I have seborrheic dermatitis (think dandruff to the nth degree), so my scalp is extremely sensitive, and on top of it, I have curly, frizzy hair which I color to cover the grays.</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels after using it, but I have soft water which may affect that.  </li>
            <li>Worth every cent!!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;m back on my \\&quot;soapbox\\&quot; for the first few lines of this review - LOL . . .  </li>
            <li>Finally a shampoo that washes gently and effectively without turning your hair into a bale of hay.</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance, light lather, everything I expected from Kevin Murphy product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never heard of it before, bought it first at a salon in Canada on vacation.</li>
            <li>and that is more than enough.</li>
            <li>Great shampoo that works for my thick and wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and cannot find locally.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>so live it up!!  </li>
            <li>and I bought the trial sizes to test it out before investing so much into a shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I am absolutely the biggest skeptic when it comes to high-end, \\&quot;designer\\&quot; beauty products.</li>
            <li>So, the shampoo itself is what percent of this whole</li>
            <li>I just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much</li>
            <li>For the price, expected better results.</li>
            <li>I used to use a lot more of other brands.</li>
            <li>The actual shampoo from Cliff&#x27;s Corn Connection was lighter in color, the texture was thinner and more free flowing when compared to the same product from a local licensed salon.</li>
            <li>and I ended up having to use at least double the product and wasn&#x27;t able to comb through my hair as easily when I used this product.</li>
            <li>The packaging is not my favorite as I&#x27;ve had a few bottles that leak in my shower.</li>
            <li>My hair does get very greasy next day though, more so than other products.</li>
            <li>I had never even heard of Kevin Murphy until I went to a new stylist for a trim.</li>
            <li>During that short time without it I really saw a drastic difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I got it for much cheaper than on amazon at my local spa.</li>
            <li>They really help my dry hair look and feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li>(I have long, thick, naturally curly hair which frizzes easily), there is no frizz when I use this!</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent of this stuff, but it&#x27;s light enough that it&#x27;s not distracting.  </li>
            <li>(I find that many stylists try and sell you on a product they sell, so I initially brushed it off), and shared with me how KM uses only \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; in their products that actually DO something for your hair (no unnecessary fillers), are environmentally conscious with their packaging design (less waste in shipping/storing), and is cruelty-free.</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair (5 inches past shoulder) and literally use a dime to quarter size of the shampoo and dime size for the rinse</li>
            <li>I am a total shampoo snob, and usually buy Alterna, Paul Mitchell, Back to Basics, Enjoy, Biolage, etc.  </li>
            <li>My hair is completely fried with bleach since I dye my hair pink, and after I use my Hydrate Me shampoo and conditioner and my Young Again serum, you&#x27;d never even know my hair felt literally like straw 6 weeks ago.  </li>
            <li>Also, keep in mind that a bottle lasts a LONG time, since the product is so rich and dense, you&#x27;ll need about half of what you&#x27;d normally use (I have pretty thick, long hair, and a bottle lasts me about 4 months, and I shampoo every other day).</li>
            <li>it is possible to tell a good shampoo from a bad one.  </li>

            <li> The product I received from Cliff&#x27;s Corn Connection had inconsistencies that made me question authenticity.</li>
            <li> Especially if you have extremely hard water and your hair tends to get dry.  </li>
            <li> I have tried MANY of them, including Bumble &amp; Bumble, Joico, Redken, Paul Mitchell, Goldwell, and Pureology, and they have all disappointed.</li>
            <li> Its a little on the expensive side but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This bottle lasted me about 3.5 months, with on average every other day hair washing.</li>
            <li> Something was not right with the product.</li>
            <li> I have been a die hard Bedhead products girl for several years, but my hair has never been softer or healthier looking since I started using the Kevin Murphy brand.  </li>
            <li> I only need a dime size of both for my just beyond shoulder-length thick hair.  </li>
            <li> but I use so much less of it.</li>
            <li> It is a bit pricey on line, so I buy mine from my hairdresser at around $11 a bottle less than I can find on line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side but as others have pointed out, you need not use a lot to get the intended effect.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the cost is a bit shocking for most of us on a budget, but when I think of all the money I&#x27;ve spent on water filters for the shower head, scalp treatments, hair products, etc.</li>
            <li> I thought my hair was dead at the bottom</li>
            <li> The packaging had a number of small differences when compared to a bottle I already owned.</li>
            <li> I wear cold fusion hair extensions and this is the only product that preserves the quality of them!</li>
            <li> (I have longer, medium thick, wavy/curly hair that is color treated).</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and the rinse,  however the price here is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> The product sent was the wrong product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a faint plum fragrance which smells divine on my just washed hair.  </li>

It&#x27;s super concentrated, so it lasts forever.  It smells great and it gets any amount of buildup out without a second wash.  I really can&#x27;t say enough good things about these products!</li>
            <li> Finally a shampoo that washes gently and effectively without turning your hair into a bale of hay.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does an awsome job at cleansing hair just loaded with hair spray!!! It has a wonderful conditioning component/ingredient and smells great too!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never heard of it before, bought it first at a salon in Canada on vacation. On my third bottle of it now and was out of it for a short time. During that short time without it I really saw a drastic difference in my hair. Back to using it again and it just leaves my hair in perfect condition every time. Love this shampoo and the rinse. It&#x27;s a bit pricier than others from the store but I use so much less of it. I have long fine hair (5 inches past shoulder) and literally use a dime to quarter size of the shampoo and dime size for the rinse and that is more than enough. I used to use a lot more of other brands. This bottle lasted me about 3.5 months, with on average every other day hair washing. I just bought the larger bottle due to the savings.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely the biggest skeptic when it comes to high-end, \\&quot;designer\\&quot; beauty products. I have tried MANY of them, including Bumble &amp; Bumble, Joico, Redken, Paul Mitchell, Goldwell, and Pureology, and they have all disappointed. My issue is, I have seborrheic dermatitis (think dandruff to the nth degree), so my scalp is extremely sensitive, and on top of it, I have curly, frizzy hair which I color to cover the grays. This has made it very challenging to find a good balance between what is good for my hair, and what is good for my scalp - use scalp-friendly product, end up with dull hair; use hair-friendly product, end up with angry, itchy, flaky scalp. Until now. I had never even heard of Kevin Murphy until I went to a new stylist for a trim. She was clearly very passionate about the product she was using (I find that many stylists try and sell you on a product they sell, so I initially brushed it off), and shared with me how KM uses only \\&quot;stuff\\&quot; in their products that actually DO something for your hair (no unnecessary fillers), are environmentally conscious with their packaging design (less waste in shipping/storing), and is cruelty-free. It also smells unbelievably good, not overpowering but fresh. I picked up a couple of 40 ml \\&quot;samples\\&quot;, and I am sold. At 41, I can&#x27;t recall when my hair was in better condition. I&#x27;m even loving the curls, because they&#x27;re soft, shiny, and touchable. Yes, the cost is a bit shocking for most of us on a budget, but when I think of all the money I&#x27;ve spent on water filters for the shower head, scalp treatments, hair products, etc., I think it&#x27;s well worth it. I&#x27;m not looking back. Also, keep in mind that a bottle lasts a LONG time, since the product is so rich and dense, you&#x27;ll need about half of what you&#x27;d normally use (I have pretty thick, long hair, and a bottle lasts me about 4 months, and I shampoo every other day). I can&#x27;t recall last time I was this excited about a product.</li>
            <li> The product sent was the wrong product. There was a sticker with a bar code and the name of a different product stuck on the product.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and manageable. I get so many compliments on how healthy my hair looks. I love this stuff, it&#x27;s the best!</li>
            <li> I wear cold fusion hair extensions and this is the only product that preserves the quality of them! I wasn&#x27;t happy with the $25-$30 price, but I can tell a huge difference if I use something else.</li>
            <li> Its a little on the expensive side but worth every penny. You don&#x27;t need a lot and it smells great. If you color your hair this a great shampoo to save your color.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance, light lather, everything I expected from Kevin Murphy product.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser got me started on this, and I love it! Does a great job making my hair shiny and nice.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m back on my \\&quot;soapbox\\&quot; for the first few lines of this review - LOL . . .  If this shampoo is not making your hair look long, silky, flowing, beautiful, ravishing, ultra-shiny, glistening, blowing in the wind, and smelling like a spring bouquet can you blame the product ???  We all have different hair types, different hair \\&quot;health\\&quot;, different water hardness, different cuts/styles, different finishing techniques, different preferences for fragrances, etc.  So, the shampoo itself is what percent of this whole equation???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now don&#x27;t get me wrong it is possible to tell a good shampoo from a bad one.  But if you don&#x27;t like the fragrance, for example and someone else loves it - how do you evaluate that?  If one person has hard water and another person has soft water - how do you evaluate that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s look at this specific product . . .  I happen to absolutely love it.  Probably 80% of what I love about it is the fragrance. Yet others didn&#x27;t like the fragrance.  I love the way my hair feels after using it, but I have soft water which may affect that.  I think the bottle is kind of cool - but one reviewer didn&#x27;t like it because the cap at bottom leaked - however, all one needs to do is simply turn the bottle so the cap is on the very top.  I love the ingredients - but I&#x27;m not a chemist,  so instead of impressing me as something great for my hair they make me hungry. . .  I don&#x27;t know about anyone else, but when I read about Kakadu Plums and Sunflower Seeds, I&#x27;m ready for a snack !!!  LOL. One reviewer said they were going back to their higher-end hair products while others considered this a higher-end hair product.  Which is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for me, with my hair type, my water type, my preferences for fragrances, etc., I love this shampoo.  The price, snazzy bottle with cap on the bottom, directions in five languages (LOL), ingredients that make me hungry (LOL), and wonderful fragrance tells me this is a higher-end hair product...  For me, this is a great shampoo!!!his is a great shampoo!!!</li>
            <li> My hair was straw before I used the hydrate me conditioner. I thought my hair was dead at the bottom and I swear this product breathed life back into it. I haven&#x27;t tried to shampoo. I got it for much cheaper than on amazon at my local spa. Don&#x27;t know what is up with this price.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo that works for my thick and wavy hair. I just wish it didn&#x27;t cost so much but I can&#x27;t find anything else that compares.</li>
            <li> For the price, expected better results. It does have a good fragrance.</li>
            <li> These products are the best I have encountered, although the price is somewhat prohibitive @ $30+ each.  Love what they do for my finicky hair!</li>
            <li> I just bought this product.  Both the shampoo and the rinse,  however the price here is ridiculous.  I paid $58.00 for both products that are both 8.4 ounces from the salon I go to.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t hurt your hair.  Heck, it makes mine look pretty good.  But this stuff never made my hair look great, so I&#x27;m sticking with the pricier shampoo that makes my hair fantastic.  Also, I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent of this stuff, but it&#x27;s light enough that it&#x27;s not distracting.  I do like the bottle design a lot--super easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used multiple Kevin Murphy products and for the most part they are great. The packaging is not my favorite as I&#x27;ve had a few bottles that leak in my shower. I love the smell of the product and it leaves my hair feeling nice (I have longer, medium thick, wavy/curly hair that is color treated).</li>
            <li> I use both the Hydrate Me Wash and Rinse.  It&#x27;s a little on the pricey side but as others have pointed out, you need not use a lot to get the intended effect.  I only need a dime size of both for my just beyond shoulder-length thick hair.  It&#x27;s a faint plum fragrance which smells divine on my just washed hair.  It&#x27;s also paraben and sulfate free so you can feel better about what&#x27;s going in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Burt&#x27;s Bees for a cheaper alternative and I ended up having to use at least double the product and wasn&#x27;t able to comb through my hair as easily when I used this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great day of and definitely helps my hair look and feel good in this dry desert air I live in. My hair does get very greasy next day though, more so than other products. The smell is ok if plum infusion is your thing, not mine.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but worth every penny!  Especially if you have extremely hard water and your hair tends to get dry.  Also, great if you color or perm your hair.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and cannot find locally. Thanks!  Fast shipping, great product and price!</li>
            <li> Worth every cent!!&lt;br /&gt;  Just remember YOU deserve it !!  Life is short&lt;br /&gt;  so live it up!!  You will buy it again!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser broke out on her own and this is the line she now uses. My hair LOVES IT!!! I have been a die hard Bedhead products girl for several years, but my hair has never been softer or healthier looking since I started using the Kevin Murphy brand.  (I have long, thick, naturally curly hair which frizzes easily), there is no frizz when I use this! It is a bit pricey on line, so I buy mine from my hairdresser at around $11 a bottle less than I can find on line. Win! :)</li>
            <li> you must try this, changed my damaged hair to perfect hair</li>
