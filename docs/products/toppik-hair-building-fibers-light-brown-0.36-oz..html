            <li>It tastes great !</li>
            <li>whatever you put it on grows hair and tastes great !</li>
            <li>But it blends flawlessly.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product for my mother.</li>

            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Really is a great product and has helped my confidence a lot.</li>
            <li>This worked great for me.</li>
            <li>then I ordered darker than my hair and it works great.</li>
            <li>This is amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>I mix light brown with blond to achieve the perfect shade.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that coworkers would notice, and believe me the group I work with would say something if they noticed, but noone noticed at all, unless you count a couple of compliments from people who said my &amp;#34;haircut&amp;#34; looked good..  </li>
            <li>I have medium brown hair and got the light brown fibers -- perfect transition in colors.  </li>
            <li>Good price on this product</li>
            <li>Provides good color and fiber coverage on spare hair areas.  </li>
            <li>I have colored blond hair and the light brown is perfect!</li>
            <li>So for now, this is a great way to feel better about my appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good idea to use a shade darker than your own hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>Great product easy transaction&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>Nice coverage.</li>
            <li>Coverage does kind of look like you have dust on your head.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t see the scalp that was beginning to show at the top of my head.</li>
            <li>Have used for many years..</li>
            <li>love this product...</li>
            <li>My hair is thinning on the top and this product helps cover the scalp area.</li>
            <li>The shaker is okay.  </li>
            <li>Also, I could not remove the top in order to put the spray top I purchased.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to get the correct color.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s ok..</li>
            <li>I also bought the tip that sprays the product which I like, but the &amp;#34;shaker&amp;#34; top also works well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read before that it&#x27;s better for thinning in the front.</li>
            <li>I just got this last night and was very impressed with it just trying it out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that as time goes by</li>
            <li>and I get better at applying it</li>
            <li>I will like it even more.</li>
            <li>As a woman with thining hair I have tried so many products to improve my appearance.  </li>
            <li>Regular hair spray works great to keep it in place all day!  </li>
            <li>This product is magical.</li>
            <li>This product worked fairly well at first.</li>
            <li>Tis product is usually very good, but this last one was/is damp so the fibers wont come out of the shaker.  </li>
            <li>I did go ahead and buy the spray applicator so that I can get more accurate coverage without making my hair frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ordering from Amazon is the fastest and most budget friendly way of ordering.  </li>
            <li>I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>Guess I just have to accept and embrace my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Looks super natural and great coverage.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference in my hair style.</li>
            <li>and I use the Light Brown.</li>
            <li>ordered the light brown and found it to be an accurate color.</li>
            <li>If the gray start to show on top I sprinkle some toppik  on it with a little spay and am good for a day or two more.</li>
            <li>It is easy to appy and blends nicely with my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I first purchased the light brown and found it was just a hint too light for me.</li>
            <li>Color is true to the description and makes hair look fuller.</li>
            <li>Toppik is easy to use and it does exactly what it advertises it will do.</li>
            <li>What can you say about Toppik other than it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for age related female pattern thinning</li>
            <li>Now, she feels much more confident when she goes out in public, or to family events.</li>
            <li>when I purchased dark brown it was great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m no longer self conscious about my hair - one less thing to think about LOL!</li>
            <li>My hair is thinning out in spots and this is the best product I have found to camouflage the thin spots.</li>
            <li>Gently massage, or better yet, gently tap the powder to give it a more natural look.</li>
            <li>The price is definitely worth the confidence boost, and even better there&#x27;s no mess or rubbing off on clothing,</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>once you know how to use it in a just right way for you.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to apply, takes me all of one minute to apply actually, pat the area where applied and then style..  </li>
            <li>And this product completely changed things for me it really gives an amazing coverage and it looks like real hair.</li>
            <li>A little more is better than trying to skimp.</li>
            <li>This product is very good for thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t believe it, but this really works!</li>
            <li>I know of several people that have started using Toppik for thining hair Everyone (including me) are pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The first order I made was for a color I thought would match my hair</li>
            <li>Needs more shaking than the same product by Caboki.</li>
            <li>Looks like real hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t detect it once you sprinkle it on your hair.</li>
            <li>etc that I was also very concerned about...</li>
            <li>The fibers give some thickness, but not as much coverage as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li>it covers thinning patches with a very unnoticeable system of fibers...</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>This light brown color does a better job at coloring in my extremely pale part during the winter months (and in between salon visits to get my highlighted blonde roots filled in) than the blonde shades.  </li>
            <li>I did notice a slight itchy feeling, make sure you wash it out when home for the day.</li>
            <li>Wash, set, dry, brush, sprinkle lightly on thinning areas and known areas of &amp;#34;parting&amp;#34; of hair.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with how natural and full my hair looks--a dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t the right color for me, the medium brown is a little too dark and the light brown is too light.</li>
            <li>I learned somewhere to only peel back just a small corner of the lid-sticker and this works great.  </li>
            <li>hair is  fine and very thin on top.</li>
            <li>Very natural look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than other products that do the same thing.  </li>
            <li>It takes practice to distribute the powder lightly over scalp areas but I&#x27;ve got it down.</li>
            <li>Though it was sealed, upon opening it, and shaking it, it has become apparent that this particular item is compromised so therefore...useless.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great but a little expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want the shaker-top holes too big as this will allow too much product to come out at once.</li>
            <li>I knew going into buying such a product not to expect much.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend if your hair is thin or fine but not for baldness or bald spots!</li>
            <li>After my mom&#x27;s brain surgery, she was always more than just a little self conscious of her &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; due to the surgery / medication.</li>
            <li>but the light is a little yellow.</li>
            <li>Be careful how much you use.  </li>
            <li>As we age, our hair tends to thin out and this product is magic for those areas.  </li>
            <li>Also, using the right color helps so start with small container order until you know what your color is.</li>
            <li>I had fine thin curly/wavey hair.</li>

            <li> Also, using the right color helps so start with small container order until you know what your color is.</li>
            <li> I had fine thin curly/wavey hair.</li>
            <li> A different product that I tried had a strange odor and made my scalp itch</li>
            <li> I honestly expected to be disappointed, but I was pleasantly surprised that the product does pretty much exactly what&#x27;s promised!  </li>
            <li> As long as you don&#x27;t scrape the toppik off with a comb or fingernail, it will stay in all day.</li>
            <li> I had already tried the dark blonde and light blonde toppix to help blend the gap of my part created by diffuse loss of my dirty blonde colored hair.  </li>
            <li> I keep a short haircut, but always a bit self conscious about my thin spot in back, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot...</li>
            <li> If you sprinkle too much your skin might become splotchy or cheetah patterned so careful to shake on just enough for a thin layer.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thinning in the back and with a little of this sprinkled there the thinning is not noticable.</li>
            <li> When I had used it only a few times, the shaker screen came off and the powder went everywhere.</li>
            <li> TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> It would probably work on other types hair.</li>
            <li> It works well for  covering thin areas and the fiber is very natural.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a little volume, but it&#x27;s not what i expected.</li>
            <li> Like another review (a negative one), I also have coarse and curly hair.</li>
            <li> Product comes out once you brush your hair; colors are not very accurate.  </li>
            <li> Used to help make scalp less visible.  </li>
            <li> Nothing less.</li>
            <li> A shake of two, a little hairspray to set the powder</li>
            <li> Takes a little practice to get it</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The salon I go to recommended this for my thinning hair.  It was getting bad enough that I was considering a wig, but this does the trick.  I recommend it to everyone.  It&#x27;s perfect for age related female pattern thinning</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe it, but this really works! A shake of two, a little hairspray to set the powder and I can&#x27;t see the scalp that was beginning to show at the top of my head. I&#x27;m no longer self conscious about my hair - one less thing to think about LOL!</li>
            <li> Nope, doesn&#x27;t work.  I have really fine hair, it&#x27;s a dirty/dishwater blonde so that&#x27;s the color I ordered for.  The powder looks red on my scalp and clumps up.  I&#x27;ve tried various techniques with different combs, parting the hair, blowdrying but just doesn&#x27;t work.  Guess I just have to accept and embrace my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Good idea to use a shade darker than your own hair.  No one knows it&#x27;s there. Looks like real hair.</li>
            <li> Have used for many years..love this product...I mix light brown with blond to achieve the perfect shade.  My hair is thinning on the top and this product helps cover the scalp area.</li>
            <li> tried it and all it did was turn my hair/scalp green. DO NOT GET!!!!!!! TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY! TERRIBLE PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Used to help make scalp less visible.  Does a great job.  Takes a little practice to get it just right. A little more is better than trying to skimp.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product recommended by my hairdresser.  As we age, our hair tends to thin out and this product is magic for those areas.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 6 months ago to help with thinning hair.  A different product that I tried had a strange odor and made my scalp itch but this didn&#x27;t have either of those problems.  It helps hide the thin spots and I can&#x27;t even tell it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li> I feel like this product is just a scam. Whenever I put it on, my hair would get so tangled. I had fine thin curly/wavey hair. I put it in 3 times and every time I put it on I felt like it made my hair worse. So I stopped using it asap.</li>
            <li> What can you say about Toppik other than it&#x27;s great.  It&#x27;s better than other products that do the same thing.  You really can&#x27;t detect it once you sprinkle it on your hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product and will buy it again. You don&#x27;t want the shaker-top holes too big as this will allow too much product to come out at once. (This will give an un-natural look.) You simply shake it on and then \\&quot;pat\\&quot; the area to disperse the fibers. They DO stay put until you wash them out!</li>
            <li> This is amazing! I lost my hair from chemo and it is finally coming back but it really thin in spots but Toppix hides the thin spots and it&#x27;s great but a little expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> It tastes great ! On eggs, turkey, muffins , snatch you name it whatever you put it on grows hair and tastes great !</li>
            <li> I did a review on this for the medium brown also. I love this! I first purchased the light brown and found it was just a hint too light for me. I then purchased the medium brown and mixed the two together. Amazing! Looks super natural and great coverage.</li>
            <li> I keep a short haircut, but always a bit self conscious about my thin spot in back, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot... I honestly expected to be disappointed, but I was pleasantly surprised that the product does pretty much exactly what&#x27;s promised!  Very easy to apply, takes me all of one minute to apply actually, pat the area where applied and then style..  That&#x27;s it..  I was worried that coworkers would notice, and believe me the group I work with would say something if they noticed, but noone noticed at all, unless you count a couple of compliments from people who said my &amp;#34;haircut&amp;#34; looked good..  The price is definitely worth the confidence boost, and even better there&#x27;s no mess or rubbing off on clothing, etc that I was also very concerned about...</li>
            <li> The shaker is okay.  The fibers give some thickness, but not as much coverage as I had hoped.  Also, I could not remove the top in order to put the spray top I purchased.</li>
            <li> I am astonished -- this actually works.  It works well.  It not only covers the ummm .... &amp;#34;blank spots&amp;#34; .... it gives a little uplift and body to the surrounding hair.  I have medium brown hair and got the light brown fibers -- perfect transition in colors.  Very natural look.</li>
            <li> It was a horrible mess. The color was difficult to control and it does not work with hairspray.&lt;br /&gt;I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Once you get the knack of applying this product ( and it really isn&#x27;t very difficult) you will be so happy to have found this.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is  fine and very thin on top. Toppik has made it possible for me not to be self-conscious anymore about my thinning hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin is a couple of different areas. I just sprinkle this on and it blends in with my hair. It is amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;You will not be disappointment with this product!! Just make sure to get the correct color.  My hair is a dark blonde (dirty blonde) color and I use the Light Brown.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a little volume, but it&#x27;s not what i expected. It is very expensive, too. I guess it&#x27;s ok..</li>
            <li> This product is very good for thin hair.  The color is similar in person, as shown on line.  I also bought the tip that sprays the product which I like, but the &amp;#34;shaker&amp;#34; top also works well.  Nice coverage. I would highly recommend if your hair is thin or fine but not for baldness or bald spots!</li>
            <li> color is a little weird. when I purchased dark brown it was great but the light is a little yellow.</li>
            <li> I just got this, so I&#x27;m still learning some of the art of applying it. But it blends flawlessly. And looks great. I&#x27;m using Propercia and a Hairmax come that I hope gives me some results (if not, I&#x27;ll be getting a transplant procedure). So for now, this is a great way to feel better about my appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read before that it&#x27;s better for thinning in the front. And that&#x27;s what I have. So note that if you have a bald spot in the back.</li>
            <li> I have been using Toppik for about ten years.  Ordering from Amazon is the fastest and most budget friendly way of ordering.  Toppik is easy to use and it does exactly what it advertises it will do.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great once you know how to use it in a just right way for you.  Also, using the right color helps so start with small container order until you know what your color is. For women with hair issues this is a stress reliever.  As long as you don&#x27;t scrape the toppik off with a comb or fingernail, it will stay in all day.</li>
            <li> What fibers?  All it did was put a bit of color on my hair.  Very disappointed, I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I tried it and did not like it. This product was powdery and looked unnatural for my type hair that is course and curly.  It would probably work on other types hair.</li>
            <li> Product delivers as it says...it covers thinning patches with a very unnoticeable system of fibers... doesn&#x27;t flake off or run... try it1</li>
            <li> very good, works well.</li>
            <li> I knew going into buying such a product not to expect much. Coverage does kind of look like you have dust on your head. I did notice a slight itchy feeling, make sure you wash it out when home for the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy to have found this product for my mother. Her hair separates in the back after sleeping. Putting this product on her scalp has taken away this annoyance factor. She has no more complaints of &amp;#34;white scalp&amp;#34; . I use one color lighter than her regular color. It takes practice to distribute the powder lightly over scalp areas but I&#x27;ve got it down. Wash, set, dry, brush, sprinkle lightly on thinning areas and known areas of &amp;#34;parting&amp;#34; of hair. .Mom is so happy. I&#x27;m loving this product for her!!</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair, and bought this product to try, since I can no longer order Joan River&#x27;s fill-in powder in blonde. This product worked fairly well at first. When I had used it only a few times, the shaker screen came off and the powder went everywhere. I lost over 2/3rds of the fibers, which made this a very expensive product. I will not order it again.</li>
            <li> Great product easy transaction&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I just got this last night and was very impressed with it just trying it out. I&#x27;m sure that as time goes by and I get better at applying it I will like it even more. I did go ahead and buy the spray applicator so that I can get more accurate coverage without making my hair frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the light brown and found it to be an accurate color. Like another review (a negative one), I also have coarse and curly hair. No problems here, though.</li>
            <li> Good price on this product</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My hair is thinning in the back and with a little of this sprinkled there the thinning is not noticable.</li>
            <li> I know of several people that have started using Toppik for thining hair Everyone (including me) are pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning out in spots and this is the best product I have found to camouflage the thin spots.</li>
            <li> As a woman with thining hair I have tried so many products to improve my appearance.  This is the one that does it.  It is easy to appy and blends nicely with my natural hair.</li>
            <li> If the gray start to show on top I sprinkle some toppik  on it with a little spay and am good for a day or two more.</li>
            <li> Provides good color and fiber coverage on spare hair areas.  Color is true to the description and makes hair look fuller.</li>
            <li> This really works. Need hairspray over it to hold for a longer time.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have some existing hair in the area you&#x27;re attempting to &#x27;cover&#x27;, this will not work for you.  Product comes out once you brush your hair; colors are not very accurate.  Overuse gives appearance of &amp;#34;afro-centric&amp;#34; type hair.  Weird</li>
            <li> Toppik is a miracle and a life saver.  Nothing less. I am thrilled with how natural and full my hair looks--a dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li> I had already tried the dark blonde and light blonde toppix to help blend the gap of my part created by diffuse loss of my dirty blonde colored hair.  This light brown color does a better job at coloring in my extremely pale part during the winter months (and in between salon visits to get my highlighted blonde roots filled in) than the blonde shades.  I learned somewhere to only peel back just a small corner of the lid-sticker and this works great.  If you sprinkle too much your skin might become splotchy or cheetah patterned so careful to shake on just enough for a thin layer.  Regular hair spray works great to keep it in place all day!  Really is a great product and has helped my confidence a lot.</li>
            <li> Toppik gives me confidence.  I am not as self-conscious.  Be careful how much you use.  Gently massage, or better yet, gently tap the powder to give it a more natural look.</li>
            <li> This worked great for me. The first order I made was for a color I thought would match my hair but it didn&#x27;t help to make my hair look thicker, so then I ordered darker than my hair and it works great. It makes a huge difference in my hair style.</li>
            <li> It works miracles for anyone who has a little &amp;#34;bald spot&amp;#34;. After my mom&#x27;s brain surgery, she was always more than just a little self conscious of her &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; due to the surgery / medication. Now, she feels much more confident when she goes out in public, or to family events.</li>
            <li> This product is magical. I&#x27;ve always had thin hair at the front. And this product completely changed things for me it really gives an amazing coverage and it looks like real hair.</li>
            <li> Tis product is usually very good, but this last one was/is damp so the fibers wont come out of the shaker.  Though it was sealed, upon opening it, and shaking it, it has become apparent that this particular item is compromised so therefore...useless.  No response from AMAZON yet.</li>
            <li> Made this comment for Caboki. Meant to make it for this item. Holes are way too small. Needs more shaking than the same product by Caboki. Enlarge your holes, or will never purchase again. Kent Oram</li>
            <li> It works well for  covering thin areas and the fiber is very natural. I have colored blond hair and the light brown is perfect!</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t the right color for me, the medium brown is a little too dark and the light brown is too light. But the product does work well covering up this hair.</li>
