            <li>Wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>LOVE the soaps for body and face but DO NOT TRY TO USE ON YOUR HAIR!!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look very good, but I think this color is caused by the  shikaki powder stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my search for my ideal conditioner continues.</li>
            <li>Bronner&#x27;s is an INCREDIBLE company.</li>
            <li>I began using this the moment I received it and was SO delighted!</li>
            <li>But this came smelling good. :D  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased to say, No Tangles!</li>
            <li>Great fragrance.</li>
            <li>The rinse counters this effect and is GREAT at detangling.  </li>
            <li>In fact, my hair smells really great after washing.</li>
            <li>The two make a great combo.</li>
            <li>The earthy citrus smell is great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, but it did not work for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Use it to this day, great product.</li>
            <li>It even smells great, diluted that is</li>
            <li>All in all, great product ---</li>
            <li>I have happy silky hair and scalp that does not itch or flake.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li>It smells great and has done wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li>I believe if I had also bought the hair creme and tried that, it would have been a great combination.</li>
            <li>Smells great</li>
            <li>But this is great for co-washing.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be great.  </li>
            <li>I use just this and Dr Bronners soap and it leaves my hair looking great.</li>
            <li>What a great product.  </li>
            <li>The product is great and works well, it just doesn&#x27;t work the way I want on my hair.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioning rinse!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy to have found a combination of products that I can feel good about putting into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Paired up with this product (I could use Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar, but eh -- I want to support someone&#x27;s honest income at Dr. Bronner&#x27;s!)</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant, but not over powering smell.</li>
            <li>Best certified organic conditioner I&#x27;ve found, and easy on the wallet.</li>
            <li>It smells great after it dries and leaves it light and breezy, ideal for humid climates.</li>
            <li>Feels good.</li>
            <li>Good buy..</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>stuff leaves my hair looking and feeling good.</li>
            <li>the good.</li>
            <li>smells so good</li>
            <li>To be fair, the labeling on the bottle does warn of this side effect.</li>
            <li>wise it would look oily.  </li>
            <li>-- it doesn&#x27;t look great and it doesn&#x27;t smell great; but wow is it great for your hair!  </li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve started using diluted Dr. Bronners Baby Mild Castile Soap as shampoo and this conditioner is the perfect match.</li>
            <li>came quickly, i use this to make fabric softener, it smells wonderful</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it is almost as good as the vinegar but smells heck of a lot better!  </li>
            <li>I now have beautiful wavy golden hair again!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE that they can proudly show the USDA organic symbol on the front of their packaging.</li>
            <li>The smell ain&#x27;t that great either, though better than poop.  </li>
            <li>Smells great to me, spot on if you love lemon scents.</li>
            <li>The Dr. Bronner&#x27;s hair creme is also very lovely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lovely scent, great conditioning performance, and product lasts longer than you might think---</li>
            <li>, it kind of reminded me of orange candy, but not in a good way.  </li>
            <li>I could see how it might not be best for all hair textures, but for fine hair, it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I decided to give this stuff a try, along with the lavender leave in, and so glad I did!</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this product!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m SO glad that I did!  </li>
            <li>What I also realized yesterday was interesting; when I poured lots of it to my hair and my hand it kind of burned my finger!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>And I am SO glad I did!  </li>
            <li>citrus IS better than vinegar, though, so it&#x27;s one-up on what I WAS doing!</li>
            <li>Just be sure to rinse well!)</li>
            <li>first thing you&#x27;ll notice is that it smells like wonderful citrus.</li>
            <li>P)&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair!</li>
            <li>I just love the smell of this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I will keep buying this product love it!</li>
            <li>, it combed easily and looked great.  </li>
            <li>The brand is great, they use great natural ingredients that make me feel good about what I&#x27;m buying.</li>
            <li>The combination of these two products is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li>I now use just an apple cider vinegar rinse and my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li>My hair feels that amazing for days after.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I would like to add that I also ordered a bottle of Dr. \\&quot;Bronner&#x27;s Liquid Soap\\&quot; and its amazing.</li>
            <li>It looks like feces, but it smells absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap and this citrus orange conditioner for about a year now, and my hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not heavenly amazing like some claim, but its not compost trash smelling either like</li>
            <li>I liked the way it smelled.</li>
            <li>That didn&#x27;t feel good either :-)</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair smelling spectacular.</li>
            <li>They work really well for me, and  they smell wonderful.</li>
            <li>so when a friend read that it needed to be dilluted, that KIND of made sense, but it said 1-2 caps to 1 cup of water...</li>
            <li>I use Dr Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap as shampoo and hand soap, and I liked the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li>I learned that I do prefer organic products in the bath and, because of this experiment, I&#x27;ve started to make my own laundry soap with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and my own body wash with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to stay away from the harmful chemicals that most hair products have and this product is as good as any to help me with my mission.  </li>
            <li>I bought the lavender kind and heard that using coconut oil as conditioner afterwards would work.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t even think my hair needs to transition to using the soap and this rinse as a follow up.</li>
            <li>(so it smells better) and contains a bunch of oils that are good for your hair.</li>
            <li>Also, not a fan of having to dilute the rinse on my own before use.</li>
            <li>My hair looks good... way better than vinegar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried using diluted apple cider vinegar as a hair rinse, and although I really liked the result, I didn&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
            <li>Let it sit in your hair for your whole shower and you&#x27;ve got great feeling, manageable hair with no chemicals!</li>
            <li>ketchup/condiment squirt bottle and fill up the rest of the bottle with warm water.  </li>
            <li>the fragrance is really nice though.</li>
            <li>I used this with Doctor zbronner&#x27;s Hemp Rose soap.</li>
            <li>It works well, although the mixing is kind of a pain.</li>
            <li>While I enjoy the results of the apple cider vinegar rinse better, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Shikakai hair rinse is a great alternative.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to pour out of bottle, I use a plastic squeeze bottle with a spout and I use one capful and fill the rest with water.</li>
            <li>The smell of this is very very strong.</li>
            <li>I do admit it is very strong when using it in the shower</li>
            <li>Very strong scent.</li>
            <li>The citrus, smell is very strong, but it does mellow out once you start massaging it</li>
            <li>It smells very strong and made my scalp burn even though it gets diluted in water before you apply it.</li>
            <li>It also has a very strong smell and it made me cough as soon as I smelled it.</li>
            <li>Make sure you dilute this stuff--it&#x27;s potent!</li>
            <li>I have wavy, dry hair, and this manages to keep it healthy, looking great, and feeling awesome.</li>
            <li>love this product, it&#x27;s awesome, and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Dr Bronners products are all natural and this hair conditioner is excellent.  </li>
            <li>This is an AMAZING fact for me -- I always thought I&#x27;d never be able to do that.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps this is a salon item, something best used in an environment where a professional operator has mixing utensils close at hand, as well as timers and a sink into which the client&#x27;s head can be reclined.</li>
            <li>I take a recycled water bottle (16 oz) and fill it almost to the top with warm water.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair look naturally shiny and very beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have very fine chin length hair.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li>A very effective and economical combination for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This also smells very orangy and good!  </li>
            <li>That said, it has worked really great for me, so I don&#x27;t mind those things very much.</li>
            <li>This is not a product for fine hair!  </li>
            <li>I will work a brush through my hair and, when my hair dries, it is very smooth and silky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it makes my hair feel very smooth</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair look really healthy.</li>
            <li>I love all Bronner&#x27;s products</li>
            <li>So many reviews that state</li>
            <li>I have tried shampooing my hair with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap and using the Citrus Hair Rinse as a conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My scalp has never felt better.</li>
            <li>I get more complements on my hair when I use it.     </li>
            <li>It smells like something that I&#x27;d put together in my kitchen, but the difference is that it actually works and makes my hair do wonderful things.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is organic.</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair feels and looks after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more like a sting.</li>
            <li>I started using this conditioner along with the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Organic Shikakai Body Soap on my hair and love them both.</li>
            <li>sure you follow the directions and finger</li>
            <li>okay, but would not recommend.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Indian women wash their hair with oil, most of the time coconut, then leave it in for hours.  </li>
            <li>is much better.. :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found something with non-toxic ingredients that work.</li>
            <li>This is definitely better than any conditioner I have tried before</li>
            <li>I noticed that it gives my hair much more volume</li>
            <li>I love this rinse for what it does to my hair.</li>
            <li>More power to anyone who does the full-blown \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; method, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>I decided to try JR Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars with this product, because they&#x27;re safe for color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>it is infinitely better and presentable to wear to the office.</li>
            <li>This is getting better, though.</li>
            <li>It is much more manageable, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as if your hair looks like you&#x27;ve been walking in the snow. :)</li>
            <li>:) I haven&#x27;t had an issue with it getting into my eyes, either.</li>
            <li>If you have any issues with your skin, try looking into a more organic skincare routine.</li>
            <li>I love most Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this product is out there for me to use.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it,</li>
            <li>so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>No flyaways, no frizz, and it has more volume.</li>
            <li>I love most Dr. Bronner&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>The process of squeezing out the orange goop into a cup and swirling it about, then dumping it over your hair is... interesting.</li>
            <li>and so I have to use more products after I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li>but some people love it.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Smells lovely and makes my hair feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>and i feel this has healing effect :)</li>
            <li>My husband has a bit more oil to his scalp and hair and he doesn&#x27;t need the oil chaser.</li>
            <li>Although I like the brand and trying to use their shampoo as well (which isn&#x27;t going that well even though I diluted it as recommended by many people online)</li>
            <li>I love the Dr.</li>
            <li>but I still need a conditioning detangler to be able to comb my hair and style.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and i can be reasonably sure it&#x27;s healthy and not terrible for the ecosystem.</li>
            <li>and I love the combination of Dr Bronners soap and this conditioning rinse.</li>
            <li>and I love the scent that lingers.  </li>
            <li>with 1 tablespoon of castille soap and my hair looks even better than it did with this rinse, so I have this as a backup-</li>
            <li>I like the concentration and the smell of citrus in this conditioner, but it definitely does not do a great conditioning job unless you want to repeat the application for 3-4 times!</li>
            <li>terrrible conditioner and I have used apple cider vinegar for conditioner with better results</li>
            <li>/&gt;After reading many reviews I was determined to use Dr Bronners Magic soap (diluted) as a shampoo</li>
            <li>I had hoped that I could use this as a rinse after the magic soap as I had read</li>
            <li>However, I found that this conditioner coupled with a daily cleansing shampoo was the perfect match!</li>
            <li>anything more than that</li>
            <li>i like the dr bronner rinse better though as it uses lemon juice for the acid portion</li>
            <li>I love this product but it came to me damaged and leaking.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the directions and dilute the formula with water.  </li>
            <li>but it is for the better.</li>
            <li>My hair retains more of the scent of the castile liquid soap that I use.</li>
            <li>when I use these products together than when I was using my argan oil shampoo and conditioner (which made my hair more on the curly side).</li>
            <li>I recommend using warm water so that it&#x27;s more comfortable when pouring on your head.</li>
            <li>Worked much better than I</li>
            <li>I then save the rest for two more uses before repeating the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the soap smells wonderful, it doesn&#x27;t last on your hair</li>
            <li>Love the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap for cleaning</li>
            <li>The soap helps my curls look better.</li>
            <li>so many others warnings, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;Tang&amp;#34; or un-natural orange smell.</li>
            <li>love the way my wife&#x27;s hair feels after she uses this.</li>
            <li>I love that effect, too.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the citrusy smell.</li>
            <li>Tried it twice just to make sure and followed all instructions.  </li>
            <li>The smell is ok,</li>
            <li>This product is magical.</li>
            <li>I love Dr Bronner&#x27;s products, because I don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving unnatural chemicals in my body.</li>
            <li>(be sure to rinse well).</li>
            <li>(I suppose that&#x27;s the mushrooms) and that scent sticks to hair more than vinegar.  </li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hair so shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li>So i added more caps fulls</li>
            <li>This is so much better</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>If I use more then that it looks greasy by then end of the day.</li>
            <li>I think I might love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This is just so much better for me than using an apple cider vinegar rinse, which just made my hair thicker and gummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I absolutely love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap, so I was very excited to try this Conditioning rinse.</li>
            <li>Dilute 1 cap of Citrus Rinse with large cup of water (most successful for me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is important to use all the products according to the package instructions or your hair may not be exactly what you want it to be, but when it&#x27;s used properly-- great results.</li>
            <li>They work best for figuring whether a solution is generally acidic or alkaline, not the precise pH.  </li>
            <li>Always enjoyable supporting a good company too.</li>
            <li>It quickly went away and my hair has never been better!</li>
            <li>It quickly went away and my hair has never been better!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any bleaching at all, but I keep my conditioner in the light-sealed container and live in Michigan where the fall season is mostly overcast or rainy.    </li>
            <li>Also, my hair is quite fine and this, used in proper dilution, is perfect.  </li>
            <li>If you use the original Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soaps on your hair then this product is a MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li>It does burn my neck if I use it after shaving, I do wish I didn&#x27;t have to mix it with water, and the smell is on the strong side but those aren&#x27;t that important!</li>
            <li>the strong smell of the soap when showering :) ahhh...tea tree...peppermint...</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so easy I&#x27;m able to do it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so happy I&#x27;m going natural with my hair and am so grateful to have found Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>This completely solved that problem, and it smells great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I didn&#x27;t love this product at first.</li>
            <li>So happy to have switched to natural products.</li>
            <li>After shampooing with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castille soap, you really need a good conditioner to soften up the hair again.</li>
            <li>My hair feels much softer and smells so good.</li>
            <li>Hair adjusted well VERY quickly… and air drying hair was actually good.  </li>
            <li>untangles hair  fast just need to watch it doesn&#x27;t get into eyes as really good sting to it</li>
            <li>It was lumpy and seemed to not do much, but I felt like I needed to use it since I paid a good amount for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This makes it easy to mix and use.</li>
            <li>It does not leave your hair easy to comb.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to smell like that, so I rewashed &amp; used my Giovanni Avocado &amp; Olive Oil 2chic ultra-moist conditioner, which I LOVE, and works great with a tiny amount.  </li>
            <li>I never leave reviews, but this product is really easily misused, so</li>
            <li>It works great on the tips or dried hair but not so good for my scalp.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner really makes hair soft and silky, and it smells great!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say that this conditions very quickly, so I think that for people who are experiencing problems with it should try rinsing it out immediately after massaging it in.</li>
            <li>it seems to be too strong for my scalp and tingles or burns me a bit.  </li>
            <li>It smells strongly of citrus, and if you have any skin abrasions anywhere it is gonna STING.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is dryer and tends to tangle after a good wash, so I decided to try the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s conditioning rise.</li>
            <li>This acidic treatment is a lot like vinegar rinse without smelling as strong.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
            <li>It looks kind of brown and runny and at first I thought it might not work</li>
            <li>but the more I used it with the recommended dilutions and full strength, the nastier my hair felt.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read elsewhere online to rinse with really cool water to help seal the hair shaft for better smoothness.</li>
            <li>My hair is easy to comb through and smooth.</li>
            <li>Yes, it has a citrus content which is fine..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smell is also less then wonderful and don&#x27;t ever mix it with fingers if you&#x27;ve got a cut - ouch (citrus).</li>
            <li>I know that folks say that if you give your hair time to adjust it will be fine, but I&#x27;m a girl who loves my hair, so this was not an option for me.</li>
            <li>But it is fine and light in texture.  </li>
            <li>Let me begin by saying that I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s shampoos, which I&#x27;ve used for quite some time.</li>
            <li>have made the mistake of shaving before applying this and that is a HUGE mistake.</li>
            <li>and I can tell you pH test strips are not all that accurate.  </li>
            <li>I have really great hair when I use regular Dove shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>If people want their health back you MUST go organic and this Hair product works great for me.</li>
            <li>Once you put it in your hair and then wash it out, it smells fantastic, of orange and lemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>light conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the product - this is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased, and using it along with the Castile soap in place of shampoo and conditioner has completely changed my hair for the better.</li>
            <li>It makes it so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>&quot; ideology doesn&#x27;t do that, but I didn&#x27;t really want to pursue something that required *that* much trial and error (i.e. measurements of how much baking soda worked perfectly with your hair, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>important to rinse thoroughly --</li>
            <li>I like the smell and enjoy the feel of my hair after using it.  </li>
            <li>hair was so smooth and brushing</li>
            <li>I shampoo with the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint, then follow with a capful of this in about a cup of water, and my hair is silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It does help detangle and smooth my hair after using the Dr. Bronner soap.</li>
            <li>I bought this when I was trying to go chemical free and &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>you need to close the follicles in order to have smooth, manageable, shiny hair.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t know if this product will under go light oxidation, but it being in a opaque container makes me think it will because of the citrus ingredients being so acidic.</li>
            <li>If your product DOES undergo light oxidation, it may bleach your hair, which some people have reported when using this conditioner and being out in the sun (think like hydrogen peroxide).</li>
            <li>; I had to use oil on my hair afterwards to smooth it out</li>
            <li>This conditioning rinse will remove all the Castile soap and leave your hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Still, my hair feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s recommends using one of their hair cremes after using this conditioning rinse to smooth and detangle.</li>
            <li>Plus it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t smell it in the bottle, its weird, good news, once you mix it with water, it smell nice and does a great job.</li>
            <li>My scalp now feels light without the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>and then i reached the desired light silky results.</li>
            <li>It worked, all natural, good for the Environment and smells</li>
            <li>kind of nice actually.  </li>
            <li>Good old diluted acetic acid gets my hair softer, too.  </li>
            <li>And knowing that there are no harsh chemicals in it makes me feel good about buying and using this product.</li>
            <li>However, with the right mix, none of that happens and my hair turns out lovely.</li>
            <li>Other than that this is a great organic option :)</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very economical</li>
            <li>but it smells nice and left my hair very easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>Diluted vinegar works well, but this works better --  a little extra shine without oil, a wonderful smell, and nice shiny hair after combing.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t love this product, despite how much I try!  </li>
            <li>&quot; I was excited and ordered a bottle.</li>
            <li>and  I am excited to see what my hair will be like after using them for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>It feels even better the next day, and the best part, I only have to wash my hair every 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it made a rich lather in my hair and my hair felt like straw after getting out (even after using my argan oil conditioner)</li>
            <li>Originally used the soap on body too, but after not seeing a noticeable difference over my Dove bar, decided to save it for just the hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Though</li>
            <li>but there Shikakai seems to add a unique smell that not everyone will like.</li>
            <li>My hair is noticeably healthier, hydrated (dries in half the time!!), has wonderful body and shine</li>
            <li>It was nice because since I wasn&#x27;t using traditional shampoo and therefore couldn&#x27;t get most moisturizing treatments to rinse from my hair.</li>
            <li>Using Dr. B&#x27;s shampoo does make my hair feel silky, shiny and clean</li>
            <li>Use this with the bar soap to clean my hair.</li>
            <li>If you use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s baby mild soap to wash your hair, use either this or Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar as a rinse so your hair will be smooth and maneageable.  </li>
            <li>As if my hair and scalp being the happiest they&#x27;ve ever been wasn&#x27;t enough, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is pretty much the best body care company out there when it comes to transparency and responsibility in producing their products.</li>
            <li>This rinse is the best I&#x27;ve found for bringing out a lovely shine to my long hair--a shine that lasts several days.  </li>
            <li>Something very important to note, which I had to learn by trial and error: the amount of Citrus Rinse and how much you are diluting it matters.</li>
            <li>I, like many other reviewers, had a good experience with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This conditioner works amazing, I love it more than the shiseido hair care products I was previously using.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice anything special.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t judge the quality for others, but for my fine hair, it&#x27;s just not quite right.</li>
            <li>First, I washed my hair with 1:1 diluted Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint castile soap, which smells great AND lathers well (I also added some peppermint essential oil to the diluted soap for moisture).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation?</li>
            <li>I use a cap full in a measuring cup of water.</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t look frizzy and it looks good the next day too.     </li>
            <li>and it ends up soft, with volume, and with nice waves without frizz.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It really feels healthy afterward.</li>
            <li>I was unpleasantly surprised after the sweet-smelling rose castile soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also think it brings out my natural wave nicely</li>
            <li>has a warehouse full of the stuff, and they want to sell it to YOU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll say the conditioner was better than the shampoo, but it wasn&#x27;t really doing it for me</li>
            <li>Some people don&#x27;t really like the citrus smell either, but I find it refreshing.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s cool and rinse the product out.</li>
            <li>I use one cap full per use</li>
            <li>It worked good after a homemade deep conditioning treatment, though it didn&#x27;t rinse all the oil out.</li>
            <li>it does not have a basket full of chemicals and dyes.</li>
            <li>The directions say to use a cap full.</li>
            <li>It has a citrus smell, which is not bad and doesn&#x27;t linger once you&#x27;ve rinsed.</li>
            <li>So soft, so shiny (not greasy though), so healthy and strong...</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: This will make your hair lighter over time due to the citrus in the product.it&#x27;s used properly-- great results.</li>
            <li>Love my new rinse!</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s super duper concentrated), and the color/texture leaves something to be desired</li>
            <li>and I decided to try it for mild dandruff relief.</li>
            <li>Because I don&#x27;t have to use so much and paired with diluted Dr. Bronners soap, it is quite an economical and healthy way to treat your hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is left feeling soft with an incredible amount of body.</li>
            <li>this can be achieved with a mild acid rinse.</li>
            <li>I have found a conditioner from the Honest Company that actually works and is chemical free.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so much &#x27;Hair Gels&#x27; on it to keep it from becoming &#x27;unruly&#x27; that you&#x27;d think I owned the company.</li>
            <li>(Currently looking for better alternatives but this is a great back up</li>
            <li>good rinse to use after high pH natural shampoo</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really dissipate over time, so I would strongly suggest that you rinse with water as soon as you pour this on</li>
            <li>I have very fine and straight hair, so a capful is a bit too much for ME</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did tingle quite a bit when my scalp wasn&#x27;t healthy, and I find the smell slightly overwhelming (but not intolerable) --- certainly not like the other perfumed conditioners, but since it keeps my hair in great shape, I don&#x27;t think I will ever look for another product.</li>
            <li>First of all, I am the biggest fan of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products!  </li>
            <li>I have been smelling and touching my hair all day - it is just so soft!</li>
            <li>Yet, be extra cautious and dilute even more!</li>
            <li>Also, the citrus smell is almost overwhelming, but at least citrus is a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>The smell of citrus is strong at first (for about the first 15 minutes or so), but it goes away after her hair dries.</li>
            <li>It will also be super soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly and somewhat fine hair that tends to be frizzy without products.</li>
            <li>I have fine, medium length, and colored hair, and it disentangled my hair really well.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair and used this with J.R Liggett Bar Shampoo based on another reviewer, was a mistake.</li>
            <li>But the best way that I can describe it is that my hair felt stripped for the first two weeks due to the damage from old shampoos and the need for my hair to heal.</li>
            <li>But the best way that I can describe it is that my hair felt stripped for the first two weeks due to the damage from old shampoos and the need for my hair to heal.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner, smells like real lemons and my fine hair is left silky and tangle free</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had much body or shine, so when this rinse left my hair shiny and not flat, smelling good and reducing frizz, I was elated!!</li>
            <li>makes hair very manageble and smooth</li>
            <li>that is, where you use vinegar and baking soda to primarily wash your hair -- and doing some research on it, I really felt like it was something I could not commit to.</li>
            <li>It has helped my dyed hair color stay fresh</li>
            <li>; I won&#x27;t buy any more products containing toxic ingredients for me or my house, so switching to Bronner soaps was a natural. .</li>
            <li>, recommended is ONE CAP FULL to a warm CUP OF WATER (long hair</li>
            <li>My wife who sometimes straightens her hair didn&#x27;t think it was worth the work</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to use more natural products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad that I did it, though, because I really tried to give it a real chance</li>
            <li>I try to use more natural products on my body when I can.</li>
            <li>So far it seems to be okay.</li>
            <li>I love natural products, so when I found \\&quot;Dr.</li>
            <li>It contains citrus so any cuts or freshly shaven areas will burn like hell.</li>
            <li>and they couldn&#x27;t think of maybe lavender oil to put in it that is natural but more preferred than this horrid rotting citrus smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;some things to consider if you&#x27;re switching from shampoo/conditioner to a more natural hair care solution:&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;ll</li>
            <li>you can make your own by mixing apple cider vinegar (acid) and some essential oils of your choosing (scent) then diluting into a rinse (search for hair vinegar rinse</li>
            <li>It delivered and smells like fresh lemon.</li>
            <li>I began the natural lifestyle just recently and was moderately happy with the way the vinegar rinse was leaving my hair, but I wanted to try something else.  </li>
            <li>Through trial and error I found this conditioner and soap combo to work fantastically together, a must try if your looking for a more natural option.</li>
            <li>CASTILE SOAP AS SHAMPOO: I recently started using the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Rose Castile Liquid Soap (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083LU5LC) for my hair.</li>
            <li>Tried a full 3 weeks and used exactly to package specifications.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a huge difference in how smooth and soft her hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, as I no longer have a film from using castile and it makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>just stick with it, it is worth it.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but I feel like I need to for this one.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this conditioner, it has a strong citrus odor and left my hair smelling very much like citrus for hours.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it leaves my hair feeling smooth and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li>Legit fair trade, seriously organic, no one gets paid more than 5 times another</li>
            <li>The bar shampoo says it can be used without any other products, but good luck with that.</li>
            <li>It took my a while to figure out the right amount for my hair.</li>
            <li>There is a warning about this right on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>The lemon juice has even given my hair some pretty fantastic natural highlights, although it&#x27;s true that it can cause some stinging like they warn on the bottle.</li>
            <li>It is not really a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It is made of very healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li>I then put a cap full of this rinse into it and shake it gently.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint for a while, and i have noticed a huge difference in my fine, short hair.</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work, but it just did not with my fine straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I tried all different dilution ratios and came to the conclusion a little over a capful to one 16 oz water bottle of water is perfect.</li>
            <li>The solution itself isn&#x27;t pure liquid -- you have to dilute it!</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair soft and is easy to comb out.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling soft, conditioned, or easy to comb through.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is just worth mentioning that I did try to go without the hair creme and just use the bar soap and the citrus rinse, but my hair wasn&#x27;t as smooth and soft as before, but it did have the boost in volume.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is just worth mentioning that I did try to go without the hair creme and just use the bar soap and the citrus rinse, but my hair wasn&#x27;t as smooth and soft as before, but it did have the boost in volume.</li>
            <li>I will say that I feel like I went through this bottle rather quickly, but I also tend to use too much conditioner on my hair.</li>
            <li>Also, the conditioning rinse is deep orange in color, and may not be great for people with bleach blonde highlights.</li>
            <li>To me, this product has such a fresh citrusy scent, I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also does have a strong citrus scent and it does sting if you get it in your eyes or if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten my own lotion down to a science and love the way natural lotions make my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, simple, natural winner from Dr. Bronner!!!!!!</li>
            <li>hair is approaching mid-back-length, and a conditioner&#x27;s detangling ability is very important to me.</li>
            <li>But very much lemons and oranges.</li>
            <li>have nearly waist-length, wavy, fine hair that is prone to dryness.</li>
            <li>Reading somewhere that this product leaves fine &amp; soft hair after soap-shampooing,  I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>Works good though a little runnier than I hoped for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this combo for a month now and find my hair with more body than it ever had and it is easy to style (and with less products) than before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin, but some herbal/plant fragrances bother me, and I don&#x27;t want super chemical either.</li>
            <li>I am 21 and the older I get, the more into natural products I become.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge advocate for all natural, non-GMO products like this</li>
            <li>The first time I used this was with homemade shampoo (baking soda and water).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick with Free and Clear.</li>
            <li>The FDA has allowed so many harmful chemicals in our personal care products the only way to be safe is to check the ingredients of all your bath products.</li>
            <li>Need more actually...</li>
            <li>while my hair did come out nice and smooth, it dried really frizzy and puffy.thank</li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner really screwed up on this!  </li>
            <li>When I first got it, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like it</li>
            <li>That assures that any globs that are initially present are able to be fully resolved before you use it.</li>
            <li>This product was my first introduction to that brand.</li>
            <li>I have had to brush my hair more often, since it feels differently.</li>
            <li>- my hair has been in much better shape since going off of regular shampoos.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product and cannot say enough about it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>The first time I got it in my eyes and it burned like hell.  </li>
            <li>First thing that struck me was the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad that I didn&#x27;t have to actually go out anywhere today....</li>
            <li>I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castille soap, but this conditioning rinse was GROSS.</li>
            <li>but this keeps it light and soft.</li>
            <li>Dr Bronner&#x27;s service rep said that this has a pH level of 3… which, assumed, that if the water was alkaline, this pH would be a bit higher than a 3.  </li>
            <li>The first ingredient is lemon juice</li>
            <li>And speaking of how it go tangled in the first place is about another product to review.</li>
            <li>I found this for the first time at a yard sale and searched my town for a store that carried it.  </li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling soft, smooth, and without the tangles that a Castile &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; or baking soda and water can leave.  </li>
            <li>At first, I used it with 2 capfuls with one application of soap.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>i do not recommend this as a detangler, but I felt my hair had been conditioned and my hair was silky even after the first use, as they claim it would be.</li>
            <li>I suspect my hair actually smells a bit more like some oil (for all my desi folks out there, kinda like Ayurvedic medicine).</li>
            <li>First world problems, I know,</li>
            <li>One way I&#x27;ve been able to make the product last longer is to put the diluted version in a spray bottle and spray it on my scalp and hair and massage everything in.  </li>
            <li>My scalp is pretty damaged, so it did sting a bit, but I&#x27;m used to that from the ACV.</li>
            <li>Overall its ok, I&#x27;ll use this bottle</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance, but didn&#x27;t know when I bought it that it would have to be mixed.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine, long, wavy, and often frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>Right now, might be using too much shampoo, because hair becomes parched if I don&#x27;t use the leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;-Price.</li>
            <li>I was all set to give up and go back to regular conditioner when I accidentally used a much more diluted mix (I forgot how much I had added) and the results were SO MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li>It is ALL NATURAL and Environment Friendly.  </li>
            <li>The conditioning rinse immediately left my hair feeling super soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li>You know that salon clean feel your hair has after a professional shampoo?  </li>
            <li>it is supposed to be on, my hair did not feel clean or soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also started to use a more natural skincare line called Zum, which is by a company in Kansas City (called Indigo Wild).</li>
            <li>Usually Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are pretty good</li>
            <li>When my hair dried it had a nice golden shine to is as it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel good - and you need very little of it to do the job.</li>
            <li>My thinking is that the positive reviews are all compensated endorsers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started to use one cap full and have diluted it with more water than I did the first few washes.</li>
            <li>this pretty much removes all the pigment you just put in.</li>
            <li>I started using Bronner&#x27;s liquid Peppermint soap (diluted 1:1) as shampoo a few months ago and am very pleased with the way it cleans my hair.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this shampoo I used WAY too much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a dark brown, mucky substance (honestly, looks just like soupy poop) that smells like sulphur.</li>
            <li>mix approximately a full cap with ~16 oz of water (in an old water bottle), kept at hand in the shower</li>
            <li>(amazing considering that most CEOs nowadays make hundreds times what their factory floor workers do), employees get 100% free healthcare, and they give like a third of their profits back to charity (beyond their free trade projects, which, among other things, support peaceful Palestinian/Israeli coexistence and medical equipment for hospitals in Sri Lanka).</li>
            <li>it was so easy, and I noticed a definite increase in shine.</li>
            <li>I got concerned when I started seeing bold spots at the front and my follicles where clearly inflamed.</li>
            <li>It has certainly become my preferred method of hair washing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was used as conditioner/ rinse for HOMEMADE SHAMPOO (1.5cups Organic Pure Virgin Coconut Milk + 1.75cups Aloe Gel) with an assumed pH level of between 4 and 6.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been fortunate that at the age of 73 years (young) that I still have a full head of hair, it&#x27;s still Red except for the temples</li>
            <li>particularly when you are first starting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I know some have had success with a pure Apple Cider Vinegar rinse with essential oils, but I&#x27;m pretty happy with trying this product first to get my hair transitioned properly -- I may try a homemade rinse down the line.</li>
            <li>counter acts the sticky grittiness that pure castille soap can leave on your hair (no matter HOW much you dilute it).</li>
            <li>It works well enough for my fine straight hair, but didn&#x27;t do any miracles.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean, smooth and detangled without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, you have to get a large cup full of water, then add two or one caps full of the conditioner and swirl it around, then you can dunk your already wet hair into the cup and shift it around, til you think the solution has reached all of the hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for people with oily or fine hair that usual creamy conditioners weigh down.</li>
            <li>Yes, most of the negative reviews are accurate.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference since using it, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2ish weeks.</li>
            <li>but the amazing highlights that emerged  while using it and spending time at the beach brought back memories from my teen years with a bottle of Sun-In hair spray lightener.</li>
            <li>I used just a tiny drop, but it really did make a huge difference in the smoothness and softness of my hair.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a HUGE difference in the softness, but it was noticeable enough that I&#x27;d keep buying the hair creme.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a HUGE difference in the softness, but it was noticeable enough that I&#x27;d keep buying the hair creme.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use any of these products on my hair and it makes me really upset.</li>
            <li>I really like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps - and I wanted to like this conditioner.</li>
            <li>It makes my whole scalp tingle, they even warn you of this.</li>
            <li>The rinse really makes a difference once you wash with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Majic Peppermint Hemp Oil soap.  </li>
            <li>and it does not get greasy so fast.</li>
            <li>Yes, absolutely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, if you really want to pursue an organic haircare routine, just be mindful of the fact that there is a transition.</li>
            <li>I personally really like how it&#x27;s going, but it&#x27;s not for everyone.</li>
            <li>With this Dr. Bronners stuff, you can&#x27;t really leave a bit in, or add a bit as a leave-in.  </li>
            <li>This product is not totally hassle free - you have to dilute a cap-full of the product in a cup of water</li>
            <li>One capful in a cup of water is really all</li>
            <li>But, It works really well.</li>
            <li>A pain, because I&#x27;d have much preferred a ready-to-use conditioner, but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>If so, the listing should indicate as much ...</li>
            <li>Ocasionally I miss the truly soft feeling of real conditioner, but then I remember trying to keep my hair in a bun without it slipping out, and I&#x27;m back to being happy with this hair rinse.</li>
            <li>Works so well to condition hair after shampooing with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap, really helps get rid of that glycerin soap feeling.</li>
            <li>smell is very citrusy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how to really explain this</li>
            <li>It also really didn&#x27;t serve its purpose.</li>
            <li>conditioners that do provide a detangling effect do so by coating the strands of your hair so that they&#x27;re slippery and don&#x27;t stick together; that&#x27;s what allows you to get a comb or a brush through it with any reasonable amount of effort.</li>
            <li>I really like it</li>
            <li>I tried the whole</li>
            <li>It did wonders for my combination skin scalp and my hair didn&#x27;t get greasy as fast as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much so this bottle lasts quite some time.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see any difference in the volume of my hair though&lt;</li>
            <li>/&gt;(as a closing note, the smell doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair too much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going to be straight with you, it&#x27;s brown goop</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll look at it and wonder if you should really put it on your hair.</li>
            <li>I really like the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Citrus Hair Conditioning Rinse in pairing with the castile liquid soap.</li>
            <li>My hair is light to medium ash in color, wavy in texture, medium in thickness, and sits just above my shoulders in length.</li>
            <li>There won&#x27;t be much of a lather.</li>
            <li>but still very wavy)</li>
            <li>and my hair is growing much faster.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe some of you over moisturize and that&#x27;s why this is too much.</li>
            <li>Very.</li>
            <li>careful not to add more to water than is suggested..</li>
            <li>Environmentally, socially, financially responsible through and through.</li>
            <li>Do you know how much time that saves me in the morning?</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.  </li>
            <li>It really tangled my hair</li>
            <li>I really wanted it to work for me, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really concentrated.  </li>
            <li>She&#x27;s pleased with this product, so we plan to repurchase it before the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li>It smells very vinegary.</li>
            <li>The real trick to making this work (for me anyway) was not to rinse too much of it out after soaking.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying to use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap for my hair since I have scalp psoriasis and shampoo seems to really trigger it, but the soap alone made my hair greasy and not presentable...</li>
            <li>Diluting it seems like a lot of work, and if you dilute it as much as the instructions say it just sorta</li>
            <li>It takes too much time in the shower.</li>
            <li>Very inconvient when in the shower.</li>
            <li>I usually really like Dr.</li>
            <li>That treatment leaves my hair gorgeous, shiny and thick without being fuzzy, and strangers compliment me for it.</li>
            <li>And although I have a lot of hair, my biggest problem is flat hair because it is so fine.</li>
            <li>I find it to be a pleasant natural citrus smell and not overwhelming at all.  </li>
            <li>Now I dilute my rinse a little more than directed, about one cap full for about 1.5-2 cups of water (I use my old conditioner bottle and it works well for shaking it up).</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length slightly wavy, very fine hair-- and a lot of it.</li>
            <li>B00120VWJ0 Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Castile Soaps]] and wanted to try other elements of the Bronner&#x27;s line.  </li>
            <li>I love Dr Bronners other products</li>
            <li>but I am going to keep looking for other plant safe products....</li>
            <li>I have medium to long fine hair that loves to tangle</li>
            <li>/&gt;-washing with soap will clean your hair well but leave the follicles open and hair feeling tangly.</li>
            <li>I should say that I have fine and color treated long hair.  </li>
            <li>I looked at this bottle and thought &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; - as soon as I put it on my hair, it *instantly* felt clean and cleaner than it had in weeks.</li>
            <li>I just bought the Dr. Bronners&#x27;s hair creme, also  pretty good but not a strong enough hold for me.  </li>
            <li>The important thing is that after I use this conditioner and let my hair air dry, I have large separate curls.</li>
            <li>I do wish they had other options for the conditioning rinse like they do for their castile soap,but so far I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this.</li>

            <li>It left my hair feeling clumpy and full of build-up.</li>
            <li>You have to get over what the mainstream companies have brainwashed us into thinking what a conditioner has to be (white, creamy, full chemicals and synthetic fragrance) to use this, you have to think about what you&#x27;re looking for - a product that works and works well.  </li>
            <li>I put one cap-full into a small spray bottle and mix with warm water to dissolve the particles in the rinse.  </li>
            <li>Some people also don&#x27;t like that you have to dilute the product, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all: I fill up my old conditioner bottle (holds about 1.5-2C) with water, pour in a cap full of the conditioner, shake it up and pour it on my hair - pretty simple.</li>
            <li>I really love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s but this product was average for me.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel as clean or soft as I generally like.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the smell too much, although it was strong and not exactly a girly smell.</li>
            <li>She thought I found some miracle style agent, but really all it has been was my new shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br</li>
            <li>She thought I found some miracle style agent, but really all it has been was my new shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used it 3 times to untangle my hair (which is caused because of the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s sshampoo) and almost used more than half the bottle on my hair</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, smooth, feels thicker and it typically looks and feels even better the next day.. and the day after that.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, smooth, feels thicker and it typically looks and feels even better the next day.. and the day after that.</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s baby mild soap mixed with coconut milk.</li>
            <li>This conditioner looks super gross in the bottle.</li>
            <li>I went with baby mild soap instead, and just bought a different conditioner.</li>
            <li>It also burns the skin and causes real irritation if you have the very sensitive type, but the caution is indicated on the bottle.</li>
            <li>It was kind of dry at first, but I know other people who ended up being oily.</li>
            <li>It was kind of dry at first, but I know other people who ended up being oily.</li>
            <li>is not there any longer, actually there is a kind of a &#x27;sweet, fruity&#x27; smell (it&#x27;s hard to smell my hair, so this seems to be the smell</li>
            <li>and it was better, but my hair was a knotted tangled mess.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s common sense, really, it&#x27;s mostly concentrated acid!  </li>
            <li>My son tried it, he has curly full hair, it made his flat and greasy.  </li>
            <li>Many of these chemicals have been banned from food, but in the FDA&#x27;s infinite stupidity they let you put them on your body where they are absorbed through your skin!!!      </li>
            <li>would HIGHLY recommend not using this AFTER you shave.</li>
            <li>I had high expectations for this because of it being a Dr Bronner product.</li>
            <li>product is HIGHLY concentrated.</li>
            <li>The lemon content is high so avoid the eyes (ouch)</li>
            <li>, it is a little overwhelming when it is concentrated in the bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to describe, but you can kind of tell when you&#x27;re &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; pouring based on the feel of your hair.</li>
            <li>I love all of Dr Bonner&#x27;s stuff, but this conditioner is very heavy and sticky for thin, fine hair, even when diluted more than the instructions state.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this stuff to complete my regimen</li>
            <li>Despite all that,  it leaves my hair so soft, and the curls are really pronounced.  </li>
            <li>The result is soft hair that doesn&#x27;t smell, and is much easier to style than it was in my conditioner days.</li>
            <li>Okay, maybe it won&#x27;t cure the common cold, but it&#x27;s a great hair rinse!!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair Very Shiny and Soft.</li>
            <li>so I really wanted something natural for moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It made my hair really shiny and soft, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>This product, 2 cap fulls in a full cup of water works like a charm (for me), not only does it give my hair a natural &#x27;sheen&#x27; but it become manageable</li>
            <li>At first I was using regular conditioner after the soap, and while it worked, I figured I would try the whole shebang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have searched for some alternatives to &#x27;normal&#x27; shampoos and ended up using a bar soap from the farmers market.</li>
            <li>: good, but not great.</li>
            <li>This conditioner works extremely well on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to wear black shirts again because my dandruff is all gone!</li>
            <li>I tried using more than the recommended two cap-fulls, which did nothing, and it still left my hair so dry that it crinkled.</li>
            <li>It is wayyy less frizzy and still has nice body and actually looks thicker.  </li>
            <li>I rated right in the middle for this conditioning rinse...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to get the right consistency to use this properly</li>
            <li>The smell is definitely overpowering right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I think I was expecting something a little more natural smelling.</li>
            <li>hair felt really good after I worked it in and let it sit for a few minutes, and it dried pretty well</li>
            <li>It does take your hair a few weeks to a couple months to adjust to the new hair cleansing routine if you&#x27;re switching from harsher shampoos to something more natural.</li>
            <li>I easily combed through my knots after using the rinse with less hair getting caught in my comb.  </li>
            <li>I normally love earthy smells, so I was surprised at how much I disliked it.  </li>
            <li>Going with natural products it will always have a different feel and will take time to get use to but its worth it.</li>
            <li>my hair seems thicker, shinier, has more volume, even has a little wave!</li>
            <li>I was very surprised.</li>
            <li>this conditioner leaves my hair very soft, but anybody who tells you it&#x27;s any help in detangling hair</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make your hair very soft.</li>
            <li>(It did not have a chemically smell to it either, very natural smelling)</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin; but the tingle left right after rinsing it off.</li>
            <li>That mixture will usually last me three or four showers (I have super short hair, so longer hair may need the entire bottle&#x27;s worth for one use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a slick feel.</li>
            <li>I personally thing traditional and more simple ways to wash your hair</li>
            <li>stuff does work pretty well as a conditioner, so it meets that objective.</li>
            <li>Would recommend 100% for natural no poo convenient hair care!</li>
            <li>many stating that it could take weeks to get the &amp;#34;greasiness&amp;#34; on the hair out during the &amp;#34;transition period.&amp;#34;  Since I was not interested in ACV, I opted for this as the rinse - similar pH.  </li>
            <li>and WOW!</li>
            <li>This makes my hair so soft and shiny (and NOT FRIZZY, hallelujah!).</li>
            <li>The first time I used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Citrus Orange Conditioning Rinse i had just gotten done setting up the Christmas tree, so i had tiny scratches all over my hands and arms.</li>
            <li>, I feel like the lemon juice and orange essential oils clean my hair enough.  </li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair with very little body and an extremely sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>At first, I rinsed out the conditioner completely, and it left my hair feeling tangled again.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t bother me now, but it may deter some people if you&#x27;re used to your conditioners smelling like sweet apples, strawberries, other fruity things or perfumes.</li>
            <li>It may work better for hair that is less coarse, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li>It is only slightly a citrus scent, but mostly a barfy scent.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s actually somewhat effective at detangling my (short) hair and making it feel less stripped of oils after using the Castile</li>
            <li>Not only that, but even after your hair is dry it leaves a light natural citrus scent without</li>
            <li>My hair is on the dry side, so after that, I do a quick spray and comb from a spray bottle with a little jojoba and sweet almond oils diluted in water.</li>
            <li>I have very straight long hair that needs to be washed every two days.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It did take a few tries to get the right mix of conditioning rinse and water, and if it&#x27;s too strong, it stings my scalp, eyes and nose.</li>
            <li>But I could still do with a little more volume &amp; moisture, especially in the Winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;After use, I found that this product felt heavier than other conditioners and I was concerned, but in a few hours, once the hair was dry, I could see smooth wavy hair with a healthy natural shine.</li>
            <li>My curly hair is amazingly soft, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and has a lot of body.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a Natural smell and after rinsing it off the smell</li>
            <li>I do use a natural shampoo about once a week and then follow with the conditioning rinse.</li>
            <li>and even if you get it near your eyes, because of the smell it may still burn.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get my Pantene conditioner on fast enough.</li>
            <li>The shikakai powder in it is a natural detangler I have</li>
            <li>I also like that they have natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>If you want to have completely unmanageable hair, this &#x27;conditioner&#x27; is for you.</li>
            <li>I have noticed an improvement and, with time, I think it will completely go away and be smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it rinsed fast enough.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I almost gave up on Dr. Bronner&#x27;s shampoo even though we like the natural aspect of it.</li>
            <li>And did I mention how SOFT it is??</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it rinsed fast enough.  </li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>Immediately, my hair felt soft, and it also smells</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m using an old shampoo bottle</li>
            <li>and she woke up with baby soft, tangle-free</li>
            <li>a disclaimer along the lines of &amp;#34;for professional use only&amp;#34; would be helpful.</li>
            <li>Bronner&#x27;s Castille soap and using it as a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>So I mixed some up and put in a spray bottle, much easier to use.</li>
            <li>perhaps because it&#x27;s naturally detangles in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I starting using the hair rinse and my hair was so much easier to comb through and didn&#x27;t look greasy anymore.  </li>
            <li>This conditioning rinse does leave my hair very manageable, following the&lt;br /&gt;Dr.</li>
            <li>Taking into consideration that my hair is the soft silky type.</li>
            <li>so I was really surprised at this one.</li>
            <li>(w/ Dr Bronners and my old conditioner), then dumped this stuff out in the sink.</li>
            <li>Naturally, that stripped my hair of all its nutrients and turned into another problem.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use that much of the conditioner, it will last me forever.  </li>
            <li>(i use an old quart-size wonton soup container, washed thoroughly of course, that i marked at 1 cup) in the shower to dilute the conditioning rinse then pour through your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it has a really wierd smell and does not work as well as I thought it would, maybe I am not using enough</li>
            <li>will, but once your hair dries, it is really soft.  </li>
            <li>If you use it directly on your hair it seems to not rinse out well and will leave your hair oily.</li>
            <li>Someone suggested that that person may have received and old bottle</li>
            <li>hair silky soft (even after shampooing w/ Dr. B&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;Cured</li>
            <li>I use this after shampooing with my Wild Naturals shampoo.</li>
            <li>appreciate that it all natural.</li>
            <li>I completely gave up soap shampoos then.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t rinse this stuff out completely.</li>
            <li>It does not make my hair oily though, just soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, naturally shiny, and it&#x27;s never oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>have to dilute both the soap and the conditioner with water, which really makes each bottle last.</li>
            <li>I could style it, and it is soft and has a lot of body.</li>
            <li>I ended up pre-diluting it in an old bottle</li>
            <li>They basically told me to go directly to the manufacture of the product.</li>
            <li>Does it look absolutely fresh on the second and third day?</li>
            <li>This was effective at conditioning without leaving anything behind.</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s diluted and goes on it leaves behind a nice citrus smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So I just recently bought this product, and I feel like I had a very different experience than most other reviewers.</li>
            <li>I literally could have given myself a Mohawk with no other styling products, that&#x27;s how much build-up it left.</li>
            <li>The trouble was my hair had significant residue or oil or</li>
            <li>I stopped using it when I had to stop using the soap on my hair, as my scalp dried out significantly.</li>
            <li>I have gone back to conventional washing, though, but feel free to ask any questions if you have any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps add some silkiness to my hair and always washes clean, not leaving my hair heavy with residue.</li>
            <li>: love the company and the results, not such a big fan of the price or the slight oily smell--but that&#x27;s what you get for all-natural.</li>
            <li>So, I would recommend if you are only interested in the final product.</li>
            <li>all came at different times (only days apart), but I got to try the Lavender and Coconut hair creme first with my homemade products.</li>
            <li>I was extremely frustrated because I was using apple cider vinegar as a rinse (as recommended by so many people doing no-poo) without any real success and</li>
            <li>If I put my hair up at night in bed and take it down in the morning, there&#x27;s actually not such a huge \\&quot;crimp\\&quot; in my hair from wearing it up.</li>
            <li>have Very fine, untreated, straight (except two weird curls by my ears), bodyless, mid-back length hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather use the acv-rinse, which is cheaper and actually makes my hair soft!!</li>
            <li>something vaguely like pine sap, which is pleasant enough on cut wood, but not quite how I&#x27;d like my hair to smell.</li>
            <li>:) Overall, I&#x27;m so glad I wasn&#x27;t dismayed by the bad reviews of this product and tried it out myself.</li>
            <li>and I was never able to freely comb my hair without snarls after using the Citrus Rinse.</li>
            <li>Had to wash and rewash my hair 3 times and it still wasn&#x27;t back to normal.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very fine &amp; thin.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and wasn&#x27;t particularly hard to rinse out.</li>
            <li>If you use too much of the castile soap as shampoo, it will dry out your hair.</li>
            <li>I heard some mixed reviews about this product, but I was still curious about it because I wanted a more or less natural conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have been searching and searching, looking for an all natural way to shampoo and condition my hair that will not dry it out and will not cost a fortune.</li>
            <li>It adds extra moisture to your hair but isn&#x27;t too heavy if concentrated at the ends and lightly all over.</li>
            <li>shampoo and conditioner strip your hair of its natural oils then replace it with heavy conditioners that coat the hair follicle which then needs to be removed by powerful detergents in the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have thick hair, some of it coarse, and the no-poo method has been challenging.</li>
            <li>However, the rinse is dark brown--not very appetizing--and it is also supposed to be mixed with water to a certain consistency.</li>
            <li>It is gloppy and some of it doesn&#x27;t get totally dissolved but it does leave my hair manageable and very very soft.</li>
            <li>I am Red Headed and according to my School Teacher who was checking hair thickness from Blondes to Brunettes and of course the Brunettes were much thicker but since I was there and have Red Hair he was curious to find out if Red Hair is the same as Blonde Hair (fine).  </li>
            <li>Well, first things first, I don&#x27;t like having to mix the rinse with water every time I need to condition...call me lazy!</li>
            <li>but that was a major &amp;#34;FAIL&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I have very limp hair on top, then frizzy and dry throughout.</li>
            <li>Every morning I use an undiluted nickle to quarter-sized dollop of this conditioner, rub it evenly into my soaking wet hair (using a circular motion with medium pressure), rinse until it feels like it&#x27;s pretty much all out (while doing the same massaging motion), finger comb my hair and air dry.</li>
            <li>highly recommend trying to wash your hair with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap as well, as long as you condition too.</li>
            <li>GENERAL:</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t last too long after rinsing out the conditioner anyway if you really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>He was surprised to find that (my) Red Hair was even thicker than Brunettes.  </li>
            <li>the Dr Bronners shampoo - I use JR Ligget&#x27;s bar shampoo (it&#x27;s all natural, oils only)</li>
            <li>, I have been using it on my squirmy two year old who gets the biggest snarls in the back of her hair, since I wash it at night before she goes to bed.  </li>
            <li>It instantly made my hair soft, yet not too greasy.</li>
            <li>My water was about a 9 and adding the ratio (as per instructions) barely brought up the level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft and sleek, and on day two, my hair isn&#x27;t oily at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on products to help increase volume, but I really hadn&#x27;t found anything that worked all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wish that Dr. Bronner&#x27;s would put a bit of info about the hair rinse on the labels of the castile soaps so that people know that there is a second step for getting soft hair after using the castile.</li>
            <li>I will say this though every person(s) measurements may be different when you dilute the conditioner with water, I use my old conditioner bottle, and mix 6-7 cap fulls in about 16oz of bottled water.</li>
            <li>so I can squeeze out a thin stream and that is working much better than a cup.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of difficult to use in the shower-</li>
            <li>It was okay, but not great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, this shikakai stuff is not really great (for me), but I do *love*</li>
            <li>I dilute this approximately 1/2 capful per 1 cup water and use it three days a week in conjunction with JR Liggett&#x27;s Jojoba &amp; Peppermint Bar Shampoo and love it.</li>
            <li>I liked the smell, but the product inside the bottle was a little strange since it was a little thicker than I had thought.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-it&#x27;s odd at first keeping a cup</li>
            <li>second bottle has the exact same ingredients, but Dr. Bronner&#x27;s has clearly listened to the complaints about the dark lumps.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Towards the end of the first bottle, I hadn&#x27;t used it for several months, and for about 5 weeks I had been doing the no-poo method (not using conventional shampoo).</li>
            <li>So if you want an eco-friendly product that makes your hair very soft, shiny manageable to use with your castile soap (or other natural shampoo)</li>
            <li>put the diluted soap and the diluted rinse in empty dishwashing liquid bottles; this allows me to use only as much as I need where I need it.  </li>
            <li>Not going to lie, the first time I used it I was a little frightened - the smell is overpowering (</li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Citrus Hair Conditioning Rinse, on the other hand, makes the strands of hair stick to one another, which is the exact opposite of a detangling effect, and it&#x27;s a time-consuming nightmare to get such hair combed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted a nice-smelling conditioner that wasn&#x27;t likely to cause an allergic reaction, and I really like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li>The citrus fades but the BO smell hangs on long after your shower is complete.  </li>
            <li>I got used to the smell after the 1st few uses, but that first whiff was vomitous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never used a product that I unfortunately disliked as much!</li>
            <li>but... I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
            <li>And they want you to dilute a capful into a cup of cool water before slowly pouring your hair.</li>
            <li>The last straw, and the reason I&#x27;ve dumped what was left in the bottle down the drain, was that after three days of using it EXACTLY according to the directions, it didn&#x27;t diminished my after-shower tangle problem at all.</li>
            <li>I have long blonde hair and it is very fine and thin.  </li>
            <li>(I have long, thick, fine hair)</li>
            <li>The comments are very helpful if you do want to go down that route.</li>
            <li>So it takes a little more effort than your usual store bought conditioner that you can just squeeze from a bottle.</li>
            <li>You use far less and there is no waste!  </li>
            <li>ACV was making my hair dry, this leaves it silky and soft.</li>
            <li>When I used less conditioner my hair was still VERY tangled and stuck.</li>
            <li>I usually pump a tiny bit of conditioner into my palm and work into my hair right before I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I love the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap series, but soap scum discouraged me from soap-shampooing with hard water at where I live .  </li>
            <li>My hair actually feels dry while it is in, but once I rinse it out and get out of the shower, my hair will end up looking and feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Caution: This product will burn you eyes, so keep your head looking down and apply it to the top of the head and comb it through (long hair) or rub it through for a few seconds until (my routine) then rinse off, including face, viola!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be aware that the switch did make my hair feel different in a very odd way.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be aware that the switch did make my hair feel different in a very odd way.</li>
            <li>and I have fine, thin shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>I even tried super diluting the magic soap and dumping a whole bottle on vinegar on my head, still came out nasty.</li>
            <li>For fear of drying my hair out again, I was using too little of the shampoo and letting the rinse sit on my hair, which made my hair really greasy.</li>
            <li>I definitely wouldn&#x27;t use it on kids as it really hurts if you get it in your eyes or if you have any little cuts on your body.</li>
            <li>my own a shampoo to make my thin, curly hair a little thicker.</li>
            <li>I usually just let my hair dry overnight while I&#x27;m sleeping because I like the natural wavy look of my hair,but  I&#x27;m sure the curlier nature of my hair would come back if I dried it with a diffuser or scrunched it and let it air dry.</li>
            <li>I have thin blonde hair that gets greasy and flat very quickly</li>
            <li>This left my hair actually feeling clean without feeling dry and dull.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t bad, but it isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li>My hair felt greasy and did not look good at all.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, bad smell, burnt scalp, greasy hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long straight dark hair.  </li>
            <li>On top of the way this product left my hair, it&#x27;s extremely awkward to use as far as the diluting in the shower process goes.</li>

            <li> This is a great product, but it did not work for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Use it to this day, great product.</li>
            <li> It even smells great, diluted that is</li>
            <li> All in all, great product ---</li>
            <li> I have happy silky hair and scalp that does not itch or flake.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be happy you did.</li>
            <li> It smells great and has done wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> I believe if I had also bought the hair creme and tried that, it would have been a great combination.</li>
            <li> Smells great</li>
            <li> But this is great for co-washing.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be great.  </li>
            <li> I use just this and Dr Bronners soap and it leaves my hair looking great.</li>
            <li> What a great product.  </li>
            <li> The product is great and works well, it just doesn&#x27;t work the way I want on my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> I love this conditioning rinse!!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so happy to have found a combination of products that I can feel good about putting into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Paired up with this product (I could use Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar, but eh -- I want to support someone&#x27;s honest income at Dr. Bronner&#x27;s!)</li>
            <li> It also has a pleasant, but not over powering smell.</li>
            <li> Best certified organic conditioner I&#x27;ve found, and easy on the wallet.</li>
            <li> It smells great after it dries and leaves it light and breezy, ideal for humid climates.</li>
            <li> Feels good.</li>
            <li> Good buy..</li>
            <li> Smells good.</li>
            <li> stuff leaves my hair looking and feeling good.</li>
            <li> the good.</li>
            <li> smells so good</li>
            <li> To be fair, the labeling on the bottle does warn of this side effect.</li>
            <li> wise it would look oily.  </li>
            <li> -- it doesn&#x27;t look great and it doesn&#x27;t smell great; but wow is it great for your hair!  </li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve started using diluted Dr. Bronners Baby Mild Castile Soap as shampoo and this conditioner is the perfect match.</li>
            <li> came quickly, i use this to make fabric softener, it smells wonderful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it is almost as good as the vinegar but smells heck of a lot better!  </li>
            <li> I now have beautiful wavy golden hair again!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE that they can proudly show the USDA organic symbol on the front of their packaging.</li>
            <li> The smell ain&#x27;t that great either, though better than poop.  </li>
            <li> Smells great to me, spot on if you love lemon scents.</li>
            <li> The Dr. Bronner&#x27;s hair creme is also very lovely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lovely scent, great conditioning performance, and product lasts longer than you might think---</li>
            <li> , it kind of reminded me of orange candy, but not in a good way.  </li>
            <li> I could see how it might not be best for all hair textures, but for fine hair, it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I decided to give this stuff a try, along with the lavender leave in, and so glad I did!</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this product!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m SO glad that I did!  </li>
            <li> What I also realized yesterday was interesting; when I poured lots of it to my hair and my hand it kind of burned my finger!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> And I am SO glad I did!  </li>
            <li> citrus IS better than vinegar, though, so it&#x27;s one-up on what I WAS doing!</li>
            <li> Just be sure to rinse well!)</li>
            <li> first thing you&#x27;ll notice is that it smells like wonderful citrus.</li>
            <li> P)&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair!</li>
            <li> I just love the smell of this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> I will keep buying this product love it!</li>
            <li> , it combed easily and looked great.  </li>
            <li> The brand is great, they use great natural ingredients that make me feel good about what I&#x27;m buying.</li>
            <li> The combination of these two products is AMAZING.  </li>
            <li> I now use just an apple cider vinegar rinse and my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li> My hair feels that amazing for days after.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I would like to add that I also ordered a bottle of Dr. \\&quot;Bronner&#x27;s Liquid Soap\\&quot; and its amazing.</li>
            <li> It looks like feces, but it smells absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap and this citrus orange conditioner for about a year now, and my hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not heavenly amazing like some claim, but its not compost trash smelling either like</li>
            <li> I liked the way it smelled.</li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t feel good either :-)</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair smelling spectacular.</li>
            <li> They work really well for me, and  they smell wonderful.</li>
            <li> so when a friend read that it needed to be dilluted, that KIND of made sense, but it said 1-2 caps to 1 cup of water...</li>
            <li> I use Dr Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap as shampoo and hand soap, and I liked the conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> I learned that I do prefer organic products in the bath and, because of this experiment, I&#x27;ve started to make my own laundry soap with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and my own body wash with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to stay away from the harmful chemicals that most hair products have and this product is as good as any to help me with my mission.  </li>
            <li> I bought the lavender kind and heard that using coconut oil as conditioner afterwards would work.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t even think my hair needs to transition to using the soap and this rinse as a follow up.</li>
            <li> (so it smells better) and contains a bunch of oils that are good for your hair.</li>
            <li> Also, not a fan of having to dilute the rinse on my own before use.</li>
            <li> My hair looks good... way better than vinegar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using diluted apple cider vinegar as a hair rinse, and although I really liked the result, I didn&#x27;t like the smell.  </li>
            <li> Let it sit in your hair for your whole shower and you&#x27;ve got great feeling, manageable hair with no chemicals!</li>
            <li> ketchup/condiment squirt bottle and fill up the rest of the bottle with warm water.  </li>
            <li> the fragrance is really nice though.</li>
            <li> I used this with Doctor zbronner&#x27;s Hemp Rose soap.</li>
            <li> It works well, although the mixing is kind of a pain.</li>
            <li> While I enjoy the results of the apple cider vinegar rinse better, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Shikakai hair rinse is a great alternative.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to pour out of bottle, I use a plastic squeeze bottle with a spout and I use one capful and fill the rest with water.</li>
            <li> The smell of this is very very strong.</li>
            <li> I do admit it is very strong when using it in the shower</li>
            <li> Very strong scent.</li>
            <li> The citrus, smell is very strong, but it does mellow out once you start massaging it</li>
            <li> It smells very strong and made my scalp burn even though it gets diluted in water before you apply it.</li>
            <li> It also has a very strong smell and it made me cough as soon as I smelled it.</li>
            <li> Make sure you dilute this stuff--it&#x27;s potent!</li>
            <li> I have wavy, dry hair, and this manages to keep it healthy, looking great, and feeling awesome.</li>
            <li> love this product, it&#x27;s awesome, and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Dr Bronners products are all natural and this hair conditioner is excellent.  </li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING fact for me -- I always thought I&#x27;d never be able to do that.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps this is a salon item, something best used in an environment where a professional operator has mixing utensils close at hand, as well as timers and a sink into which the client&#x27;s head can be reclined.</li>
            <li> I take a recycled water bottle (16 oz) and fill it almost to the top with warm water.</li>
            <li> This makes my hair look naturally shiny and very beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have very fine chin length hair.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> A very effective and economical combination for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This also smells very orangy and good!  </li>
            <li> That said, it has worked really great for me, so I don&#x27;t mind those things very much.</li>
            <li> This is not a product for fine hair!  </li>
            <li> I will work a brush through my hair and, when my hair dries, it is very smooth and silky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it makes my hair feel very smooth</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair look really healthy.</li>
            <li> I love all Bronner&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> So many reviews that state</li>
            <li> I have tried shampooing my hair with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap and using the Citrus Hair Rinse as a conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> My scalp has never felt better.</li>
            <li> I get more complements on my hair when I use it.     </li>
            <li> It smells like something that I&#x27;d put together in my kitchen, but the difference is that it actually works and makes my hair do wonderful things.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is organic.</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair feels and looks after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more like a sting.</li>
            <li> I started using this conditioner along with the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Organic Shikakai Body Soap on my hair and love them both.</li>
            <li> sure you follow the directions and finger</li>
            <li> okay, but would not recommend.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Indian women wash their hair with oil, most of the time coconut, then leave it in for hours.  </li>
            <li> is much better.. :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I found something with non-toxic ingredients that work.</li>
            <li> This is definitely better than any conditioner I have tried before</li>
            <li> I noticed that it gives my hair much more volume</li>
            <li> I love this rinse for what it does to my hair.</li>
            <li> More power to anyone who does the full-blown \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; method, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I decided to try JR Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars with this product, because they&#x27;re safe for color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> it is infinitely better and presentable to wear to the office.</li>
            <li> This is getting better, though.</li>
            <li> It is much more manageable, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as if your hair looks like you&#x27;ve been walking in the snow. :)</li>
            <li> :) I haven&#x27;t had an issue with it getting into my eyes, either.</li>
            <li> If you have any issues with your skin, try looking into a more organic skincare routine.</li>
            <li> I love most Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this product is out there for me to use.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it,</li>
            <li> so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> No flyaways, no frizz, and it has more volume.</li>
            <li> I love most Dr. Bronner&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> The process of squeezing out the orange goop into a cup and swirling it about, then dumping it over your hair is... interesting.</li>
            <li> and so I have to use more products after I get out of the shower.  </li>
            <li> but some people love it.  </li>
            <li> love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely and makes my hair feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> and i feel this has healing effect :)</li>
            <li> My husband has a bit more oil to his scalp and hair and he doesn&#x27;t need the oil chaser.</li>
            <li> Although I like the brand and trying to use their shampoo as well (which isn&#x27;t going that well even though I diluted it as recommended by many people online)</li>
            <li> I love the Dr.</li>
            <li> but I still need a conditioning detangler to be able to comb my hair and style.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> and i can be reasonably sure it&#x27;s healthy and not terrible for the ecosystem.</li>
            <li> and I love the combination of Dr Bronners soap and this conditioning rinse.</li>
            <li> and I love the scent that lingers.  </li>
            <li> with 1 tablespoon of castille soap and my hair looks even better than it did with this rinse, so I have this as a backup-</li>
            <li> I like the concentration and the smell of citrus in this conditioner, but it definitely does not do a great conditioning job unless you want to repeat the application for 3-4 times!</li>
            <li> terrrible conditioner and I have used apple cider vinegar for conditioner with better results</li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading many reviews I was determined to use Dr Bronners Magic soap (diluted) as a shampoo</li>
            <li> I had hoped that I could use this as a rinse after the magic soap as I had read</li>
            <li> However, I found that this conditioner coupled with a daily cleansing shampoo was the perfect match!</li>
            <li> anything more than that</li>
            <li> i like the dr bronner rinse better though as it uses lemon juice for the acid portion</li>
            <li> I love this product but it came to me damaged and leaking.</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the directions and dilute the formula with water.  </li>
            <li> but it is for the better.</li>
            <li> My hair retains more of the scent of the castile liquid soap that I use.</li>
            <li> when I use these products together than when I was using my argan oil shampoo and conditioner (which made my hair more on the curly side).</li>
            <li> I recommend using warm water so that it&#x27;s more comfortable when pouring on your head.</li>
            <li> Worked much better than I</li>
            <li> I then save the rest for two more uses before repeating the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the soap smells wonderful, it doesn&#x27;t last on your hair</li>
            <li> Love the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap for cleaning</li>
            <li> The soap helps my curls look better.</li>
            <li> so many others warnings, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;Tang&amp;#34; or un-natural orange smell.</li>
            <li> love the way my wife&#x27;s hair feels after she uses this.</li>
            <li> I love that effect, too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the citrusy smell.</li>
            <li> Tried it twice just to make sure and followed all instructions.  </li>
            <li> The smell is ok,</li>
            <li> This product is magical.</li>
            <li> I love Dr Bronner&#x27;s products, because I don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving unnatural chemicals in my body.</li>
            <li> (be sure to rinse well).</li>
            <li> (I suppose that&#x27;s the mushrooms) and that scent sticks to hair more than vinegar.  </li>
            <li> I love how it makes my hair so shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> So i added more caps fulls</li>
            <li> This is so much better</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> If I use more then that it looks greasy by then end of the day.</li>
            <li> I think I might love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is just so much better for me than using an apple cider vinegar rinse, which just made my hair thicker and gummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap, so I was very excited to try this Conditioning rinse.</li>
            <li> Dilute 1 cap of Citrus Rinse with large cup of water (most successful for me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is important to use all the products according to the package instructions or your hair may not be exactly what you want it to be, but when it&#x27;s used properly-- great results.</li>
            <li> They work best for figuring whether a solution is generally acidic or alkaline, not the precise pH.  </li>
            <li> Always enjoyable supporting a good company too.</li>
            <li> It quickly went away and my hair has never been better!</li>
            <li> It quickly went away and my hair has never been better!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any bleaching at all, but I keep my conditioner in the light-sealed container and live in Michigan where the fall season is mostly overcast or rainy.    </li>
            <li> Also, my hair is quite fine and this, used in proper dilution, is perfect.  </li>
            <li> If you use the original Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soaps on your hair then this product is a MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> It does burn my neck if I use it after shaving, I do wish I didn&#x27;t have to mix it with water, and the smell is on the strong side but those aren&#x27;t that important!</li>
            <li> the strong smell of the soap when showering :) ahhh...tea tree...peppermint...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so easy I&#x27;m able to do it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am so happy I&#x27;m going natural with my hair and am so grateful to have found Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> This completely solved that problem, and it smells great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I didn&#x27;t love this product at first.</li>
            <li> So happy to have switched to natural products.</li>
            <li> After shampooing with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castille soap, you really need a good conditioner to soften up the hair again.</li>
            <li> My hair feels much softer and smells so good.</li>
            <li> Hair adjusted well VERY quickly… and air drying hair was actually good.  </li>
            <li> untangles hair  fast just need to watch it doesn&#x27;t get into eyes as really good sting to it</li>
            <li> It was lumpy and seemed to not do much, but I felt like I needed to use it since I paid a good amount for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This makes it easy to mix and use.</li>
            <li> It does not leave your hair easy to comb.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to smell like that, so I rewashed &amp; used my Giovanni Avocado &amp; Olive Oil 2chic ultra-moist conditioner, which I LOVE, and works great with a tiny amount.  </li>
            <li> I never leave reviews, but this product is really easily misused, so</li>
            <li> It works great on the tips or dried hair but not so good for my scalp.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner really makes hair soft and silky, and it smells great!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say that this conditions very quickly, so I think that for people who are experiencing problems with it should try rinsing it out immediately after massaging it in.</li>
            <li> it seems to be too strong for my scalp and tingles or burns me a bit.  </li>
            <li> It smells strongly of citrus, and if you have any skin abrasions anywhere it is gonna STING.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is dryer and tends to tangle after a good wash, so I decided to try the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s conditioning rise.</li>
            <li> This acidic treatment is a lot like vinegar rinse without smelling as strong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
            <li> It looks kind of brown and runny and at first I thought it might not work</li>
            <li> but the more I used it with the recommended dilutions and full strength, the nastier my hair felt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read elsewhere online to rinse with really cool water to help seal the hair shaft for better smoothness.</li>
            <li> My hair is easy to comb through and smooth.</li>
            <li> Yes, it has a citrus content which is fine..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell is also less then wonderful and don&#x27;t ever mix it with fingers if you&#x27;ve got a cut - ouch (citrus).</li>
            <li> I know that folks say that if you give your hair time to adjust it will be fine, but I&#x27;m a girl who loves my hair, so this was not an option for me.</li>
            <li> But it is fine and light in texture.  </li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s shampoos, which I&#x27;ve used for quite some time.</li>
            <li> have made the mistake of shaving before applying this and that is a HUGE mistake.</li>
            <li> and I can tell you pH test strips are not all that accurate.  </li>
            <li> I have really great hair when I use regular Dove shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> If people want their health back you MUST go organic and this Hair product works great for me.</li>
            <li> Once you put it in your hair and then wash it out, it smells fantastic, of orange and lemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> light conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product - this is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased, and using it along with the Castile soap in place of shampoo and conditioner has completely changed my hair for the better.</li>
            <li> It makes it so smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> &quot; ideology doesn&#x27;t do that, but I didn&#x27;t really want to pursue something that required *that* much trial and error (i.e. measurements of how much baking soda worked perfectly with your hair, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> important to rinse thoroughly --</li>
            <li> I like the smell and enjoy the feel of my hair after using it.  </li>
            <li> hair was so smooth and brushing</li>
            <li> I shampoo with the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint, then follow with a capful of this in about a cup of water, and my hair is silky smooth.</li>
            <li> It does help detangle and smooth my hair after using the Dr. Bronner soap.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I was trying to go chemical free and &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> you need to close the follicles in order to have smooth, manageable, shiny hair.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t know if this product will under go light oxidation, but it being in a opaque container makes me think it will because of the citrus ingredients being so acidic.</li>
            <li> If your product DOES undergo light oxidation, it may bleach your hair, which some people have reported when using this conditioner and being out in the sun (think like hydrogen peroxide).</li>
            <li> ; I had to use oil on my hair afterwards to smooth it out</li>
            <li> This conditioning rinse will remove all the Castile soap and leave your hair silky smooth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Still, my hair feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s recommends using one of their hair cremes after using this conditioning rinse to smooth and detangle.</li>
            <li> Plus it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t smell it in the bottle, its weird, good news, once you mix it with water, it smell nice and does a great job.</li>
            <li> My scalp now feels light without the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> and then i reached the desired light silky results.</li>
            <li> It worked, all natural, good for the Environment and smells</li>
            <li> kind of nice actually.  </li>
            <li> Good old diluted acetic acid gets my hair softer, too.  </li>
            <li> And knowing that there are no harsh chemicals in it makes me feel good about buying and using this product.</li>
            <li> However, with the right mix, none of that happens and my hair turns out lovely.</li>
            <li> Other than that this is a great organic option :)</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very economical</li>
            <li> but it smells nice and left my hair very easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> Diluted vinegar works well, but this works better --  a little extra shine without oil, a wonderful smell, and nice shiny hair after combing.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t love this product, despite how much I try!  </li>
            <li> &quot; I was excited and ordered a bottle.</li>
            <li> and  I am excited to see what my hair will be like after using them for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It feels even better the next day, and the best part, I only have to wash my hair every 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it made a rich lather in my hair and my hair felt like straw after getting out (even after using my argan oil conditioner)</li>
            <li> Originally used the soap on body too, but after not seeing a noticeable difference over my Dove bar, decided to save it for just the hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Though</li>
            <li> but there Shikakai seems to add a unique smell that not everyone will like.</li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably healthier, hydrated (dries in half the time!!), has wonderful body and shine</li>
            <li> It was nice because since I wasn&#x27;t using traditional shampoo and therefore couldn&#x27;t get most moisturizing treatments to rinse from my hair.</li>
            <li> Using Dr. B&#x27;s shampoo does make my hair feel silky, shiny and clean</li>
            <li> Use this with the bar soap to clean my hair.</li>
            <li> If you use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s baby mild soap to wash your hair, use either this or Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar as a rinse so your hair will be smooth and maneageable.  </li>
            <li> As if my hair and scalp being the happiest they&#x27;ve ever been wasn&#x27;t enough, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is pretty much the best body care company out there when it comes to transparency and responsibility in producing their products.</li>
            <li> This rinse is the best I&#x27;ve found for bringing out a lovely shine to my long hair--a shine that lasts several days.  </li>
            <li> Something very important to note, which I had to learn by trial and error: the amount of Citrus Rinse and how much you are diluting it matters.</li>
            <li> I, like many other reviewers, had a good experience with [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This conditioner works amazing, I love it more than the shiseido hair care products I was previously using.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything special.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t judge the quality for others, but for my fine hair, it&#x27;s just not quite right.</li>
            <li> First, I washed my hair with 1:1 diluted Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint castile soap, which smells great AND lathers well (I also added some peppermint essential oil to the diluted soap for moisture).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation?</li>
            <li> I use a cap full in a measuring cup of water.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t look frizzy and it looks good the next day too.     </li>
            <li> and it ends up soft, with volume, and with nice waves without frizz.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It really feels healthy afterward.</li>
            <li> I was unpleasantly surprised after the sweet-smelling rose castile soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also think it brings out my natural wave nicely</li>
            <li> has a warehouse full of the stuff, and they want to sell it to YOU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll say the conditioner was better than the shampoo, but it wasn&#x27;t really doing it for me</li>
            <li> Some people don&#x27;t really like the citrus smell either, but I find it refreshing.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s cool and rinse the product out.</li>
            <li> I use one cap full per use</li>
            <li> It worked good after a homemade deep conditioning treatment, though it didn&#x27;t rinse all the oil out.</li>
            <li> it does not have a basket full of chemicals and dyes.</li>
            <li> The directions say to use a cap full.</li>
            <li> It has a citrus smell, which is not bad and doesn&#x27;t linger once you&#x27;ve rinsed.</li>
            <li> So soft, so shiny (not greasy though), so healthy and strong...</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: This will make your hair lighter over time due to the citrus in the product.it&#x27;s used properly-- great results.</li>
            <li> Love my new rinse!</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s super duper concentrated), and the color/texture leaves something to be desired</li>
            <li> and I decided to try it for mild dandruff relief.</li>
            <li> Because I don&#x27;t have to use so much and paired with diluted Dr. Bronners soap, it is quite an economical and healthy way to treat your hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is left feeling soft with an incredible amount of body.</li>
            <li> this can be achieved with a mild acid rinse.</li>
            <li> I have found a conditioner from the Honest Company that actually works and is chemical free.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so much &#x27;Hair Gels&#x27; on it to keep it from becoming &#x27;unruly&#x27; that you&#x27;d think I owned the company.</li>
            <li> (Currently looking for better alternatives but this is a great back up</li>
            <li> good rinse to use after high pH natural shampoo</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really dissipate over time, so I would strongly suggest that you rinse with water as soon as you pour this on</li>
            <li> I have very fine and straight hair, so a capful is a bit too much for ME</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did tingle quite a bit when my scalp wasn&#x27;t healthy, and I find the smell slightly overwhelming (but not intolerable) --- certainly not like the other perfumed conditioners, but since it keeps my hair in great shape, I don&#x27;t think I will ever look for another product.</li>
            <li> First of all, I am the biggest fan of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products!  </li>
            <li> I have been smelling and touching my hair all day - it is just so soft!</li>
            <li> Yet, be extra cautious and dilute even more!</li>
            <li> Also, the citrus smell is almost overwhelming, but at least citrus is a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> The smell of citrus is strong at first (for about the first 15 minutes or so), but it goes away after her hair dries.</li>
            <li> It will also be super soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly and somewhat fine hair that tends to be frizzy without products.</li>
            <li> I have fine, medium length, and colored hair, and it disentangled my hair really well.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair and used this with J.R Liggett Bar Shampoo based on another reviewer, was a mistake.</li>
            <li> But the best way that I can describe it is that my hair felt stripped for the first two weeks due to the damage from old shampoos and the need for my hair to heal.</li>
            <li> But the best way that I can describe it is that my hair felt stripped for the first two weeks due to the damage from old shampoos and the need for my hair to heal.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner, smells like real lemons and my fine hair is left silky and tangle free</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had much body or shine, so when this rinse left my hair shiny and not flat, smelling good and reducing frizz, I was elated!!</li>
            <li> makes hair very manageble and smooth</li>
            <li> that is, where you use vinegar and baking soda to primarily wash your hair -- and doing some research on it, I really felt like it was something I could not commit to.</li>
            <li> It has helped my dyed hair color stay fresh</li>
            <li> ; I won&#x27;t buy any more products containing toxic ingredients for me or my house, so switching to Bronner soaps was a natural. .</li>
            <li> , recommended is ONE CAP FULL to a warm CUP OF WATER (long hair</li>
            <li> My wife who sometimes straightens her hair didn&#x27;t think it was worth the work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to use more natural products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad that I did it, though, because I really tried to give it a real chance</li>
            <li> I try to use more natural products on my body when I can.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be okay.</li>
            <li> I love natural products, so when I found \\&quot;Dr.</li>
            <li> It contains citrus so any cuts or freshly shaven areas will burn like hell.</li>
            <li> and they couldn&#x27;t think of maybe lavender oil to put in it that is natural but more preferred than this horrid rotting citrus smell</li>
            <li> /&gt;some things to consider if you&#x27;re switching from shampoo/conditioner to a more natural hair care solution:&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;ll</li>
            <li> you can make your own by mixing apple cider vinegar (acid) and some essential oils of your choosing (scent) then diluting into a rinse (search for hair vinegar rinse</li>
            <li> It delivered and smells like fresh lemon.</li>
            <li> I began the natural lifestyle just recently and was moderately happy with the way the vinegar rinse was leaving my hair, but I wanted to try something else.  </li>
            <li> Through trial and error I found this conditioner and soap combo to work fantastically together, a must try if your looking for a more natural option.</li>
            <li> CASTILE SOAP AS SHAMPOO: I recently started using the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Rose Castile Liquid Soap (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083LU5LC) for my hair.</li>
            <li> Tried a full 3 weeks and used exactly to package specifications.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a huge difference in how smooth and soft her hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, as I no longer have a film from using castile and it makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> just stick with it, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I feel like I need to for this one.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner, it has a strong citrus odor and left my hair smelling very much like citrus for hours.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it leaves my hair feeling smooth and smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li> Legit fair trade, seriously organic, no one gets paid more than 5 times another</li>
            <li> The bar shampoo says it can be used without any other products, but good luck with that.</li>
            <li> It took my a while to figure out the right amount for my hair.</li>
            <li> There is a warning about this right on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> The lemon juice has even given my hair some pretty fantastic natural highlights, although it&#x27;s true that it can cause some stinging like they warn on the bottle.</li>
            <li> It is not really a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It is made of very healthy ingredients.</li>
            <li> I then put a cap full of this rinse into it and shake it gently.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint for a while, and i have noticed a huge difference in my fine, short hair.</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work, but it just did not with my fine straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I tried all different dilution ratios and came to the conclusion a little over a capful to one 16 oz water bottle of water is perfect.</li>
            <li> The solution itself isn&#x27;t pure liquid -- you have to dilute it!</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair soft and is easy to comb out.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling soft, conditioned, or easy to comb through.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is just worth mentioning that I did try to go without the hair creme and just use the bar soap and the citrus rinse, but my hair wasn&#x27;t as smooth and soft as before, but it did have the boost in volume.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is just worth mentioning that I did try to go without the hair creme and just use the bar soap and the citrus rinse, but my hair wasn&#x27;t as smooth and soft as before, but it did have the boost in volume.</li>
            <li> I will say that I feel like I went through this bottle rather quickly, but I also tend to use too much conditioner on my hair.</li>
            <li> Also, the conditioning rinse is deep orange in color, and may not be great for people with bleach blonde highlights.</li>
            <li> To me, this product has such a fresh citrusy scent, I love the fragrance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also does have a strong citrus scent and it does sting if you get it in your eyes or if your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten my own lotion down to a science and love the way natural lotions make my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, simple, natural winner from Dr. Bronner!!!!!!</li>
            <li> hair is approaching mid-back-length, and a conditioner&#x27;s detangling ability is very important to me.</li>
            <li> But very much lemons and oranges.</li>
            <li> have nearly waist-length, wavy, fine hair that is prone to dryness.</li>
            <li> Reading somewhere that this product leaves fine &amp; soft hair after soap-shampooing,  I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> Works good though a little runnier than I hoped for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this combo for a month now and find my hair with more body than it ever had and it is easy to style (and with less products) than before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin, but some herbal/plant fragrances bother me, and I don&#x27;t want super chemical either.</li>
            <li> I am 21 and the older I get, the more into natural products I become.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I am a huge advocate for all natural, non-GMO products like this</li>
            <li> The first time I used this was with homemade shampoo (baking soda and water).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick with Free and Clear.</li>
            <li> The FDA has allowed so many harmful chemicals in our personal care products the only way to be safe is to check the ingredients of all your bath products.</li>
            <li> Need more actually...</li>
            <li> while my hair did come out nice and smooth, it dried really frizzy and puffy.thank</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner really screwed up on this!  </li>
            <li> When I first got it, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like it</li>
            <li> That assures that any globs that are initially present are able to be fully resolved before you use it.</li>
            <li> This product was my first introduction to that brand.</li>
            <li> I have had to brush my hair more often, since it feels differently.</li>
            <li> - my hair has been in much better shape since going off of regular shampoos.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product and cannot say enough about it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> The first time I got it in my eyes and it burned like hell.  </li>
            <li> First thing that struck me was the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad that I didn&#x27;t have to actually go out anywhere today....</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castille soap, but this conditioning rinse was GROSS.</li>
            <li> but this keeps it light and soft.</li>
            <li> Dr Bronner&#x27;s service rep said that this has a pH level of 3… which, assumed, that if the water was alkaline, this pH would be a bit higher than a 3.  </li>
            <li> The first ingredient is lemon juice</li>
            <li> And speaking of how it go tangled in the first place is about another product to review.</li>
            <li> I found this for the first time at a yard sale and searched my town for a store that carried it.  </li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling soft, smooth, and without the tangles that a Castile &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; or baking soda and water can leave.  </li>
            <li> At first, I used it with 2 capfuls with one application of soap.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> i do not recommend this as a detangler, but I felt my hair had been conditioned and my hair was silky even after the first use, as they claim it would be.</li>
            <li> I suspect my hair actually smells a bit more like some oil (for all my desi folks out there, kinda like Ayurvedic medicine).</li>
            <li> First world problems, I know,</li>
            <li> One way I&#x27;ve been able to make the product last longer is to put the diluted version in a spray bottle and spray it on my scalp and hair and massage everything in.  </li>
            <li> My scalp is pretty damaged, so it did sting a bit, but I&#x27;m used to that from the ACV.</li>
            <li> Overall its ok, I&#x27;ll use this bottle</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance, but didn&#x27;t know when I bought it that it would have to be mixed.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine, long, wavy, and often frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> Right now, might be using too much shampoo, because hair becomes parched if I don&#x27;t use the leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;-Price.</li>
            <li> I was all set to give up and go back to regular conditioner when I accidentally used a much more diluted mix (I forgot how much I had added) and the results were SO MUCH BETTER.</li>
            <li> It is ALL NATURAL and Environment Friendly.  </li>
            <li> The conditioning rinse immediately left my hair feeling super soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li> You know that salon clean feel your hair has after a professional shampoo?  </li>
            <li> it is supposed to be on, my hair did not feel clean or soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also started to use a more natural skincare line called Zum, which is by a company in Kansas City (called Indigo Wild).</li>
            <li> Usually Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are pretty good</li>
            <li> When my hair dried it had a nice golden shine to is as it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel good - and you need very little of it to do the job.</li>
            <li> My thinking is that the positive reviews are all compensated endorsers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started to use one cap full and have diluted it with more water than I did the first few washes.</li>
            <li> this pretty much removes all the pigment you just put in.</li>
            <li> I started using Bronner&#x27;s liquid Peppermint soap (diluted 1:1) as shampoo a few months ago and am very pleased with the way it cleans my hair.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this shampoo I used WAY too much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dark brown, mucky substance (honestly, looks just like soupy poop) that smells like sulphur.</li>
            <li> mix approximately a full cap with ~16 oz of water (in an old water bottle), kept at hand in the shower</li>
            <li> (amazing considering that most CEOs nowadays make hundreds times what their factory floor workers do), employees get 100% free healthcare, and they give like a third of their profits back to charity (beyond their free trade projects, which, among other things, support peaceful Palestinian/Israeli coexistence and medical equipment for hospitals in Sri Lanka).</li>
            <li> it was so easy, and I noticed a definite increase in shine.</li>
            <li> I got concerned when I started seeing bold spots at the front and my follicles where clearly inflamed.</li>
            <li> It has certainly become my preferred method of hair washing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was used as conditioner/ rinse for HOMEMADE SHAMPOO (1.5cups Organic Pure Virgin Coconut Milk + 1.75cups Aloe Gel) with an assumed pH level of between 4 and 6.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been fortunate that at the age of 73 years (young) that I still have a full head of hair, it&#x27;s still Red except for the temples</li>
            <li> particularly when you are first starting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know some have had success with a pure Apple Cider Vinegar rinse with essential oils, but I&#x27;m pretty happy with trying this product first to get my hair transitioned properly -- I may try a homemade rinse down the line.</li>
            <li> counter acts the sticky grittiness that pure castille soap can leave on your hair (no matter HOW much you dilute it).</li>
            <li> It works well enough for my fine straight hair, but didn&#x27;t do any miracles.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean, smooth and detangled without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, you have to get a large cup full of water, then add two or one caps full of the conditioner and swirl it around, then you can dunk your already wet hair into the cup and shift it around, til you think the solution has reached all of the hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for people with oily or fine hair that usual creamy conditioners weigh down.</li>
            <li> Yes, most of the negative reviews are accurate.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference since using it, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2ish weeks.</li>
            <li> but the amazing highlights that emerged  while using it and spending time at the beach brought back memories from my teen years with a bottle of Sun-In hair spray lightener.</li>
            <li> I used just a tiny drop, but it really did make a huge difference in the smoothness and softness of my hair.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a HUGE difference in the softness, but it was noticeable enough that I&#x27;d keep buying the hair creme.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a HUGE difference in the softness, but it was noticeable enough that I&#x27;d keep buying the hair creme.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any of these products on my hair and it makes me really upset.</li>
            <li> I really like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps - and I wanted to like this conditioner.</li>
            <li> It makes my whole scalp tingle, they even warn you of this.</li>
            <li> The rinse really makes a difference once you wash with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Majic Peppermint Hemp Oil soap.  </li>
            <li> and it does not get greasy so fast.</li>
            <li> Yes, absolutely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you really want to pursue an organic haircare routine, just be mindful of the fact that there is a transition.</li>
            <li> I personally really like how it&#x27;s going, but it&#x27;s not for everyone.</li>
            <li> With this Dr. Bronners stuff, you can&#x27;t really leave a bit in, or add a bit as a leave-in.  </li>
            <li> This product is not totally hassle free - you have to dilute a cap-full of the product in a cup of water</li>
            <li> One capful in a cup of water is really all</li>
            <li> But, It works really well.</li>
            <li> A pain, because I&#x27;d have much preferred a ready-to-use conditioner, but not a deal breaker.</li>
            <li> If so, the listing should indicate as much ...</li>
            <li> Ocasionally I miss the truly soft feeling of real conditioner, but then I remember trying to keep my hair in a bun without it slipping out, and I&#x27;m back to being happy with this hair rinse.</li>
            <li> Works so well to condition hair after shampooing with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap, really helps get rid of that glycerin soap feeling.</li>
            <li> smell is very citrusy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to really explain this</li>
            <li> It also really didn&#x27;t serve its purpose.</li>
            <li> conditioners that do provide a detangling effect do so by coating the strands of your hair so that they&#x27;re slippery and don&#x27;t stick together; that&#x27;s what allows you to get a comb or a brush through it with any reasonable amount of effort.</li>
            <li> I really like it</li>
            <li> I tried the whole</li>
            <li> It did wonders for my combination skin scalp and my hair didn&#x27;t get greasy as fast as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take much so this bottle lasts quite some time.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see any difference in the volume of my hair though&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;(as a closing note, the smell doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair too much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just going to be straight with you, it&#x27;s brown goop</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll look at it and wonder if you should really put it on your hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Citrus Hair Conditioning Rinse in pairing with the castile liquid soap.</li>
            <li> My hair is light to medium ash in color, wavy in texture, medium in thickness, and sits just above my shoulders in length.</li>
            <li> There won&#x27;t be much of a lather.</li>
            <li> but still very wavy)</li>
            <li> and my hair is growing much faster.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe some of you over moisturize and that&#x27;s why this is too much.</li>
            <li> Very.</li>
            <li> careful not to add more to water than is suggested..</li>
            <li> Environmentally, socially, financially responsible through and through.</li>
            <li> Do you know how much time that saves me in the morning?</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.  </li>
            <li> It really tangled my hair</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work for me, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really concentrated.  </li>
            <li> She&#x27;s pleased with this product, so we plan to repurchase it before the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> It smells very vinegary.</li>
            <li> The real trick to making this work (for me anyway) was not to rinse too much of it out after soaking.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap for my hair since I have scalp psoriasis and shampoo seems to really trigger it, but the soap alone made my hair greasy and not presentable...</li>
            <li> Diluting it seems like a lot of work, and if you dilute it as much as the instructions say it just sorta</li>
            <li> It takes too much time in the shower.</li>
            <li> Very inconvient when in the shower.</li>
            <li> I usually really like Dr.</li>
            <li> That treatment leaves my hair gorgeous, shiny and thick without being fuzzy, and strangers compliment me for it.</li>
            <li> And although I have a lot of hair, my biggest problem is flat hair because it is so fine.</li>
            <li> I find it to be a pleasant natural citrus smell and not overwhelming at all.  </li>
            <li> Now I dilute my rinse a little more than directed, about one cap full for about 1.5-2 cups of water (I use my old conditioner bottle and it works well for shaking it up).</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length slightly wavy, very fine hair-- and a lot of it.</li>
            <li> B00120VWJ0 Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Castile Soaps]] and wanted to try other elements of the Bronner&#x27;s line.  </li>
            <li> I love Dr Bronners other products</li>
            <li> but I am going to keep looking for other plant safe products....</li>
            <li> I have medium to long fine hair that loves to tangle</li>
            <li> /&gt;-washing with soap will clean your hair well but leave the follicles open and hair feeling tangly.</li>
            <li> I should say that I have fine and color treated long hair.  </li>
            <li> I looked at this bottle and thought &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; - as soon as I put it on my hair, it *instantly* felt clean and cleaner than it had in weeks.</li>
            <li> I just bought the Dr. Bronners&#x27;s hair creme, also  pretty good but not a strong enough hold for me.  </li>
            <li> The important thing is that after I use this conditioner and let my hair air dry, I have large separate curls.</li>
            <li> I do wish they had other options for the conditioning rinse like they do for their castile soap,but so far I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re interested in more socially responsible products, check out the Good Guide app (here&#x27;s the Apple link: [...] )</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling clumpy and full of build-up.</li>
            <li> You have to get over what the mainstream companies have brainwashed us into thinking what a conditioner has to be (white, creamy, full chemicals and synthetic fragrance) to use this, you have to think about what you&#x27;re looking for - a product that works and works well.  </li>
            <li> I put one cap-full into a small spray bottle and mix with warm water to dissolve the particles in the rinse.  </li>
            <li> Some people also don&#x27;t like that you have to dilute the product, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all: I fill up my old conditioner bottle (holds about 1.5-2C) with water, pour in a cap full of the conditioner, shake it up and pour it on my hair - pretty simple.</li>
            <li> I really love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s but this product was average for me.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel as clean or soft as I generally like.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the smell too much, although it was strong and not exactly a girly smell.</li>
            <li> She thought I found some miracle style agent, but really all it has been was my new shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br</li>
            <li> She thought I found some miracle style agent, but really all it has been was my new shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used it 3 times to untangle my hair (which is caused because of the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s sshampoo) and almost used more than half the bottle on my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, smooth, feels thicker and it typically looks and feels even better the next day.. and the day after that.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, smooth, feels thicker and it typically looks and feels even better the next day.. and the day after that.</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s baby mild soap mixed with coconut milk.</li>
            <li> This conditioner looks super gross in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I went with baby mild soap instead, and just bought a different conditioner.</li>
            <li> It also burns the skin and causes real irritation if you have the very sensitive type, but the caution is indicated on the bottle.</li>
            <li> It was kind of dry at first, but I know other people who ended up being oily.</li>
            <li> It was kind of dry at first, but I know other people who ended up being oily.</li>
            <li> is not there any longer, actually there is a kind of a &#x27;sweet, fruity&#x27; smell (it&#x27;s hard to smell my hair, so this seems to be the smell</li>
            <li> and it was better, but my hair was a knotted tangled mess.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s common sense, really, it&#x27;s mostly concentrated acid!  </li>
            <li> My son tried it, he has curly full hair, it made his flat and greasy.  </li>
            <li> Many of these chemicals have been banned from food, but in the FDA&#x27;s infinite stupidity they let you put them on your body where they are absorbed through your skin!!!      </li>
            <li> would HIGHLY recommend not using this AFTER you shave.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this because of it being a Dr Bronner product.</li>
            <li> product is HIGHLY concentrated.</li>
            <li> The lemon content is high so avoid the eyes (ouch)</li>
            <li> , it is a little overwhelming when it is concentrated in the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe, but you can kind of tell when you&#x27;re &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; pouring based on the feel of your hair.</li>
            <li> I love all of Dr Bonner&#x27;s stuff, but this conditioner is very heavy and sticky for thin, fine hair, even when diluted more than the instructions state.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this stuff to complete my regimen</li>
            <li> Despite all that,  it leaves my hair so soft, and the curls are really pronounced.  </li>
            <li> The result is soft hair that doesn&#x27;t smell, and is much easier to style than it was in my conditioner days.</li>
            <li> Okay, maybe it won&#x27;t cure the common cold, but it&#x27;s a great hair rinse!!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair Very Shiny and Soft.</li>
            <li> so I really wanted something natural for moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It made my hair really shiny and soft, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This product, 2 cap fulls in a full cup of water works like a charm (for me), not only does it give my hair a natural &#x27;sheen&#x27; but it become manageable</li>
            <li> At first I was using regular conditioner after the soap, and while it worked, I figured I would try the whole shebang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have searched for some alternatives to &#x27;normal&#x27; shampoos and ended up using a bar soap from the farmers market.</li>
            <li> : good, but not great.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works extremely well on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to wear black shirts again because my dandruff is all gone!</li>
            <li> I tried using more than the recommended two cap-fulls, which did nothing, and it still left my hair so dry that it crinkled.</li>
            <li> It is wayyy less frizzy and still has nice body and actually looks thicker.  </li>
            <li> I rated right in the middle for this conditioning rinse...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get the right consistency to use this properly</li>
            <li> The smell is definitely overpowering right out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I think I was expecting something a little more natural smelling.</li>
            <li> hair felt really good after I worked it in and let it sit for a few minutes, and it dried pretty well</li>
            <li> It does take your hair a few weeks to a couple months to adjust to the new hair cleansing routine if you&#x27;re switching from harsher shampoos to something more natural.</li>
            <li> I easily combed through my knots after using the rinse with less hair getting caught in my comb.  </li>
            <li> I normally love earthy smells, so I was surprised at how much I disliked it.  </li>
            <li> Going with natural products it will always have a different feel and will take time to get use to but its worth it.</li>
            <li> my hair seems thicker, shinier, has more volume, even has a little wave!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised.</li>
            <li> this conditioner leaves my hair very soft, but anybody who tells you it&#x27;s any help in detangling hair</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make your hair very soft.</li>
            <li> (It did not have a chemically smell to it either, very natural smelling)</li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin; but the tingle left right after rinsing it off.</li>
            <li> That mixture will usually last me three or four showers (I have super short hair, so longer hair may need the entire bottle&#x27;s worth for one use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a slick feel.</li>
            <li> I personally thing traditional and more simple ways to wash your hair</li>
            <li> stuff does work pretty well as a conditioner, so it meets that objective.</li>
            <li> Would recommend 100% for natural no poo convenient hair care!</li>
            <li> many stating that it could take weeks to get the &amp;#34;greasiness&amp;#34; on the hair out during the &amp;#34;transition period.&amp;#34;  Since I was not interested in ACV, I opted for this as the rinse - similar pH.  </li>
            <li> and WOW!</li>
            <li> This makes my hair so soft and shiny (and NOT FRIZZY, hallelujah!).</li>
            <li> The first time I used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Citrus Orange Conditioning Rinse i had just gotten done setting up the Christmas tree, so i had tiny scratches all over my hands and arms.</li>
            <li> , I feel like the lemon juice and orange essential oils clean my hair enough.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair with very little body and an extremely sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> At first, I rinsed out the conditioner completely, and it left my hair feeling tangled again.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bother me now, but it may deter some people if you&#x27;re used to your conditioners smelling like sweet apples, strawberries, other fruity things or perfumes.</li>
            <li> It may work better for hair that is less coarse, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> It is only slightly a citrus scent, but mostly a barfy scent.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s actually somewhat effective at detangling my (short) hair and making it feel less stripped of oils after using the Castile</li>
            <li> Not only that, but even after your hair is dry it leaves a light natural citrus scent without</li>
            <li> My hair is on the dry side, so after that, I do a quick spray and comb from a spray bottle with a little jojoba and sweet almond oils diluted in water.</li>
            <li> I have very straight long hair that needs to be washed every two days.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It did take a few tries to get the right mix of conditioning rinse and water, and if it&#x27;s too strong, it stings my scalp, eyes and nose.</li>
            <li> But I could still do with a little more volume &amp; moisture, especially in the Winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;After use, I found that this product felt heavier than other conditioners and I was concerned, but in a few hours, once the hair was dry, I could see smooth wavy hair with a healthy natural shine.</li>
            <li> My curly hair is amazingly soft, not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and has a lot of body.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a Natural smell and after rinsing it off the smell</li>
            <li> I do use a natural shampoo about once a week and then follow with the conditioning rinse.</li>
            <li> and even if you get it near your eyes, because of the smell it may still burn.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get my Pantene conditioner on fast enough.</li>
            <li> The shikakai powder in it is a natural detangler I have</li>
            <li> I also like that they have natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> If you want to have completely unmanageable hair, this &#x27;conditioner&#x27; is for you.</li>
            <li> I have noticed an improvement and, with time, I think it will completely go away and be smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it rinsed fast enough.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I almost gave up on Dr. Bronner&#x27;s shampoo even though we like the natural aspect of it.</li>
            <li> And did I mention how SOFT it is??</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it rinsed fast enough.  </li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Immediately, my hair felt soft, and it also smells</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m using an old shampoo bottle</li>
            <li> and she woke up with baby soft, tangle-free</li>
            <li> a disclaimer along the lines of &amp;#34;for professional use only&amp;#34; would be helpful.</li>
            <li> Bronner&#x27;s Castille soap and using it as a natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> So I mixed some up and put in a spray bottle, much easier to use.</li>
            <li> perhaps because it&#x27;s naturally detangles in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I starting using the hair rinse and my hair was so much easier to comb through and didn&#x27;t look greasy anymore.  </li>
            <li> This conditioning rinse does leave my hair very manageable, following the&lt;br /&gt;Dr.</li>
            <li> Taking into consideration that my hair is the soft silky type.</li>
            <li> so I was really surprised at this one.</li>
            <li> (w/ Dr Bronners and my old conditioner), then dumped this stuff out in the sink.</li>
            <li> Naturally, that stripped my hair of all its nutrients and turned into another problem.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use that much of the conditioner, it will last me forever.  </li>
            <li> (i use an old quart-size wonton soup container, washed thoroughly of course, that i marked at 1 cup) in the shower to dilute the conditioning rinse then pour through your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it has a really wierd smell and does not work as well as I thought it would, maybe I am not using enough</li>
            <li> will, but once your hair dries, it is really soft.  </li>
            <li> If you use it directly on your hair it seems to not rinse out well and will leave your hair oily.</li>
            <li> Someone suggested that that person may have received and old bottle</li>
            <li> hair silky soft (even after shampooing w/ Dr. B&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;Cured</li>
            <li> I use this after shampooing with my Wild Naturals shampoo.</li>
            <li> appreciate that it all natural.</li>
            <li> I completely gave up soap shampoos then.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t rinse this stuff out completely.</li>
            <li> It does not make my hair oily though, just soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, naturally shiny, and it&#x27;s never oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> have to dilute both the soap and the conditioner with water, which really makes each bottle last.</li>
            <li> I could style it, and it is soft and has a lot of body.</li>
            <li> I ended up pre-diluting it in an old bottle</li>
            <li> They basically told me to go directly to the manufacture of the product.</li>
            <li> Does it look absolutely fresh on the second and third day?</li>
            <li> This was effective at conditioning without leaving anything behind.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s diluted and goes on it leaves behind a nice citrus smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So I just recently bought this product, and I feel like I had a very different experience than most other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I literally could have given myself a Mohawk with no other styling products, that&#x27;s how much build-up it left.</li>
            <li> The trouble was my hair had significant residue or oil or</li>
            <li> I stopped using it when I had to stop using the soap on my hair, as my scalp dried out significantly.</li>
            <li> I have gone back to conventional washing, though, but feel free to ask any questions if you have any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It helps add some silkiness to my hair and always washes clean, not leaving my hair heavy with residue.</li>
            <li> : love the company and the results, not such a big fan of the price or the slight oily smell--but that&#x27;s what you get for all-natural.</li>
            <li> So, I would recommend if you are only interested in the final product.</li>
            <li> all came at different times (only days apart), but I got to try the Lavender and Coconut hair creme first with my homemade products.</li>
            <li> I was extremely frustrated because I was using apple cider vinegar as a rinse (as recommended by so many people doing no-poo) without any real success and</li>
            <li> If I put my hair up at night in bed and take it down in the morning, there&#x27;s actually not such a huge \\&quot;crimp\\&quot; in my hair from wearing it up.</li>
            <li> have Very fine, untreated, straight (except two weird curls by my ears), bodyless, mid-back length hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather use the acv-rinse, which is cheaper and actually makes my hair soft!!</li>
            <li> something vaguely like pine sap, which is pleasant enough on cut wood, but not quite how I&#x27;d like my hair to smell.</li>
            <li> :) Overall, I&#x27;m so glad I wasn&#x27;t dismayed by the bad reviews of this product and tried it out myself.</li>
            <li> and I was never able to freely comb my hair without snarls after using the Citrus Rinse.</li>
            <li> Had to wash and rewash my hair 3 times and it still wasn&#x27;t back to normal.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very fine &amp; thin.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and wasn&#x27;t particularly hard to rinse out.</li>
            <li> If you use too much of the castile soap as shampoo, it will dry out your hair.</li>
            <li> I heard some mixed reviews about this product, but I was still curious about it because I wanted a more or less natural conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have been searching and searching, looking for an all natural way to shampoo and condition my hair that will not dry it out and will not cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> It adds extra moisture to your hair but isn&#x27;t too heavy if concentrated at the ends and lightly all over.</li>
            <li> shampoo and conditioner strip your hair of its natural oils then replace it with heavy conditioners that coat the hair follicle which then needs to be removed by powerful detergents in the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, some of it coarse, and the no-poo method has been challenging.</li>
            <li> However, the rinse is dark brown--not very appetizing--and it is also supposed to be mixed with water to a certain consistency.</li>
            <li> It is gloppy and some of it doesn&#x27;t get totally dissolved but it does leave my hair manageable and very very soft.</li>
            <li> I am Red Headed and according to my School Teacher who was checking hair thickness from Blondes to Brunettes and of course the Brunettes were much thicker but since I was there and have Red Hair he was curious to find out if Red Hair is the same as Blonde Hair (fine).  </li>
            <li> Well, first things first, I don&#x27;t like having to mix the rinse with water every time I need to condition...call me lazy!</li>
            <li> but that was a major &amp;#34;FAIL&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have very limp hair on top, then frizzy and dry throughout.</li>
            <li> Every morning I use an undiluted nickle to quarter-sized dollop of this conditioner, rub it evenly into my soaking wet hair (using a circular motion with medium pressure), rinse until it feels like it&#x27;s pretty much all out (while doing the same massaging motion), finger comb my hair and air dry.</li>
            <li> highly recommend trying to wash your hair with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap as well, as long as you condition too.</li>
            <li> GENERAL:</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last too long after rinsing out the conditioner anyway if you really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> He was surprised to find that (my) Red Hair was even thicker than Brunettes.  </li>
            <li> the Dr Bronners shampoo - I use JR Ligget&#x27;s bar shampoo (it&#x27;s all natural, oils only)</li>
            <li> , I have been using it on my squirmy two year old who gets the biggest snarls in the back of her hair, since I wash it at night before she goes to bed.  </li>
            <li> It instantly made my hair soft, yet not too greasy.</li>
            <li> My water was about a 9 and adding the ratio (as per instructions) barely brought up the level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft and sleek, and on day two, my hair isn&#x27;t oily at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on products to help increase volume, but I really hadn&#x27;t found anything that worked all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wish that Dr. Bronner&#x27;s would put a bit of info about the hair rinse on the labels of the castile soaps so that people know that there is a second step for getting soft hair after using the castile.</li>
            <li> I will say this though every person(s) measurements may be different when you dilute the conditioner with water, I use my old conditioner bottle, and mix 6-7 cap fulls in about 16oz of bottled water.</li>
            <li> so I can squeeze out a thin stream and that is working much better than a cup.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind of difficult to use in the shower-</li>
            <li> It was okay, but not great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, this shikakai stuff is not really great (for me), but I do *love*</li>
            <li> I dilute this approximately 1/2 capful per 1 cup water and use it three days a week in conjunction with JR Liggett&#x27;s Jojoba &amp; Peppermint Bar Shampoo and love it.</li>
            <li> I liked the smell, but the product inside the bottle was a little strange since it was a little thicker than I had thought.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-it&#x27;s odd at first keeping a cup</li>
            <li> second bottle has the exact same ingredients, but Dr. Bronner&#x27;s has clearly listened to the complaints about the dark lumps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Towards the end of the first bottle, I hadn&#x27;t used it for several months, and for about 5 weeks I had been doing the no-poo method (not using conventional shampoo).</li>
            <li> So if you want an eco-friendly product that makes your hair very soft, shiny manageable to use with your castile soap (or other natural shampoo)</li>
            <li> put the diluted soap and the diluted rinse in empty dishwashing liquid bottles; this allows me to use only as much as I need where I need it.  </li>
            <li> Not going to lie, the first time I used it I was a little frightened - the smell is overpowering (</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Citrus Hair Conditioning Rinse, on the other hand, makes the strands of hair stick to one another, which is the exact opposite of a detangling effect, and it&#x27;s a time-consuming nightmare to get such hair combed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted a nice-smelling conditioner that wasn&#x27;t likely to cause an allergic reaction, and I really like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> The citrus fades but the BO smell hangs on long after your shower is complete.  </li>
            <li> I got used to the smell after the 1st few uses, but that first whiff was vomitous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never used a product that I unfortunately disliked as much!</li>
            <li> but... I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the effort.</li>
            <li> And they want you to dilute a capful into a cup of cool water before slowly pouring your hair.</li>
            <li> The last straw, and the reason I&#x27;ve dumped what was left in the bottle down the drain, was that after three days of using it EXACTLY according to the directions, it didn&#x27;t diminished my after-shower tangle problem at all.</li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair and it is very fine and thin.  </li>
            <li> (I have long, thick, fine hair)</li>
            <li> The comments are very helpful if you do want to go down that route.</li>
            <li> So it takes a little more effort than your usual store bought conditioner that you can just squeeze from a bottle.</li>
            <li> You use far less and there is no waste!  </li>
            <li> ACV was making my hair dry, this leaves it silky and soft.</li>
            <li> When I used less conditioner my hair was still VERY tangled and stuck.</li>
            <li> I usually pump a tiny bit of conditioner into my palm and work into my hair right before I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I love the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap series, but soap scum discouraged me from soap-shampooing with hard water at where I live .  </li>
            <li> My hair actually feels dry while it is in, but once I rinse it out and get out of the shower, my hair will end up looking and feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Caution: This product will burn you eyes, so keep your head looking down and apply it to the top of the head and comb it through (long hair) or rub it through for a few seconds until (my routine) then rinse off, including face, viola!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be aware that the switch did make my hair feel different in a very odd way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be aware that the switch did make my hair feel different in a very odd way.</li>
            <li> and I have fine, thin shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I even tried super diluting the magic soap and dumping a whole bottle on vinegar on my head, still came out nasty.</li>
            <li> For fear of drying my hair out again, I was using too little of the shampoo and letting the rinse sit on my hair, which made my hair really greasy.</li>
            <li> I definitely wouldn&#x27;t use it on kids as it really hurts if you get it in your eyes or if you have any little cuts on your body.</li>
            <li> my own a shampoo to make my thin, curly hair a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I usually just let my hair dry overnight while I&#x27;m sleeping because I like the natural wavy look of my hair,but  I&#x27;m sure the curlier nature of my hair would come back if I dried it with a diffuser or scrunched it and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I have thin blonde hair that gets greasy and flat very quickly</li>
            <li> This left my hair actually feeling clean without feeling dry and dull.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad, but it isn&#x27;t good.</li>
            <li> My hair felt greasy and did not look good at all.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, bad smell, burnt scalp, greasy hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long straight dark hair.  </li>
            <li> On top of the way this product left my hair, it&#x27;s extremely awkward to use as far as the diluting in the shower process goes.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I&#x27;m just a bit more casual than others, but I have found it to be manageable.</li>
            <li> For major highlights I just leave it in and don&#x27;t rinse it and then let it air dry in the sun.</li>
            <li> I only use a small amount, leave it on for a few minutes in the shower, and it rinses out easily.</li>
            <li> (the lemon is to abrasive for long term use), and as an after shampoo conditioner, which left my hair very sticky and matted, and generally left my hair a mess.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair and was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to comb it out, but it wasn&#x27;t a problem!</li>
            <li> And it really didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair - still a dry mess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strange that a few minutes of rinsing would make that much of a difference, but I&#x27;m telling you to give this a try before you throw it in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This does not happen with a 1:3 part white vinegar rinse (white instead of cider because of the grey).  </li>
            <li> (She talks about Dr. Bronner&#x27;s so much that before I knew it was a brand, I was getting a little jealous of this guy!)</li>
            <li> The first week I my hair did look a little oily, but into the second week my hair is not greasy or weighed down at all even on the third day!  </li>
            <li> Without it my hair would feel funny and stiff while it was wet.  </li>
            <li> I switched from using traditional shampoos and conditioners because every brand I tried left my hair either too dry or too oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent my whole life using half a bottle of conditioner in order to tame my hair, so I started with the high end of their recommendations.</li>
            <li> I tried vinegar, but it doesn&#x27;t condition my long hair well enough.</li>
            <li> She said it didn&#x27;t de-tangle her [long] hair enough.</li>
            <li> considering how long it will last.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have waist length hair, and I recently started using Bronner&#x27;s lavender castille soap as shampoo, mainly because I&#x27;m too lazy to buy both a shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> so it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t typically think I have a sensitive head or anything</li>
            <li> After 3 months of trying this routine out, my hair was left feeling as dry as straw</li>
            <li> That obviously leaves my hair feeling weird and gross, but clean.</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with different &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; recipes and my hair was so tangly and dry feeling with the vinegar conditioner.</li>
            <li> I found that if I only rinse for a few seconds, my hair feels amazingly soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Although using this product from the bottle without diluting does not work for me as well as diluting it with water first, it has plenty of acidicness so that only a small amount (think dime or nickel size diameter in your palm) is needed for a typical man&#x27;s head of hair.</li>
            <li> The smell is a little overpowering, but it does make hair soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li> My skin has also been much less dry after switching to natural shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Go to CVS and buy something that costs less than half as much and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyway I dilute that to a mixture of about half soap and half water, which I find creates loads of suds and is easier than just using straight soap.</li>
            <li> The smell is half good (citrus) and half not good (not sure).</li>
            <li> My only recommendation is let your hair dry, air dry or blow dry before brushing.</li>
            <li> I say \\&quot;suspect\\&quot; because I don&#x27;t smell it on a day to day basis, and no one has told me my hair stinks, but if I am hot and/or sweaty, sometimes I smell it.&lt;br /&gt;-for the citrus conditioning rinse, be careful, because it really stings if you get it in your eyes or on open cuts.</li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve been trying a mixture of this with apple cider vinegar, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> Left a strange residue on my hair, also made my hair extremely tangled and flat.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the smell bothers me long after the shower.  </li>
            <li> It did have a strange smell to it.</li>
            <li> To call this product conditioner is a joke, It does not condition at all, but made my long curly hair so unmanageable, that I had to use another conditioner afterwards, to get through with a comb.</li>
            <li> thing for a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;EXCELLENT - as long as the pH is tested.</li>
            <li> mix a few capfuls of the rinse with water in an old conditioner bottle, and then pour about 1/4 of the bottle over my hair.</li>
            <li> and I have wavy long blond hair.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d appreciate it if it came pre-diluted, and preferably at the same consistency as the soap (instead of having the viscosity of water, which is harder to work through your hair).&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a guy with long hair)</li>
            <li> Bonus: by diluting the conditioner and putting it in a squirt bottle rather than a cup, it lasts a really long time.  </li>
            <li> I keep an empty body wash bottle (size of a Bath&amp;Bodyworks bottle) in the shower to dilute the conditioner (I can just use a tiny amount of soap and dilute it during each shower, so no extra bottle for that), put a cap-full of the conditioner in the empty bottle and fill the rest with water.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying this in hopes it will get that waxy build-up out of your hair that Bronners soap leaves then give up now (&amp; go read my long review on Bronners Peppermint 32 oz</li>
            <li> I tried it because we are working on turning our shower water into grey water for the garden</li>
            <li> As a conditioner, I didn&#x27;t find that it did enough for my thick, coarse, afro-textured hair (I&#x27;m natural, not relaxed).</li>
            <li> My hair wasn&#x27;t stringy but it had a very strange texture-- not very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very curly and sometimes frizzy hair, so shampooing with just Dr. Bronner&#x27;s makes it dry and hard to comb without breaking.  </li>
            <li> I expected my hair to be tangled and dry after using this, but nothing could be further from the truth</li>
            <li> you may need to try out different amounts of product and whether to use it on wet, damp, or dry</li>
            <li> used to wash my hair every single evening and had done so for as long as I can remember --</li>
            <li> The smell and color may take some getting used to, but I personally don&#x27;t find it as offensive as some of the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I have drier hair due to bleach so for me this adds just enough moisture without leaving my hair greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with very thick, very curly</li>
            <li> My hair felt brittle and dry.</li>
            <li> These soaps make my hair dry.</li>
            <li> Squeeze dry your hair and then let air do the rest.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair dry, sticky, fuzzy and can&#x27;t be untangled.</li>
            <li> However, that requires conditioner or it leaves my hair too dry.</li>
            <li> , I just let it air dry</li>
            <li> when blow dry my hair, I notice the volume and the body my hair now has.</li>
            <li> I towel dry</li>
            <li> If youdon&#x27;t use conditioner, the castile soap will dry out your hair.</li>
            <li> I use a soap nut shampoo and it leaves my hair quite dry</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t put my fingers through it, it was so tangled and dry.</li>
            <li> This remaining oil helps to moisturize my hair after it&#x27;s dry.  </li>
            <li> Of course if you have cuts or a dry scalp it&#x27;s going to sting a bit.  </li>
            <li> I had been using Dr Bronner&#x27;s castile soap to wash my hair without any conditioning, and my hair was dry and tangly.</li>
            <li> FWIW, I have shoulder length straight hair that is thin (the individual hairs are) but plentiful.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, thick naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I let it air dry and didn&#x27;t put a single styling product in it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes because I love Bronner&#x27;s soap, but this stuff is weird and globby, too concentrated, and made my hair super greasy and heavy feeling. :(</li>
            <li> However, it does have an odor that I&#x27;m not particularly fond of.  </li>
            <li> Even if I rinsed with water in the end, the smell would return if my head got slightly sweaty or if it was humid outside.  </li>
            <li> The smell is odd and probably would have made me sick when I was pregnant but doesn&#x27;t bother me too much now.</li>
            <li> This product lasted 5 months with my family of 4 which 3 of us have long hair and wash our hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third week of transitioning from conventional shampoos/conditioners, but I already know that I will keep doing this for the foreseeable future merely because my skin feels so much</li>
            <li> only did it burn my scalp for less than the &#x27;30 sec&#x27;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very long (middle of my back) so hard to keep in shape.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get use to, because the feel in the shower is different than chemical conditioners.</li>
            <li> Flushed it down the toilet.</li>
            <li> its a vicious cycle but obviously a great business model.</li>
            <li> Regular products give me chemical induced rashes, natural products usually leave me with limp hair and lots of build up, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Citrus Hair Conditioning Rinse is the solution!    </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t what I expected for a conditioning rinse.</li>
            <li> Just put some in an empty bottle and add water.</li>
            <li> few Internet searches later</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t feel like there is any residue left, unlike when I tried Aveda shampoo and conditioner a few days</li>
            <li> Please be careful when you buy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few tests, it turns out that only maybe about 2-3 drops of DrB Rinse +</li>
            <li> so I guess that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend pre-diluting this product unless you have an opaque, closed container.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this product is not diluted to save money and plastic waste (yay) or because it changes the composition of the product, so you may want to look into that, but my bet is on the former.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend did not really like it.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly but is also thick and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> only issue is that because my hair is so thick, I actually keep a bit of conditioner in my hair.  </li>
            <li> There is also a moisturizer left behind that leaves hair soft and non static-y.</li>
            <li> It is citrusy but in a natural organic way if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner actually spent time in mental institutions!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for natural products, but this one was a major fail for me.</li>
            <li> The moral of the story is PLEASE do not write this off completely if you hate it the first time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard lots of times that people either love or hate this product, and I think it just comes down to personal hair</li>
            <li> The combo smell was odd, but strangely compatible!</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product because I prefer to use natural and organic products, but the shampoo and conditioner are seriously horrid.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again, but it is a little strange.</li>
            <li> Now, I rinse my hair under water long enough for me to comb through my hair again, so it still feels a little slick.  </li>
            <li> Even when I tried it with very little water, it still did not condition my hair well enough to get a comb through it.</li>
            <li> have tailbone-length dark blonde/light brown hair that is slightly wavy, not color treated, and about 1/4 grey.  </li>
            <li> I wash my hair every other day.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other folks about using the vinegar method.</li>
            <li> This hair rinse works extremely well when paired with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castille soap.  </li>
            <li> This did sort of tingle on my skin due to the citrus acid in it</li>
            <li> Some other people on here are saying &amp;#34;OMG it smells of garbage!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> use a very small amount will last a long time.</li>
            <li> and it does not stick around in my hair as other reviews state.</li>
            <li> I use all of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s other products and would give everyone of them 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> It does the job that the other products do and without the harmful chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Other stuff I&#x27;ve tried include Kiehls and DevaCurl - both are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, this stuff does work, but I still need other things</li>
            <li> I usually wash my hair w/ actual shampoo about once per month, with just water rinses in between.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a pretty color and it doesnt smell all perfumey.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t remember when I&#x27;ve been more disappointed in a purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used other Dr. Bronner products containing ingredients with, shall we say a &amp;#34;distinctive&amp;#34;  odor (e.g. Tea Tree Oil)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price, it is like other Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products, it is concentrate and you need to dilute it 1 part rinse to 20 parts water</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: This will make your hair lighter over time due to the citrus in the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the reason I&#x27;m leaving this review is to give other users a tip.</li>
            <li> I use about one bottle-full (or one capful of concentrate) a week, and I wash my hair every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other reviewers have mentioned burning/stinging.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have issues with it globbing up, I mixed it in a small water bottle with a spout and shook it well.</li>
            <li> I personally see that my hair gets a little too oily by the end of the day, so I may also try reducing down to half a cap-full and see if that helps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Being that this is my first Dr. Bronner&#x27;s purchase, I honestly do not know if this one product is supposed to be this way (I seriously doubt it) or if someone tampered with it.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair as do both of my girls and our hair was a tangle mess with only Dr. Bronner shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Dr Bronner is one of my favorite brands, so I was really surprised at how horrible this product is.  </li>
            <li> The reason for me switching from conventional products was due to having skin irritations on my scalp, so this didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I rinsed very thoroughly, and it left my hair feeling awful, almost like it had a sticky residue on it.</li>
            <li> I used to wash/ condition my hair every other day with Alba, or deal with oily, slicked down hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was sticking together, getting dry and feeling stiff.</li>
            <li> After drying my hair it was still stiff and dry.</li>
            <li> It is not meant for use with conventional shampoos.</li>
            <li> This is because your hair is transitioning from conventional to organic.</li>
            <li> The castile soap did make my hair feel a little bit tight and dry, but then I conditioned with the Citrus Conditioning Hair Rinse -</li>
            <li> I actually have been on a baking soda/water wash regimen for my very thick, curly, long hair for about 4 months now....</li>
            <li> Not sure whether it was due to the soap or my dry skin conditions.</li>
            <li> While the smell that others complained of didn&#x27;t bother me, the product itself left a lot wanting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a hideous dark reddish brown in color.  </li>
            <li> i have long hair (past my shoulders)</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product, but a little disappointed when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I did give it a few tries but will never use this again.</li>
            <li> This rinse smells too sour and meaty</li>
            <li> I also couldn&#x27;t keep it from running somewhat down my face at some point.</li>
            <li> It just washes down my drain.</li>
            <li> I even wore my hair in a ponytail for work, wore it up all day, and then took it down when I went to sleep.</li>
            <li> I even wore my hair in a ponytail for work, wore it up all day, and then took it down when I went to sleep.</li>
            <li> Weighs down my hair...and gives it a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> He used to have unruly Harry Potter hair that was weighed down by conditioners.</li>
            <li> I cant wait to try the other fragrances!</li>
            <li> It left my hair dull, heavy, and greasy.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt greasy and did not look good at all.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, bad smell, burnt scalp, greasy hair, expensive.</li>
            <li> When you do use it, pour a capful and a half into a 8-10oz plastic waterbottle in the shower.</li>
            <li> It still has a slight organic smell to it</li>
            <li> At this point I typically use anywhere from 1/8 to 1/4 of a capfull of the concentrate with about a cup of water.</li>
            <li> Like someone previously reviewed...like rotting oranges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It literally looks like someone opened the bottle, dumped out half, and then did their business in it.</li>
            <li> It was the stinkiest black sludge.</li>
            <li> And less falling hair -</li>
            <li> In my case, I have almost neutral pH, softened water and that is sufficient for washing out Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soaps in less than 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I think it feels healthier, thicker and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I think it feels healthier, thicker and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I started using Castile soap to wash my hair after I read that it was gentler than typical shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Once I put the rinse on I massage it into my scalp for less than 30 seconds</li>
            <li> (I use half a capful).</li>
            <li> I have noticed less frizz</li>
            <li> It helps my scalp to produce less sebum.</li>
            <li> I used this by putting about one and a half capfuls to two capfuls of water (used a travel sized shampoo bottle to mix) squirted it on my scalp and throughout my hair, massaged in scalp and hair and rinsed well</li>
            <li> however it has a slightly off putting odor.</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to get my homemade lotions right because they would make my hair oily like crazy!</li>
            <li> ; this is just not true.</li>
            <li> first disappointment came as I read the directions that instruct the user to MIX the product with water, 2 caps of conditioner to one cup of water.</li>
            <li> when switching to dr bronner&#x27;s soaps/conditioners, for the first couple weeks my hair was still looking dirty even though i had just washed it.</li>
            <li> an try it since I&#x27;m tired of all the other supposedly healthy products turning out to have bad ingredients in them.</li>
            <li> was surprised to see that this product is Dark Brown (I thought I got the wrong item, it looked like a hair dye instead)</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy, coarse hair that usually requires the use of detangling spray and leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> A friend said it turned her highlights slightly orange after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;the smell is disgusting, I understand organic products do have a certain smell because of the natural ingredients, but this product has been around for how long</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the brown color of these products scare you off, it&#x27;s not significant at all.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s brown and a little chunky),</li>
            <li> I was a little worried it would dye my hair.  </li>
            <li> I also used a little hair creme by dr. bronner, some mousse by kiss my face (Just a little), and this product in the shower after washing my hair with dr. bronner&#x27;s pepperment castile soap.</li>
            <li> I have to say the smell and color of the conditioning rinse does take a little time to get used to.  </li>
            <li> My scalp and skin have itched for years -- not overly so, but to the point where I always felt a little off.</li>
            <li> when the rinse runs into your mouth a little while showering</li>
            <li> It is a little straighter (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some complaints about little brown beads all over the tub.</li>
            <li> I have dirty blonde long very thick hair with a little natural wave to it.  </li>
            <li> I have very hard tap water that makes my hair extra tangle prone.</li>
            <li> that I had a nick on my skin rinsing down the drain!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hate to know how much money they are they flushing down the toilet because of their nut job rants on the label.</li>
            <li> This stuff is hard to use (it&#x27;s a liquid that has to be mixed in a cup and poured slowly over your head) and BURNS like The Devil&#x27;s flames if it gets in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> friend was telling me about all the bad things in regular shampoo, so I decided to switch to all natural products.</li>
            <li> I have been on a journey to find natural hair and body care products and it has been so difficult.</li>
            <li> My hair looked and felt limp and greasy.</li>
            <li> I think this conditioner can help any curly hair with a few uses.</li>
            <li> but this doesn&#x27;t work for me or the few others that have tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell is foul...but after using it a few times in conjunction with Dr Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap, I got the feel of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too heavy.</li>
            <li> This stuff stings my scalp for a few seconds</li>
            <li> or so otherwise my hair gets too dried out.  </li>
            <li> Bronners shampoos and the leave-in conditioner, but this conditioning hair rinse is not what it implies or at least what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Mix a few table spoons in 4 cups of water , yes you want to dilute it.  </li>
            <li> it was an epic fail.  </li>
            <li> I spray a few squirts onto my scalp and</li>
            <li> then a few onto my ends then massage it all in and leave it for a few minutes before rinsing it out.  </li>
            <li> Both lavender and peppermint leave my hair sweet-smelling and well-conditioned without being heavy in any way.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the few guys (with medium length hair) who uses Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products...</li>
            <li> ; so even though it made my hair feel heavy and greasy, I kept using it for about a month.  </li>
            <li> I expected this product may save me from soap scum while using a liquid soap as a shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Now it is fluffy and styles well.</li>
            <li> For those of you who don&#x27;t want to use the peroxide heavy, highlight activation sprays, \\&quot;Dr.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never use harsh chemical activators, again.</li>
            <li> I have medium textured hair (not too thick or thin) and it has a medium natural curl/wave to it.  </li>
            <li> The smell didn&#x27;t stay after rinsing my hair though, so not a huge problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bronner&#x27;s\\&quot; conditioning hair rinse is a less harsh option (and no brassy tones!)</li>
            <li> Using this rinse helps my hair stay softer and less frizzy!</li>
            <li> The smell on this stuff is unbearable!!!!!!!I had to use two capfuls due to hard water</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say that the first time I used the conditioner I was a little shocked that the liquid was brown.</li>
            <li> Not only did it make my just shaved legs burn because of the citrus, it smelled gross, and was impossible to  fully rinse out, leaving my hair a very odd texture.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get that super silky feel to your hair that you get from regular conditioners, but that just means that you are not putting terrible chemicals on your hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin wavy dry hair and when I use this, I don&#x27;t put any products or style it afterwards</li>
            <li> (For reference I have thick, slightly wavy hair.)  </li>
            <li> But be careful if you have any open areas or it will sting like mad if you use this.</li>
            <li> I really like Dr. B&#x27;s soaps, so thought I would give this a shot - bad decision.  </li>
            <li> It has lemon juice in it so too much can be bad..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually try conditioners, but I figured I would try it.</li>
            <li> Sadly,it left my hair weirdly matted and sort of feeling like coconut fibers.  </li>
            <li> :-/</li>
            <li> Directions on it were too small for me to read</li>
            <li> And the smell is awful to top it.  </li>
            <li> The citrus smell is not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> I tried the conditioning rinse this past week</li>
            <li> I usually use baking soda and ACV-rinse to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> conditioning rinse is, hands-down, the most disgusting thing I&#x27;ve ever put in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what this product is supposed to look like, but what I found inside almost made me vomit.</li>
            <li> but I still have a small mark on my finger from this incident.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Would not use again and not sure what I am going to do with the rest of the bottle.</li>
            <li> for about the past month, i&#x27;ve been using dr bronner&#x27;s hair conditioning rinse after washing my hair with dr bronner&#x27;s shikakai lavendar body soap followed by dr bronner&#x27;s lavendar leave-in conditioning creme.</li>
            <li> No more problems with oily hair</li>
            <li> No more problems with oily hair</li>
            <li> Rinsed well when I was done and to my amazement no more oily coated hair.</li>
            <li> Stay green!</li>
            <li> No, my hair does not smell like a salad, the scent evaporates when it dries, even if I don&#x27;t rinse it out, but I usually do rinse it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because it has citrus in it, I&#x27;ve noticed my wife&#x27;s hair lightening up a bit (turning a lighter shade of auburn than it usually is) in the sunshine.</li>
            <li> Comb some of the concentrated rinse on areas you&#x27;d like to see highlighted, spend a few hours in the sun and presto! California dreamin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair with baking soda and usually rinse with a 50/50 of apple cider vinegar and water.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get past it.</li>
            <li> The main problem with this product was that, as a sufferer of seborheic dermatitis, the lemon/citrus stung my scalp so badly that I can&#x27;t continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to have to switch up my potentially-long term routine merely because I grew tired of my natural hair color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what purpose the conditioning rinse serves because it leaves my hair hard to even run my fingers into; but the Lav-Coco Leave-In Conditioner helped to comb through my hair.</li>
            <li> Smells awful and strong.</li>
            <li> it will be easier, cheaper, and less irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick, difficult to manage hair and this just doesn&#x27;t cut it.</li>
            <li> (learned that the hard was just yesterday).</li>
            <li> It made my hair extremely hard to comb through.  </li>
            <li> We have really hard water</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad, but it is a little different.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t bad, but it is a little different.</li>
            <li> lemons kinda, but not a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Even strange for me... it smells like an orange that&#x27;s just going bad and looks like some sort of dark jelly like an apple or fig jelly...</li>
            <li> I would suggest bringing a travel comb in your purse for the transition period (a month or so, at least for me</li>
            <li> My curly hair loves the extra oils, but it does tend to look dirty eventually.  </li>
            <li> It is free of nasty chemicals and works to detangle my hair</li>
            <li> I am in my 20s and my hair suddenly went crazy on me no matter what I tried shampoo or conditioner</li>
            <li> I have moderately thick, curly hair, and I&#x27;ve been doing the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It is a really thick liquid</li>
            <li> Just pour it in my hair slowly and rub it in then rinse.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell bad but it just leaves my hair stiff.  </li>
            <li> Right after my hair was highlighted, it dried it out terribly.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed to get such a bad product for this much money.</li>
            <li> I thought the other reviews complaining about the smell were exaggerated</li>
            <li> I mean it.</li>
            <li> Gosh I hate to give a bad review, especially with the company that I adore so much.  </li>
            <li> This stuff isn&#x27;t bad, but it does seem to leave a bit of a coating that feels slimy and dulls my hair a little.  </li>
            <li> Well, it may not be on this product, but those who are looking for a resolution to prevent soap scum with hard water may not want to try this only to be disappointed like me.</li>
            <li> This was a local store and it smelled bad there.  </li>
            <li> The way it feels isn&#x27;t bad -- it&#x27;s just different.</li>
            <li> because if I didn&#x27;t wash it every single evening, it felt greasy and looked awful the very next day.</li>
            <li> I was so sad when I still felt the hard texture of soap scum.  </li>
            <li> My hair is left feeling stringy, tangled, and simply terrible when still wet.</li>
            <li> The smell is really disgusting fortunately when your hair dries it just leaves a faint orange smell.</li>
            <li> It smells terrible, and it left my hair feeling oily, limp, and dull.</li>
            <li> I thought it was awful the first time I used it in the shower, but when I got out and did my hair</li>
            <li> But...the citrus is totally overpowered by a rank smell reminiscent of bad BO.  </li>
            <li> Now regarding the smell of the product, I thought it smelled horrible at first, and the concentrate certainly is worse than the diluted product.  </li>
            <li> Im not very happy about this and will never buy another product from AmericaRx!</li>
            <li> I have wavy very Thick Spanish/Hispanic Hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells awful, stings the skin, and does not detangle regardless of how or how little water is mixed with the product (tried variations).</li>
            <li> Smell&#x27;s really not that bad.</li>
            <li> With the product being so thin, it just ran through my hair.</li>
            <li> The whole Bronner&#x27;s hair care line is awful.</li>
            <li> I have thin wavy hair, all this did was make it greasy and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> what have you and it kept getting worse after each wash.</li>
            <li> It was not great for my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The hair conditioning rinse is a bit shocking to look at straight from the bottle.</li>
            <li> I took a whiff of the product and it smelled like a mixture of citrus and human feces (very disturbing!).</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant buying this because of the reviews about it smelling bad.</li>
            <li> I poured a bit in to the cap and it was a disgusting mixture of very dark brown (think motor oil) and dark brown chunks of something.</li>
            <li> The smell is so bad, I have to hold my breath when it&#x27;s on my head, but even if I could get past that...</li>
            <li> I sort of expect salon products to smell bad and be hard to use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind it was a weird texture</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is this weird brown clumpy consistency.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I tried diluting it thinking that would help, but sadly, it did not.  </li>
            <li> Also I had a terrible burning sensation on my back, where it came in contact with my skin.</li>
            <li> : unfortunately, the transition period that I mentioned below just never went full-circle for me.</li>
            <li> Fail and fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> which made it difficult to evenly distribute throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> but they are like expensive perfume compared to this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I wish it left my hair not smelling awful though.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s Eco-friendly and you don&#x27;t have to feel guilty anymore</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t feel so guilty when pressing snooze 3x.&lt;br /&gt;-Love</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t that expensive</li>
            <li> Like everyone else said - this stuff is kinda weird.</li>
            <li> This stuff smelled so bad and was so thin, I couldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> Just horrible, sorry I wasted the money.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use it with the Castile soap as that made my hair a nasty mess.</li>
            <li> WORST, a little dab did nothing, and a couple of tablespoons also did nothing--</li>
            <li> to, is/are how crazy he and his family are/was.</li>
            <li> This stuff is crazy.</li>
            <li> It had the weight &amp; softness of my hair when I don&#x27;t wash it for a day or two, but without the dirty, oiliness.</li>
            <li> , it always made my hair feel heavy and leave a nasty residue.  </li>
            <li> I am not to crazy about the smell......</li>
            <li> It was very thin and runny (that&#x27;s even BEFORE diluting!)</li>
            <li> I know that they have bad things in them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically concentrated lemon juice with some conditioning oils in it, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so bad.  </li>
            <li> also if you have any break outs on your face or cuts on your hand, using this conditioner will sting bad.</li>
            <li> Was it as bad as I anticipated?</li>
            <li> If you use this stuff you will leave the house smelling like you have a bad case of swamp a</li>
            <li> DO NOT GET IN YOUR EYES, stings so badly.</li>
            <li> However it is an ugly color and often quite lumpy.</li>
            <li> I smells atrocious...</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> This is a really really horrible and unfortunate combination of color and texture.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the smell:( and its too humbug to have to dilute to use</li>
            <li> And honestly, I hate the smell</li>
            <li> It softens and de-tangles the crap out of my always knotted hair.</li>
            <li> I hate returning stuff</li>
            <li> I kinda hate this stuff.</li>
            <li> , Holy hell, remember to close your eyes when you&#x27;re rinsing with this stuff unless you want to be screaming bloody murder in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, the product looks ugly, but who cares?!  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in product.</li>
            <li> but I will be re-selling the two pack I bought - very disappointed</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find anything that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel horrible.</li>
            <li> In the shower, it feels awful hahah.</li>
            <li> Truly disgusting.  </li>
            <li> Horrible stuff, smells terrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible... does not condition hair in the slightest.  </li>
            <li> I read all of these reviews about how a person&#x27;s hair looked absolutely horrible for a month, etc, etc -- and I haven&#x27;t found that.</li>
            <li> Just be mindful -- it wasn&#x27;t overly awful</li>
            <li> Citrus Rinse itself does have a stronger citrus smell, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s absolutely horrific</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>
            <li> It was horrible.</li>

            <li> My hair felt and looked terrible after using them.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible.  </li>
            <li> , this conditioner just doesn&#x27;t do its job and smells awful!!</li>
            <li> The worst was the reaction of skin on my face if some would accidentally get on it.</li>
            <li> Tried &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method and it was awful.</li>
            <li> However, the smell and texture was disgusting.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve tried and tried to use this as all I use in my home is Dr. Bronners, but it&#x27;s just awful.  </li>
            <li> but no matter what I tried it came out horrific.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE stuff.</li>
            <li> It also smells nasty.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so disgusting.</li>
            <li> Tried it for a month &amp;#34;to get used to it&amp;#34; and it was awful.</li>
            <li> It was awful for my hair.</li>
            <li> Real bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this stuff. I mix it with water in a spray bottle and spray all over my hair after washing with Dr Bronner&#x27;s citrus shampoo. I comb out my hair before rinsing it out during my shower. My hair is easy to comb through and smooth. Makes my hair look really healthy. It has helped my dyed hair color stay fresh and it doesn&#x27;t fade. My hairstylist has noticed as well.</li>
            <li> I love all Bronner&#x27;s products so I decided to try this; I won&#x27;t buy any more products containing toxic ingredients for me or my house, so switching to Bronner soaps was a natural. . This conditioner works extremely well on my fine hair. I only use a small amount, leave it on for a few minutes in the shower, and it rinses out easily. I even like the somewhat earthy aroma. Fantastic, simple, natural winner from Dr. Bronner!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I only use Bronner&#x27;s liquid castille soap on my hair and rinse with this product. Otherwise my psoriasis acts up. I tried vinegar, but it doesn&#x27;t condition my long hair well enough. Love this!</li>
            <li> I have not been on a chemical-free regiment for my hair for about 3 years and this is perfect. ACV was making my hair dry, this leaves it silky and soft. Smell&#x27;s really not that bad.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually try conditioners, but I figured I would try it. Great fragrance. Not a slick feel. Feels good.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this was with homemade shampoo (baking soda and water). It made my hair so greasy that I immediately shelved it. Since then, I&#x27;ve started using diluted Dr. Bronners Baby Mild Castile Soap as shampoo and this conditioner is the perfect match. My curly hair is amazingly soft, not greasy at all. So... I think it depends on what you&#x27;re using it with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because they actually use good ingredients. What a nut job this guy was personally! I don&#x27;t appreciate all the religious rants, which make no sense, on this product. Isn&#x27;t it enough to have your values represented in the ingredients and fair trade affiliation? I&#x27;m returning the product because I don&#x27;t want to support whack jobs like this and his family, who continue to keep the label as a memorial to Dr. Bronner. The only thing it&#x27;s a memorial to, is/are how crazy he and his family are/was. They would all do well to enroll in a business ethics 101 course. I&#x27;d hate to know how much money they are they flushing down the toilet because of their nut job rants on the label. Dr. Bronner actually spent time in mental institutions!  What a shame, I actually wanted to buy this product.  http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/dr-bronner-s-crazy-ass-magic-soap-labels-18606</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner, smells like real lemons and my fine hair is left silky and tangle free</li>
            <li> I have been on a journey to find natural hair and body care products and it has been so difficult. My hair did NOT like this conditioning rinse at all. I tried using it for over 2 weeks and the results were the same. My hair felt brittle and dry. I liked the way it smelled. I didn&#x27;t mind it was a weird texture and I had to dilute it. It did de-tangle my hair, but it made my hair feel so crappy. I have really great hair when I use regular Dove shampoo and conditioner. My hair is soft and has a lot of body. I don&#x27;t want to use these types of products I know that they have bad things in them. I&#x27;ve gotten my own lotion down to a science and love the way natural lotions make my skin feel. I&#x27;m still so worried about soap and and conditioner. I can&#x27;t find anything that doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel horrible. I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lemon soap for my wash, for cleaning, for everything BUT MY HAIR. I can&#x27;t use any of these products on my hair and it makes me really upset. The brand is great, they use great natural ingredients that make me feel good about what I&#x27;m buying. But my hair just can&#x27;t do it. It took me a long time to get my homemade lotions right because they would make my hair oily like crazy! These soaps make my hair dry. I don&#x27;t know what to do.</li>
            <li> So many reviews that state this product is &#x27;smelly&#x27; and &#x27;gross&#x27;.  It is ALL NATURAL and Environment Friendly.  I use this every morning to manage my &#x27;mop&#x27;.  I am Red Headed and according to my School Teacher who was checking hair thickness from Blondes to Brunettes and of course the Brunettes were much thicker but since I was there and have Red Hair he was curious to find out if Red Hair is the same as Blonde Hair (fine).  He was surprised to find that (my) Red Hair was even thicker than Brunettes.  So I&#x27;ve been fortunate that at the age of 73 years (young) that I still have a full head of hair, it&#x27;s still Red except for the temples and it is still unmanagable as ever.  I&#x27;ve used so much &#x27;Hair Gels&#x27; on it to keep it from becoming &#x27;unruly&#x27; that you&#x27;d think I owned the company. This product, 2 cap fulls in a full cup of water works like a charm (for me), not only does it give my hair a natural &#x27;sheen&#x27; but it become manageable so I don&#x27;t even have to use &#x27;hair gels&#x27; anymore.  I just wash, rinse and comb, what a time saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, the smell is pungent, I admit that but it&#x27;s a Natural smell and after rinsing it off the smell is not there any longer, actually there is a kind of a &#x27;sweet, fruity&#x27; smell (it&#x27;s hard to smell my hair, so this seems to be the smell I&#x27;m smelling).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair with TEA TREE OIL SOAPs by Dr. Bronner and Rinse it with this product and it&#x27;s very economical, recommended is ONE CAP FULL to a warm CUP OF WATER (long hair solution).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised to see that this product is Dark Brown (I thought I got the wrong item, it looked like a hair dye instead) but after reading the instructions and applying it, I was hooked.  It worked, all natural, good for the Environment and smells natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered another one to keep handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution: This product will burn you eyes, so keep your head looking down and apply it to the top of the head and comb it through (long hair) or rub it through for a few seconds until (my routine) then rinse off, including face, viola!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works wonderfully with Dr. Bronners Liquid Castille Soap.</li>
            <li> Ugh! This stuff smelled so bad and was so thin, I couldn&#x27;t use it. I was very disappointed in product.</li>
            <li> I have tried shampooing my hair with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Soap and using the Citrus Hair Rinse as a conditioner. I have very fine chin length hair. The soap did not work well for me. My hair looked and felt limp and greasy. I decided to try using the Citrus Hair Rinse alone. I love it. My hair looks so shiny and bouncy. My scalp has never felt better. I use a cap full in a measuring cup of water. I massage it into my hair for about 1 minute. I wash my hair every other day. After towel drying I use a tiny amount of the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap, so I was very excited to try this Conditioning rinse. I have very long, thick, difficult to manage hair and this just doesn&#x27;t cut it. Even when I tried it with very little water, it still did not condition my hair well enough to get a comb through it.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff for my shoulder length curly hair. I get more complements on my hair when I use it.     Yes, most of the negative reviews are accurate. It does burn my neck if I use it after shaving, I do wish I didn&#x27;t have to mix it with water, and the smell is on the strong side but those aren&#x27;t that important! The important thing is that after I use this conditioner and let my hair air dry, I have large separate curls. My hair doesn&#x27;t look frizzy and it looks good the next day too.     I think this conditioner can help any curly hair with a few uses. My wife who sometimes straightens her hair didn&#x27;t think it was worth the work but I think she just undid all the benefits by straightening.     When you do use it, pour a capful and a half into a 8-10oz plastic waterbottle in the shower. This makes it easy to mix and use. I leave it on for a while and then rinse. Squeeze dry your hair and then let air do the rest.</li>
            <li> Be warned: This conditioning rinse is OPAQUE BROWN. I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin, but some herbal/plant fragrances bother me, and I don&#x27;t want super chemical either. I wanted a nice-smelling conditioner that wasn&#x27;t likely to cause an allergic reaction, and I really like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s other products. However, the rinse is dark brown--not very appetizing--and it is also supposed to be mixed with water to a certain consistency. The smell is half good (citrus) and half not good (not sure). I&#x27;ll stick with Free and Clear.</li>
            <li> I really like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps - and I wanted to like this conditioner. It makes my hair feel good - and you need very little of it to do the job. HOWEVER, ouch! it seems to be too strong for my scalp and tingles or burns me a bit.  I don&#x27;t typically think I have a sensitive head or anything but this doesn&#x27;t work for me or the few others that have tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would HIGHLY recommend not using this AFTER you shave. That didn&#x27;t feel good either :-)</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! It smells like something that I&#x27;d put together in my kitchen, but the difference is that it actually works and makes my hair do wonderful things.  I have very curly and sometimes frizzy hair, so shampooing with just Dr. Bronner&#x27;s makes it dry and hard to comb without breaking.  The rinse counters this effect and is GREAT at detangling.  I was very surprised. I easily combed through my knots after using the rinse with less hair getting caught in my comb.  It also leaves my hair smelling spectacular.</li>
            <li> Well, first things first, I don&#x27;t like having to mix the rinse with water every time I need to condition...call me lazy! Also, the citrus smell is almost overwhelming, but at least citrus is a pleasant smell. As a conditioner, I didn&#x27;t find that it did enough for my thick, coarse, afro-textured hair (I&#x27;m natural, not relaxed). With the product being so thin, it just ran through my hair. I suppose I need something thicker, like a cream conditioner, that will actually sit in my hair and condition. After shampooing with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castille soap, you really need a good conditioner to soften up the hair again. I could notice some difference after using this product, but it wasn&#x27;t nearly enough to suit my needs. It may work better for hair that is less coarse, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> The FDA has allowed so many harmful chemicals in our personal care products the only way to be safe is to check the ingredients of all your bath products. Many of these chemicals have been banned from food, but in the FDA&#x27;s infinite stupidity they let you put them on your body where they are absorbed through your skin!!!      Dr Bronners products are all natural and this hair conditioner is excellent.  It makes my whole scalp tingle, they even warn you of this. You must keep it out of your eyes because it will sting.     If people want their health back you MUST go organic and this Hair product works great for me.</li>
            <li> I use Dr. Bronners Tea Tree Oil (diluted) for shampoo and face &amp; body wash.  I really wanted this stuff to complete my regimen but it just doesn&#x27;t work for me.  I tried lots of ways of mixing and applying, but nope, does not work.  Plus, the smell bothers me long after the shower.  I normally love earthy smells, so I was surprised at how much I disliked it.  The bottle is pretty small too for the price.</li>
            <li> The smell is foul...but after using it a few times in conjunction with Dr Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap, I got the feel of it. It&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
            <li> This stuff is crazy. I love that it is organic. I love the way my hair feels and looks after I get out of the shower. In the shower, it feels awful hahah. It does not leave your hair easy to comb. It smells strongly of citrus, and if you have any skin abrasions anywhere it is gonna STING. I thought it was awful the first time I used it in the shower, but when I got out and did my hair...amazing. So, I would recommend if you are only interested in the final product. I have coarse, thick naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff has saved my scalp! Regular products give me chemical induced rashes, natural products usually leave me with limp hair and lots of build up, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Citrus Hair Conditioning Rinse is the solution!    I have fine, straight hair with very little body and an extremely sensitive scalp. Every morning I use an undiluted nickle to quarter-sized dollop of this conditioner, rub it evenly into my soaking wet hair (using a circular motion with medium pressure), rinse until it feels like it&#x27;s pretty much all out (while doing the same massaging motion), finger comb my hair and air dry. No shampoo, no mixing the goop in a cup with water, no waiting five minutes for the conditioner to \\&quot;work\\&quot;.     And the results... my hair seems thicker, shinier, has more volume, even has a little wave! My scalp doesn&#x27;t itch, there&#x27;s no build up and I&#x27;m able to wear black shirts again because my dandruff is all gone! The lemon juice has even given my hair some pretty fantastic natural highlights, although it&#x27;s true that it can cause some stinging like they warn on the bottle. I found that the stinging went away once my scalp finished healing.    The smell and color may take some getting used to, but I personally don&#x27;t find it as offensive as some of the other reviewers. I like the earthy, citrusy scent and the smell doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair. In fact, my hair smells really great after washing. I do use a natural shampoo about once a week and then follow with the conditioning rinse. The weekly shampoo makes my hair feel \\&quot;cleaner\\&quot; while still getting the benefits of just using the conditioner the rest of the time.     As if my hair and scalp being the happiest they&#x27;ve ever been wasn&#x27;t enough, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is pretty much the best body care company out there when it comes to transparency and responsibility in producing their products. I LOVE that they can proudly show the USDA organic symbol on the front of their packaging. I also love their peppermint bar soap (sorry, not a fan of the liquid) and their peppermint lip balm.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair soft and is easy to comb out. It took a little while to get use to, because the feel in the shower is different than chemical conditioners. I have long hair and was afraid I wouldn&#x27;t be able to comb it out, but it wasn&#x27;t a problem!</li>
            <li> Works good though a little runnier than I hoped for.</li>
            <li> Good buy.. Need more actually...</li>
            <li> The smell on this stuff is unbearable!!!!!!!I had to use two capfuls due to hard water and it stung everywhere that I had a nick on my skin rinsing down the drain! while my hair did come out nice and smooth, it dried really frizzy and puffy.thank god I had morroccon oil on hand to help get some of the smell out. I agree with the other folks about using the vinegar method. This stuff does smell like rotting oranges and compost trash.Thankfully, my health food store allows returns!</li>
            <li> This hair rinse works extremely well when paired with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castille soap.  It has certainly become my preferred method of hair washing.  However, it does have an odor that I&#x27;m not particularly fond of.  It doesn&#x27;t really dissipate over time, so I would strongly suggest that you rinse with water as soon as you pour this on - DO NOT let it sit/soak!  Also, air drying helps reduce the smell while using a blow dryer seems to accentuate it.  I will be trying a apple cider vinegar rise once this is used up.</li>
            <li> My heart wasn&#x27;t any shinier or smoother using this product.</li>
            <li> It smells like mildew and I don&#x27;t like the way it makes my scalp feel. It isn&#x27;t tingly, I like that, it&#x27;s more like a sting.</li>
            <li> oooops!  Dr. Bronner really screwed up on this!  It&#x27;s brown, and comes out of the bottle like mucousy poop.  Truly disgusting.  The smell ain&#x27;t that great either, though better than poop.  WORST, a little dab did nothing, and a couple of tablespoons also did nothing-- except make my hair feel like straw dipped in glue.  I didn&#x27;t want to smell like that, so I rewashed &amp; used my Giovanni Avocado &amp; Olive Oil 2chic ultra-moist conditioner, which I LOVE, and works great with a tiny amount.  Best certified organic conditioner I&#x27;ve found, and easy on the wallet.</li>
            <li> I have very curly and somewhat fine hair that tends to be frizzy without products. I started using this conditioner along with the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Organic Shikakai Body Soap on my hair and love them both. Don&#x27;t let the brown color of these products scare you off, it&#x27;s not significant at all. They work really well for me, and  they smell wonderful. I would definitely recommend this Conditioning Hair Rinse to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product lives up to it&#x27;s claim. I use a combination of coconut milk and Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Almond Castile Soap as a shampoo, and was using organic honey as a conditioner but my hair was still a bit stringy. I decided to give this stuff a try, along with the lavender leave in, and so glad I did! Not going to lie, the first time I used it I was a little frightened - the smell is overpowering (because it&#x27;s super duper concentrated), and the color/texture leaves something to be desired (it&#x27;s brown and a little chunky), but after I used it I could immediately tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you follow the directions and finger comb it through your hair before rinsing - you will notice a difference (learned that the hard was just yesterday). And keep it away from your eyes - it stings. a lot. and even if you get it near your eyes, because of the smell it may still burn.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t what I expected for a conditioning rinse. They don&#x27;t call it a &amp;#34;creme rinse&amp;#34; for a reason... it has a consistency of skim milk! And they want you to dilute a capful into a cup of cool water before slowly pouring your hair. So it takes a little more effort than your usual store bought conditioner that you can just squeeze from a bottle. It&#x27;s basically concentrated lemon juice with some conditioning oils in it, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing. It&#x27;s great for people with oily or fine hair that usual creamy conditioners weigh down.</li>
            <li> Smells good. That&#x27;s it. Does not work. I tried using more than the recommended two cap-fulls, which did nothing, and it still left my hair so dry that it crinkled.</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this because of it being a Dr Bronner product. Sadly,it left my hair weirdly matted and sort of feeling like coconut fibers.  No conditioning value at all.  I couldn&#x27;t get my Pantene conditioner on fast enough. It does burn the scalp a bit.  I did give it a few tries but will never use this again.</li>
            <li> I rated right in the middle for this conditioning rinse... After reading reviews, I tried to keep an open mind an try it since I&#x27;m tired of all the other supposedly healthy products turning out to have bad ingredients in them. It did have a strange smell to it. It&#x27;s a greyish-brown in color (almost like a clay color) and you mix a capful of it with water in a cup and pour it on your hair while trying to rub it into the hair. This did sort of tingle on my skin due to the citrus acid in it and I have sensitive skin; but the tingle left right after rinsing it off. I also couldn&#x27;t keep it from running somewhat down my face at some point. I used it in conjunction with the Lavender &amp; Coconut Hair Conditioner &amp; Styling Creme. I&#x27;m not really sure what purpose the conditioning rinse serves because it leaves my hair hard to even run my fingers into; but the Lav-Coco Leave-In Conditioner helped to comb through my hair. I gave it a try and I&#x27;ll do a bit of thinking after I&#x27;m through with this bottle to see if I&#x27;d even like to try it again. ??  :-/</li>
            <li> Some other people on here are saying &amp;#34;OMG it smells of garbage!&amp;#34; this is just not true. When you smell the bottle, it smells like oranges/lemons kinda, but not a nice smell. It isn&#x27;t bad, but it isn&#x27;t good. Once you put it in your hair and then wash it out, it smells fantastic, of orange and lemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is this weird brown clumpy consistency. It doesn&#x27;t look very good, but I think this color is caused by the  shikaki powder stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it works as intended. I&#x27;m a guy with a buzz cut and I decided to try it for mild dandruff relief. I haven&#x27;t seen a huge difference since using it, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2ish weeks.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so bad.  It is only slightly a citrus scent, but mostly a barfy scent.  And it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling soft, conditioned, or easy to comb through.  I&#x27;ll stick with any mainstream product rather than this gunk.</li>
            <li> Even strange for me... it smells like an orange that&#x27;s just going bad and looks like some sort of dark jelly like an apple or fig jelly... I was a little worried it would dye my hair.  Directions on it were too small for me to read so when a friend read that it needed to be dilluted, that KIND of made sense, but it said 1-2 caps to 1 cup of water... my hair doesn&#x27;t take an entire cup of water so.... estimated.  Works okay, but would not recommend.  Do Apple Cider Vinegar instead</li>
            <li> I followed the mixing instructions to a tee as well as the directions on how to use it. Sadly, it didn&#x27;t work for me. It left my hair feeling clumpy and full of build-up. I literally could have given myself a Mohawk with no other styling products, that&#x27;s how much build-up it left. I won&#x27;t use it again, which is a shame because it smells wonderful (if you like the citrus scent).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. When I first got it, I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like it -- it doesn&#x27;t look great and it doesn&#x27;t smell great; but wow is it great for your hair!  I expected my hair to be tangled and dry after using this, but nothing could be further from the truth, it combed easily and looked great.  You have to get over what the mainstream companies have brainwashed us into thinking what a conditioner has to be (white, creamy, full chemicals and synthetic fragrance) to use this, you have to think about what you&#x27;re looking for - a product that works and works well.  This one does that and without chemicals - yay!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tip is make up your dilution into another container a day or longer before you plan to use it.  That assures that any globs that are initially present are able to be fully resolved before you use it.</li>
            <li> light conditioner.  use a very small amount will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The rinse really makes a difference once you wash with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Majic Peppermint Hemp Oil soap.  After conditioning my hair, I use this product to seal in its effects. I have read reviews of people who just wash with the Majic Pepperming Hemp Oil and rinse with the Shikakai.  But my hair is in need of deep conditioning these days so I use a deep penetrating conditioner and use the Shikakai when rinsing out the conditioner.  My hair feels much softer and smells so good. I am so happy I&#x27;m going natural with my hair and am so grateful to have found Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> Horrible stuff, smells terrible. Makes my hair dry, sticky, fuzzy and can&#x27;t be untangled. Just horrible, sorry I wasted the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to use more natural products.  However, this one just fell way below expectations.  It smells awful, stings the skin, and does not detangle regardless of how or how little water is mixed with the product (tried variations).</li>
            <li> It is not really a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;It is made of very healthy ingredients. But doesn&#x27;t help conditioning hair.&lt;br /&gt;And also if you have any break outs on your face or cuts on your hand, using this conditioner will sting bad.</li>
            <li> My hair would feel heavier in the shower after using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap to wash it.  My hair is naturally curly but is also thick and frizzy.  But it is fine and light in texture.  Anyways, when I used this I could automatically feel the difference as I poured the diluted solution over my hair.  The shikakai powder in it is a natural detangler I have read.&lt;br /&gt;Indian women wash their hair with oil, most of the time coconut, then leave it in for hours.  Then they make a paste with shikakai powder to wash the oil out.  And look how beatiful Indian lady&#x27;s hair is!  I personally thing traditional and more simple ways to wash your hair is much better.. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also smells very orangy and good!  It still has a slight organic smell to it but I like that smell.  This was a local store and it smelled bad there.  So I do think that at the store the  product expired.  But this came smelling good. :D  My hair is shiny, bouncy, and the poofiness is gone.  I also used a little hair creme by dr. bronner, some mousse by kiss my face (Just a little), and this product in the shower after washing my hair with dr. bronner&#x27;s pepperment castile soap.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product - this is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased, and using it along with the Castile soap in place of shampoo and conditioner has completely changed my hair for the better.</li>
            <li> I bought this rinse to use with my Liggetts shampoo bar.  The combination of these two products is AMAZING.  I have very fine, long, wavy, and often frizzy hair.  I have been washing my hair with both these products every three days.  The first week I my hair did look a little oily, but into the second week my hair is not greasy or weighed down at all even on the third day!  It is wayyy less frizzy and still has nice body and actually looks thicker.  My skin has also been much less dry after switching to natural shampoo and conditioner.  I have to say the smell and color of the conditioning rinse does take a little time to get used to.  Ive noticed the best results when I leave the rinse in my hair for about 5 min before washing it out, just don&#x27;t get it in your eyes--it stings alot!</li>
            <li> I really like Dr. B&#x27;s soaps, so thought I would give this a shot - bad decision.  It comes brown and lumpy in the bottle, and smells wretched.  I tried diluting it thinking that would help, but sadly, it did not.  Do not purchase this product!</li>
            <li> I use Dr Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap as shampoo and hand soap, and I liked the conditioner as well. I have fine, medium length, and colored hair, and it disentangled my hair really well. I&#x27;m glad I found something with non-toxic ingredients that work. I didn&#x27;t have any stinging problems, and I don&#x27;t understand why some people think it&#x27;s a big deal to dilute it. Just put some in an empty bottle and add water. It&#x27;s that simple! I recommend this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap. However, that requires conditioner or it leaves my hair too dry.I tried different conditioners and they always leave my hair looking frizzier.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff leaves my hair looking and feeling good. I have thin wavy dry hair and when I use this, I don&#x27;t put any products or style it afterwards, I just let it air dry and it ends up soft, with volume, and with nice waves without frizz.&lt;br /&gt;I dilute one cap of this with water in a cup and pour it over my head and massage it into my hair. While you are in the shower, it does not feel like it is moisturizing your hair like some of those creamy conditioners do. My hair actually feels dry while it is in, but once I rinse it out and get out of the shower, my hair will end up looking and feeling soft and moisturized. This is definitely better than any conditioner I have tried before and I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying to wash your hair with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap as well, as long as you condition too. I noticed that it gives my hair much more volume and it does not get greasy so fast. The two make a great combo. I also like that they have natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love all of Dr Bonner&#x27;s stuff, but this conditioner is very heavy and sticky for thin, fine hair, even when diluted more than the instructions state.  I tried using this for several days, using it as a pre shampoo conditioner, which left my hair staticky and tangled, as a deep conditioner (the lemon is to abrasive for long term use), and as an after shampoo conditioner, which left my hair very sticky and matted, and generally left my hair a mess.  I have long blonde hair and it is very fine and thin.  This is not a product for fine hair!  It&#x27;s too heavy.</li>
            <li> I love this rinse for what it does to my hair. It makes it so smooth and silky. It really feels healthy afterward. The only,and unfortunatly for me a deal breaker, downfall is in the name. Citrus. If you use a blonding shampoo(purple shampoo) this pretty much removes all the pigment you just put in. Other than that this is a great organic option :)</li>
            <li> Terrible... does not condition hair in the slightest.  Had to wash and rewash my hair 3 times and it still wasn&#x27;t back to normal.  LOVE the soaps for body and face but DO NOT TRY TO USE ON YOUR HAIR!!!</li>
            <li> If you want to have completely unmanageable hair, this &#x27;conditioner&#x27; is for you. To call this product conditioner is a joke, It does not condition at all, but made my long curly hair so unmanageable, that I had to use another conditioner afterwards, to get through with a comb. Also I had a terrible burning sensation on my back, where it came in contact with my skin. Don&#x27;t even want to know what would have happened, if it got into my eyes. And the smell is awful to top it.  I am extremely disappointed to get such a bad product for this much money.</li>
            <li> makes hair very manageble and smooth</li>
            <li> * UPDATE 4/29/14: unfortunately, the transition period that I mentioned below just never went full-circle for me. After 3 months of trying this routine out, my hair was left feeling as dry as straw and I was never able to freely comb my hair without snarls after using the Citrus Rinse. I&#x27;m glad that I did it, though, because I really tried to give it a real chance and I learned a lot about the experience. I learned that I do prefer organic products in the bath and, because of this experiment, I&#x27;ve started to make my own laundry soap with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and my own body wash with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s. This product was my first introduction to that brand. I&#x27;m going to leave my review below, with all of the details, as others may still find it helpful. I have gone back to conventional washing, though, but feel free to ask any questions if you have any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- - - - -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Citrus Rinse, you know that this product is part of an organic haircare routine. It is not meant for use with conventional shampoos. Your reasoning for doing this may vary, but my reason for looking into organic haircare was not the health of my hair -- it was the health of my skin. My scalp and skin have itched for years -- not overly so, but to the point where I always felt a little off. After talking with someone at the office about the \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; method -- that is, where you use vinegar and baking soda to primarily wash your hair -- and doing some research on it, I really felt like it was something I could not commit to. More power to anyone who does the full-blown \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; method, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me. I like the idea of having the products readily-made and pin-pointed towards helping my hair -- not to say the \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; ideology doesn&#x27;t do that, but I didn&#x27;t really want to pursue something that required *that* much trial and error (i.e. measurements of how much baking soda worked perfectly with your hair, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few Internet searches later and I stumbled upon this Citrus Rinse. Initially, I was going to try one of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soaps in conjunction with this Citrus Rinse, but I do occasionally color my hair. I didn&#x27;t want to have to switch up my potentially-long term routine merely because I grew tired of my natural hair color. However, if you&#x27;re reading this and don&#x27;t color your hair, I fully encourage you to read Lisa Bronner&#x27;s blog post on Dr. Bronner&#x27;s site discussing this product (titled \\&quot;From Shampoo to Soap - My story\\&quot;). The comments are very helpful if you do want to go down that route. I decided to try JR Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bars with this product, because they&#x27;re safe for color-treated hair. I tried the shampoo bar alone without using this Citrus Rinse, and I preferred how my hair felt after using this Citrus Rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to wash my hair every single evening and had done so for as long as I can remember -- because if I didn&#x27;t wash it every single evening, it felt greasy and looked awful the very next day. Now, I only wash my hair on Sunday, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. This is an AMAZING fact for me -- I always thought I&#x27;d never be able to do that. I do try to give it a break over the weekend. Does it look absolutely fresh on the second and third day? Not 100%, but it is infinitely better and presentable to wear to the office. I&#x27;m on my third week of transitioning from conventional shampoos/conditioners, but I already know that I will keep doing this for the foreseeable future merely because my skin feels so much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is there a transition? Yes, absolutely. Was it as bad as I anticipated? No. I read all of these reviews about how a person&#x27;s hair looked absolutely horrible for a month, etc, etc -- and I haven&#x27;t found that. Perhaps I&#x27;m just a bit more casual than others, but I have found it to be manageable. Something very important to note, which I had to learn by trial and error: the amount of Citrus Rinse and how much you are diluting it matters. I&#x27;ve started to use one cap full and have diluted it with more water than I did the first few washes. This seemed to have made a difference. I also keep a wide-toothed comb in the shower and try to brush through my hair after the Citrus Rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I noticed during transition and tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It feels as if I&#x27;ve been swimming in the ocean after I put the Citrus Rinse on my head -- a \\&quot;crunchy, heavy\\&quot; feeling. This is because your hair is transitioning from conventional to organic. I have noticed an improvement and, with time, I think it will completely go away and be smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* When I get out of the shower, I can&#x27;t simply run my fingers through my hair, even when I try and brush with a wide-toothed comb while in the shower. This is getting better, though. I will work a brush through my hair and, when my hair dries, it is very smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* If I put my hair up at night in bed and take it down in the morning, there&#x27;s actually not such a huge \\&quot;crimp\\&quot; in my hair from wearing it up. It is much more manageable, in my opinion. I love this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I would suggest bringing a travel comb in your purse for the transition period (a month or so, at least for me that&#x27;s what it seems like it will be). I have had to brush my hair more often, since it feels differently. The way it feels isn&#x27;t bad -- it&#x27;s just different. It feels cleaner, healthier, and stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* If you&#x27;ve read the reviews, you&#x27;ve read that you may get white \\&quot;blobs\\&quot; on your scalp. This is how your hair is transitioning. I did have this, too. Just be mindful -- it wasn&#x27;t overly awful and I wasn&#x27;t embarrassed by it. I wouldn&#x27;t say anyone but you will actually notice. It&#x27;s not as if your hair looks like you&#x27;ve been walking in the snow. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Keep in mind that, if you use a lot of products in your hair, the transition may take longer. You&#x27;re going organic with your haircare, but you&#x27;re still putting a lot of build-up in your hair from all of your styling products. Just be patient and realize that you may need to tweak things a bit for your personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- - - -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine is as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Wash hair with JR Liggett&#x27;s shampoo bar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Dilute 1 cap of Citrus Rinse with large cup of water (most successful for me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Keep in hair while I use soap, shave, etc - wash out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very important to rinse thoroughly -- particularly when you are first starting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- - - -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Citrus Rinse itself does have a stronger citrus smell, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s absolutely horrific and it does not stick around in my hair as other reviews state. You may have clumps of the solution that doesn&#x27;t entirely dilute, but it&#x27;s nothing I&#x27;m concerned about. It just washes down my drain. The solution itself isn&#x27;t pure liquid -- you have to dilute it! I hope that you know that by your research. :) I haven&#x27;t had an issue with it getting into my eyes, either. I just stand where the shower isn&#x27;t streaming and pour it over my head. I then rinse off my face before I open my eyes and have never had any troubles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you really want to pursue an organic haircare routine, just be mindful of the fact that there is a transition. I personally really like how it&#x27;s going, but it&#x27;s not for everyone. I&#x27;ve also started to use a more natural skincare line called Zum, which is by a company in Kansas City (called Indigo Wild). If you have any issues with your skin, try looking into a more organic skincare routine. This is just my personal opinion, of course. :) Overall, I&#x27;m so glad I wasn&#x27;t dismayed by the bad reviews of this product and tried it out myself. I know some have had success with a pure Apple Cider Vinegar rinse with essential oils, but I&#x27;m pretty happy with trying this product first to get my hair transitioned properly -- I may try a homemade rinse down the line.</li>
            <li> You mix this with water before adding to hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a creamy conditioning rinse.&lt;br /&gt;1. I love most Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;2. This burned my scalp/skin. It was horrible. I couldn&#x27;t get it rinsed fast enough. I&#x27;ve tried it twice. I do not have sensitive skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;3. The smell is just bad.&lt;br /&gt;4. My hair felt greasy and did not look good at all.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, bad smell, burnt scalp, greasy hair, expensive. No go.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this product! I almost gave up on Dr. Bronner&#x27;s shampoo even though we like the natural aspect of it. I have long thick hair as do both of my girls and our hair was a tangle mess with only Dr. Bronner shampoo.  So this is a must buy to go hand in hand with Dr. Bronner shampoo. This product lasted 5 months with my family of 4 which 3 of us have long hair and wash our hair every other day. The citrus smell is not overwhelming at all. Going with natural products it will always have a different feel and will take time to get use to but its worth it. Our family is happy with this product!</li>
            <li> First of all, I am the biggest fan of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products!  BUT, that being said... I can&#x27;t love this product, despite how much I try!  The smell is so bad, I have to hold my breath when it&#x27;s on my head, but even if I could get past that... It actually burns my skin!  I guess it&#x27;s the citrus extracts in it, but it left red marks around my hairline.  I use all of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s other products and would give everyone of them 5 stars.  But, they need to go back to the drawing board on this one.  And it really didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair - still a dry mess.</li>
            <li> I tried this when replacing my &amp;#34;toxic&amp;#34; beauty products.  It left my hair snarled and gunked up.  I am scoring it as 2 stars because there is a chance it was user error, although I followed instructions and tried it multiple times.  I really wanted it to work, but it just did not with my fine straight hair.  I now use just an apple cider vinegar rinse and my hair looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to stay away from the harmful chemicals that most hair products have and this product is as good as any to help me with my mission.  It does the job that the other products do and without the harmful chemicals.  I&#x27;m glad this product is out there for me to use.</li>
            <li> I picked this up on a whim and I&#x27;m SO glad that I did!  I don&#x27;t use the Dr Bronners shampoo - I use JR Ligget&#x27;s bar shampoo (it&#x27;s all natural, oils only) - my hair has been in much better shape since going off of regular shampoos. But I could still do with a little more volume &amp; moisture, especially in the Winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I tried the conditioning rinse this past week and I LOVE it, so glad I found it. I have a lot of hair but it&#x27;s very fine &amp; thin. It&#x27;s also very long (middle of my back) so hard to keep in shape. The conditioning rinse immediately left my hair feeling super soft and more manageable. It had the weight &amp; softness of my hair when I don&#x27;t wash it for a day or two, but without the dirty, oiliness. I let it air dry and didn&#x27;t put a single styling product in it. No flyaways, no frizz, and it has more volume. And did I mention how SOFT it is?? I wish I&#x27;d tried this stuff ages ago. I could see how it might not be best for all hair textures, but for fine hair, it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> Make sure you dilute this stuff--it&#x27;s potent!</li>
            <li> This product suprised me. .for the good. Left my hair shinning.</li>
            <li> 1. I love most Dr. Bronner&#x27;s product.&lt;br /&gt;2. This burned my scalp/skin. It was horrible. I couldn&#x27;t get it rinsed fast enough.  I&#x27;ve tried it twice. I do not have sensitive skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;3. The smell is just bad.&lt;br /&gt;4. My hair felt greasy and did not look good at all.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, bad smell, burnt scalp, greasy hair.  No go.</li>
            <li> This stuff stings my scalp for a few seconds but I noticed my scalp has improved after about a week of applying it daily.</li>
            <li> Since I am using Dr Bronner liquid I thought I would try this as a hair rinse.  I like the smell and enjoy the feel of my hair after using it.  Without it my hair would feel funny and stiff while it was wet.  Remember to dilute!!!</li>
            <li> I have been searching and searching, looking for an all natural way to shampoo and condition my hair that will not dry it out and will not cost a fortune. THIS IS IT!&lt;br /&gt;I have nearly waist-length, wavy, fine hair that is prone to dryness. First, I washed my hair with 1:1 diluted Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint castile soap, which smells great AND lathers well (I also added some peppermint essential oil to the diluted soap for moisture). The castile soap did make my hair feel a little bit tight and dry, but then I conditioned with the Citrus Conditioning Hair Rinse - it took about 1 capful in 1/2 cup of water to do all of my hair, and I used it generously. Immediately, my hair felt soft, and it also smells great.&lt;br /&gt;My hair was so smooth and brushing it was so easy, and I noticed a definite increase in shine. It also doesn&#x27;t feel like there is any residue left, unlike when I tried Aveda shampoo and conditioner a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this product and cannot say enough about it. I have been smelling and touching my hair all day - it is just so soft! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male with very thick, very curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does work pretty well as a conditioner, so it meets that objective. My hair is detangled, not frizzy. I do like what it does to my hair. The process of squeezing out the orange goop into a cup and swirling it about, then dumping it over your hair is... interesting. The first time I got it in my eyes and it burned like hell.  Now I&#x27;m using an old shampoo bottle so I can squeeze out a thin stream and that is working much better than a cup. Oh, and it smells like orange rinds in a compost.  If that&#x27;s your thing, go for it.  I got used to the smell after the 1st few uses, but that first whiff was vomitous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that because my hair is so thick, I actually keep a bit of conditioner in my hair.  I usually pump a tiny bit of conditioner into my palm and work into my hair right before I get out of the shower. It works the same as any leave-in conditioner product.  With this Dr. Bronners stuff, you can&#x27;t really leave a bit in, or add a bit as a leave-in.  Because of this, its not enough for my hair and so I have to use more products after I get out of the shower.  I just bought the Dr. Bronners&#x27;s hair creme, also  pretty good but not a strong enough hold for me.  I might use that as my leave-in and see how it goes. Other stuff I&#x27;ve tried include Kiehls and DevaCurl - both are great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this stuff does work, but I still need other things so ultimately I don&#x27;t think this conditioner will make the final cut.</li>
            <li> I usually use baking soda and ACV-rinse to wash my hair. I tried using this one. First thing that struck me was the smell. Later when I saw the consistency I was going to throw up. But I chose not to judge it by the color or smell. I put one cap in water and rinsed my hair with it. My hair was sticking together, getting dry and feeling stiff. After drying my hair it was still stiff and dry. I tried another time with two caps, same thing happened. Disgusting. I am extremely disappointed with this product and I will not buy this again or recommend it for anyone. I&#x27;d rather use the acv-rinse, which is cheaper and actually makes my hair soft!!</li>
            <li> Love my new rinse! Package arrived intact product wonderful!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even buy this from Amazon, but I know lots of people go here to check out reviews before purchase.  I bought this on a whim.  I have moderately thick, curly hair, and I&#x27;ve been doing the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; thing for a long time.  I usually wash my hair w/ actual shampoo about once per month, with just water rinses in between.  My curly hair loves the extra oils, but it does tend to look dirty eventually.  This product is not totally hassle free - you have to dilute a cap-full of the product in a cup of water and then you pour that over your head.  Don&#x27;t use it without diluting!!!  And honestly, I hate the smell but some people love it.  Despite all that,  it leaves my hair so soft, and the curls are really pronounced.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to use shampoo even once a month, I feel like the lemon juice and orange essential oils clean my hair enough.  You know that salon clean feel your hair has after a professional shampoo?  My hair feels that amazing for days after.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have been using it on my squirmy two year old who gets the biggest snarls in the back of her hair, since I wash it at night before she goes to bed.  I used it a couple of nights ago and she woke up with baby soft, tangle-free hair.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It could be me bit I can&#x27;t seem to get the right consistency to use this properly</li>
            <li> Smells lovely and makes my hair feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I can only use it once a week or so otherwise my hair gets too dried out.  I use it in conjunction with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s baby mild soap mixed with coconut milk.</li>
            <li> came quickly, i use this to make fabric softener, it smells wonderful</li>
            <li> I have very straight long hair that needs to be washed every two days.  I do not color or chemically enhance it in any way.  I started using Bronner&#x27;s liquid Peppermint soap (diluted 1:1) as shampoo a few months ago and am very pleased with the way it cleans my hair.  However, as I age, the hair strands are getting thinner and softer, so I need a rinse that flattens the hair cuticles after cleaning so that I can comb my hair without shredding it.  Diluted vinegar works well, but this works better --  a little extra shine without oil, a wonderful smell, and nice shiny hair after combing.  One capful in a cup of water is really all I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the diluted soap and the diluted rinse in empty dishwashing liquid bottles; this allows me to use only as much as I need where I need it.  A very effective and economical combination for me.</li>
            <li> I have been going &amp;#34;no &#x27;poo&amp;#34; for about a year now but had problems with itchiness and dandruff.  This completely solved that problem, and it smells great.  Try it!!!</li>
            <li> smells so good and i feel this has healing effect :) I used this after Dr Bronner&#x27;s liquid soap as shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint for a while, and i have noticed a huge difference in my fine, short hair. my hair now has body and volume! So, I&#x27;ve been reading all the online reviews of this and decided to take the plunge. I shampoo with the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint, then follow with a capful of this in about a cup of water, and my hair is silky smooth. when blow dry my hair, I notice the volume and the body my hair now has. I haven&#x27;t air dryed my hair yet, and that will be the defining moment for me.</li>
            <li> Now this is different. You mix it with water and pour it over your hair. It&#x27;s not a pretty color and it doesnt smell all perfumey. But, It works really well.</li>
            <li> Big mistake. This stuff reeks! It&#x27;s all clumpy and gooey. Flushed it down the toilet. Usually Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are pretty good</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying that I&#x27;m a HUGE fan of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s shampoos, which I&#x27;ve used for quite some time. As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair is dryer and tends to tangle after a good wash, so I decided to try the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s conditioning rise. Yikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first disappointment came as I read the directions that instruct the user to MIX the product with water, 2 caps of conditioner to one cup of water. A pain, because I&#x27;d have much preferred a ready-to-use conditioner, but not a deal breaker. Then I noticed the smell ... something vaguely like pine sap, which is pleasant enough on cut wood, but not quite how I&#x27;d like my hair to smell. Still not a deal breaker, however. The last straw, and the reason I&#x27;ve dumped what was left in the bottle down the drain, was that after three days of using it EXACTLY according to the directions, it didn&#x27;t diminished my after-shower tangle problem at all. Not at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this is a salon item, something best used in an environment where a professional operator has mixing utensils close at hand, as well as timers and a sink into which the client&#x27;s head can be reclined. If so, the listing should indicate as much ... a disclaimer along the lines of &amp;#34;for professional use only&amp;#34; would be helpful. I sort of expect salon products to smell bad and be hard to use. All by myself in the shower, though, I need something that&#x27;s convenient to use and that relieves the tangles. Fail and fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of spending (dare I say wasting?) your money on this, I suggest you do what I&#x27;ve done, sadder but wiser. Go to CVS and buy something that costs less than half as much and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t remember when I&#x27;ve been more disappointed in a purchase.</li>
            <li> It seems to work like it&#x27;s supposed to but the smell takes some getting used to. It does help detangle and smooth my hair after using the Dr. Bronner soap.</li>
            <li> While the smell that others complained of didn&#x27;t bother me, the product itself left a lot wanting. It was very thin and runny (that&#x27;s even BEFORE diluting!) which made it difficult to evenly distribute throughout my hair. The main problem with this product was that, as a sufferer of seborheic dermatitis, the lemon/citrus stung my scalp so badly that I can&#x27;t continue to use it. To be fair, the labeling on the bottle does warn of this side effect. Still, despite that I can&#x27;t use this product even though I just bought it, I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products so I will leg this one fail slide.</li>
            <li> I try to use more natural products on my body when I can. I find that using castile soaps on my hair is a bit wanting, no matter what I mix with it, so I use an aloe-based bullcrap-free shampoo, and I chase it with this rinse. My hair is on the dry side, so after that, I do a quick spray and comb from a spray bottle with a little jojoba and sweet almond oils diluted in water. That treatment leaves my hair gorgeous, shiny and thick without being fuzzy, and strangers compliment me for it. My husband has a bit more oil to his scalp and hair and he doesn&#x27;t need the oil chaser. The earthy citrus smell is great.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be okay. I use this about once a week and combined with the peppermint soap it seems to get through the gunk from products.</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews, but this product is really easily misused, so I thought I&#x27;d chime in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have waist length hair, and I recently started using Bronner&#x27;s lavender castille soap as shampoo, mainly because I&#x27;m too lazy to buy both a shampoo and conditioner. Anyway I dilute that to a mixture of about half soap and half water, which I find creates loads of suds and is easier than just using straight soap. That obviously leaves my hair feeling weird and gross, but clean. At first I was using regular conditioner after the soap, and while it worked, I figured I would try the whole shebang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is HIGHLY concentrated. I&#x27;ve spent my whole life using half a bottle of conditioner in order to tame my hair, so I started with the high end of their recommendations. I put 1.5 cap-fulls into a cup of water, and poured it on my head. Not only did it make my just shaved legs burn because of the citrus, it smelled gross, and was impossible to  fully rinse out, leaving my hair a very odd texture. I was all set to give up and go back to regular conditioner when I accidentally used a much more diluted mix (I forgot how much I had added) and the results were SO MUCH BETTER. At this point I typically use anywhere from 1/8 to 1/4 of a capfull of the concentrate with about a cup of water. The result is soft hair that doesn&#x27;t smell, and is much easier to style than it was in my conditioner days. Ocasionally I miss the truly soft feeling of real conditioner, but then I remember trying to keep my hair in a bun without it slipping out, and I&#x27;m back to being happy with this hair rinse. The moral of the story is PLEASE do not write this off completely if you hate it the first time. Play around with the concentration. It makes a massive difference.</li>
            <li> I thought the other reviews complaining about the smell were exaggerated so I bought this anyway.  I have used other Dr. Bronner products containing ingredients with, shall we say a &amp;#34;distinctive&amp;#34;  odor (e.g. Tea Tree Oil) but they are like expensive perfume compared to this stuff.  Yes, it has a citrus content which is fine..kind of nice actually.  But...the citrus is totally overpowered by a rank smell reminiscent of bad BO.  The citrus fades but the BO smell hangs on long after your shower is complete.  I like the Dr Bronner soaps and use them regularly.  If you use this stuff you will leave the house smelling like you have a bad case of swamp a**.</li>
            <li> Smells awful and strong. Also, came opened! I think I was shipped a used/opened product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t judge the quality for others, but for my fine hair, it&#x27;s just not quite right. Shower at night and the next morning my hair feels all greasy. It&#x27;s smell is also less then wonderful and don&#x27;t ever mix it with fingers if you&#x27;ve got a cut - ouch (citrus).</li>
            <li> Dr Bronner is one of my favorite brands, so I was really surprised at how horrible this product is.  It has a horrible smell,  it stung my skin, you have to mix it up in another container every time you want to use it, and it didn&#x27;t condition my hair.  And its an unsightly lumpy brown concoction.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, but it did not work for my hair.  Maybe I didn&#x27;t give my hair enough time to adjust, but I just couldn&#x27;t handle the feeling of my hair after using this and the castile soap as my shampoo.  I tried for an entire month, but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> Ick. The whole Bronner&#x27;s hair care line is awful. I wanted to like this product because I prefer to use natural and organic products, but the shampoo and conditioner are seriously horrid. I have medium textured hair (not too thick or thin) and it has a medium natural curl/wave to it.  My hair felt and looked terrible after using them.</li>
            <li> Not clumpy at all! Smells great to me, spot on if you love lemon scents. Very easy to pour out of bottle, I use a plastic squeeze bottle with a spout and I use one capful and fill the rest with water. Works so well to condition hair after shampooing with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap, really helps get rid of that glycerin soap feeling. Would recommend 100% for natural no poo convenient hair care!</li>
            <li> I was unpleasantly surprised after the sweet-smelling rose castile soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioning rinse is, hands-down, the most disgusting thing I&#x27;ve ever put in my hair.  It smells horrible.  Like someone previously reviewed...like rotting oranges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a hideous dark reddish brown in color.  Gloppy and lumpy in texture.  This is a really really horrible and unfortunate combination of color and texture.  Ladies, do you catch my drift?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not have continued using it just for those two reasons, but I would have given it 2 or 3 stars if it had actually worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it doesn&#x27;t.  It left my hair dull, heavy, and greasy.  I&#x27;m going to have to wash my hair again tonight.  I&#x27;m just glad that I didn&#x27;t have to actually go out anywhere today....would have been too embarrassed to walk out the front door with my hair looking like this.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castille soap, but this conditioning rinse was GROSS. It smells terrible, and it left my hair feeling oily, limp, and dull. I&#x27;m all for natural products, but this one was a major fail for me.</li>
            <li> I love natural products, so when I found \\&quot;Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Conditioning Rinse\\&quot; I was excited and ordered a bottle. The bottle arrived today, and I was eager to open it and see what it smelled like. After opening the plastic cap, I found the \\&quot;protective seal\\&quot; to be 90% peeled back already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m not sure what this product is supposed to look like, but what I found inside almost made me vomit. I took a whiff of the product and it smelled like a mixture of citrus and human feces (very disturbing!). I poured a bit in to the cap and it was a disgusting mixture of very dark brown (think motor oil) and dark brown chunks of something. It literally looks like someone opened the bottle, dumped out half, and then did their business in it. Did I mention it smelled appalling?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being that this is my first Dr. Bronner&#x27;s purchase, I honestly do not know if this one product is supposed to be this way (I seriously doubt it) or if someone tampered with it. I would like to add that I also ordered a bottle of Dr. \\&quot;Bronner&#x27;s Liquid Soap\\&quot; and its amazing. That being said, there is no way in hell I&#x27;m putting \\&quot;Shitrus\\&quot; Rinse on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review as needed.</li>
            <li> I am 21 and the older I get, the more into natural products I become. I have been reading about Dr.Bronner&#x27;s Castille soap and using it as a natural shampoo. I have dirty blonde long very thick hair with a little natural wave to it.  I decided to give it a try and knew that going this route would cause a transitional period in my hair. I bought the lavender kind and heard that using coconut oil as conditioner afterwards would work. Well, the soap made my hair feel funky and the oil made it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Then I read about this conditioning rinse and decided to try it. It instantly made my hair soft, yet not too greasy. I honestly don&#x27;t even think my hair needs to transition to using the soap and this rinse as a follow up. My hair feels even softer the next day, and doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all. I also think it brings out my natural wave nicely and  I am excited to see what my hair will be like after using them for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very citrusy but I like it. The Dr. Bronner&#x27;s hair creme is also very lovely I like the mint or the lavender coconut scent the best. It adds extra moisture to your hair but isn&#x27;t too heavy if concentrated at the ends and lightly all over.</li>
            <li> I have never used a product that I unfortunately disliked as much! Although I like the brand and trying to use their shampoo as well (which isn&#x27;t going that well even though I diluted it as recommended by many people online), this conditioner just doesn&#x27;t do its job and smells awful!! I have used it 3 times to untangle my hair (which is caused because of the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s sshampoo) and almost used more than half the bottle on my hair it doesn&#x27;t do anything. What I also realized yesterday was interesting; when I poured lots of it to my hair and my hand it kind of burned my finger! I don&#x27;t know how to really explain this but I still have a small mark on my finger from this incident. I will throw away whatever&#x27;s left and will never purchase this product again. Please be careful when you buy.</li>
            <li> I recently engaged in an experiment with using home made shampoo, so I bought this to use as a rinse. It burnt my skin, scalp when it came in contact. The reason for me switching from conventional products was due to having skin irritations on my scalp, so this didn&#x27;t help. The worst was the reaction of skin on my face if some would accidentally get on it. It also really didn&#x27;t serve its purpose. I&#x27;m still trying to get everything balanced with my hair and the castile soap, but I&#x27;m switching to vinegar or lemon juice.....it will be easier, cheaper, and less irritating to my skin.</li>
            <li> Tried &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method and it was awful. This product however is wonderful. I have thin blonde hair that gets greasy and flat very quickly but this keeps it light and soft. My only recommendation is let your hair dry, air dry or blow dry before brushing.</li>
            <li> I bought this when I was trying to go chemical free and &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34;. It was nice because since I wasn&#x27;t using traditional shampoo and therefore couldn&#x27;t get most moisturizing treatments to rinse from my hair. This was effective at conditioning without leaving anything behind. However, the smell and texture was disgusting. It was the stinkiest black sludge. I only used it because it was necessary. I wish it left my hair not smelling awful though.</li>
            <li> Did not condition nor get any tangles out.  I love the Dr.Bronners shampoos and the leave-in conditioner, but this conditioning hair rinse is not what it implies or at least what I expected.  I couldn&#x27;t run my fingers through my hair while still in shower.  I used extra, but still no luck.  Also did not feel silky with this rinse.  Using Dr. B&#x27;s shampoo does make my hair feel silky, shiny and clean but I still need a conditioning detangler to be able to comb my hair and style. I am not sure what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> The smell of this is very very strong.</li>
            <li> Gosh I hate to give a bad review, especially with the company that I adore so much.  However, I&#x27;ve tried and tried to use this as all I use in my home is Dr. Bronners, but it&#x27;s just awful.  Not only does it smell bad but it just leaves my hair stiff.  I can literally move my hair and it stays there.  Throwing this one out.  What a bummer!</li>
            <li> this conditioner leaves my hair very soft, but anybody who tells you it&#x27;s any help in detangling hair has a warehouse full of the stuff, and they want to sell it to YOU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my hair is approaching mid-back-length, and a conditioner&#x27;s detangling ability is very important to me. conditioners that do provide a detangling effect do so by coating the strands of your hair so that they&#x27;re slippery and don&#x27;t stick together; that&#x27;s what allows you to get a comb or a brush through it with any reasonable amount of effort. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Citrus Hair Conditioning Rinse, on the other hand, makes the strands of hair stick to one another, which is the exact opposite of a detangling effect, and it&#x27;s a time-consuming nightmare to get such hair combed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i like the smell of this stuff okay, i like that it&#x27;s Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and i can be reasonably sure it&#x27;s healthy and not terrible for the ecosystem. but as a detangler, this stuff doesn&#x27;t even register on the chart. my search for my ideal conditioner continues.</li>
            <li> Mix a few table spoons in 4 cups of water , yes you want to dilute it.  It works great on the tips or dried hair but not so good for my scalp.  So I mixed some up and put in a spray bottle, much easier to use.</li>
            <li> I have medium to long fine hair that loves to tangle and I love the combination of Dr Bronners soap and this conditioning rinse. My hair is noticeably healthier, hydrated (dries in half the time!!), has wonderful body and shine and I love the scent that lingers.  I find it to be a pleasant natural citrus smell and not overwhelming at all.  I do admit it is very strong when using it in the shower but it&#x27;s not a turn off.  One capful does the trick.  Because I don&#x27;t have to use so much and paired with diluted Dr. Bronners soap, it is quite an economical and healthy way to treat your hair.</li>
            <li> I really like it but... I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s worth the effort. (Currently looking for better alternatives but this is a great back up 11/2014)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does a real good job of replenishing my hair. It softens and de-tangles the crap out of my always knotted hair. I have wavy very Thick Spanish/Hispanic Hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works but.... you have to use it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, you have to get a large cup full of water, then add two or one caps full of the conditioner and swirl it around, then you can dunk your already wet hair into the cup and shift it around, til you think the solution has reached all of the hair. Then you can pull it out then pour the rest on your hair next to your scalp. DO NOT GET IN YOUR EYES, stings so badly. You&#x27;ll survive tho.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like it, but I&#x27;m still searching for a less-step process conditioner. If I can&#x27;t find one, I&#x27;ll come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Use it to this day, great product.</li>
            <li> I mix this conditioner with apple cider vinegar &amp; water &amp; works great!</li>
            <li> Dr Bronner&#x27;s service rep said that this has a pH level of 3… which, assumed, that if the water was alkaline, this pH would be a bit higher than a 3.  Initially used ratio as per instructions - 1-2 capfuls per cup of water, assuming cup was 8oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was used as conditioner/ rinse for HOMEMADE SHAMPOO (1.5cups Organic Pure Virgin Coconut Milk + 1.75cups Aloe Gel) with an assumed pH level of between 4 and 6.  Turns out the combination tested (using pH strips) to be around 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of curiousity, and because I wanted to truly test the pH levels, I ordered some of pH Test Strips…  WHOA!!!  The pH level for Dr B Rinse concentrate did not hit 3 at all … it was a 1!!!  Perhaps I misunderstood the rep and she meant it has a pH of 3 after it was mixed with water?  It was not!!!  Even 1 capful to 1 cup of water still had it at 1, maybe 2!!!  My water was about a 9 and adding the ratio (as per instructions) barely brought up the level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few tests, it turns out that only maybe about 2-3 drops of DrB Rinse + 8 oz water brings the pH level to a 3.  So if the correct pH level is critical for you, use pH Test Strips to test your shampoo, water and mixes before using these!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are plenty of reviews for the combination of Coconut Milk+Aloe Gel Shampoo followed by ACV (Apple Cider Vinegar) Rinse… many stating that it could take weeks to get the &amp;#34;greasiness&amp;#34; on the hair out during the &amp;#34;transition period.&amp;#34;  Since I was not interested in ACV, I opted for this as the rinse - similar pH.  By testing out the actual pH, and having 5 for the shampoo and 3 for the rinse, I found that the transition took only 4 days.  Hair adjusted well VERY quickly… and air drying hair was actually good.  And less falling hair - perhaps because it&#x27;s naturally detangles in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXCELLENT - as long as the pH is tested.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I do the rinse with it and let it soak before rinsing it out</li>
            <li> good rinse to use after high pH natural shampoo but it does sometimes burn my skin, even when diluted.  The first ingredient is lemon juice so I guess that is to be expected.  It is free of nasty chemicals and works to detangle my hair so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I tried the whole \\&quot;no poo\\&quot; method with baking soda and vinegar and it was an epic fail.  I switched to using Dr Bronners castille soap and it was better, but my hair was a knotted tangled mess.  I starting using the hair rinse and my hair was so much easier to comb through and didn&#x27;t look greasy anymore.  It&#x27;s kind of difficult to use in the shower- you are supposed to mix a cap-full of the rinse in a container with water then pour it over your head while combing through your hair.  It is a really thick liquid and I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell, it kind of reminded me of orange candy, but not in a good way.  The smell didn&#x27;t stay after rinsing my hair though, so not a huge problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started mixing a teaspoon of organic coconut milk (also purchased on amazon) with 1 tablespoon of castille soap and my hair looks even better than it did with this rinse, so I have this as a backup- but will be sticking with coconut milk from now on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I didn&#x27;t love this product at first. I was using up the rest of my regular shampoo and following up with this rinse. It was okay, but not great. But then I ran out of shampoo and diluted a bottle of my Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint soap to use as shampoo. The combination is incredible! I have thick, wavy, coarse hair that usually requires the use of detangling spray and leave-in conditioner. But not with this combination! It left my hair soft and sleek, and on day two, my hair isn&#x27;t oily at all. I&#x27;m very pleased with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did take a few tries to get the right mix of conditioning rinse and water, and if it&#x27;s too strong, it stings my scalp, eyes and nose. However, with the right mix, none of that happens and my hair turns out lovely. I will definitely continue using this and I&#x27;m so happy to have found a combination of products that I can feel good about putting into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mix a few capfuls of the rinse with water in an old conditioner bottle, and then pour about 1/4 of the bottle over my hair. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but you can kind of tell when you&#x27;re &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; pouring based on the feel of your hair. Then rinse and done!</li>
            <li> This conditioner works well but you MUST dilute it. I keep a bottle in the shower to dilute, mix, and apply. The smell is definitely overpowering right out of the bottle. That is because it&#x27;s concentrated. Once it&#x27;s diluted and goes on it leaves behind a nice citrus smell.&lt;br /&gt;I have made the mistake of shaving before applying this and that is a HUGE mistake. It contains citrus so any cuts or freshly shaven areas will burn like hell. So shave after!</li>
            <li> This conditioning rinse does leave my hair very manageable, following the&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Bronners Soap. However it is an ugly color and often quite lumpy. I don&#x27;t dilute it as it&lt;br /&gt;recommends, but just put some in the palm of my hand and rub it through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I am on my 2nd bottle, so obviously like it well enough to reorder!</li>
            <li> I recently to switched to J.R. Liggett&#x27;s bar shampoo and I follow up with this rinse. My hair is left feeling stringy, tangled, and simply terrible when still wet. I towel dry and I&#x27;m very pleased to say, No Tangles! My hair is left feeling soft with an incredible amount of body. It feels even better the next day, and the best part, I only have to wash my hair every 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;I have Very fine, untreated, straight (except two weird curls by my ears), bodyless, mid-back length hair. I used to wash/ condition my hair every other day with Alba, or deal with oily, slicked down hair. No fun.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, it&#x27;s awesome, and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I, like many other reviewers, had a good experience with [[ASIN:B00120VWJ0 Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Magic Castile Soaps]] and wanted to try other elements of the Bronner&#x27;s line.  This stuff is hard to use (it&#x27;s a liquid that has to be mixed in a cup and poured slowly over your head) and BURNS like The Devil&#x27;s flames if it gets in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that said, I think it&#x27;s actually somewhat effective at detangling my (short) hair and making it feel less stripped of oils after using the Castile soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, as with all Dr Bronner items, it&#x27;s organic and made in the USA.  Always a plus!</li>
            <li> I like the concentration and the smell of citrus in this conditioner, but it definitely does not do a great conditioning job unless you want to repeat the application for 3-4 times! Taking into consideration that my hair is the soft silky type. And speaking of how it go tangled in the first place is about another product to review. It also burns the skin and causes real irritation if you have the very sensitive type, but the caution is indicated on the bottle. Yet, be extra cautious and dilute even more!</li>
            <li> terrrible conditioner and I have used apple cider vinegar for conditioner with better results&lt;br /&gt;not only did it burn my scalp for less than the &#x27;30 sec&#x27; it is supposed to be on, my hair did not feel clean or soft AT ALL&lt;br /&gt;the smell is disgusting, I understand organic products do have a certain smell because of the natural ingredients, but this product has been around for how long and they couldn&#x27;t think of maybe lavender oil to put in it that is natural but more preferred than this horrid rotting citrus smell&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge advocate for all natural, non-GMO products like this but I will be re-selling the two pack I bought - very disappointed</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean, smooth and detangled without weighing it down. I tried all different dilution ratios and came to the conclusion a little over a capful to one 16 oz water bottle of water is perfect. I get 3-4 uses from each 16 oz bottle. The lemon content is high so avoid the eyes (ouch) but the amazing highlights that emerged  while using it and spending time at the beach brought back memories from my teen years with a bottle of Sun-In hair spray lightener. For major highlights I just leave it in and don&#x27;t rinse it and then let it air dry in the sun. Everyone thought I had gone to the salon for highlights. It smells great after it dries and leaves it light and breezy, ideal for humid climates. It did wonders for my combination skin scalp and my hair didn&#x27;t get greasy as fast as normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading many reviews I was determined to use Dr Bronners Magic soap (diluted) as a shampoo but no matter what I tried it came out horrific. I had hoped that I could use this as a rinse after the magic soap as I had read but that was a major &amp;#34;FAIL&amp;#34;. I even tried super diluting the magic soap and dumping a whole bottle on vinegar on my head, still came out nasty. So needless to say, 18-in-1 magic soap is a 17-in-1 since I can wash anything but my hair with it.</li>
            <li> I love Dr Bronners other products so I was really surprised at this one. TERRIBLE stuff. It&#x27;s a dark brown, mucky substance (honestly, looks just like soupy poop) that smells like sulphur. My hair felt like straw after I&#x27;d used it so I rehashed (w/ Dr Bronners and my old conditioner), then dumped this stuff out in the sink.</li>
            <li> I found this for the first time at a yard sale and searched my town for a store that carried it.  No luck.  Amazon came through!!  I bought 2 bottles.  This rinse is the best I&#x27;ve found for bringing out a lovely shine to my long hair--a shine that lasts several days.  I *think* it even minimizes the gray that&#x27;s starting to creep in!! Okay, maybe it won&#x27;t cure the common cold, but it&#x27;s a great hair rinse!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 months now and I have wavy long blond hair.  I am in my 20s and my hair suddenly went crazy on me no matter what I tried shampoo or conditioner wise it would look oily.  I tried everything it seemed, even using dawn dish soap on my hair just to get the grease out.  Naturally, that stripped my hair of all its nutrients and turned into another problem.  Well, I gave up on shampoo and started using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap as shampoo coupled with this conditioning rinse.  Well I tried and hoped and wished that the castile soap would work but no matter what I did even after trying everybody else&#x27;s advise on here it just didn&#x27;t work for me, it always made my hair feel heavy and leave a nasty residue.  However, I found that this conditioner coupled with a daily cleansing shampoo was the perfect match! I now have beautiful wavy golden hair again!! I don&#x27;t even use that much of the conditioner, it will last me forever.  I put one cap-full into a small spray bottle and mix with warm water to dissolve the particles in the rinse.  I spray a few squirts onto my scalp and then a few onto my ends then massage it all in and leave it for a few minutes before rinsing it out.  It even smells great, diluted that is, it is a little overwhelming when it is concentrated in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have thin wavy hair, all this did was make it greasy and unmanageable.  My son tried it, he has curly full hair, it made his flat and greasy.  We tried various ratios of water to rinse and the end results were all the same.  Would not use again and not sure what I am going to do with the rest of the bottle.</li>
            <li> i get a dozen compliments a day on my hair when using this product.</li>
            <li> Very strong scent. Stings the eyes. Doesn&#x27;t make your hair very soft. I like Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products, but this one just wasn&#x27;t up to par.</li>
            <li> for about the past month, i&#x27;ve been using dr bronner&#x27;s hair conditioning rinse after washing my hair with dr bronner&#x27;s shikakai lavendar body soap followed by dr bronner&#x27;s lavendar leave-in conditioning creme. i have long hair (past my shoulders) and i can definitely say that it looks and feels healthier and shinier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;some things to consider if you&#x27;re switching from shampoo/conditioner to a more natural hair care solution:&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;ll definitely take some experimentation to get a system that works for you. i only use a tiny amount (pea size) of the leave-in creme on the ends of my hair after towel drying. anything more than that and my hair gets too greasy. you may need to try out different amounts of product and whether to use it on wet, damp, or dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;-give your hair/scalp time to adjust. shampoo and conditioner strip your hair of its natural oils then replace it with heavy conditioners that coat the hair follicle which then needs to be removed by powerful detergents in the shampoo. its a vicious cycle but obviously a great business model. when switching to dr bronner&#x27;s soaps/conditioners, for the first couple weeks my hair was still looking dirty even though i had just washed it. after some time though, it adjusts.&lt;br /&gt;-it&#x27;s odd at first keeping a cup (i use an old quart-size wonton soup container, washed thoroughly of course, that i marked at 1 cup) in the shower to dilute the conditioning rinse then pour through your hair.&lt;br /&gt;-washing with soap will clean your hair well but leave the follicles open and hair feeling tangly. you need to close the follicles in order to have smooth, manageable, shiny hair. this can be achieved with a mild acid rinse. you can make your own by mixing apple cider vinegar (acid) and some essential oils of your choosing (scent) then diluting into a rinse (search for hair vinegar rinse and there&#x27;s a ton of stuff out there about it). i like the dr bronner rinse better though as it uses lemon juice for the acid portion (so it smells better) and contains a bunch of oils that are good for your hair.</li>
            <li> But it has a really wierd smell and does not work as well as I thought it would, maybe I am not using enough</li>
            <li> Although using this product from the bottle without diluting does not work for me as well as diluting it with water first, it has plenty of acidicness so that only a small amount (think dime or nickel size diameter in your palm) is needed for a typical man&#x27;s head of hair. In my case, I have almost neutral pH, softened water and that is sufficient for washing out Dr. Bronner&#x27;s liquid soaps in less than 30 seconds. But, if like some users, you prefer to us an acidic conditioner to neutralize the basic pH of the soap, then this one works well.</li>
            <li> I thought here we go another &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; product that make big claims and doesn&#x27;t deliver. It delivered and smells like fresh lemon. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the price, it is like other Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products, it is concentrate and you need to dilute it 1 part rinse to 20 parts water so it will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I smells atrocious...</li>
            <li> I began using this the moment I received it and was SO delighted! Leaves hair feeling soft, smooth, and without the tangles that a Castile &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; or baking soda and water can leave.  I began the natural lifestyle just recently and was moderately happy with the way the vinegar rinse was leaving my hair, but I wanted to try something else.  And I am SO glad I did!  This rinse made my hair shiny, and silky without any chemical build-up.  I am not to crazy about the smell......citrus IS better than vinegar, though, so it&#x27;s one-up on what I WAS doing!</li>
            <li> I bought this and am using it along with the dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile soap. At first, I used it with 2 capfuls with one application of soap.  So greasy (I have long/oily/fine hair)!!! Through trial and error I found this conditioner and soap combo to work fantastically together, a must try if your looking for a more natural option. Just remember to stick with it, and it will produce great results!</li>
            <li> i really like this stuff. it makes my hair feel very smooth and it smells awesome. it does sting any</li>
            <li> This conditioner did not work at all for me.  It made my hair extremely hard to comb through.  I should say that I have fine and color treated long hair.  Right after my hair was highlighted, it dried it out terribly.  It also smells nasty.  The directions tell you to dilute it in a cup of water and then pour it over your head.  I don&#x27;t like doing this in the shower.  I just want to squeeze something in my hand and put it on my hair and be done.  I have found a conditioner from the Honest Company that actually works and is chemical free.  I will not buy this hair rinse again.  In fact, I will not be using it again.</li>
            <li> Works well. Doesn&#x27;t take much so this bottle lasts quite some time. Always enjoyable supporting a good company too.</li>
            <li> I love this product but it came to me damaged and leaking. I hate returning stuff so I just kept it.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length slightly wavy, very fine hair-- and a lot of it. And although I have a lot of hair, my biggest problem is flat hair because it is so fine. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money on products to help increase volume, but I really hadn&#x27;t found anything that worked all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend was telling me about all the bad things in regular shampoo, so I decided to switch to all natural products. I did some research and decided to initially try the home made stuff--- water, castile soap, and essential oils &#x3D; shampoo and diluted apple cider vinegar for the conditioner. I&#x27;ll say the conditioner was better than the shampoo, but it wasn&#x27;t really doing it for me so I decided to switch again. I tried a combo of three products: JR Liggett&#x27;s bar shampoo, Dr. Bonners citrus conditioner rinse, and Dr. Bonner&#x27;s Lavender and coconut conditioner and styling creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They all came at different times (only days apart), but I got to try the Lavender and Coconut hair creme first with my homemade products. I used just a tiny drop, but it really did make a huge difference in the smoothness and softness of my hair. It also has a pleasant, but not over powering smell. I really didn&#x27;t see any difference in the volume of my hair though&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next came the bar shampoo-- big improvement over the handmade shampoo and in combination with the dr. bonner hair creme my hair was even softer. The bar shampoo says it can be used without any other products, but good luck with that. I tried it without the conditioning products, but it isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d do again. My hair wasn&#x27;t stringy but it had a very strange texture-- not very soft. Still not a lot of increase in volume. (UPDATE: This improves over time)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next came the Dr. Bonner Citrus Rinse. Awesome. The combination of all three products definitely seems to be the winner. It is important to use all the products according to the package instructions or your hair may not be exactly what you want it to be, but when it&#x27;s used properly-- great results. My hair is soft, smooth, feels thicker and it typically looks and feels even better the next day.. and the day after that. No more problems with oily hair and I haven&#x27;t had any dandruff. As for volume, I have seen an improvement. I even wore my hair in a ponytail for work, wore it up all day, and then took it down when I went to sleep. When I woke up-- volume! That has never, ever, ever happened before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is just worth mentioning that I did try to go without the hair creme and just use the bar soap and the citrus rinse, but my hair wasn&#x27;t as smooth and soft as before, but it did have the boost in volume. It wasn&#x27;t a HUGE difference in the softness, but it was noticeable enough that I&#x27;d keep buying the hair creme. (Update: Still don&#x27;t miss the hair creme)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, be aware that the switch did make my hair feel different in a very odd way. It isn&#x27;t bad, but it is a little different. It was kind of dry at first, but I know other people who ended up being oily. It just depends on how your hair and scalp decide to behave during the \\&quot;re-training\\&quot; process. But the best way that I can describe it is that my hair felt stripped for the first two weeks due to the damage from old shampoos and the need for my hair to heal. It quickly went away and my hair has never been better! I think it feels healthier, thicker and less frizzy. My hair dresser even noticed! She thought I found some miracle style agent, but really all it has been was my new shampoo and conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: This will make your hair lighter over time due to the citrus in the product.it&#x27;s used properly-- great results.

            <li> smells! so gross. when the rinse runs into your mouth a little while showering it&#x27;s so disgusting. it looks like mud from the bottom of a river. i can&#x27;t say anything about what it does for my hair. I didn&#x27;t notice anything special.</li>
            <li> This is a conditioning rinse to be used after a hair washing with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castille soap. It is NOT intended to be used as a conditioner solely. The acidity (and you CAN smell it. Compare it to concentrated lemon juice) counter acts the sticky grittiness that pure castille soap can leave on your hair (no matter HOW much you dilute it). I actually have been on a baking soda/water wash regimen for my very thick, curly, long hair for about 4 months now....and WOW! What a difference! It did take about two weeks of adjustment for my hair, but after that, there was no looking back. Paired up with this product (I could use Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar, but eh -- I want to support someone&#x27;s honest income at Dr. Bronner&#x27;s!), it&#x27;s been a wonderful journey to no-&#x27;poo land. I did purchase the peppermint hair cream, but you&#x27;d do just as well with a teensy dab of coconut oil rubbed in your palms, then applied to your ends. All in all, great product --- but if you don&#x27;t like the smell of lemon juice concentrate, this isn&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(as a closing note, the smell doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair too much. Just be sure to rinse well!)</li>
            <li> This conditioner really makes hair soft and silky, and it smells great!  It won&#x27;t leave your hair feeling immediately detangled like chemical conditioners will, but once your hair dries, it is really soft.  Make sure you follow the directions and dilute the formula with water.  If you use it directly on your hair it seems to not rinse out well and will leave your hair oily.</li>
            <li> If you use the original Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soaps on your hair then this product is a MUST HAVE! I don&#x27;t recall all the science based soap info but the jist is that the soap leaves a film and the acidic juices in the Shikakai hair rinse cut through that. There is also a moisturizer left behind that leaves hair soft and non static-y. A cup of water with a capfull of this rinse does the trick. Makes your hair smell like lemons which is a great bonus! I wish that Dr. Bronner&#x27;s would put a bit of info about the hair rinse on the labels of the castile soaps so that people know that there is a second step for getting soft hair after using the castile. The castile alone makes my hair squeaky and tangly. Yes, the castile works but my hair isn&#x27;t as manageable as with the rinse.</li>
            <li> I kinda hate this stuff. I had high hopes because I love Bronner&#x27;s soap, but this stuff is weird and globby, too concentrated, and made my hair super greasy and heavy feeling. :(</li>
            <li> I started using Castile soap to wash my hair after I read that it was gentler than typical shampoos.  I have tried all sorts of brands but my scalp would bother me after couple months regardless. I got concerned when I started seeing bold spots at the front and my follicles where clearly inflamed. So I used tea tree castile soap and it did the trick on the scalp after the second wash, not itching, no flakes and no inflamed follicles.  The trouble was my hair had significant residue or oil or what have you and it kept getting worse after each wash. So I did some research and learned to dilute castile but that did not do it. We have really hard water so that was not helping. I can see the soap react almost instantly with minerals in water but I used distilled and it did not help. So I washed my hair with regular shampoo and ordered this rinse after reading Lisa Bronner&#x27;s blog. Something about hair shafts being raised and I needed to rinse either with vinegar or this rinse after using the soap. I did not want to smell like vinegar so the rinse it was. I followed the directions and used 2 caps in a glass of water and left the rinse after massaging it in for the rest of the shower.  Rinsed well when I was done and to my amazement no more oily coated hair. It smells like lemons and it does burn if you have any scratches but it goes away after rinsing. I just have to say, I will not be going back to traditional shampoo and conditioner.  I have happy silky hair and scalp that does not itch or flake. It does take some time for your hair to adjust and you will notice the difference but it is for the better.</li>
            <li> GENERAL: This conditioner looks super gross in the bottle. I&#x27;m just going to be straight with you, it&#x27;s brown goop and you&#x27;ll look at it and wonder if you should really put it on your hair. Just do it. You&#x27;ll be happy you did. Some people don&#x27;t really like the citrus smell either, but I find it refreshing. The smell doesn&#x27;t last too long after rinsing out the conditioner anyway if you really don&#x27;t like it. My hair retains more of the scent of the castile liquid soap that I use. Some people also don&#x27;t like that you have to dilute the product, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all: I fill up my old conditioner bottle (holds about 1.5-2C) with water, pour in a cap full of the conditioner, shake it up and pour it on my hair - pretty simple. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend pre-diluting this product unless you have an opaque, closed container. I don&#x27;t know if this product is not diluted to save money and plastic waste (yay) or because it changes the composition of the product, so you may want to look into that, but my bet is on the former. I also don&#x27;t know if this product will under go light oxidation, but it being in a opaque container makes me think it will because of the citrus ingredients being so acidic. If your product DOES undergo light oxidation, it may bleach your hair, which some people have reported when using this conditioner and being out in the sun (think like hydrogen peroxide). This may be desirable or undesirable based on the consumer. I haven&#x27;t experienced any bleaching at all, but I keep my conditioner in the light-sealed container and live in Michigan where the fall season is mostly overcast or rainy.    CASTILE SOAP AS SHAMPOO: I recently started using the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Rose Castile Liquid Soap (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083LU5LC) for my hair. DO NOT USE THE CASTILE SOAP BY ITSELF ON YOUR HAIR. I mean it. Don&#x27;t do it. You HAVE to use a conditioner. I really like the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Citrus Hair Conditioning Rinse in pairing with the castile liquid soap. If youdon&#x27;t use conditioner, the castile soap will dry out your hair. If you use too much of the castile soap as shampoo, it will dry out your hair. It took my a while to figure out the right amount for my hair. My hair is light to medium ash in color, wavy in texture, medium in thickness, and sits just above my shoulders in length. I use about a nickel size amount, rub it in between my hands, and then massage this into my scalp. Then I rinse out the soap and repeat the same process with only about a dime size amount. Another reviewer suggested this and it seems to work well for me even though I have never done the \\&quot;repeat\\&quot; part of hair washing. There won&#x27;t be much of a lather. The first time I used this shampoo I used WAY too much and it made a rich lather in my hair and my hair felt like straw after getting out (even after using my argan oil conditioner); I had to use oil on my hair afterwards to smooth it out and it make it greasy after just one day. So you will have to play around with the amount to see what works for you.    CITRIS HAIR RINSE AS CONDITIONER: After that, I started using the citrus rinse and still had some problems. For fear of drying my hair out again, I was using too little of the shampoo and letting the rinse sit on my hair, which made my hair really greasy. Now I dilute my rinse a little more than directed, about one cap full for about 1.5-2 cups of water (I use my old conditioner bottle and it works well for shaking it up). Once I put the rinse on I massage it into my scalp for less than 30 seconds then I immediately lower the temperature of the water so it&#x27;s cool and rinse the product out. This makes my hair so soft and shiny (and NOT FRIZZY, hallelujah!). It is a little straighter (but still very wavy) when I use these products together than when I was using my argan oil shampoo and conditioner (which made my hair more on the curly side). I usually just let my hair dry overnight while I&#x27;m sleeping because I like the natural wavy look of my hair,but  I&#x27;m sure the curlier nature of my hair would come back if I dried it with a diffuser or scrunched it and let it air dry. I usually only ever finger comb my hair and I never have problems with tangling when using this conditioner.    So if you want an eco-friendly product that makes your hair very soft, shiny manageable to use with your castile soap (or other natural shampoo) this is the product for you! Stay green!</li>
            <li> When I decided to switch to this conditioner, I was plagued by dandruff, in spite of trying a lot of products specifically meant for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After use, I found that this product felt heavier than other conditioners and I was concerned, but in a few hours, once the hair was dry, I could see smooth wavy hair with a healthy natural shine. Over weeks, the hair texture has improved --- I don&#x27;t get frizz, and the dandruff is all gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did tingle quite a bit when my scalp wasn&#x27;t healthy, and I find the smell slightly overwhelming (but not intolerable) --- certainly not like the other perfumed conditioners, but since it keeps my hair in great shape, I don&#x27;t think I will ever look for another product.</li>
            <li> I heard some mixed reviews about this product, but I was still curious about it because I wanted a more or less natural conditioner. It has a citrus smell, which is not bad and doesn&#x27;t linger once you&#x27;ve rinsed. It makes my hair Very Shiny and Soft. I have very fine and straight hair, so a capful is a bit too much for ME (I use half a capful). But I like that you have the option to make the conditioner heavier or lighter as needed. I&#x27;ve read some complaints about little brown beads all over the tub. Someone suggested that that person may have received and old bottle and I think that may have been the case. The concentrate disolves quite well in water. I recommend using warm water so that it&#x27;s more comfortable when pouring on your head.</li>
            <li> My husband has allergies to a lot of chemicals so I bought this for him.  He likes it and I like it too.  It looks kind of brown and runny and at first I thought it might not work but it smells nice and left my hair very easy to manage.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Meh price.&lt;br /&gt;You have to mix it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Stings (it has lemon juice in it).&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair silky soft (even after shampooing w/ Dr. B&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;Cured my dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: good, but not great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard lots of times that people either love or hate this product, and I think it just comes down to personal hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tailbone-length dark blonde/light brown hair that is slightly wavy, not color treated, and about 1/4 grey.  This stuff isn&#x27;t bad, but it does seem to leave a bit of a coating that feels slimy and dulls my hair a little.  Also it stings my scalp.  This is by using the directions on the bottle.  This does not happen with a 1:3 part white vinegar rinse (white instead of cider because of the grey).  No, my hair does not smell like a salad, the scent evaporates when it dries, even if I don&#x27;t rinse it out, but I usually do rinse it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this shikakai stuff is not really great (for me), but I do *love* the leave-in conditioners that the Dr. Bronner company makes.  Both lavender and peppermint leave my hair sweet-smelling and well-conditioned without being heavy in any way.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioning rinse!! It smells great and has done wonders for my hair. I have noticed less frizz and my hair is growing much faster. If you use Castile soap as a shampoo, you will need this rinse, because it will leave your hair sticky. This conditioning rinse will remove all the Castile soap and leave your hair silky smooth. Plus, it&#x27;s Eco-friendly and you don&#x27;t have to feel guilty anymore ;) A wonderful buy.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy this again but in another scent. The smell is really disgusting fortunately when your hair dries it just leaves a faint orange smell. It is gloppy and some of it doesn&#x27;t get totally dissolved but it does leave my hair manageable and very very soft. I have drier hair due to bleach so for me this adds just enough moisture without leaving my hair greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe some of you over moisturize and that&#x27;s why this is too much. Check your shampoos does it add moisture? If so then this is probably overkill. I use a soap nut shampoo and it leaves my hair quite dry so I really wanted something natural for moisturizing. Vinegar for me leaves my hair to stringy/greasy looking.</li>
            <li> I dilute this approximately 1/2 capful per 1 cup water and use it three days a week in conjunction with JR Liggett&#x27;s Jojoba &amp; Peppermint Bar Shampoo and love it. It helps add some silkiness to my hair and always washes clean, not leaving my hair heavy with residue. FWIW, I have shoulder length straight hair that is thin (the individual hairs are) but plentiful. I&#x27;ve been using this combo for a month now and find my hair with more body than it ever had and it is easy to style (and with less products) than before.&lt;br /&gt;I mix approximately a full cap with ~16 oz of water (in an old water bottle), kept at hand in the shower the diluted mixture lasts me about 1.5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Very. Concentrated. Dilute well.&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, Holy hell, remember to close your eyes when you&#x27;re rinsing with this stuff unless you want to be screaming bloody murder in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, my hair feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this conditioner, it has a strong citrus odor and left my hair smelling very much like citrus for hours. (It did not have a chemically smell to it either, very natural smelling) i read the instructions and used the product as explained on the bottle. (It comes in concentrate and you have to dilute it each use.) The first time I used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Citrus Orange Conditioning Rinse i had just gotten done setting up the Christmas tree, so i had tiny scratches all over my hands and arms. Oh, the pain! They use usda certified organic lemon juice in this product,  so it was literally like adding lemon juice to a cut. It was easy to apply and wasn&#x27;t particularly hard to rinse out. (I have long, thick, fine hair) i do not recommend this as a detangler, but I felt my hair had been conditioned and my hair was silky even after the first use, as they claim it would be. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s recommends using one of their hair cremes after using this conditioning rinse to smooth and detangle. I believe if I had also bought the hair creme and tried that, it would have been a great combination. I will say that I feel like I went through this bottle rather quickly, but I also tend to use too much conditioner on my hair. All in all, I like this product and will try it again, but this time I won&#x27;t forget to order the hair styling/detangling creme.</li>
            <li> Bought this and the shampoo to go with it. Smells great but the more I used it with the recommended dilutions and full strength, the nastier my hair felt. Tried it for a month &amp;#34;to get used to it&amp;#34; and it was awful.</li>
            <li> Works great with Dr Bronner&#x27;s soap, makes my hair feel like silk!</li>
            <li> Worked much better than I expected!&lt;br /&gt;Be careful not to add more to water than is suggested..&lt;br /&gt;Because it will burn! It has lemon juice in it so too much can be bad.. But this is great for co-washing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 months now, after making changes to all of my hygiene products in favor of chemical-free bliss! I chose Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap as my shampoo (as well as my dish rinse, body wash, hand soap, toothpaste, laundry detergent, and floor cleaner). It definitely needing a conditioner to go along with it so enter Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Organic Shikakai Conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Bronner&#x27;s carries \\&quot;Champion Status\\&quot; at the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website that ranks products based on their danger/toxicity. This means they have signed a pledge to use only the safest ingredients in all their products. On a scale of 0-10 (0 being the safest), this product scores a 0. I think if you averaged the scores of all the products I have replaced with it, you&#x27;d get about a 5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you&#x27;ll notice is that it smells like wonderful citrus. I take a recycled water bottle (16 oz) and fill it almost to the top with warm water. I then put a cap full of this rinse into it and shake it gently. For my short guy&#x27;s hair, I use about 1/3 of that bottle. Just pour it in my hair slowly and rub it in then rinse. I then save the rest for two more uses before repeating the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mentioned, I use this conditioner after shampooing my hair with [[ASIN:B0000533G8 Organic Castile Liquid Soap Peppermint Dr Bronners 16 oz]]. My girlfriend did not really like it. She said it didn&#x27;t de-tangle her [long] hair enough. I&#x27;ve switched her over to Yes to Cucumbers (or Yes to Carrots) shampoo/conditioner and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I use this after shampooing with my Wild Naturals shampoo. Works well and I have fine, thin shoulder length hair. I won&#x27;t use it with the Castile soap as that made my hair a nasty mess.</li>
            <li> Probably one of the few guys (with medium length hair) who uses Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products... so here goes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Dr. Bronner&#x27;s is an INCREDIBLE company. Environmentally, socially, financially responsible through and through. Legit fair trade, seriously organic, no one gets paid more than 5 times another (amazing considering that most CEOs nowadays make hundreds times what their factory floor workers do), employees get 100% free healthcare, and they give like a third of their profits back to charity (beyond their free trade projects, which, among other things, support peaceful Palestinian/Israeli coexistence and medical equipment for hospitals in Sri Lanka). If corporations were actually people, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s would be Gandhi (and I should know, I&#x27;m Indian :P)&lt;br /&gt;-I&#x27;ve never gotten so many compliments on my hair! So soft, so shiny (not greasy though), so healthy and strong...Not only that, but after using this and the conditioning rinse and leave-in conditioner, I can just run my hands through my hair to style it almost any which way I please! Do you know how much time that saves me in the morning? Now I don&#x27;t feel so guilty when pressing snooze 3x.&lt;br /&gt;-Love the strong smell of the soap when showering :) ahhh...tea tree...peppermint...so refreshing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-still experimenting on how much/little to use of each product. Right now, might be using too much shampoo, because hair becomes parched if I don&#x27;t use the leave-in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;-Price. Originally used the soap on body too, but after not seeing a noticeable difference over my Dove bar, decided to save it for just the hair.&lt;br /&gt;-Though the soap smells wonderful, it doesn&#x27;t last on your hair (like my hair doesn&#x27;t smell like peppermint or tea trees--do those actually exist?? I don&#x27;t think tea leaves grow on trees, I always imagined them growing in bushes). Anyways... I suspect my hair actually smells a bit more like some oil (for all my desi folks out there, kinda like Ayurvedic medicine). I say \\&quot;suspect\\&quot; because I don&#x27;t smell it on a day to day basis, and no one has told me my hair stinks, but if I am hot and/or sweaty, sometimes I smell it.&lt;br /&gt;-for the citrus conditioning rinse, be careful, because it really stings if you get it in your eyes or on open cuts. Also, the smell of citrus and whatever oils they use is, frankly, nauseating in the shower. Citrus and that oil smell do not mix Dr. Bronner, nuh uh, not at all. Also, not a fan of having to dilute the rinse on my own before use. First world problems, I know, but I&#x27;d appreciate it if it came pre-diluted, and preferably at the same consistency as the soap (instead of having the viscosity of water, which is harder to work through your hair).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the novella. TL;DR: love the company and the results, not such a big fan of the price or the slight oily smell--but that&#x27;s what you get for all-natural. Also, for guys, cut back ALOT on what they tell you to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~A Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lifetime customer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.s.

            <li> Use this with the bar soap to clean my hair. I use one cap full per use so it isn&#x27;t that expensive considering how long it will last. My hair looks good... way better than vinegar.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.  Love the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap for cleaning so when I read about people using it for shampoo, I decided to try it.  It really tangled my hair so I found this product.  I thought it would be great.  It was not great for my hair.  I read that you have to &amp;#34;get used to it&amp;#34; so even though it made my hair feel heavy and greasy, I kept using it for about a month.  My hair never got used to it.  It was awful for my hair.</li>
            <li> Weighs down my hair...and gives it a greasy feel. I use a drop of Dr. Bronners soap + my own a shampoo to make my thin, curly hair a little thicker. The soap helps my curls look better. However, the conditioner made my hair greasy and stringy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that it all natural. The smell is interesting--lemon mixed with something else. I&#x27;ll finish the bottle my mixing it with my regular conditioner. Stick with the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap. (I use it on everything from my hair to my kitchen floors!)</li>
            <li> I really wanted it to work for me, but it didn&#x27;t. Hair felt like straw, no detangling at all. I have fine, straight hair and used this with J.R Liggett Bar Shampoo based on another reviewer, was a mistake. I didn&#x27;t mind the smell too much, although it was strong and not exactly a girly smell. But very much lemons and oranges. Tried a full 3 weeks and used exactly to package specifications. I would NOT recommend. My thinking is that the positive reviews are all compensated endorsers. Please heed mine and so many others warnings, don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I expected this product may save me from soap scum while using a liquid soap as a shampoo.  I love the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap series, but soap scum discouraged me from soap-shampooing with hard water at where I live .  Reading somewhere that this product leaves fine &amp; soft hair after soap-shampooing,  I gave it a try.  I was so sad when I still felt the hard texture of soap scum.  I completely gave up soap shampoos then.  Well, it may not be on this product, but those who are looking for a resolution to prevent soap scum with hard water may not want to try this only to be disappointed like me.</li>
            <li> I have wavy, dry hair, and this manages to keep it healthy, looking great, and feeling awesome. Plus it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t smell it in the bottle, its weird, good news, once you mix it with water, it smell nice and does a great job.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like the smell:( and its too humbug to have to dilute to use</li>
            <li> I use just this and Dr Bronners soap and it leaves my hair looking great. I get complements on my hair and people ask what I use (I&#x27;m a guy with long hair)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using diluted apple cider vinegar as a hair rinse, and although I really liked the result, I didn&#x27;t like the smell.  Even if I rinsed with water in the end, the smell would return if my head got slightly sweaty or if it was humid outside.  While I enjoy the results of the apple cider vinegar rinse better, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Shikakai hair rinse is a great alternative.  I&#x27;d say it is almost as good as the vinegar but smells heck of a lot better!  One way I&#x27;ve been able to make the product last longer is to put the diluted version in a spray bottle and spray it on my scalp and hair and massage everything in.  You use far less and there is no waste!  Lately, I&#x27;ve been trying a mixture of this with apple cider vinegar, and I really like it.</li>
            <li> So I just recently bought this product, and I feel like I had a very different experience than most other reviewers. I just love the smell of this stuff! Just citrusy goodness, I tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the reason I&#x27;m leaving this review is to give other users a tip. Don&#x27;t rinse this stuff out completely. The first time I used it, I rinsed very thoroughly, and it left my hair feeling awful, almost like it had a sticky residue on it. I couldn&#x27;t put my fingers through it, it was so tangled and dry. I found that if I only rinse for a few seconds, my hair feels amazingly soft and manageable. It&#x27;s strange that a few minutes of rinsing would make that much of a difference, but I&#x27;m telling you to give this a try before you throw it in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> What a great product.  Lovely scent, great conditioning performance, and product lasts longer than you might think---it&#x27;s really concentrated.  Also, my hair is quite fine and this, used in proper dilution, is perfect.  No weighing my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;I will order this again---please keep producing it!</li>
            <li> I have been experimenting with different &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; recipes and my hair was so tangly and dry feeling with the vinegar conditioner. I&#x27;ve now found the perfect combination for my curly hair. A squirt of dr. Bronners soap in a cup of water for my shampoo and one cap of the conditioning rinse in a cup of water for my conditioner. Let it sit in your hair for your whole shower and you&#x27;ve got great feeling, manageable hair with no chemicals!</li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this product, but a little disappointed when it arrived. It definitely has an orange smell to it...but it&#x27;s more of a &amp;#34;Tang&amp;#34; or un-natural orange smell. I think I was expecting something a little more natural smelling. Also, the conditioning rinse is deep orange in color, and may not be great for people with bleach blonde highlights. A friend said it turned her highlights slightly orange after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;I personally would purchase it again if it wasn&#x27;t such an over powering orange smell.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife who is a big fan of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap. (She talks about Dr. Bronner&#x27;s so much that before I knew it was a brand, I was getting a little jealous of this guy!) Anyway, she says her hair feels silkier and smoother after just one use of this stuff. She&#x27;s been using it on her and our kids for about two weeks now and I have noticed a huge difference in how smooth and soft her hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair conditioning rinse is a bit shocking to look at straight from the bottle. It looks like feces, but it smells absolutely amazing. You have to dilute it in order to use it, so follow the directions on the bottle. They&#x27;re so easy I&#x27;m able to do it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way my wife&#x27;s hair feels after she uses this. The smell of citrus is strong at first (for about the first 15 minutes or so), but it goes away after her hair dries. Because it has citrus in it, I&#x27;ve noticed my wife&#x27;s hair lightening up a bit (turning a lighter shade of auburn than it usually is) in the sunshine. I love that effect, too. She&#x27;s pleased with this product, so we plan to repurchase it before the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> It smells very vinegary.</li>
            <li> I use this as both a conditioning rinse after shampooing and then also as a facial toner.  Here&#x27;s how I dilute and use it:  I shake the concentrate, pour one capful into a 12 oz. ketchup/condiment squirt bottle and fill up the rest of the bottle with warm water.  For shampooing I use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soaps, which can leave the hair feeling tangled.  After rinsing out the soap, I shake up the diluted rinse and run the tip of the squirt bottle along my scalp and then squirt some along the length of my hair.  I comb it in with a wide-tooth comb and let it sit anywhere from 1-5 minutes.  The real trick to making this work (for me anyway) was not to rinse too much of it out after soaking.  At first, I rinsed out the conditioner completely, and it left my hair feeling tangled again.  Now, I rinse my hair under water long enough for me to comb through my hair again, so it still feels a little slick.  This remaining oil helps to moisturize my hair after it&#x27;s dry.  It does not make my hair oily though, just soft and shiny. (For reference I have thick, slightly wavy hair.)  Bonus: by diluting the conditioner and putting it in a squirt bottle rather than a cup, it lasts a really long time.  I use about one bottle-full (or one capful of concentrate) a week, and I wash my hair every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the same dilution as for hair use, I put some on a cotton ball and rub all over my face after washing it.  I think it works as well as apple cider vinegar without the smell.  Now regarding the smell of the product, I thought it smelled horrible at first, and the concentrate certainly is worse than the diluted product.  I suppose I have gotten used to it and don&#x27;t mind it anymore, but it I had to describe the scent I would say it resembles spoiling lemons.  If you use the product correctly the scent does not linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other reviewers have mentioned burning/stinging.  There is a warning about this right on the bottle.  And it&#x27;s common sense, really, it&#x27;s mostly concentrated acid!  Of course if you have cuts or a dry scalp it&#x27;s going to sting a bit.  I have had this issue only once after getting a sunburn on my hair part.  After the sunburn healed the stinging went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing, I would trust Dr. Bronner&#x27;s representatives for acidity (pH) levels of the diluted conditioner.  I have a degree in chemistry and I can tell you pH test strips are not all that accurate.  They work best for figuring whether a solution is generally acidic or alkaline, not the precise pH.  They can also react with the chemicals on your hands.</li>
            <li> I think this works well.  Regular conditioners irritate my scalp.  This acidic treatment is a lot like vinegar rinse without smelling as strong.  If you use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s baby mild soap to wash your hair, use either this or Bragg&#x27;s apple cider vinegar as a rinse so your hair will be smooth and maneageable.  It will also be super soft and healthy.  My scalp likes it too.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I switched from using traditional shampoos and conditioners because every brand I tried left my hair either too dry or too oily. I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap and this citrus orange conditioner for about a year now, and my hair feels amazing. It&#x27;s soft, naturally shiny, and it&#x27;s never oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to dilute both the soap and the conditioner with water, which really makes each bottle last. I keep an empty body wash bottle (size of a Bath&amp;Bodyworks bottle) in the shower to dilute the conditioner (I can just use a tiny amount of soap and dilute it during each shower, so no extra bottle for that), put a cap-full of the conditioner in the empty bottle and fill the rest with water. That mixture will usually last me three or four showers (I have super short hair, so longer hair may need the entire bottle&#x27;s worth for one use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the first time I used the conditioner I was a little shocked that the liquid was brown. It&#x27;s natural, so I thought, &amp;#34;I should have expected this.&amp;#34; The smell is also something to get used to. Doesn&#x27;t bother me now, but it may deter some people if you&#x27;re used to your conditioners smelling like sweet apples, strawberries, other fruity things or perfumes. The smell doesn&#x27;t linger after rinsing your hair, so don&#x27;t worry about that. It does take your hair a few weeks to a couple months to adjust to the new hair cleansing routine if you&#x27;re switching from harsher shampoos to something more natural. Just give it time. Your hair will thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have been trying to use Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap for my hair since I have scalp psoriasis and shampoo seems to really trigger it, but the soap alone made my hair greasy and not presentable...I know that folks say that if you give your hair time to adjust it will be fine, but I&#x27;m a girl who loves my hair, so this was not an option for me. I tried with the ACV as a rinse, which helped but wasn&#x27;t perfect. Did some googling and found this product! I love it. My scalp is pretty damaged, so it did sting a bit, but I&#x27;m used to that from the ACV. I love the citrusy smell. Best of all, my hair was presentable immediately! I could style it, and it is soft and has a lot of body. Best of all, my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch!</li>
            <li> Tried it twice just to make sure and followed all instructions.  It left myhair looking like I have not washed them for a month and greased them with oil.  I have long straight dark hair.  Real bad.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re buying this in hopes it will get that waxy build-up out of your hair that Bronners soap leaves then give up now (&amp; go read my long review on Bronners Peppermint 32 oz where I tried this rinse in different dulution to no avail). It worked good after a homemade deep conditioning treatment, though it didn&#x27;t rinse all the oil out. The smell is ok, it&#x27;s not heavenly amazing like some claim, but its not compost trash smelling either like others said. It is citrusy but in a natural organic way if you know what I mean. I didn&#x27;t have issues with it globbing up, I mixed it in a small water bottle with a spout and shook it well. I&#x27;ve read elsewhere online to rinse with really cool water to help seal the hair shaft for better smoothness. Overall its ok, I&#x27;ll use this bottle but I probably won&#x27;t order another one.</li>
            <li> This product is magical. I had been using Dr Bronner&#x27;s castile soap to wash my hair without any conditioning, and my hair was dry and tangly. After I started using this hair rinse, it changed everything. It made my hair really shiny and soft, not greasy at all. It helps my scalp to produce less sebum. My scalp now feels light without the greasy feeling. I love Dr Bronner&#x27;s products, because I don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving unnatural chemicals in my body.</li>
            <li> The product is great and works well, it just doesn&#x27;t work the way I want on my hair. It didn&#x27;t make my hair feel as clean or soft as I generally like.</li>
            <li> I guess the formula has changed and it&#x27;s no longer clumpy. I love this stuff, as I no longer have a film from using castile and it makes my hair shiny and soft. I don&#x27;t mind the smell. My son loves it too. He used to have unruly Harry Potter hair that was weighed down by conditioners. Now it is fluffy and styles well.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else said - this stuff is kinda weird. It works well enough for my fine straight hair, but didn&#x27;t do any miracles. The smell is odd and probably would have made me sick when I was pregnant but doesn&#x27;t bother me too much now. Diluting it seems like a lot of work, and if you dilute it as much as the instructions say it just sorta all runs off and gets into your eyes and stings. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t use it on kids as it really hurts if you get it in your eyes or if you have any little cuts on your body. I tried it because we are working on turning our shower water into grey water for the garden but I am going to keep looking for other plant safe products....</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant buying this because of the reviews about it smelling bad. To me, this product has such a fresh citrusy scent, I love the fragrance. Not only that, but even after your hair is dry it leaves a light natural citrus scent without awful parfumey smells. Yes, the product looks ugly, but who cares?!  I used this by putting about one and a half capfuls to two capfuls of water (used a travel sized shampoo bottle to mix) squirted it on my scalp and throughout my hair, massaged in scalp and hair and rinsed well (be sure to rinse well). The results have exceeded my expectations. I have very limp hair on top, then frizzy and dry throughout. I&#x27;ve never had much body or shine, so when this rinse left my hair shiny and not flat, smelling good and reducing frizz, I was elated!! I only have to use 2-3 times a week so it&#x27;s lasting a long time. I will definitely order again and again!</li>
            <li> This rinse smells too sour and meaty (I suppose that&#x27;s the mushrooms) and that scent sticks to hair more than vinegar.  Good old diluted acetic acid gets my hair softer, too.  Three stars for quality ingredients and a trustworthy brand.</li>
            <li> I do not like having to mix and wait .  It takes too much time in the shower. the fragrance is really nice though.</li>
            <li> Smells real good. But be careful if you have any open areas or it will sting like mad if you use this.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance, but didn&#x27;t know when I bought it that it would have to be mixed.  Very inconvient when in the shower.</li>
            <li> Works great.  You don&#x27;t get that super silky feel to your hair that you get from regular conditioners, but that just means that you are not putting terrible chemicals on your hair. So happy to have switched to natural products.</li>
            <li> For those of you who don&#x27;t want to use the peroxide heavy, highlight activation sprays, \\&quot;Dr. Bronner&#x27;s\\&quot; conditioning hair rinse is a less harsh option (and no brassy tones!) Comb some of the concentrated rinse on areas you&#x27;d like to see highlighted, spend a few hours in the sun and presto! California dreamin&#x27;. I&#x27;ll never use harsh chemical activators, again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  I love how it makes my hair so shiny and manageable.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product! A little goes a long way and it leaves my hair feeling smooth and smelling wonderful. And knowing that there are no harsh chemicals in it makes me feel good about buying and using this product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works amazing, I love it more than the shiseido hair care products I was previously using. This makes my hair look naturally shiny and very beautiful. I will say this though every person(s) measurements may be different when you dilute the conditioner with water, I use my old conditioner bottle, and mix 6-7 cap fulls in about 16oz of bottled water. I have very hard tap water that makes my hair extra tangle prone. When I used less conditioner my hair was still VERY tangled and stuck. So i added more caps fulls and then i reached the desired light silky results. I also combine this with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Organic shikakai soap that i use as shampoo and body soap! This is so much better it does not have a basket full of chemicals and dyes. I will keep buying this product love it! I cant wait to try the other fragrances!</li>
            <li> I wash my hair with Dr Bronners castille soap &amp; then use this rinse as a conditioner. The smell is a little overpowering, but it does make hair soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li> 2nd time buying and I love it. Have searched for some alternatives to &#x27;normal&#x27; shampoos and ended up using a bar soap from the farmers market. Using this rinse helps my hair stay softer and less frizzy! I ended up pre-diluting it in an old bottle so I don&#x27;t have to mix it every time.</li>
            <li> untangles hair  fast just need to watch it doesn&#x27;t get into eyes as really good sting to it</li>
            <li> I used this with Doctor zbronner&#x27;s Hemp Rose soap. The combo smell was odd, but strangely compatible! Now, I am warning you, when I opened this I was NOT expecting it to look like liquid poop. I sort of stared at it in my hand debating if I wanted to out it on. The citrus, smell is very strong, but it does mellow out once you start massaging it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt really good after I worked it in and let it sit for a few minutes, and it dried pretty well but I didn&#x27;t think of it otherwise. The next morning I had gotten about a DOZEN people complimenting my hair about how it looked. I am definitely going to be buying this again!!!</li>
            <li> The directions say to use a cap full. I only use a 1/4 of that but I also have short hair, a ton of it but short. If I use more then that it looks greasy by then end of the day. I also use it in conjunction with the Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Organic Hand &amp; Body Shikakai Soap in Lavender. It does take a couple of weeks for your hair to adjust. just stick with it, it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this only once and that&#x27;s all that was needed. I wash my hair with baking soda and usually rinse with a 50/50 of apple cider vinegar and water. This left my hair actually feeling clean without feeling dry and dull. When my hair dried it had a nice golden shine to is as it is supposed to. I think I might love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This works well however it has a slightly off putting odor. It still has citrus smell but there Shikakai seems to add a unique smell that not everyone will like.</li>
            <li> I usually really like Dr.Bronners stuff but this product does not work as described. It smells very strong and made my scalp burn even though it gets diluted in water before you apply it. It also has a very strong smell and it made me cough as soon as I smelled it. The worsts part is that the supplierAmericaRx will not take the product back. They basically told me to go directly to the manufacture of the product. Im not very happy about this and will never buy another product from AmericaRx!</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I feel like I need to for this one. I&#x27;ve tried this product twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time I got it out of curiosity. I was using standard shampoo beforehand and then following up with this. It was lumpy and seemed to not do much, but I felt like I needed to use it since I paid a good amount for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Towards the end of the first bottle, I hadn&#x27;t used it for several months, and for about 5 weeks I had been doing the no-poo method (not using conventional shampoo). I was extremely frustrated because I was using apple cider vinegar as a rinse (as recommended by so many people doing no-poo) without any real success and no matter what I tried, it felt like I was going through the transition period over and over again. I have thick hair, some of it coarse, and the no-poo method has been challenging. I looked at this bottle and thought &amp;#34;why not?&amp;#34; - as soon as I put it on my hair, it *instantly* felt clean and cleaner than it had in weeks. I immediately ordered another bottle of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second bottle has the exact same ingredients, but Dr. Bronner&#x27;s has clearly listened to the complaints about the dark lumps. They now blend the mixture, which makes it easier to rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that this conditions very quickly, so I think that for people who are experiencing problems with it should try rinsing it out immediately after massaging it in. I personally see that my hair gets a little too oily by the end of the day, so I may also try reducing down to half a cap-full and see if that helps. This is just so much better for me than using an apple cider vinegar rinse, which just made my hair thicker and gummy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also does have a strong citrus scent and it does sting if you get it in your eyes or if your skin is sensitive. That said, it has worked really great for me, so I don&#x27;t mind those things very much. I do wish they had other options for the conditioning rinse like they do for their castile soap,but so far I&#x27;m pretty pleased with this.</li>
            <li> The smell. I can&#x27;t get past it. I went with baby mild soap instead, and just bought a different conditioner.</li>
            <li> A necessary product if you&#x27;re using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap on your hair. It works well, although the mixing is kind of a pain. I stopped using it when I had to stop using the soap on my hair, as my scalp dried out significantly. Not sure whether it was due to the soap or my dry skin conditions. Still recommended if you use the soap on your hair. It worked well on the hair (just not on my scalp).</li>
            <li> Did not work well on my hair at all, combined with the dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap/shampoo.  Left a strange residue on my hair, also made my hair extremely tangled and flat.  On top of the way this product left my hair, it&#x27;s extremely awkward to use as far as the diluting in the shower process goes.</li>
            <li> I really love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s but this product was average for me. I liked the smell, but the product inside the bottle was a little strange since it was a little thicker than I had thought. I would buy it again, but it is a little strange.</li>
