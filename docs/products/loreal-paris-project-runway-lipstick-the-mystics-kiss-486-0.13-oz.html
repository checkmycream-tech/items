            <li>IF YOU LIKE COLOR WITH A GLOSS FEEL AND DOES FEEL GOOD</li>
            <li>This lipstick is a beautiful color but when applied, it is not purple on the lips but is more of a berry tone.  </li>
            <li>BUT THIS IS NICE FOR THE MONEY AND FEEL GOOD ON THE LIPS.....</li>
            <li>I just love this lip stick!  </li>
            <li>Nice lipstick</li>
            <li>It is kind of a waxy texture</li>
            <li>This is a nice purple color.</li>
            <li>THIS IS NICE</li>
            <li>it was kind of like a fushia</li>
            <li>Glided on nicely.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s bold beautiful</li>
            <li>It is very light, and almost looks like a translucent version of that lipstick.</li>
            <li>I put layer after  layer about10× still very  light.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color that can become more intense with additional coats.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, has a nice sheen, but is semi-transparent (i.e. not opaque).</li>
            <li>Definitely not the best Loreal creation</li>
            <li>wont purchase any more</li>
            <li>The color was ok</li>
            <li>I feel this product is more like a tinted lip balm</li>
            <li>Still a happy buyer &amp; shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Love this one.  </li>
            <li>Love the L&#x27;Oreal fragrance.</li>
            <li>It is a lovely lavender color and goes on smooth and creamy.  </li>
            <li>But rubs off so easily.</li>
            <li>Its fine though.</li>
            <li>Looks cheap.</li>
            <li>It is gorgeous on, not dark or overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I was really excited when I opened the tube.</li>
            <li>It just the right shade of purple (flirty!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the color and ordered for a specific dress on an occasion.</li>
            <li>THIS IS TRUE TO COLOR...</li>
            <li>Anyway it is cool.</li>
            <li>lip color is true to color.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, just the right amount of shine, plus has a pleasant but subtle kind of fruity scent.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, the quality of lipstick if nice but don&#x27;t expect such a bold purple color that the tube presents.</li>
            <li>I wish I had ordered more than one because this is an instant favorite.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency of the lip color however its more red then purple.</li>
            <li>It came super fast and is really great quality, however if you are looking for a dark purple lipstick this is not for you.</li>
            <li>Since I have a darker hair color right now, this color works freak for me.</li>
            <li>The color is more of a light violet than anything else, and it smells like baby wipes (which can be a plus or a minus depending on the person).</li>
            <li>After applying multiple coats, it is still very very light and shimmery.</li>
            <li>As stated above, I love it.  </li>
            <li>Still pretty, but not what I was hoping for.  </li>

            <li>**)</li>
            <li>I was really expecting a purple one!</li>
            <li>Love the color but the application goes on too sheer.  </li>
            <li>Would consider more Loreal lip colors in the future.</li>
            <li>Nice lipstick, however the color is not exactly as it appears.</li>
            <li>The shipper provides fast service and quality products.</li>
            <li>It comes off more pink with a purple undertone.</li>
            <li>very.... purple.</li>
            <li>I lipsticks with rich deep coverage.</li>
            <li>i thought the color was dark like the picture, but its more like violet smh.</li>
            <li>highly dissapointed</li>
            <li>It reminds me more of a lipgloss that I&#x27;d find in my little sisters makeup bag than a lipstick.</li>
            <li>I was looking for much more of a dark purple, which this appears to be, though be warned -- it is definitely not dark purple.</li>
            <li>Mystic&#x27;s Kiss lipstick did not quite live up to a run way sensation with its competitors or consumers.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out on my lips and the smell really is as amazing as previous reviews</li>
            <li>It is a little bit sheer, i wish the color would be more vibrant</li>
            <li>The color is much darker than I expected and doesn&#x27;t have much pigment to it.</li>
            <li>found it thank u do much for selling such a hoot product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s instead more mauve or pinkish, A dark pink with purple tones.</li>
            <li>It is not nearly as dark as the picture shows.</li>
            <li>This makes your lips look like a light pink rather than dark purple.</li>
            <li>barely any color at all.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re looking for a dark colored lipstick this isn&#x27;t for you, it&#x27;s like a light purple, pink color</li>
            <li>used to shop a lot on Amazon, Now I am little less confident.</li>
            <li>this was a little too dark, but smooth on my lips.</li>
            <li>Seems to always be one or the other, highly pigmented but a texture like chalk, or non-drying but not so pigmented.</li>

            <li> In the case of lipstick, I&#x27;ll take the few swipes.</li>
            <li> Takes a few swipes to get the color you want, though, but at least it doesn&#x27;t feel like chalk.</li>
            <li> It didnt work at all, it was like a dark lip gloss that only covered partially and looked like crap.</li>
            <li> The composition of the lipstick base was adequate; however, the color of the lipstick did not correspond with application disappointing.</li>
            <li> It does not go on very thick and it does not stay.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected  :(</li>
            <li> and I was disappointed in the lipstick.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Paris Project Runway lipstick is lighter than it appears on screen.  It is a lovely lavender color and goes on smooth and creamy.  I Absolutely love it!!!</li>
            <li> the color looks nothing like pictured</li>
            <li> Had a rash reaction on lips. Stopped using it</li>
            <li> The product is NOTHING like the color pictured above. It is very light, and almost looks like a translucent version of that lipstick. Don&#x27;t waste your money if you are going for a dark lip. This makes your lips look like a light pink rather than dark purple.</li>
            <li> Nice lipstick but it isn&#x27;t dark like it looks. It&#x27;s almost a violet color. I plan to nombre with black so it will still work for me</li>
            <li> Two star because this item was already used when I opened it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the color and ordered for a specific dress on an occasion. So did not return as I needed it at that time. But I was not expecting this from amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to shop a lot on Amazon, Now I am little less confident.</li>
            <li> I love it. The color is perfect. 👍👍👍</li>
            <li> I got this because it looks like it&#x27;s going to go on purple. Giving a beautiful color. It&#x27;s instead more mauve or pinkish, A dark pink with purple tones. It goes on smooth, the quality of lipstick if nice but don&#x27;t expect such a bold purple color that the tube presents.</li>
            <li> As stated above, I love it.  It is gorgeous on, not dark or overpowering.  Wear it with the lip gloss that goes with it. Simply stunning!!!!</li>
            <li> I just love this lip stick!  It just the right shade of purple (flirty!)</li>
            <li> Nice lipstick, however the color is not exactly as it appears. It&#x27;s closer to a violet shade of purple than the actual purple that&#x27;s pictured</li>
            <li> I could have gone without ordering this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colour that I got is totally nothing like what is pictured in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall dont like the coverage, colour, nor the formula. Pass</li>
            <li> The color is much darker than I expected and doesn&#x27;t have much pigment to it. I had to mix it with another color.</li>
            <li> It is not nearly as dark as the picture shows. Its fine though. Nothing incredible.</li>
            <li> Use black liner and it darkens it.</li>
            <li> It didnt work at all, it was like a dark lip gloss that only covered partially and looked like crap. barely any color at all.</li>
            <li> Bought this for Halloween make-up, but the lipstick lasted all evening.</li>
            <li> Now this is my model  as I say lipstick it&#x27;s bold beautiful and I look good with this color I&#x27;m so glad I searched for a perfect purple and found it thank u do much for selling such a hoot product</li>
            <li> giving it to my family friend. this is the greatest product ever. i didn&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s going to do to her.</li>
            <li> This lipstick is a beautiful color but when applied, it is not purple on the lips but is more of a berry tone.  Still pretty, but not what I was hoping for.  It goes on smoothly, has a nice sheen, but is semi-transparent (i.e. not opaque).</li>
            <li> It does not go on very thick and it does not stay. It is kind of a waxy texture and I was disappointed in the lipstick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good lipstick I just wished it would&#x27;ve been darker</li>
            <li> Simply beautiful saturated berry color. Goes on smooth, just the right amount of shine, plus has a pleasant but subtle kind of fruity scent. I wish I had ordered more than one because this is an instant favorite.</li>
            <li> this was a little too dark, but smooth on my lips.</li>
            <li> This is a nice purple color. The shipper provides fast service and quality products. I will buy other products in the future.</li>
            <li> Color is not vibrant and dark enough. Looks cheap. Definitely not the best Loreal creation</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this color!!</li>
            <li> This lipstick is not quite what I&#x27;d expected. I was looking for much more of a dark purple, which this appears to be, though be warned -- it is definitely not dark purple. And if you&#x27;re looking for a matte finish, this is not the lipstick for you. After applying multiple coats, it is still very very light and shimmery. The color is more of a light violet than anything else, and it smells like baby wipes (which can be a plus or a minus depending on the person). It reminds me more of a lipgloss that I&#x27;d find in my little sisters makeup bag than a lipstick.</li>
            <li> THIS IS TRUE TO COLOR... HOWEVER THE DISPLAY PICTURE APPEARS TO BE DARKER-IT IS NOT.... THIS GOES ON PURPLE IT IS A VELVET GLOSS.......  (***THIS IS NOT A MATTE*** )THIS IS NICE IF YOU LIKE COLOR WITH A GLOSS FEEL AND DOES FEEL GOOD AND THE COLOR DOES APPEAR.......(*** HOWEVER IF YOU PREFERS A MATTE LIPSTICK- THIS IS NOT IT***) BUT THIS IS NICE FOR THE MONEY AND FEEL GOOD ON THE LIPS..... I PREFER MATTE.....</li>
            <li> The lipstick is too greasy.</li>
            <li> i thought the color was dark like the picture, but its more like violet smh.</li>
            <li> I thought this would have  great pigmentation but it does not.  It takes several swipes to put on color does not last I like the show but the lip stick is wack wont purchase any more</li>
            <li> The way this shade of purple is portrayed in the picture is not the way it will look on your lips. highly dissapointed</li>
            <li> I love the consistency of the lip color however its more red then purple. Also it does run so lip liner is a must. I have to keep applying to hold on to the depth.</li>
            <li> It came super fast and is really great quality, however if you are looking for a dark purple lipstick this is not for you. It comes off more pink with a purple undertone.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit sheer, i wish the color would be more vibrant but it is not. Anyway it is cool. i like it.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re looking for a dark colored lipstick this isn&#x27;t for you, it&#x27;s like a light purple, pink color</li>
            <li> The color was ok it was kind of like a fushia I&#x27;m into dark colors I was really expecting a purple one!</li>
            <li> Since I have a darker hair color right now, this color works freak for me. I would recommend it. Yay.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay on and I the color is lighter than it appears. I feel this product is more like a tinted lip balm</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I opened the tube. The lipstick is a little darker than the picture, but still very.... purple. Just what I wanted! Takes a few swipes to get the color you want, though, but at least it doesn&#x27;t feel like chalk. Seems to always be one or the other, highly pigmented but a texture like chalk, or non-drying but not so pigmented. In the case of lipstick, I&#x27;ll take the few swipes.</li>
            <li> But rubs off so easily. I mixed it with another lipstick &amp; only this way does it stay on longer. Still a happy buyer &amp; shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color that can become more intense with additional coats. Doesn&#x27;t dry out on my lips and the smell really is as amazing as previous reviews mentioned!&lt;br /&gt;The color is like a deep magenta.</li>
            <li> Not as deep as it looks...</li>
            <li> Mystic&#x27;s Kiss lipstick did not quite live up to a run way sensation with its competitors or consumers. The composition of the lipstick base was adequate; however, the color of the lipstick did not correspond with application disappointing.</li>
            <li> Lipstick is meant to be smeared.  Love this one.  Love the L&#x27;Oreal fragrance. Great for showing evidence of a great time.</li>
            <li> Love the color but the application goes on too sheer.  I lipsticks with rich deep coverage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as dark as I thought . I put layer after  layer about10× still very  light. Not what I expected  :(</li>
            <li> lip color is true to color. Glided on nicely. Would consider more Loreal lip colors in the future. Great product</li>
