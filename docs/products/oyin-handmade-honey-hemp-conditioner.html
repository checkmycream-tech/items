            <li>Clears out your hair beautifully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on my own hair (4b) and the results are similarly impressive.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy I tried it.  </li>
            <li>Great product from Oyin.  </li>
            <li>I am so in love with this product!!</li>
            <li>This conditioner softens hair,  has great slip and some good detangling properties.</li>
            <li>this is really good</li>

            <li>I love the smell!</li>

            <li>SURE YOU WANT AND LIKE OYIN PRODUCTS BEFORE SPENDING YOUR HARD-EARNED DOLLARS ON THEM!I</li>
            <li>, I freaking love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and it has a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It gives a lot of slip and rinses away easily.</li>
            <li>I was excited to use it...</li>
            <li>And the coupon isn&#x27;t even worth the amount I already paid for the conditioner!</li>
            <li>Great product; very helpful in de tangling my natural hair</li>
            <li>I love their products because they are natural and always have a lovely smell.  </li>
            <li>With this, the comb glides through her curls with no significant tangles — even in the most challenging areas — and her hair is nicely moisturized.</li>
            <li>It really softened up my hair during the conditioning process, it felt lovely.</li>
            <li>goodies are handmade, all natural, with ingredients that are not of hazardous materials.</li>
            <li>Where has this been all my life !, super moisturizing</li>
            <li>I am very &amp;#34;tender-headed&amp;#34; and I was able to comb right through my hair after using this product.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Thanks for contacting Oyin Handmade!</li>
            <li>Why in the world would I want to buy another product from them, when the first one didn&#x27;t work for me, AND they won&#x27;t refund it?</li>
            <li>This conditioner did not work well for my hair - leaving it dry and more tangled than before.</li>
            <li>My hair is very particular because it dislikes oils, shea, aloe, and/or butters.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s fine, I just wanted my money back.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s fine, I just wanted my money back.</li>
            <li>Yet, I can use this as a  deep conditioner and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>VERY</li>
            <li>My hair is curly, fine and always dry.</li>
            <li>I have fine strands that tend to be dry.  </li>
            <li>If this were a $5 conditioner, I would just toss it, but for the $20 I paid, I wanted a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller did respond promptly, so that was good, but their response was no good at all.</li>
            <li>I do believe that the hazardous materials thing is a standard message from amazon, and that this product is not actually hazardous, but it most certainly does not appear on all Amazon beauty products, so that was a just a flat out</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft and gentle</li>
            <li>Why would I waste any more of my money on their products??</li>
            <li>I ordered a 2 oz sample size directly from Oyin&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>I really like this conditioner, next time I will look for one that&#x27;s a bit thicker otherwise</li>
            <li>, Oyin offers me a $10 coupon.</li>
            <li>My daughter has extremely thick, curly hair (4A) that is prone to tangling and we have tried so many conditioners over the years with lackluster results.</li>
            <li>I will not rinse it completely out the next time, that should help.</li>
            <li>I did give stars for the smell, and for supporting a black owned business.</li>
            <li>I mean, maybe if they had offered me an online store credit (and free shipping) for the SAME AMOUNT as what I paid for this conditioner</li>
            <li>If you have very thick and/or long hair, I&#x27;d recommend getting the largest size because we go through a standard bottle pretty fast.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> This is a straight-up miracle product. My daughter has extremely thick, curly hair (4A) that is prone to tangling and we have tried so many conditioners over the years with lackluster results. With this, the comb glides through her curls with no significant tangles — even in the most challenging areas — and her hair is nicely moisturized. I&#x27;ve used it on my own hair (4b) and the results are similarly impressive. It gives a lot of slip and rinses away easily. Though some don&#x27;t like the smell, it doesn&#x27;t bother us. If you have very thick and/or long hair, I&#x27;d recommend getting the largest size because we go through a standard bottle pretty fast. I hope Oyin never stops making it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for products for my hair for some time and I must say that oyin honey hemp has made it to the top of my &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; list. I ended up ordering the 1 liter with pump.</li>
            <li> Great product; very helpful in de tangling my natural hair and it has a nice fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It really softened up my hair during the conditioning process, it felt lovely. Once I washed it out it wasn&#x27;t as nourishing. I will not rinse it completely out the next time, that should help.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and smells great!! I love their products because they are natural and always have a lovely smell.  I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> YES! YES! YES! I have 4b/4c low porosity hair. This conditioner softens hair,  has great slip and some good detangling properties. You may still need to use an additional leave in detangler if your hair is really coarse.  I also love the scent.  This is my go to conditioner.</li>
            <li> Love love! I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I ordered a 2 oz sample size directly from Oyin&#x27;s website. I was excited to use it... but my hair HATED it :( I couldn&#x27;t detangle, there was absolutely NO moisture, and it made my scalp itch :/ I had to deep condition my hair w/ cholesterol that evening to get this out! I did give stars for the smell, and for supporting a black owned business.</li>
            <li> Where has this been all my life !, super moisturizing</li>
            <li> I really like this conditioner, next time I will look for one that&#x27;s a bit thicker otherwise this is really good and I&#x27;m happy I tried it.  My hair is curly, fine and always dry. It was packaged well too by the shipper</li>
            <li> Really Good Product. Clears out your hair beautifully.</li>
            <li> This conditioner did not work well for my hair - leaving it dry and more tangled than before. That was disappointing, but hey, it happens. My reason for leaving a poor rating is not the product itself (although I didn&#x27;t like it at all), but the service I received after getting the product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this conditioner one time, and could immediately tell this wasn&#x27;t going to work for me. So I think \\&quot;ok, well that sucks, but I&#x27;ll return it, no harm done\\&quot;. When I click on the \\&quot;return\\&quot; button, I get a message saying \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.\\&quot; Um, WHAT?!?!?! Hazardous??? And of course there is no option to return the product. So I send a message to the seller (Oyin), asking them about this, and if can they please provide some way for me to get my money back. If this were a $5 conditioner, I would just toss it, but for the $20 I paid, I wanted a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller did respond promptly, so that was good, but their response was no good at all. Here&#x27;s what they wrote to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~ \\&quot;Thanks for contacting Oyin Handmade! We are extremely sorry to hear that you were disappointed in your Oyin experience!

What a joke! Why in the world would I want to buy another product from them, when the first one didn&#x27;t work for me, AND they won&#x27;t refund it? Why would I waste any more of my money on their products?? And the coupon isn&#x27;t even worth the amount I already paid for the conditioner! I mean, maybe if they had offered me an online store credit (and free shipping) for the SAME AMOUNT as what I paid for this conditioner, I might consider trying something else, but this coupon is just adding insult to injury. And even ifI got a discount, I would still have to pay for shipping too - so basically they&#x27;re just inviting me to waste more of my money on their products as their sort of lame \\&quot;apology\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize not all products will work for everyone - that&#x27;s fine, I just wanted my money back.

            <li> Luv aroma and the silky after feel.</li>
            <li> My hair is between 2a down in length to 3b/c, course, low density and low porosity. I cowash or shampoo and condish my hair and brush this through my hair in the shower but I don&#x27;t rinse it out. I scrunch and plop for about 7-10 minutes and air dry, I freaking love this stuff. I don&#x27;t use any other products. I love the smell! I want to post a picture but I don&#x27;t know how on my phone.</li>
            <li> The best! I have fine strands that tend to be dry.  Often my hair tangles and this stuff helps out the semi fluff used to be curly hair that has changed over time.</li>
            <li> Actually made the dye come out of my hair</li>
            <li> I use something else for deep conditioning, but nothing else gets a comb through my kids hair as well as this</li>
            <li> My hair is very particular because it dislikes oils, shea, aloe, and/or butters. My hair is low porosity. Yet, I can use this as a  deep conditioner and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with the Honey Wash shampoo and we noticed far less hair combing out.  It works to help maintain length of my hair.  Great product from Oyin.  I&#x27;m so glad I found Oyin, and so glad they sell on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and gentle</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product!! I am very &amp;#34;tender-headed&amp;#34; and I was able to comb right through my hair after using this product.</li>
