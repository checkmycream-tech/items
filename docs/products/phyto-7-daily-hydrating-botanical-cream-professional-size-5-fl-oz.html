            <li>love this product, light yet conditioning...</li>
            <li>Again I love that they are clean and can be layered without overkill on your hair.</li>
            <li>Based on the positive reviews I placed an order but after using the product as per the directions, I am puzzled as to why it&#x27;s so nicely rated.</li>
            <li>But I noticed, out of three products, one hasn&#x27;t arrived, the two that were delivered were not as advertised and cheap and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product as is the entire Phyto line of products.  </li>
            <li>Easily recommended, first used on a trip to France, been in love with this product ever since.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for re-hydrating your hair from all the heat you put on it from curling irons to flat irons, etc.</li>
            <li>It is also great for those you color your hair and need a little more hydration.</li>
            <li>Clean...</li>
            <li>My hair is suffering drought sometimes, so I am using leave in products after washing my hair,  and this one is so good because it is absorbing fast, and help the hair gets healther.</li>
            <li>It definitely helps my hair to look good.</li>
            <li>Good for use on dry hair</li>
            <li>(that contains 2 more plants and has a more oily feel), Phyto 9 is better suited for very dry or coarse hair.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing for dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li>Non-greasy, lightweight and effective for dry hair.</li>
            <li>I bought and paid for PhytoDefrissiant, which is a great product for my hair type, coarse, curly, and dry.</li>
            <li>For me, I did not notice any positive improvement; additionally, the product made my scalp itch.</li>
            <li>I love this product for my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>My biggest advice is if you order something, be certain its not being fulfilled by dutyfreebeauty because you might not get what you ordered, then they won&#x27;t off an exchange until you elevate it to Amazon.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without this product!!</li>
            <li>Gives my straight hair bounce and reduces fly-aways.  </li>
            <li>Thanks customer service</li>
            <li>no smells really</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product in my hair right before I blow dry it, and it makes it so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>No residue, no greasy feeling, no weird silicones, all natural ingredients that nourish and repair hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to use a tiny bit and apply several times during the day if your hair is very damaged.</li>
            <li>and when I wake up my hair is soft and pretty.</li>
            <li>this is a light cream that provides the moisture necessary for soft and not greasy hair</li>
            <li>Glad I got the big bottle because it will last a while.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Amazon credited me (they get high marks).  </li>
            <li>It certainly helps my hair feel soft and silky, and keeps it shiny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a complainer and have not been dissatisfied with any online purchases thus far except this one.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and supple even after heat styling.</li>
            <li>I have fine, slightly wavy hair - probably to light for thick, curly hair.</li>
            <li>The larger size (5oz) is a way better deal than the small size.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair which tends to be a somewhat dry, so I&#x27;ve used this product for a number of years, summer and winter, instead of the usual conditioners that get rinsed out.  </li>
            <li>So if you have thin blonde hair it might be good, but I don&#x27;t so can only say its not what I ordered and not for me.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have silicones in it that coat your hair and weight it down, it is actually absorbed into your hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t send it back because I&#x27;ve been too busy.</li>
            <li>It is essential for my naturally curly hair in the arid Colorado climate.</li>
            <li>I have thin, long color treated hair that has a mind of its own.</li>
            <li>It helps control my frizzy hair; but I do have to use more than suggested due to my thick hair.</li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down one bit.</li>
            <li>But I use a little bit everyday to keep my hair sleek and smooth.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought and paid for PhytoDefrissiant, which is a great product for my hair type, coarse, curly, and dry. I was sent this junk and well it is for people with nice smooth hair who want to build thicker strands. So if you have thin blonde hair it might be good, but I don&#x27;t so can only say its not what I ordered and not for me. My biggest advice is if you order something, be certain its not being fulfilled by dutyfreebeauty because you might not get what you ordered, then they won&#x27;t off an exchange until you elevate it to Amazon. But I noticed, out of three products, one hasn&#x27;t arrived, the two that were delivered were not as advertised and cheap and then this one which wasn&#x27;t even what I ordered. Amazon has become a storefront for crap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product sporadically over the years and every time I pick it back up I remember why I started using it.  Gives my straight hair bounce and reduces fly-aways.  A keeper.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without this product!!</li>
            <li> It came in a completely different package, a gold metal type tube. And it was dented all over! The product is not what I expected. It&#x27;s too slippery and doesn&#x27;t seem to hydrate my hair, just coats it. Dissatisfied. I didn&#x27;t send it back because I&#x27;ve been too busy. I&#x27;m not a complainer and have not been dissatisfied with any online purchases thus far except this one.</li>
            <li> I was given this product from my cosmetology instructor a few years ago for my coarse, curly, dry hair. I ran out and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere until now! It makes my hair look and feel healthy and helps it grow longer bc it strengthens it to avoid breakage. Nothing compares!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing for dry, curly hair. I use it so often I order the &#x27;backbar&#x27; size. Good for use on dry hair</li>
            <li> This product is great for re-hydrating your hair from all the heat you put on it from curling irons to flat irons, etc. It is also great for those you color your hair and need a little more hydration.</li>
            <li> Nice light non-greasy leave-in conditioner. I use it after I shower and let my hair air dry. It leaves my hair soft and supple even after heat styling. Very light almost nonexistent scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product as is the entire Phyto line of products.  Clean...all of them.  I use several of the Phyto products, Phytodefrisant, Phytocitrus shampoo, Phytomask for hair, and the Phyto 7..  Buy them; you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Again I love that they are clean and can be layered without overkill on your hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair which tends to be a somewhat dry, so I&#x27;ve used this product for a number of years, summer and winter, instead of the usual conditioners that get rinsed out.  After getting out of the shower and towel-drying my hair, I place a dime-sized amount of Phyto7 in the palm of my hand, rub my hands together, and run them through my hair.  I comb and roughly shape my hair in the manner in which I will eventually style it. Works great!</li>
            <li> It helps control my frizzy hair; but I do have to use more than suggested due to my thick hair.</li>
            <li> Before I ordered this product, I read the reviews. Based on the positive reviews I placed an order but after using the product as per the directions, I am puzzled as to why it&#x27;s so nicely rated. For me, I did not notice any positive improvement; additionally, the product made my scalp itch.</li>
            <li> I have short hair.  A very small amount of this product &amp;#34;seals&amp;#34; all my ends and is quickly absorbed. It makes styling easier and hair texture is not greasy.</li>
            <li> YES! It is essential for my naturally curly hair in the arid Colorado climate. ESSENTIAL! Plus easier to locate than looking for salons in Denver that stock Phyto products consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better than Phyto 7 Daily Hydrating Botanical Cream was Amazon removing the charges for Amazon Prime that I did not sign up for. Thanks customer service though you are Very Difficult to locate.</li>
            <li> My hair is suffering drought sometimes, so I am using leave in products after washing my hair,  and this one is so good because it is absorbing fast, and help the hair gets healther.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years in France and it is a great product. It&#x27;s like your face moisturizer but for hair. You only need a little bit and it is totally absorbed by the hair after a few minutes. No residue, no greasy feeling, no weird silicones, all natural ingredients that nourish and repair hair. I wash my hair at night, and I use this on dry hair in the morning to hydrate and treat the ends. It works great at taming flyaways also! If it feels weird on your hair, it means you used too much. It&#x27;s better to use a tiny bit and apply several times during the day if your hair is very damaged. I like Phyto 7 much better than Phyto 9 (that contains 2 more plants and has a more oily feel), Phyto 9 is better suited for very dry or coarse hair. It&#x27;s expensive but you only need like a hazelnut of product. Rub it in your hands and &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; your hair with your fingers starting at the ends.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and continue to love it. Non-greasy, lightweight and effective for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Easily recommended, first used on a trip to France, been in love with this product ever since.  The larger size (5oz) is a way better deal than the small size.  Great product at a good price (5oz)</li>
            <li> love this product, light yet conditioning...this is a light cream that provides the moisture necessary for soft and not greasy hair</li>
            <li> On a humid day, this is a lifesaver.  But I use a little bit everyday to keep my hair sleek and smooth.  This is my hidden weapon for a &amp;#34;good hair day&amp;#34;.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer/ leave in conditioner for all types of hair, seals cuticle and defines texture, smooths.</li>
            <li> I personally have never used this but my tech-challenged mom asks me to order her it every few months. She has frizzy,curly hair and uses it religiously.</li>
            <li> Package arrived with broken pieces in the tube.  Useless.  Amazon credited me (they get high marks).  Whoever packaged this deserves a demerit.  The cream itself I have used before is good but this shipment was not usable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product in my hair right before I blow dry it, and it makes it so soft and smooth. It is very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down one bit. I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for a good leave-in conditioner!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this leave in conditioner and I still love it. I put it on my hair when it&#x27;s towel dried, wrap it into a bun, go to bed and when I wake up my hair is soft and pretty. This really is different from other leave ins. It doesn&#x27;t have silicones in it that coat your hair and weight it down, it is actually absorbed into your hair. I have very fine long hair that is suuuuper dry due to going from dyed black but naturally dark brown, to platinum ash blonde (I don&#x27;t recommend doing this by the way) anyways... My hair is in a fragile state and this stuff has been a godsend. Glad I got the big bottle because it will last a while. Product has a slight earthy scent, almost like plants? If you can imagine(not bad though, just natural), but it is very faint and only smells right out of the tube. Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky, no smells really, u can put it on multiple times a day without build up, and all ingredients are water soluble. Awesome! Try it</li>
            <li> I love this product for my dry hair.  It works beautifully - I use it all the time as a leave - I use it at night and during the day. It definitely helps my hair to look good.</li>
            <li> I have thin, long color treated hair that has a mind of its own. I tried this on a whim... It certainly helps my hair feel soft and silky, and keeps it shiny.  It&#x27;s not a miracle product by any means, but I&#x27;m currently using Phyto shampoo &amp; conditioner and it compliments those products perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s unscented, and you only need a small amount. For my hair I only apply it to the ends, and avoid the roots so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;My ends don&#x27;t fly away any more either, which is a huge bonus!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it because i have not received the second portion of my order - I received only this 5 oz cream - not the 1.5 oz that I also ordered.  When I receive all my order I will rate it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s weightless, it makes your hair smoother and lighter. I have fine, slightly wavy hair - probably to light for thick, curly hair.</li>
    </ol>
