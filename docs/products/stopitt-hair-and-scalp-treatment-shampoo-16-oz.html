    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had terrible scalp issues which required me to shampoo my hair at least twice a week. I friend recommended Stopitt Hair and Scalp Treatment and since then I&#x27;ve seen a drastic changes, in that I am able go two weeks without shampooing my hair. I am not experiencing the flaking and itching that I use to before using that product. It really works!</li>
            <li> I love it, it works magic!!!</li>
            <li> Made my hair greasy and my scalp much worse with more noticable dandruff than before. It&#x27;s a dissapointing product.</li>
            <li> I have had dandruff for years. I&#x27;ve tried everything I could get my hands on, followed advice from professionals, family, friends, complete strangers. Nothing. Ordered this and their cream.... No more dandruff. Not just reduced dandruff. Not, no more only after a few hours after using. No more dandruff. Granted, if I go more than a week without using, it slowly returns. When used regularly, the dandruff is completely gone. The little growths of skin that I&#x27;ve scratched at for close to a decade and had feared were just scars of nails too sharp, are receding. One scar growth thing is completely gone. If you have scalp problems, I recommend this in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> For anyone who have a dandruff problem, this is the best product. My daughter had dandruff so bad it made my skin crawl.  You will see the different the first time you use this product. It is the best</li>
            <li> The medicinal smell is bad but would have been worth enduring if the shampoo worked by stopping dandruff as advertised. &amp;#34;Would have&amp;#34; being the operative words. If anything, my scalp has been more itchy than before.</li>
            <li> This is not a shampoo, it&#x27;s basically nothing!</li>
            <li> I had high expectations for this product based on other reviews, but this product didn&#x27;t work for me. I wanted to wait a few weeks before I wrote an honest review about this and to give this product a chance to prove itself. Needless to say, it failed. I&#x27;m still using the product because I paid for it and it doesn&#x27;t make sense to let it go to waste. It gets my hair clean and has a nice fragrance, it just didn&#x27;t tackle my embarrassing dandruff issue.</li>
            <li> The Only shampoo work for people who they suffering from dandruff is this.Works from the first use ,but doesn&#x27;t works for the itch...</li>
            <li> My husband has dandruff really really bad nothing was working so someone informed me of this product &amp;i must say he loves it &amp; so do i</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it all, T-Gel, Selsun Blue, Head &amp; Shoulders, you name it.  Then I was introduced to this very powerful (and very hard to get in Trinidad &amp; Tobago) product!!  I have an extremely severe case of dandruff/dry scalp and to me it is the most difficult thing to manage but Stop Itt has FINALLY given me some kind of hope that I can battle this.  I would recommend it to anyone struggling with dundruff/dry scalp issues simply because it works!!</li>
            <li> For three years, I&#x27;ve had horrible itching and dandruff, and I&#x27;ve tried everything I could find! One use and I noticed a difference. Since the second use, I haven&#x27;t seen a single flake, and NO MORE ITCHING! The smell is good, too. Not medicine-smelling like t-gel or some others.</li>
            <li> Anti dandruff shampoo that really works!!!</li>
            <li> very good stuff .  I have been using this for 2 weeks twice a week and it has significantly cleared up my scalp. I have fine ,colored hair. my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch and the scaling is reduced.</li>
            <li> I am a dandruff sufferer (worse in the winter when the weather is cold - my scalp just gets very dry, itchy, and flaky) and I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING. All the drugstore dandruff shampoos, all the &amp;#34;natural treatments&amp;#34; including tea tree oil and several Whole Foods dandruff shampoos and treatments,  I even spent a year doing the baking-soda-instead-of-shampoo, apple-cider-vinegar-instead-of-conditioner route and experienced absolutely no improvement, if anything, my dandruff was worse. I bought this product and it works like a charm. I use it once a week and my hair stays dandruff free the rest of the time. Amazing. Well worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Tried everything to control my dandruff and dry scalp finally found relieve with this product love it!!</li>
            <li> No harm no foul. Seems to be an OK shampoo, but didn&#x27;t do anything for my dry scalp or dandruff.</li>
            <li> I have always had itchy scalp and  nothing worked until I tried Stopitt shampoo the scalp cream is miraculous</li>
            <li> The shampoo and leave-in conditioner worked great at first for me, but after approx. one month my scalp &amp;#34;got used&amp;#34; to it and my flakes gradually came back. Every one&#x27;s scalps have different needs, and I will just keep alternating products for now. Just because it didn&#x27;t work long-term for me doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for you. I would recommend trying it and seeing if it helps you.</li>
            <li> Bought this after having used the cream</li>
