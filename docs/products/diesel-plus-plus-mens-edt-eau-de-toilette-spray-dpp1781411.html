            <li>ON TOP OF THAT</li>
            <li>A bit synthetic on top</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>Nothing can top this scent....</li>
            <li>I love Diesel plus plus, have not been able to find this product in stores.  </li>
            <li>Out of all the Diesel fragrances this has to be my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love this one..</li>
            <li>, I said love...</li>
            <li>..It was ok...</li>
            <li>&quot; Need i say more?</li>
            <li>I totally love it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>This is a magic bottle with a genie inside it, for the price you should never tell anyone.  </li>
            <li>Plus Plus for sure.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?  </li>
            <li>I find Plus Plus to be the most versatile (Zero</li>
            <li>Its underwhelming in a way that is actually refreshing.</li>
            <li>When I was younger I used this cologne and I fell in love with it, I received the product within time and still am impressed by the smell.</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve bought more bottles.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, has a creamy/milky scent with a vanilla hint to it.</li>
            <li>The size, price, fragance it is ok for me.</li>
            <li>People always love when I wear this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.....</li>
            <li>The parfume has a very unique scent and it grows on the women around you more than it does on you...</li>
            <li>i love this perfume cause the scent is like so friendly so nice..</li>
            <li>As for the scent itself, it&#x27;s very unique...</li>
            <li>A classic smell at a great price.  </li>
            <li>You get a totally different aroma, very pleasant.</li>
            <li>While it does smell pretty good</li>
            <li>Plus Plus because of its somewhat good rating, its good value per ounce, its popularity, and that it was sold direct from Amazon, making use of the Super Saver Shipping with a bundle ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very pleased with my purchase, super fast delivery and safe!</li>
            <li>but i dont enjoy it because i got charge more than i found on amazon.</li>
            <li>This is an INCREDIBLE cologne they never should have stopped marketing/producing on a massive level.  </li>
            <li>It was a good deal and fast also.</li>
            <li>This stuff if over-sprayed will get cloying so be easy on the trigger.</li>
            <li>Product came very quickly and as described.     </li>
            <li>.. Use it as strong or as week as you want...</li>
            <li>For a low price you can enjoy a delicious smell, just for everyday use or special occasions, always perfect.</li>
            <li>I thought this smelled OK, too sweet for my liking.</li>
            <li>It is a sweet, aromatic fragrance that no one has ever told me they didn&#x27;t like, and through the course of the day it smells better as it mixes with your perspiration, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, great quality, exactly what I expected with low cost nice presentation</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fully satisfied, fulfilled expectations, sweet aroma, desired size</li>
            <li>smells just ok, not bad and not so well.</li>
            <li>Its a nice delicious sweet smelling cologne, not over powering but really lasts long.</li>
            <li>Keep it to two sprays, the nozzle isn&#x27;t too fine.    </li>
            <li>This perfume is one of the best, its aroma and quality are second to none, so when the end would be willing to buy another</li>
            <li>Approved by the super price!</li>
            <li>Wears very nicely and goes on strong, so you do not need to bathe in it to make it stay with you for hours or pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much from Diesel Plus Plus, but this scent is very good as an every day going to the office, out for a quick bite, type of smell.   </li>
            <li>CHEAP PRINT ON THE BOTTLE.</li>
            <li>this was my second purchase ever on Amazon, and I wasn&#x27;t all that happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>sweet but not sickening.  </li>
            <li>Start with smooth coconut, then add a bit of spice as you&#x27;d find in cider.</li>
            <li>the Plus Plus scent even though I was prejudiced in thinking \\&quot;true\\&quot; cologne cannot be this cheap.</li>
            <li>Its ok¡ Cheap an nice¡</li>
            <li>have loved this cologne for a long time, and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in a while.</li>
            <li>The cologne is super cheap and as a result I think it smells cheap as well.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly , and overall I am happy with this purchase .</li>
            <li>Definitely a unique scent that is powdery and fruity/sweet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not the original fragrance , since the original one was discontinued a while ago,so I have to take couple of stars off.</li>
            <li>So glad i was able to find it on here and did not have to go through another company with the potential of having problems, also love the fact it is eligible for free super saver shipping.    </li>
            <li>Perfect to wear on a daily basis, very fresh and young and cool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and sweet-smelling.</li>
            <li>good and fast shipping thank you and nature, much nicer than the picture</li>
            <li>It has an amazing sweet smell that my girlfriend cant get enough of :)</li>
            <li>and i found it cool.</li>
            <li>this cologne I will have to say is out of my top 5 is my absolute one .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how to explain it better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in times like these, how can you not jump on a chance to get a scent this good for SUCH a bargain!!!</li>
            <li>Has a hint of almost a sweet milkiness to it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad fragrance...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad fragrance...</li>
            <li>no bad reviews from people.</li>
            <li>not necessarily a bad thing though.</li>
            <li>Not a bad cologne to wear around the house</li>
            <li>However I noticed if I spray a cloud in front of me and walk into it that it smells immediately  of fresh linen, clean skin, and has an almost coffee creamer type scent.</li>
            <li>I recomend this buyer it is quick and responsable and the thing a bought</li>
            <li>lazy but exellent product grat timing and price very good</li>
            <li>you enjoy it as much as a do!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery....very reasonable pricing ......and most important</li>
            <li>He loves it, and I think it&#x27;s a great fragrance; not too sweet, and a little like pipe tobacco.</li>
            <li>It does look exactly as  the original one though.</li>
            <li>someone unique willing to stand out...</li>
            <li>this is an everyday great smelling Cologne</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you however its still enticing and intriguing  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like it, then you&#x27;ll still have money to buy a different kind.</li>
            <li>Even old fashioned Brut smells better than the men&#x27;s Diesel.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite cologne by far.</li>
            <li>In a good way, it&#x27;s definitely different, but ladies like it but don&#x27;t use too much a spray or two will do.</li>
            <li>Good smelling Cologne for any season.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for a daily basis, very fresh and young and</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li>I ordered this on a whim because of the name, price, and other reviews - it was a gift, and not only was it liked by the recipient, but I liked it a lot and plan on ordering a bottle for myself.  </li>
            <li>It smelled cheap to me, i expected more from Diesel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the quality I expected for the price I paid, I have no complaints whatsoever, I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much for all about it.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>Milky, sweet, a touch of spices, slightly woodsy, very sexy and intimate.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I layer this with Raw Vanilla for a particularly excellent hint of vanilla/bamboo on a budget.</li>
            <li>I bought one of this a few years ago and i loved it since the first time i worn it.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>Do yourself, or your kid, a favor and spare the latest cliche from Hollister or American Eagle.</li>
            <li>the description of item is exact according to display in the website</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a very unique but not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that I ordered three for the low low price and am good for at least a year...</li>
            <li>A milk box and pure white bottle, lovely.</li>
            <li>Im certainly purchasing more in the future</li>
            <li>Different in every way, but a good kinda different.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re smart, try it at a store first</li>
            <li>When first spraying the cologne it has a very run of the mill, soapy, Rx store scent.</li>
            <li>The first bottle I received was loose at the top and leaking.</li>
            <li>, REALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, VERY FAST, PROCEDURE WELL, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING</li>
            <li>especially if you like sweet smelling colognes like I do well recommended seller and worth the buy.</li>
            <li>It certainly does have a milky scent.</li>
            <li>It has a refreshing and unique scent which I can&#x27;t find anywhere else, not too masculine or feminine, I always keep an eye out for these as they are hard to come by, if you have not tried it before, it is quite worth a try!</li>
            <li>The scent is a little feminine, but it&#x27;s quite nice.</li>
            <li>The bottle and packaging is really chic, but the scent itself smells like a locker room.  </li>
            <li>but I really like it</li>
            <li>The product was shipped extremely fast and I wasn&#x27;t planning on receiving it before Christmas</li>
            <li>This item is really as I wanted.</li>
            <li>Smells like a warm, cozy dream.</li>
            <li>when i got the cologne i was surprise because i got charge for shipping its supose to be free plus the regular price i was so made .</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a mock off, its the real thing.</li>
            <li>Plus Plus if your the type of guy that wants a \\&quot;throw-away\\&quot; bottle of cologne to keep in the car, office, or travel bag.</li>
            <li>&#x27;m not much given to repeat perfumes, but this is one of my favorite.</li>
            <li>I like this scent very much.&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li>I was really hoping that I&#x27;ll keep buying thank you</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a unique smell and definitely not for the truck driver type, or the conservative type, it&#x27;s for the sporty, athletic type,</li>
            <li>Once you let the pungent alcohol scent dissipate, you&#x27;re left with a smooth, almost milky aroma; think about what a new car should smell like.</li>
            <li>The bottle is bit small but nice.</li>
            <li>Yea it may seem a bit of a younger scent, but it&#x27;s great for casual and light activities (beach, bbq, hanging out with friends, etc).</li>
            <li>can tell you that it smells more flowery than the others and kind of like a room aromatizer, I know I&#x27;ve smelled this in a living room before, but my family tells me that I&#x27;m crazy...</li>
            <li>It may last you 3-4 hours if you&#x27;re lucky or unlucky if it isn&#x27;t what you like</li>
            <li>and you have a cologne for men that has an empirical positive effect on women.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cologne and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>i will say though that the scent disappears after a few hours but luckily one spray is more than enough per use.</li>
            <li>Perhaps even a little more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it is an EDT just 2 sprays ought to get you set for a while without coming out too strong and tacky, because as said by other reviewers, while the atomizer is not squirting the product, it is not one of the finest atomizers I&#x27;ve encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A bit sweeter than what I normally go for, but still a hint of freshness, making this a winner of a cologne.</li>
            <li>I might have to pick up a few more bottles as it has been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Although it took a couple of extra days to arrive, it was worth waiting.</li>
            <li>I tend to think all cologne in this price range smell pretty similar for the most part, however this definitely has a different smell.</li>
            <li>Great cologne for casual use.</li>
            <li>The packages are left right by the road on the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow this one really shocked me, sweet, sugary, syrupy scent with great projection and longevity.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but I wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li>For those new to Diesel fragrances (perhaps you were also drawn by the brand/price), they&#x27;ve got four mainstream scents.</li>
            <li>For such a cheap scent this is actually quality juice.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft and subtle, not over powering, the type of cologne you could wear daily as it really isn&#x27;t an intrusive scent and more of a complimentary one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be able to do any updates later on, but I felt compelled to inform other to-be shoppers about their surprise if they haven&#x27;t bought this before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be able to do any updates later on, but I felt compelled to inform other to-be shoppers about their surprise if they haven&#x27;t bought this before.    </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve used more recently some of the varieties from Adidas (for casual going out), Tommy Hilfiger (EDT), and Hugo Boss for more formal outings</li>
            <li>Only lasts about half the day, but still its very cheap, so what do you expect?</li>
            <li>I know it&#x60;s an old perfume</li>
            <li>I purchased again recently and a very fashionable lady in my office said, \\&quot;You smell like a Lord.\\</li>
            <li>I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 13-year old.</li>
            <li>only i really dnt like it .</li>
            <li>Amazon fixed it and sent me another bottle.</li>
            <li>Plus is rather short (2-3hrs), but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me, because I&#x27;m not utilizing it</li>
            <li>Sorta bought this blind on his recommend and based on his sniffer&#x27;s taste, not really sure what to expect - turned out great!!!</li>
            <li>The scent of this fragrance differs slightly from the original from Diesel, but its close enough for me to like it.</li>
            <li>Packaging is nice with the little milk carton thing and the bottle is a nice cold ceramic, but my bottle was scuffed up the side a bit with a small black streak, and the cap goes on crooked because the top is bent.  </li>
            <li>I would have to say that women enjoy the scent, but its just not a going out on a date or late night</li>
            <li>Only had a couple of women thus far compliment on it, nothing like Azzaro or Ferrera.</li>
            <li>One is apparently for Diesel shoes.</li>
            <li>As a few reviewers stated, its a milky aroma but fresh like after a shower.</li>
            <li>Powerful but yet not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I was a little thrown off at first thinking that it smelled like a woman&#x27;s fragrance, but some women&#x27;s initial reaction&#x27;s</li>
    </ol>

            <li> ON TOP OF THAT</li>
            <li> A bit synthetic on top</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> Nothing can top this scent....</li>
            <li> I love Diesel plus plus, have not been able to find this product in stores.  </li>

            <li> I love this one..</li>
            <li> , I said love...</li>
            <li> ..It was ok...</li>
            <li> &quot; Need i say more?</li>
            <li> I totally love it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> This is a magic bottle with a genie inside it, for the price you should never tell anyone.  </li>
            <li> Plus Plus for sure.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?  </li>
            <li> I find Plus Plus to be the most versatile (Zero</li>
            <li> Its underwhelming in a way that is actually refreshing.</li>
            <li> When I was younger I used this cologne and I fell in love with it, I received the product within time and still am impressed by the smell.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve bought more bottles.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, has a creamy/milky scent with a vanilla hint to it.</li>
            <li> The size, price, fragance it is ok for me.</li>
            <li> People always love when I wear this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.....</li>
            <li> The parfume has a very unique scent and it grows on the women around you more than it does on you...</li>
            <li> i love this perfume cause the scent is like so friendly so nice..</li>
            <li> As for the scent itself, it&#x27;s very unique...</li>
            <li> A classic smell at a great price.  </li>
            <li> You get a totally different aroma, very pleasant.</li>
            <li> While it does smell pretty good</li>
            <li> Plus Plus because of its somewhat good rating, its good value per ounce, its popularity, and that it was sold direct from Amazon, making use of the Super Saver Shipping with a bundle ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase, super fast delivery and safe!</li>
            <li> but i dont enjoy it because i got charge more than i found on amazon.</li>
            <li> This is an INCREDIBLE cologne they never should have stopped marketing/producing on a massive level.  </li>
            <li> It was a good deal and fast also.</li>
            <li> This stuff if over-sprayed will get cloying so be easy on the trigger.</li>
            <li> Product came very quickly and as described.     </li>
            <li> .. Use it as strong or as week as you want...</li>
            <li> For a low price you can enjoy a delicious smell, just for everyday use or special occasions, always perfect.</li>
            <li> I thought this smelled OK, too sweet for my liking.</li>
            <li> It is a sweet, aromatic fragrance that no one has ever told me they didn&#x27;t like, and through the course of the day it smells better as it mixes with your perspiration, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great quality, exactly what I expected with low cost nice presentation</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fully satisfied, fulfilled expectations, sweet aroma, desired size</li>
            <li> smells just ok, not bad and not so well.</li>
            <li> Its a nice delicious sweet smelling cologne, not over powering but really lasts long.</li>
            <li> Keep it to two sprays, the nozzle isn&#x27;t too fine.    </li>
            <li> This perfume is one of the best, its aroma and quality are second to none, so when the end would be willing to buy another</li>
            <li> Approved by the super price!</li>
            <li> Wears very nicely and goes on strong, so you do not need to bathe in it to make it stay with you for hours or pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much from Diesel Plus Plus, but this scent is very good as an every day going to the office, out for a quick bite, type of smell.   </li>
            <li> CHEAP PRINT ON THE BOTTLE.</li>
            <li> this was my second purchase ever on Amazon, and I wasn&#x27;t all that happy with the product.  </li>
            <li> sweet but not sickening.  </li>
            <li> Start with smooth coconut, then add a bit of spice as you&#x27;d find in cider.</li>
            <li> the Plus Plus scent even though I was prejudiced in thinking \\&quot;true\\&quot; cologne cannot be this cheap.</li>
            <li> Its ok¡ Cheap an nice¡</li>
            <li> have loved this cologne for a long time, and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in a while.</li>
            <li> The cologne is super cheap and as a result I think it smells cheap as well.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly , and overall I am happy with this purchase .</li>
            <li> Definitely a unique scent that is powdery and fruity/sweet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not the original fragrance , since the original one was discontinued a while ago,so I have to take couple of stars off.</li>
            <li> So glad i was able to find it on here and did not have to go through another company with the potential of having problems, also love the fact it is eligible for free super saver shipping.    </li>
            <li> Perfect to wear on a daily basis, very fresh and young and cool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean and sweet-smelling.</li>
            <li> good and fast shipping thank you and nature, much nicer than the picture</li>
            <li> It has an amazing sweet smell that my girlfriend cant get enough of :)</li>
            <li> and i found it cool.</li>
            <li> this cologne I will have to say is out of my top 5 is my absolute one .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to explain it better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in times like these, how can you not jump on a chance to get a scent this good for SUCH a bargain!!!</li>
            <li> Has a hint of almost a sweet milkiness to it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not a bad fragrance...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad fragrance...</li>
            <li> no bad reviews from people.</li>
            <li> not necessarily a bad thing though.</li>
            <li> Not a bad cologne to wear around the house</li>
            <li> However I noticed if I spray a cloud in front of me and walk into it that it smells immediately  of fresh linen, clean skin, and has an almost coffee creamer type scent.</li>
            <li> I recomend this buyer it is quick and responsable and the thing a bought</li>
            <li> lazy but exellent product grat timing and price very good</li>
            <li> you enjoy it as much as a do!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery....very reasonable pricing ......and most important</li>
            <li> He loves it, and I think it&#x27;s a great fragrance; not too sweet, and a little like pipe tobacco.</li>
            <li> It does look exactly as  the original one though.</li>
            <li> someone unique willing to stand out...</li>
            <li> this is an everyday great smelling Cologne</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you however its still enticing and intriguing  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like it, then you&#x27;ll still have money to buy a different kind.</li>
            <li> Even old fashioned Brut smells better than the men&#x27;s Diesel.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite cologne by far.</li>
            <li> In a good way, it&#x27;s definitely different, but ladies like it but don&#x27;t use too much a spray or two will do.</li>
            <li> Good smelling Cologne for any season.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for a daily basis, very fresh and young and</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s right</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim because of the name, price, and other reviews - it was a gift, and not only was it liked by the recipient, but I liked it a lot and plan on ordering a bottle for myself.  </li>
            <li> It smelled cheap to me, i expected more from Diesel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the quality I expected for the price I paid, I have no complaints whatsoever, I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase!</li>
            <li> Thank you very much for all about it.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Milky, sweet, a touch of spices, slightly woodsy, very sexy and intimate.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I layer this with Raw Vanilla for a particularly excellent hint of vanilla/bamboo on a budget.</li>
            <li> I bought one of this a few years ago and i loved it since the first time i worn it.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> Do yourself, or your kid, a favor and spare the latest cliche from Hollister or American Eagle.</li>
            <li> the description of item is exact according to display in the website</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a very unique but not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that I ordered three for the low low price and am good for at least a year...</li>
            <li> A milk box and pure white bottle, lovely.</li>
            <li> Im certainly purchasing more in the future</li>
            <li> Different in every way, but a good kinda different.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re smart, try it at a store first</li>
            <li> When first spraying the cologne it has a very run of the mill, soapy, Rx store scent.</li>
            <li> The first bottle I received was loose at the top and leaking.</li>
            <li> , REALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, VERY FAST, PROCEDURE WELL, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING</li>
            <li> especially if you like sweet smelling colognes like I do well recommended seller and worth the buy.</li>
            <li> It certainly does have a milky scent.</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing and unique scent which I can&#x27;t find anywhere else, not too masculine or feminine, I always keep an eye out for these as they are hard to come by, if you have not tried it before, it is quite worth a try!</li>
            <li> The scent is a little feminine, but it&#x27;s quite nice.</li>
            <li> The bottle and packaging is really chic, but the scent itself smells like a locker room.  </li>
            <li> but I really like it</li>
            <li> The product was shipped extremely fast and I wasn&#x27;t planning on receiving it before Christmas</li>
            <li> This item is really as I wanted.</li>
            <li> Smells like a warm, cozy dream.</li>
            <li> when i got the cologne i was surprise because i got charge for shipping its supose to be free plus the regular price i was so made .</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a mock off, its the real thing.</li>
            <li> Plus Plus if your the type of guy that wants a \\&quot;throw-away\\&quot; bottle of cologne to keep in the car, office, or travel bag.</li>
            <li> &#x27;m not much given to repeat perfumes, but this is one of my favorite.</li>
            <li> I like this scent very much.&lt;br /&gt;Con</li>
            <li> I was really hoping that I&#x27;ll keep buying thank you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a unique smell and definitely not for the truck driver type, or the conservative type, it&#x27;s for the sporty, athletic type,</li>
            <li> Once you let the pungent alcohol scent dissipate, you&#x27;re left with a smooth, almost milky aroma; think about what a new car should smell like.</li>
            <li> The bottle is bit small but nice.</li>
            <li> Yea it may seem a bit of a younger scent, but it&#x27;s great for casual and light activities (beach, bbq, hanging out with friends, etc).</li>
            <li> can tell you that it smells more flowery than the others and kind of like a room aromatizer, I know I&#x27;ve smelled this in a living room before, but my family tells me that I&#x27;m crazy...</li>
            <li> It may last you 3-4 hours if you&#x27;re lucky or unlucky if it isn&#x27;t what you like</li>
            <li> and you have a cologne for men that has an empirical positive effect on women.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cologne and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> i will say though that the scent disappears after a few hours but luckily one spray is more than enough per use.</li>
            <li> Perhaps even a little more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it is an EDT just 2 sprays ought to get you set for a while without coming out too strong and tacky, because as said by other reviewers, while the atomizer is not squirting the product, it is not one of the finest atomizers I&#x27;ve encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A bit sweeter than what I normally go for, but still a hint of freshness, making this a winner of a cologne.</li>
            <li> I might have to pick up a few more bottles as it has been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Although it took a couple of extra days to arrive, it was worth waiting.</li>
            <li> I tend to think all cologne in this price range smell pretty similar for the most part, however this definitely has a different smell.</li>
            <li> Great cologne for casual use.</li>
            <li> The packages are left right by the road on the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow this one really shocked me, sweet, sugary, syrupy scent with great projection and longevity.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but I wanted to try something new.  </li>
            <li> For those new to Diesel fragrances (perhaps you were also drawn by the brand/price), they&#x27;ve got four mainstream scents.</li>
            <li> For such a cheap scent this is actually quality juice.  </li>
            <li> It is very soft and subtle, not over powering, the type of cologne you could wear daily as it really isn&#x27;t an intrusive scent and more of a complimentary one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be able to do any updates later on, but I felt compelled to inform other to-be shoppers about their surprise if they haven&#x27;t bought this before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be able to do any updates later on, but I felt compelled to inform other to-be shoppers about their surprise if they haven&#x27;t bought this before.    </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve used more recently some of the varieties from Adidas (for casual going out), Tommy Hilfiger (EDT), and Hugo Boss for more formal outings</li>
            <li> Only lasts about half the day, but still its very cheap, so what do you expect?</li>
            <li> I know it&#x60;s an old perfume</li>
            <li> I purchased again recently and a very fashionable lady in my office said, \\&quot;You smell like a Lord.\\</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 13-year old.</li>
            <li> only i really dnt like it .</li>
            <li> Amazon fixed it and sent me another bottle.</li>
            <li> Plus is rather short (2-3hrs), but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me, because I&#x27;m not utilizing it</li>
            <li> Sorta bought this blind on his recommend and based on his sniffer&#x27;s taste, not really sure what to expect - turned out great!!!</li>
            <li> The scent of this fragrance differs slightly from the original from Diesel, but its close enough for me to like it.</li>
            <li> Packaging is nice with the little milk carton thing and the bottle is a nice cold ceramic, but my bottle was scuffed up the side a bit with a small black streak, and the cap goes on crooked because the top is bent.  </li>
            <li> I would have to say that women enjoy the scent, but its just not a going out on a date or late night</li>
            <li> Only had a couple of women thus far compliment on it, nothing like Azzaro or Ferrera.</li>
            <li> One is apparently for Diesel shoes.</li>
            <li> As a few reviewers stated, its a milky aroma but fresh like after a shower.</li>
            <li> Powerful but yet not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> I was a little thrown off at first thinking that it smelled like a woman&#x27;s fragrance, but some women&#x27;s initial reaction&#x27;s</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> To understand my thinking, my favorite scent to wear is Burberry Brit, followed closely by Burberry London, and Polo Black and Armani Code close behind that.</li>
            <li> long lasting as well</li>
            <li> is, it doesnt last very long.</li>
            <li> Factor in a woody, masculine backbone and just a hit of a slightly tart fruit scent</li>
            <li> choosing to buy it or not, I didn&#x27;t pay attention to up-close images of the product: It&#x27;s a little ridiculous to have it in a Milk carton, and to have a cow with a pseudo-hologram image on the carton itself; it&#x27;s creative, but</li>
            <li> (although I&#x27;m sure it tastes pretty bad as well, but hey, 80% alchohol by volume!)</li>
            <li> Jovan Musk,(neither in a long time as my tastes have changed)</li>
            <li> I has this cologne a long time ago</li>
            <li> Wear this when you don&#x27;t want to waste the good stuff around people you don&#x27;t like or an ugly date you were suckered into by your homeboy who needed to bring a guy so his girl could bring her friend for a double date.</li>
            <li> used to have it long time ago</li>
            <li> Masculine heavy smell.</li>
            <li> I purchased this without smelling it due to the low price and quality reviews.</li>
            <li> However, I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong in that line of thinking!</li>
            <li> Only a few negatives</li>
            <li> He had sampled it while on vacation, but it turned out to be harder to find than I expected.</li>
            <li> My driveway is 40 foot wide</li>
            <li> it is as expected buy a recomend them</li>
            <li> I was chocked when I received an empty bottle today.</li>
            <li> Not great at first but is tolerable after it settles down a bit.  </li>
            <li> (I know, I&#x27;m not smart)</li>
            <li> I, like other reviewers, went ahead and got the Diesel</li>
            <li> and I have to say that the Diesel Plus Plus is unlike any one of these other fragrances when it comes to men&#x27;s perfumes.</li>
            <li> Not overwhelming when applied properly.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the pump (nozzle) seems to be slightly defective.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s nothing that is distinctly bad, it certainly has a scent that is outside of my preference.</li>
            <li> THE BOTTLE CAP GOT STUCK HALF WAY.</li>
            <li> it rains,,, it is a mess.</li>
            <li> so they do not have to put their trucks in reverse to turn around,,, but they are to lazy to leave packages at the front, side, or back door,,, or at least within 5 feet of my home.</li>
            <li> The clossing system came with a little dent and some cologne came out from it.</li>
            <li> but I wish the smell was a little stronger and lasted longer, which is for the 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I have to pump it a few times every time I use before it will spray.</li>
            <li> as this is flammable.and they said you have two choice destroy it or return it to you with 15 $ .  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been complimented on it quite a few times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple of days of wearing it, and getting used to it, the smell is less shocking and somewhat refreshing.</li>
            <li> but after a fe times use there was no more spill.  </li>
            <li> Dont buy this perfume, you would get it broken and the content empty.</li>
            <li> I usually order this item with no problems.</li>
            <li> but once it settles down it reminds me very much of a poor mans Paco Rabanne&#x27;s One Million.  </li>
            <li> that a number of negative reviews below have to do with packaging.</li>
            <li> What I mean is that I&#x27;m 24 and this smells like a teeny-boppers cologne.</li>
            <li> dumb, unless I knew their advertising strategy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was the least expensive on site unfortanetly cologne does not stay on u longer than an hr but on ur clothes for three?</li>
            <li> In my country this product is some expensive</li>
            <li> Life is complicated.</li>
            <li> SORRY NO WHERE I GET MY PERFUME ...</li>
            <li> I would even go to say you can use it for work or around a casual office.</li>
            <li> AND THIS IS JUST A BAD COPY OF IT.</li>
            <li> vry mch disappointed bcaz</li>
            <li> and i was really disappointed with the smell.</li>
            <li> but when you try to wear it out for a night, no one can tell you have it on. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> ThePerfumeSpot WORST BUY EVER.</li>
            <li> And the worst thing is that you cant ask them for a return</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> good company as I got my product the best price, arrived on time and without problems</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim because of the name, price, and other reviews - it was a gift, and not only was it liked by the recipient, but I liked it a lot and plan on ordering a bottle for myself.  It&#x27;s clean and sweet-smelling.</li>
            <li> I bought one of this a few years ago and i loved it since the first time i worn it. In my country this product is some expensive and i&#x27;m very pleased for finding it here at amazon.</li>
            <li> I, like other reviewers, went ahead and got the Diesel Plus Plus because of its somewhat good rating, its good value per ounce, its popularity, and that it was sold direct from Amazon, making use of the Super Saver Shipping with a bundle ship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Halston Z-14, Jovan Musk,(neither in a long time as my tastes have changed), I&#x27;ve used more recently some of the varieties from Adidas (for casual going out), Tommy Hilfiger (EDT), and Hugo Boss for more formal outings and I have to say that the Diesel Plus Plus is unlike any one of these other fragrances when it comes to men&#x27;s perfumes. I was a little thrown off at first thinking that it smelled like a woman&#x27;s fragrance, but some women&#x27;s initial reaction&#x27;s is that it doesn&#x27;t smell like a women&#x27;s perfume at all.&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you that it smells more flowery than the others and kind of like a room aromatizer, I know I&#x27;ve smelled this in a living room before, but my family tells me that I&#x27;m crazy...but I could swear it smells like a flower potpourri.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging&lt;br /&gt;Since the picture shows only the carton, it helps to describe what the bottle looks like inside: since it&#x27;s supposed to be milk, and a milky fragrance, couldn&#x27;t just have a transparent bottle; Indeed, the bottle is covered with white to go with the motif of the rest of the presentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When choosing to buy it or not, I didn&#x27;t pay attention to up-close images of the product: It&#x27;s a little ridiculous to have it in a Milk carton, and to have a cow with a pseudo-hologram image on the carton itself; it&#x27;s creative, but dumb, unless I knew their advertising strategy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it is an EDT just 2 sprays ought to get you set for a while without coming out too strong and tacky, because as said by other reviewers, while the atomizer is not squirting the product, it is not one of the finest atomizers I&#x27;ve encountered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of days of wearing it, and getting used to it, the smell is less shocking and somewhat refreshing.

I might buy again.I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll be able to do any updates later on, but I felt compelled to inform other to-be shoppers about their surprise if they haven&#x27;t bought this before.    It&#x27;s not a bad fragrance...it&#x27;s just different. I might buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff draws the girls like a magnet, it smells fantastic!! All I have to do is spray it on and walk out the door, automatically girls come out of nowhere to compliment me</li>
            <li> ThePerfumeSpot WORST BUY EVER. CHEAP PRINT ON THE BOTTLE. COLOGNE SMELLED MORE LIKE ALCOHOL THAN A COLOGNE. ON TOP OF THAT THE BOTTLE CAP GOT STUCK HALF WAY. NEVER BUY FROM THEPERFUMESPOT</li>
            <li> Diesel still makes great fragrances and this is no exemption, smells really good and will last all day, and the price is great!!</li>
            <li> Wow this one really shocked me, sweet, sugary, syrupy scent with great projection and longevity.  For such a cheap scent this is actually quality juice.  A bit synthetic on top but once it settles down it reminds me very much of a poor mans Paco Rabanne&#x27;s One Million.  Women love this scent and is great for a night out or clubbing.  This stuff if over-sprayed will get cloying so be easy on the trigger.</li>
            <li> Hey Shopper&lt;br /&gt;So this was my second purchase ever on Amazon, and I wasn&#x27;t all that happy with the product.  The bottle and packaging is really chic, but the scent itself smells like a locker room.  I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but I wanted to try something new.  If I was you I&#x27;d pass on this and go find a bottle you know you already like.&lt;br /&gt;xoxo</li>
            <li> tienen calidad y son muy cumplidores con lo que publican excelentemente bueniso los recomiendo con los ojos cerrados son 100% confiable</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite cologne. It has a great scent and women love it.</li>
            <li> I has this cologne a long time ago and i havent been able to find it at any fragrance shop ANYWHERE! It has an amazing sweet smell that my girlfriend cant get enough of :)&lt;br /&gt;Hope you enjoy it as much as a do!</li>
            <li> The cologne is super cheap and as a result I think it smells cheap as well. Definitely a unique scent that is powdery and fruity/sweet. Not great at first but is tolerable after it settles down a bit.  Wear this when you don&#x27;t want to waste the good stuff around people you don&#x27;t like or an ugly date you were suckered into by your homeboy who needed to bring a guy so his girl could bring her friend for a double date. Life is complicated.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT, I AM VERY THANKFUL, REALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, VERY FAST, PROCEDURE WELL, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING, WE ARE GRATEFUL</li>
            <li> DID NOT LIKE THIS COLOGNE , I SMELL IT BEFORE IN A DIESEL STORE AND THIS IS JUST A BAD COPY OF IT.</li>
            <li> Nothing can top this scent....100% percent woman magnet. mix it with something similar and that&#x27;s it..long lasting as well.. Use it as strong or as week as you want...no bad reviews from people.</li>
            <li> I love Diesel plus plus, have not been able to find this product in stores.  Out of all the Diesel fragrances this has to be my favorite.  So glad i was able to find it on here and did not have to go through another company with the potential of having problems, also love the fact it is eligible for free super saver shipping.    Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a very unique but not overpowering scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this without smelling it due to the low price and quality reviews. Product came very quickly and as described.     As for the scent itself, it&#x27;s very unique...not necessarily a bad thing though. It certainly does have a milky scent. Although it&#x27;s nothing that is distinctly bad, it certainly has a scent that is outside of my preference.</li>
            <li> This fragances is very good I used it every day and the prices is the best.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped promptly and it smells great. My only complaint is that the pump (nozzle) seems to be slightly defective. I have to pump it a few times every time I use before it will spray. However, I am still happy with my decision to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I love this one..that&#x27;s right, I said love...you wanna come to the wedding ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly though, a well packed and well priced product with a scent I happen to prefer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Diesel Plus Plus and haven&#x27;t been without one since 2003. Always get some good complements whenever I wear it and would recommend it to anyone</li>
            <li> Delicious, heady fragrance.  Milky, sweet, a touch of spices, slightly woodsy, very sexy and intimate.  No idea why the product description recommends wearing it at the office.  Keep it to two sprays, the nozzle isn&#x27;t too fine.    Packaging is nice with the little milk carton thing and the bottle is a nice cold ceramic, but my bottle was scuffed up the side a bit with a small black streak, and the cap goes on crooked because the top is bent.  So, the one I got was damaged, but I&#x27;d buy it again even knowing it would look like that.</li>
            <li> I rlly like the outlook of this perfume. A milk box and pure white bottle, lovely. smells just ok, not bad and not so well.</li>
            <li> ..It was ok...the smell last for 5 hours..very good product....  I will recomend this product...</li>
            <li> I just loved the smell of this eau de toilette.  Diesel has great colognes and this one just smells great. The bottle is bit small but nice. The clossing system came with a little dent and some cologne came out from it. but after a fe times use there was no more spill.  very nice cologne</li>
            <li> loved the price! my wife wont leave me alone once i put it on! i will say though that the scent disappears after a few hours but luckily one spray is more than enough per use.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x60;s an old perfume but I really like it and the seller is super awesome     thank you so much   &lt;3</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT THE PRICE WAS INCREDIBLE ... BOX AND PACKAGING THE PRODUCT IS GOOD CARE BEST ...&lt;br /&gt;PURCHASE AN EXCELLENT AND VERY GOOD SERVICE&lt;br /&gt;THANKS FOR YOUR EXCELLENT PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> Dont buy this perfume, you would get it broken and the content empty. And the worst thing is that you cant ask them for a return</li>
            <li> I used this perfume in 2004 or so and i found it cool. I purchased again recently and a very fashionable lady in my office said, \\&quot;You smell like a Lord.\\&quot; Need i say more?</li>
            <li> Before I purchased this item I read the reviews. Only a few negatives so I ordered and recd it in 3 days :-)&lt;br /&gt;It is def. a scent for daytime. As a few reviewers stated, its a milky aroma but fresh like after a shower. I really like it! Oh, and take the advice of one reviewer, spray the scent and walk through the \\&quot;cloud\\&quot;. You get a totally different aroma, very pleasant.</li>
            <li> NICE PERFUM! For a low price you can enjoy a delicious smell, just for everyday use or special occasions, always perfect.</li>
            <li> i love this perfume cause the scent is like so friendly so nice.. used to have it long time ago want it back again and i still like it!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 13-year old. He had sampled it while on vacation, but it turned out to be harder to find than I expected. He loves it, and I think it&#x27;s a great fragrance; not too sweet, and a little like pipe tobacco.</li>
            <li> hi i bought this product after viewing the reviews but im vry mch disappointed bcaz this perfume lasts jst for 1 hour only i really dnt like it .</li>
            <li> I thought this smelled OK, too sweet for my liking. Only had a couple of women thus far compliment on it, nothing like Azzaro or Ferrera.</li>
            <li> The product was shipped extremely fast and I wasn&#x27;t planning on receiving it before Christmas but I did and my dad loved it and it smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Product was excellent,,, UPS drivers are another question,,, they leave packages at the end of my driveway and on the ground for stray dogs and animals to urinate on and ants to get all over.  My driveway is 40 foot wide so they do not have to put their trucks in reverse to turn around,,, but they are to lazy to leave packages at the front, side, or back door,,, or at least within 5 feet of my home. The packages are left right by the road on the ground.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it rains,,, it is a mess. But the seller and the product are excellent.</li>
            <li> This product is really good. Thank you very much for all about it. This item is really as I wanted.</li>
            <li> sweet but not sickening.  Powerful but yet not overwhelming.  Different in every way, but a good kinda different.  Smells like a warm, cozy dream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the quality I expected for the price I paid, I have no complaints whatsoever, I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase!</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne, great smell and excellent value.  Only lasts about half the day, but still its very cheap, so what do you expect?</li>
            <li> Was the least expensive on site unfortanetly cologne does not stay on u longer than an hr but on ur clothes for three? Lol avoid this from this buyer bottle was ok but print didn&#x27;t look 100% aunthentic. AVOID!!!</li>
            <li> I tried this one because the price was unbeatable. Even the local flea market could not compete. It is good!</li>
            <li> I just cannot describe how amazing this cologne smells, it draws others towards you.  Great gift for any guy in your life.</li>
            <li> incredible phenomenal its beyond definition !!! this cologne I will have to say is out of my top 5 is my absolute one . this is an everyday great smelling Cologne summer winter spring fall any season this will get attention . especially if you like sweet smelling colognes like I do well recommended seller and worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Im a girl and I used to wear it years ago. I didnt find a store where I could get it until I saw it here. I totally love it. I got two and Im happy with it. Love the smell.</li>
            <li> The first bottle I received was loose at the top and leaking. Amazon fixed it and sent me another bottle. I have to say the service was very good and I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have loved this cologne for a long time, and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in a while. It is a sweet, aromatic fragrance that no one has ever told me they didn&#x27;t like, and through the course of the day it smells better as it mixes with your perspiration, in my opinion. I don&#x27;t really know how to explain it better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, even if you haven&#x27;t smelled it, go ahead and buy it. I think you will be happy.</li>
            <li> This is a magic bottle with a genie inside it, for the price you should never tell anyone.  Its simply amazing.</li>
            <li> Bought on a friend&#x27;s recommendation and him telling me what a great deal I can get on this nice smelling fragrance. Sorta bought this blind on his recommend and based on his sniffer&#x27;s taste, not really sure what to expect - turned out great!!! A bit sweeter than what I normally go for, but still a hint of freshness, making this a winner of a cologne. Wears very nicely and goes on strong, so you do not need to bathe in it to make it stay with you for hours or pretty much all day. One of my favorites now and for the discount deal available on this product, I can safely recommend this a good buy.</li>
            <li> The parfume has a very unique scent and it grows on the women around you more than it does on you...You&#x27;ll not be disappointed,especially for this price!! Plus Plus for sure.</li>
            <li> We will definitely be ordering this product again</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t smelled this before, but have been to any night club, or sports bar, I have news for you. You&#x27;ve smelled this before. As soon as you spray it every episode of Jersey Shore will flash before your eyes. Somehow it smells good. Go figure.</li>
            <li> Good smelling Cologne for any season.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for a daily basis, very fresh and young and cool.&lt;br /&gt;Nice perfume, I recommended.</li>
            <li> excellent very good is the best and the best price I recommend it 100% good quality best there again if I can buy the seller</li>
            <li> No me gusto mucho este perfume es algo dulce es como para personas de entre 12-18 a&amp;ntilde;os.</li>
            <li> SORRY NO WHERE I GET MY PERFUME ... AND I WILL BE WAITING ... WHAT HAPPENS??? HAPPENS?? NEED ANSWERS?SORRY NO WHERE I GET MY PERFUME</li>
            <li> when i got the cologne i was surprise because i got charge for shipping its supose to be free plus the regular price i was so made . rhe cologne was nice but i dont enjoy it because i got charge more than i found on amazon.</li>
            <li> This smells great I had ordered some of this for my hubby and I loved the smell so I ordered another one for my daughters fiance for Christmas. It is a great price</li>
            <li> Diesel Plus Plus By Diesel For Men Eau De Toilette Spray 2.5 Fluid Ounce This perfume smells delicious for men I like to much</li>
            <li> This perfume is one of the best, its aroma and quality are second to none, so when the end would be willing to buy another</li>
            <li> Every time Diesel surprises me in every aspect of their products! This is very very good Eau De Toilette Spray!</li>
            <li> This is an INCREDIBLE cologne they never should have stopped marketing/producing on a massive level.  I wore it back around 2000 and it rained compliments.  I&#x27;m happy to say that I ordered three for the low low price and am good for at least a year... in times like these, how can you not jump on a chance to get a scent this good for SUCH a bargain!!!</li>
            <li> So I got 4 different fragrances from Amazon, and this was the cheapest one I got, and I feel that the price is evedent in the product. I took a star off for taste...not the way it actually tasted (although I&#x27;m sure it tastes pretty bad as well, but hey, 80% alchohol by volume!) What I mean is that I&#x27;m 24 and this smells like a teeny-boppers cologne. I took another star off for duration. It may last you 3-4 hours if you&#x27;re lucky or unlucky if it isn&#x27;t what you like as was the case for me. If you&#x27;re smart, try it at a store first (I know, I&#x27;m not smart)</li>
            <li> Perfume simply wonderful, optimal setting, pleasant odor, fragrance very striking. Only compliments! Approved by the super price! Very pleased with my purchase, super fast delivery and safe!</li>
            <li> Diesel PLUS PLUS is an amazing smelling cologne. This isn&#x27;t a mock off, its the real thing. I love it. It was shipped to me in about a week. Im certainly purchasing more in the future</li>
            <li> A classic smell at a great price.  What more could you ask for?  Just buy it and be smelling good in two days with Prime Membership shipping.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this spray. It doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you however its still enticing and intriguing  I even like it as air fresher lol.</li>
            <li> Good day   when I want to ship this item via ups from my box mail to my locale adrisse in saudi arabia , they said to me ,they cannot to send it to my adrisse.  as this is flammable.and they said you have two choice destroy it or return it to you with 15 $ .  please help me.....</li>
            <li> For those new to Diesel fragrances (perhaps you were also drawn by the brand/price), they&#x27;ve got four mainstream scents. I find Plus Plus to be the most versatile (Zero Plus is VERY cinnamony and ideal for a bonfire or Christmas party.) Once you let the pungent alcohol scent dissipate, you&#x27;re left with a smooth, almost milky aroma; think about what a new car should smell like. Start with smooth coconut, then add a bit of spice as you&#x27;d find in cider. Factor in a woody, masculine backbone and just a hit of a slightly tart fruit scent and you have a cologne for men that has an empirical positive effect on women. This is my go-to scent for sleepovers, if you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely for the younger crowd. Do yourself, or your kid, a favor and spare the latest cliche from Hollister or American Eagle. Personally, I layer this with Raw Vanilla for a particularly excellent hint of vanilla/bamboo on a budget. I might have to pick up a few more bottles as it has been discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that a number of negative reviews below have to do with packaging. One is apparently for Diesel shoes.</li>
            <li> As a fan of Diesel clothing and shoes, I went out on a limb and bought the Plus Plus scent even though I was prejudiced in thinking \\&quot;true\\&quot; cologne cannot be this cheap. However, I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong in that line of thinking! To understand my thinking, my favorite scent to wear is Burberry Brit, followed closely by Burberry London, and Polo Black and Armani Code close behind that. I really wasn&#x27;t expecting much from Diesel Plus Plus, but this scent is very good as an every day going to the office, out for a quick bite, type of smell.   When first spraying the cologne it has a very run of the mill, soapy, Rx store scent. However I noticed if I spray a cloud in front of me and walk into it that it smells immediately  of fresh linen, clean skin, and has an almost coffee creamer type scent. Its underwhelming in a way that is actually refreshing. The longevity of Plus Plus is rather short (2-3hrs), but that doesn&#x27;t really bother me, because I&#x27;m not utilizing it like I utilize Brit or London.   I recommend Plus Plus if your the type of guy that wants a \\&quot;throw-away\\&quot; bottle of cologne to keep in the car, office, or travel bag. I would have to say that women enjoy the scent, but its just not a going out on a date or late night romp kind of scent for me. To sum it up, its a scent that is perfect for smelling good around friends, family, and co-workers. I hope this helps anyone on the fence.</li>
            <li> Yea it may seem a bit of a younger scent, but it&#x27;s great for casual and light activities (beach, bbq, hanging out with friends, etc). I would even go to say you can use it for work or around a casual office. For the price, this is a great cologne. I got this as a gift in Vegas after shopping at the Diesel store (2006). Try it, I think it&#x27;s a great unique scent. If you don&#x27;t like it, then you&#x27;ll still have money to buy a different kind.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the price. I am a fan of Diesel products and gave it a try before smelling it. I am very happy with it. Great cologne for casual use. Not overwhelming when applied properly. The only downfall I have noticed is the duration is shorter than I would like.</li>
            <li> I bought this as birthday gift for a soon to be boyfriend. i had my doubts since it was a second choice. i tried it as soon as i got it and i was really disappointed with the smell. It smelled cheap to me, i expected more from Diesel. I had to find something else as gift. I&#x27;m just happy it was not expensive.</li>
            <li> When I was younger I used this cologne and I fell in love with it, I received the product within time and still am impressed by the smell. I should&#x27;ve bought more bottles. Its a nice delicious sweet smelling cologne, not over powering but really lasts long. It always impressed the girls I used to date.</li>
            <li> Designer Perfume at a a great price, if your looking for a day to day fragance light, sweet and fragrant this is it! Good gift option.</li>
            <li> &#x27;m not much given to repeat perfumes, but this is one of my favorite. I&#x27;ve already bought like 5 times, 3 of them here on Amazon ... A smell super good and pleases women.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, has a creamy/milky scent with a vanilla hint to it. I can&#x27;t stop wanting to smell it because it smells really good but I wish the smell was a little stronger and lasted longer, which is for the 4 stars. Otherwise, this is a really good product</li>
            <li> The scent of this fragrance differs slightly from the original from Diesel, but its close enough for me to like it. It does look exactly as  the original one though. It arrived quickly , and overall I am happy with this purchase . It&#x27;s just not the original fragrance , since the original one was discontinued a while ago,so I have to take couple of stars off.</li>
            <li> I received the product and it&#x27;s great. The size, price, fragance it is ok for me. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> Although it took a couple of extra days to arrive, it was worth waiting. t h a n k s</li>
            <li> I just like this smell, it depends on your skin color but it is just nice on me. I have been using for 4 years now</li>
            <li> I recomend this buyer it is quick and responsable and the thing a bought it is as expected buy a recomend them</li>
            <li> This smell very nice and for the price it is, you can definetly say it is worth it. Perhaps even a little more. I like this scent very much.&lt;br /&gt;Con is, it doesnt last very long.</li>
            <li> I saw the name and price and thought that I&#x27;d try it out. While it does smell pretty good it just doesn&#x27;t last long enough. Not a bad cologne to wear around the house but when you try to wear it out for a night, no one can tell you have it on. :(</li>
            <li> I usually order this item with no problems. I was chocked when I received an empty bottle today. I&#x27;m trying to return it, but it&#x27;s saying I can&#x27;t return it. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great quality, exactly what I expected with low cost nice presentation&lt;br /&gt;Fully satisfied, fulfilled expectations, sweet aroma, desired size</li>
            <li> 1&lt;br /&gt;2&lt;br /&gt;3&lt;br /&gt;4&lt;br /&gt;5&lt;br /&gt;6&lt;br /&gt;7&lt;br /&gt;8&lt;br /&gt;9&lt;br /&gt;10&lt;br /&gt;im lazy but exellent product grat timing and price very good</li>
            <li> Very nice and upscale and distinctive packaging is good and fast shipping thank you and nature, much nicer than the picture thank you this fragrance is very distinctive and beautiful</li>
            <li> Its ok¡ Cheap an nice¡</li>
            <li> very good product I recommend it to everyone I came perfectly and has no sign of damage apart is very good product!</li>
            <li> People always love when I wear this fragrance. Perfect to wear on a daily basis, very fresh and young and cool.</li>
            <li> It has a refreshing and unique scent which I can&#x27;t find anywhere else, not too masculine or feminine, I always keep an eye out for these as they are hard to come by, if you have not tried it before, it is quite worth a try!</li>
            <li> It was a good deal and fast also.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Ordered as a gift. Smells great. Smells great. Smells great. Smells great. Smells great. Smells great. Smells nice.</li>
            <li> The men&#x27;s scent is lousy and unwearable, while the women&#x27;s is not my favorite though I will wear it. Even old fashioned Brut smells better than the men&#x27;s Diesel.</li>
            <li> really great love this product. i cant find it any where. and reminds me of 90s. get loads of people compliments. so nice.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite cologne by far. I tend to think all cologne in this price range smell pretty similar for the most part, however this definitely has a different smell. For this price that is awesome. Masculine heavy smell. Recommend for any age.</li>
            <li> I do not have the recommendations, this pack is according for the article! the description of item is exact according to display in the website</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before and got it for my man, in the beginning it was ok, but once you use is regularly it is very strong, I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> good morning the phone arrived in perfect condition I was really hoping that I&#x27;ll keep buying thank you and I will recommend my friends to have a happy Christmas.</li>
            <li> I have had every cologne from armani code to drakkar and I have never had my girlfriend ask me to use it cause she liked the smell. It&#x27;s a unique smell and definitely not for the truck driver type, or the conservative type, it&#x27;s for the sporty, athletic type, someone unique willing to stand out...In a good way, it&#x27;s definitely different, but ladies like it but don&#x27;t use too much a spray or two will do.</li>
            <li> This cologne is brilliant. It is very soft and subtle, not over powering, the type of cologne you could wear daily as it really isn&#x27;t an intrusive scent and more of a complimentary one.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little feminine, but it&#x27;s quite nice. I&#x27;ve been complimented on it quite a few times.  Has a hint of almost a sweet milkiness to it. I highly recommend this cologne and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery....very reasonable pricing ......and most important I LOVE IT.....well all of the diesel products are best with product quality ...once again its proven...even if its not expensive still its one of the best...</li>
            <li> excelente producto recomendado, llego a tiempo y llego con una excelente envoltura producto recomendado y con excelente funcionamiento, recomendado al 100 %</li>
