            <li>The best product ever!  </li>
            <li>Best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for almost 20 years and it&#x27;s THE BEST !!!</li>
            <li>This product keep my skin hydrate and in good shape, it doesn&#x27;t smell, and the quantity of the bottle is perfect,</li>
            <li>This is a great size, too, for the bathroom.</li>
            <li>This is is a great body lotion --</li>
            <li>I have found that Neutrogena&#x27;s Moisture Wrap is a great body lotion and non greasy.</li>
            <li>The lotion was not lacking in moisture in anyway and has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>Great product, very nice cream, delivery was fast and product</li>
            <li>I am also pregnant and I use it on my itchy belly, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>it is the best skin cream I have found so far.</li>
            <li>This item is my favorite of its kind</li>
            <li>I have always been a Neutrogena fan and was thrilled when I was able to find it again..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really satisfied by neutrogena norwegian formula, It&#x27;s a great product !</li>
            <li>Love this body lotion.</li>
            <li>In a day or two after using this lotion my hands felt and looked so much better.  </li>
            <li>But then again, most Neutrogena products do.  </li>
            <li>Hoped it would soak in more and soften my skin longer, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter which brand I use...</li>
            <li>more fluid intake may be my best remedy.</li>
            <li>I love the fragrance of it as well - not offensive at all.</li>
            <li>Very nice lotion and a reasonably price.</li>
            <li>Pretty good lotion.</li>
            <li>This Neutrogena lotion is good; but, it is a step below the first Walgreen lotion.</li>
            <li>the very soft, clean scent but more importantly is does a superb job at moisturizing and making my skin so very soft.  </li>
            <li>It feels light.</li>
            <li>This body lotion goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>It was nice to have his Wish List to check for things he really wanted.</li>
            <li>The texture is great, the lotion effective, and there&#x27;s not a strong smell to this lotion.</li>
            <li>My new favorite lotion!  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny to me!</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on silky smooth, is super moisturizing and is not at all greasy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really great for my dry</li>
            <li>/&gt;Except this one, and its milky, liquid-y consistency is great for dry skin as it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping too.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making it available on line.</li>
            <li>it if you want, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li>I have used many different brands and this is by far the best (and we live in a very dry environment)!  </li>
            <li>I use it daily after my shower and my skin has never been so healthy as it is now.</li>
            <li>I tried so many different lotions and anti itch creams, along with switching all my body washes and detergents to non-scented.</li>
            <li>You feel it beginning to help almost after the first use, but my skin soaked it up almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I live in the Caribbean, there is not cold at all, but the Sun its powerful, too much for my skin.</li>
            <li>long lasting and pleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anymore I pretty much stick with all Neutogena products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>one comes really close to that feeling.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, and my 93 year old father, with his fragile skin, loves it too!</li>
            <li>The only downside is that I had to use far more of this lotion than I normally use of my Crabtree and Evelyn lotions.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other creams and nothing compares to this one.</li>
            <li>At first I reapplied every couple of hours until my skin was good and moisturized, then after a few days I only had to apply it once a day and the itch was completely gone!</li>
            <li>To get a real hydration boost, put a thin layer of vasaline over the Moisture Wrap while you sleep and do not use soap anywhere on your body but the most important places.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this lotion.</li>
            <li>and I also live in a desert.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena&#x27;s Moisture Wrap is different and it can actually smooth and soften skin with daily use.</li>
            <li>Not sticky or too thick, and doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>This seeps in as easily as lotion but has the heavy cream effect.</li>
            <li>This is hard to find in our area; I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft</li>
            <li>I even went as far as to take a benadryl before bed to get relief.</li>
            <li>I have made every effort to reduce wrinkles and have used every product I could afford since I was 23 years old to keep my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>I use Aveeno moisturizer, as thats the only one that can really calm my dry</li>
            <li>/&gt;Especially nice this time of year -- but not too heavy all year round.</li>
            <li>I have fair Scoth/Irish/English skin and it wrinkles if I even sleep the wrong way!</li>
            <li>I use Eucerin Original Healing Creme - the thick, hydrating one - as a daily lotion.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and this works like a charm.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cream last ALL DAY LONG and keeps my skin soft.</li>

            <li> If you suffer from extremely itchy skin and have sworn you&#x27;ve tried everything to no avail you NEED to try this.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, and would use it all the time except that it has become so expensive that I have to rate it poorly.</li>
            <li> I have such dry skin that it&#x27;s kinda ridiculous</li>
            <li> This winter the skin on my hands and become rough and raw.  </li>
            <li> Purchased the Target knockoff - not good enough.</li>
            <li> My legs would get extremely itchy and I would just scratch and scratch my skin raw.</li>
            <li> It does not leave a greasy residue on the skin and it has little to no smell.</li>
            <li> it is hard to find and not cheap.  </li>
            <li> Cold dry winter dry skin solver, this stuff works!  </li>

            <li> I use Aveeno moisturizer, as thats the only one that can really calm my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one comes really close to that feeling. Pretty good lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, and would use it all the time except that it has become so expensive that I have to rate it poorly. It is almost $18.00 (today) for one 15 oz. bottle, and that is too much to pay for a body lotion that you can get at the drugstore for at least a bit less. When I was paying $8-$9 it was just about tolerable.</li>
            <li> I got this lotion when I was on the HCG diet.  The lotion was not lacking in moisture in anyway and has a pleasant scent.  The only downside is that I had to use far more of this lotion than I normally use of my Crabtree and Evelyn lotions.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, and my 93 year old father, with his fragile skin, loves it too! long lasting when rubbed in, it has no perfume that I can detect (and I do have perfume allergies) it is the best skin cream I have found so far. This is a great size, too, for the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really satisfied by neutrogena norwegian formula, It&#x27;s a great product ! i will recommend it to my wife...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;regards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thierry</li>
            <li> Love this body lotion. The texture is great, the lotion effective, and there&#x27;s not a strong smell to this lotion.</li>
            <li> This moisture wrap lotion is the only lotion I use anymore. My doctor recommended it due to sensitive skin which reacts to lotions with heavy perfumes and additives. I&#x27;ve tried other lotions but always come back to this. Anymore I pretty much stick with all Neutogena products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the very soft, clean scent but more importantly is does a superb job at moisturizing and making my skin so very soft.  I live in a very dry climate and this works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This lotion goes on silky smooth, is super moisturizing and is not at all greasy. It is worth every penny to me!</li>
            <li> Great product, very nice cream, delivery was fast and product well pack.&lt;br /&gt;I would recomend, in some contries that cream those not arrive ever, so we have to buy at US, but its all good.&lt;br /&gt;Love it! Thanks</li>
            <li> The best product ever!  Quick shipping too.</li>
            <li> This item is my favorite of its kind and I choose it above all others.</li>
            <li> My new favorite lotion!  Not sticky or too thick, and doesn&#x27;t have a very strong smell.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a body moistureizer that helped my dry skin on my legs.  Best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is is a great body lotion -- long lasting and pleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially nice this time of year -- but not too heavy all year round.</li>
            <li> This winter the skin on my hands and become rough and raw.  In a day or two after using this lotion my hands felt and looked so much better.  I even decided to try it on my face.  My face feels so soft and I think my skin even feels firmer from this lotion.</li>
            <li> Cold dry winter dry skin solver, this stuff works!  But then again, most Neutrogena products do.  Like buying two at once, just wish this vendor was prime.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in our area; I absolutely love this product. Thanks for making it available on line.</li>
            <li> This was a gift but my wife loves this stuff. She even got my mom to start buying it too.</li>
            <li> Hoped it would soak in more and soften my skin longer, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter which brand I use...more fluid intake may be my best remedy.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this lotion. Neutrogena is a name I trust and have used a number of their products over the years. I purchased the Walgreen knockoff of Gold Bond Ultimate and was blown away with how well it worked with just one application. I purchased what seemed to be the same Walgreen product but they must have changed the formula - it wasn&#x27;t the same. Purchased the Target knockoff - not good enough. This Neutrogena lotion is good; but, it is a step below the first Walgreen lotion. I use on my hands and face. It feels light. It absorbs faster than similar lotions.</li>
            <li> This cream last ALL DAY LONG and keeps my skin soft. I&#x27;ve tried many other creams and nothing compares to this one. It does not leave a greasy residue on the skin and it has little to no smell. I use it daily after my shower and my skin has never been so healthy as it is now. I am also pregnant and I use it on my itchy belly, this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Curel believer until now. This seeps in as easily as lotion but has the heavy cream effect. I have multiple bottles of this and the hand cream stashed in various places</li>
            <li> If you suffer from extremely itchy skin and have sworn you&#x27;ve tried everything to no avail you NEED to try this. My legs would get extremely itchy and I would just scratch and scratch my skin raw. I tried so many different lotions and anti itch creams, along with switching all my body washes and detergents to non-scented. I even went as far as to take a benadryl before bed to get relief. But nothing ever reached that deep under the skin itch I would get until I tried neutrogena norwegian formula! You feel it beginning to help almost after the first use, but my skin soaked it up almost immediately. At first I reapplied every couple of hours until my skin was good and moisturized, then after a few days I only had to apply it once a day and the itch was completely gone!</li>
            <li> I have such dry skin that it&#x27;s kinda ridiculous and I also live in a desert. I use Eucerin Original Healing Creme - the thick, hydrating one - as a daily lotion. That&#x27;s the only lotion that has worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except this one, and its milky, liquid-y consistency is great for dry skin as it absorbs quickly. I love the fragrance of it as well - not offensive at all. It&#x27;s really great for my dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it if you want, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> So, I got my Mom addicted to using this brand of lotion because it actually absorbs into your skin quickly (what a concept).  I have used many different brands and this is by far the best (and we live in a very dry environment)!  For reasons I do not understand local stores no longer carry this and even on Amazon it is hard to find and not cheap.  I&#x27;ll keep buying it until I no longer can find it...</li>
            <li> I am a 63 year old female and have used about every lotion brand in the average and above average market. I also have used perscription lotions. Neutrogena&#x27;s Moisture Wrap is different and it can actually smooth and soften skin with daily use. I have fair Scoth/Irish/English skin and it wrinkles if I even sleep the wrong way! I have made every effort to reduce wrinkles and have used every product I could afford since I was 23 years old to keep my skin hydrated. I have found that Neutrogena&#x27;s Moisture Wrap is a great body lotion and non greasy. To get a real hydration boost, put a thin layer of vasaline over the Moisture Wrap while you sleep and do not use soap anywhere on your body but the most important places.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for about 3 weeks now but it seems to be helping my skin. Worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> This is getting harder and harder to find, but it really is the ONLY lotion that keeps my feet from cracking!!  I&#x27;ve used it for almost 20 years and it&#x27;s THE BEST !!!</li>
            <li> This body lotion goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.  Your skin feels invigorated.  Very nice lotion and a reasonably price.</li>
            <li> I bought this on line because I can no longer find in the stores...this lotion was recommended to my husband by our doctor for his skin dryness...It is the only one that helps and really does the job with no greasiness or residue left behind...I keep one in my bathroom as well. I have always been a Neutrogena fan and was thrilled when I was able to find it again..</li>
            <li> This was on his Christmas &amp; Birthday. It was nice to have his Wish List to check for things he really wanted.</li>
            <li> I live in the Caribbean, there is not cold at all, but the Sun its powerful, too much for my skin. This product keep my skin hydrate and in good shape, it doesn&#x27;t smell, and the quantity of the bottle is perfect,</li>
            <li> I had problems with seriously cracked skin until I started using this product.  If you can&#x27;t seem to find lotion that moisturizes your skin, you have to try Neutrogena Norwegian Formula.  I recommend it to anyone I meet with dry skin.</li>
