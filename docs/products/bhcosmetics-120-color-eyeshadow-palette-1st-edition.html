            <li>the colours are so bright</li>
            <li>but if you know how to manipulate the color palette they won&#x27;t be so bright</li>
            <li>The colors are so bright and the color doesn&#x27;t fade off.</li>
            <li>Amazing products for a great price! :)</li>
            <li>They are just as bright as they are in the photos.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m learning how to apply eyeshadow, I muat say these colors are a bit to bright for a starter like me.</li>
            <li>My wife loved it.</li>
            <li>anyway everything else is good.   </li>
            <li>good  Variety:</li>
            <li>good  </li>
            <li>good  Durability:</li>
            <li>purchased this for my daughter who is 16, she loves it and seems to be good quality</li>
            <li>but it holds up way good.</li>
            <li>didnt think that was a good sign.  </li>
            <li>The quality is surprisingly good.</li>
            <li>The pigmentation is really good.</li>
            <li>I loved everything about it.</li>
            <li>pigmentation is awesome and so cheap....</li>
            <li>but that is solved with some good eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Loved this palette.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous palette, bright colors, lacks the eye shadow brush but you can do it yourself.</li>
            <li>and I thought this would be a good place to start.</li>
            <li>After watching youtube reviews, I saw how good they packaged their products.  </li>
            <li>The palette itself is gorgeous and the colors are so pigmented.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for really good eyeshadow at a good price, I came across this palette</li>
            <li>Not of good quality...</li>
            <li>If you are light skinned like, lets say Katherine Heigl then it may be awesome.  </li>
            <li>Good pigment  too.  </li>
            <li>the pigmentation was SO GOOD.</li>
            <li>and this work good say on good with primer throw</li>
            <li>I recommend an eye primer and a good make up remover.</li>
            <li>The quality is just as good as anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>The product is really good for the price.</li>
            <li>The colors are really beautiful and the pigment is really strong!</li>
            <li>ok let me start off with the quality, it is amazingly bright and beautiful.</li>
            <li>The best makeup that you can purchase for the right price!</li>

            <li>Colors are great  good price love it perfect for first timers learning how to do</li>
            <li>After Reading many reviews about BHcosmetics and how great of shape their products were in when they arrived</li>
            <li>and she will not be very pleased when she opens it.</li>
            <li>With that said, I am very pleased with the shipping and handling.  </li>

            <li>So many beautiful colors, First time buying eye shadow and i</li>
            <li>, I will order from them again because they are very fast and a really great company, plus things tend to get damaged evey once in a while</li>
            <li>All of the colors are very pigmented and look absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li>The colors are great and very pigmented!</li>

            <li>Just love playing with all the color combinations &amp; I&#x27;m soooo happy to have purchased it for such a great price.</li>
            <li>It came packaged very securely with bubble wrap, brown packing paper, and a brown mesh packing paper wrapped around everything.  </li>
            <li>And I do know that if you use it without primer, they won&#x27;t show up at all, or just very light.</li>
            <li>I have an olive skin tone, very light but still considered olive.</li>
            <li>a great selection of highly pigmented shadows for an amazing price.</li>
            <li>All of the colors are wonderfully bright and bold.</li>
            <li>lol i dont know which color to use first :)    </li>
            <li>The colors are awesome and are true to color and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I love this palette, I use it all of the time as the colors are vibrant and gorgeous!</li>
            <li>Colors are vibrant and beautiful just as described.</li>
            <li>The colors from the eye shadow palette are so beautiful and vibrant.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and beautiful.</li>
            <li>i still love it and with my primer and eye milk</li>
            <li>Im in love with it</li>
            <li>I love both, but I use the 120 palette more because the colors are easier to blend.</li>
            <li>While I was fixing them (there are many tutorials on youtube)</li>
            <li>Fingerprints were on the glossy parts of the palette, the top textured pattern imprint on the top of each shadow was rubbed off and smudged around in most of the shadows.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m SO GLAD that I checked before I almost gave it as a gift.    </li>
            <li>SURE</li>
            <li>i love the colors in the palette how they come out on my eyes..</li>
            <li>I know how to achieve my desired look, but if you are a rookie all these colors are too many options...</li>
            <li>My sister gave me this palette since I was the one that used it the most  </li>
            <li>but I use the one with the blacks and brown  more</li>
            <li>I just love the BH Cosmetics 120 color eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>and I got all three colors :-).</li>
            <li>i absolutely love this palette</li>
            <li>im satisfied.</li>
            <li>I use mostly MAC makeup, my concealer, foundation, powder, primer, all MAC.</li>
            <li>it stays on for most of my day, throughout school and work.</li>
            <li>But when I&#x27;m in the mood for a bright and colorful look, I will use my 120 palette.</li>
            <li>I have mostly all the colors i would need.</li>
            <li>but hopefully the learn to fix the product shipping packaging better.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love the colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this one.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>The 1st edition has a great variety of colors and the casing is very well made.</li>
            <li>It could use better packaging.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love both sets of shadows &amp; with all the color selections</li>
            <li>I love this palette.</li>
            <li>There was bubble wrap surrounding the palette inside the box, and Amazon added more bubble wrap around the box to protect it.</li>
            <li>There were plastic slips on top of both palettes.  </li>
            <li>My top palette did not come with a ribbon like it shows on the Amazon picture.  </li>
            <li>I might just switch the palettes so that the one with the ribbon is on top.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, place the top palette on the lid</li>
            <li>:)  Count   </li>
            <li>If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!</li>
            <li>To be a women of color I love it no matter what color I choose from it</li>
            <li>shows up I&#x27;ve used many brands with color</li>
            <li>but it would rub off or never show the way they were mentioned this dose the job and more for shades for my money</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Had this for almost 3 years and still love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the matte and satin finishes the most.</li>
            <li>but it still comes with so many colors it didn&#x27;t even matter..</li>
            <li>I love the case</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cute and stylish.</li>
            <li>The colors are a great variety, some of these colors are very dificult to find</li>
            <li>I truly love this product.</li>
            <li>but there are the times I like to be adventurous.</li>
            <li>i love them, i recomend to every girl that loves eyeshadow should buy this product.</li>
            <li>this palette would be better if u were to use a primer of some sort.  </li>
            <li>Waoo i love this eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>and you get more color options.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>it was wrapped like three times in bubble wrap, then inside the box that hold the eyeshadow pallete had more bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>I love all the colors &amp;#60;3.</li>
            <li>I love this palette, but not the shipping.</li>
            <li>It need to be packaged better for sure.</li>
            <li>Aside from that I love the case and the selection of colors inside.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t dream of it being better.</li>
            <li>I love love love this palette.  </li>
            <li>and I have fallen in love with this palette.  </li>
            <li>What I love most about the 120 palette is that there are a lot of matte colors.  </li>
            <li>The 88 palette has more shimmer.  </li>
            <li>With this palette I love the case.  </li>
            <li>so i have the opportunity to wear the funky colors and be really creative.</li>
            <li>i have never gotten so many compliments in one day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I took the plunge</li>
            <li>i am just in love with this pallete.  </li>
            <li>Love love love the colors</li>
            <li>Has so many color cant wait to try them all.great quality</li>
            <li>color payoff depends on the color, but it&#x27;s safe to say that the matte colors are more pigmented than the shimmery colors.</li>
            <li>Of course, you&#x27;ll get much better results if you use an eyeshadow primer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love everything about it except for the fact that it&#x27;s kinda flake-y.</li>
            <li>Gotta love bubble wrap :</li>
            <li>so you can basically do most of the makeups with it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about it.</li>
            <li>I love how there&#x27;s so many colors</li>
            <li>i must say, thank you so much for this great product</li>
            <li>and then you need to find a surface to rest the top layer on.</li>
            <li>Never have I seen such beautiful colors frome a make-up palette!!!</li>
            <li>I am a sexy milk chocolate</li>
            <li>I get many comments on the colors and I wear it just about every day.</li>

            <li>I love BH cosmetics and their products</li>
            <li>I do however need to say some are more pigmented then others</li>
            <li>I REALLY LOVE</li>
            <li>I have been complimented on how I use them I do like the many colors it comes with.</li>
            <li>I am a MAC girl, but didn&#x27;t want to spend oodles of money on a color I wasn&#x27;t sure about.</li>
            <li>There is an interesting odor from the makeup I can&#x27;t seem to get rid of.</li>
            <li>I am really impressed and definitely would purchase again.</li>
            <li>Really love my palette.</li>
            <li>There are so many</li>
            <li>I have used it in numerous of my daughter&#x27;s theater productions and it works great!!</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with this palette.</li>
            <li>They really are great.</li>
            <li>This has to be one of my favorite eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li>Love the pigments love the packaging, love using it.&lt;br /&gt;Work</li>
            <li>I purchased this palette because I like to do elaborate make-up for Halloween and events.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would recommend this palette to anyone and I am personally, very, very happy with mine.</li>
            <li>I love this makeup</li>
            <li>Cute for all tones</li>
            <li>My daughter love this.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad she love it.</li>
            <li>So Many Colors&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I played around with all the colors and used them at several photoshoots and must say the product and the price are superb.</li>
            <li>These remind me of Yaby Pearl of Paint shadows..but has more punch than Yaby and MAC&#x27;s matte shadows.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no falling off effect, no horrible after tint color..</li>
            <li>It shipped fast, it got here in decent amount of time, and the colors and pallet its self was a great size and great quality.</li>
            <li>The product itself is very nice with intense colors.</li>
            <li>I received the first palette, and I love the matte finish of the bright colors.</li>
            <li>This pallet, again, full of really nice colors, I love how they come on, but I can&#x27;t use all the colors.</li>
            <li>There nice and clean not caked out like Mac</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented and great colors</li>
            <li>Great assortment of colors that are highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced and a good product.</li>
            <li>That was a pretty good trick.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow stays on for hours and still looks as good as it did when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>but it is actually pretty good.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy!!</li>
            <li>I am so happy for my new makeup.</li>
            <li>I really love this palette, it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this brand and was very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have three of the different palettes and I can say that they have nice quality and great colors.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for trying all kinds of colors that you may not normally try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>LOOOOve this product, so many bright colors, but you need to use a primer to get the color to last, Very glad i bought this</li>
            <li>, i refuse to buy more higher priced items when i can get this at cheap price and works just as good.</li>
            <li>is what to do:&lt;br /&gt;Crush up the color in its original circle into a very fine powder.</li>
            <li>Love this product the best, I recommend this to other friends.</li>
            <li>good as new!!)    </li>
            <li>the colors are bright and their very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I would repurchase again, but don&#x27;t think I need too since i don&#x27;t wear bright colors all that much</li>
            <li>It is very well although I received the shimerry ones and not the bright ones....</li>
            <li>I was surprised because my mum dropped it twice lol.  </li>
            <li>whomever does not know how to safely and secure these packages.</li>
            <li>I love the smooth texture eyeshadow that this brand have.</li>
            <li>Great gift for a young lady.</li>
            <li>The most important thing everyone should know is that this IS NOT A BH COSMETICS BRAND PALETTE.</li>
            <li>The product came really carefully packed and every eyeshadow was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>the colors are true to their colors and honestly the picture of the product accurately portrays the colors.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and am really amazed at how good it works.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the eye shadow stays on haha which I guess is good, but I gotta get me</li>
            <li>THE packing was really good came fast</li>
            <li>Came right on time too!!</li>
            <li>I think this is a wonderful product, and it is very handy, not a very BIG BIG case.</li>
            <li>I love the bright vivid colors as well as the speckled ones on the end.  </li>
            <li>Other then that.. very good product!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to get this eyeshadow because all the youtube videos i seen and reviews said the colors were amazing.</li>
            <li>Let it sit for 24 hours and your color is good as new!</li>
            <li>I love telling people that talk about how great the price is that you CAN get this same palette for even cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li>After using it, I found the blues to be very wearable and because there are so many of them, I can create amazing fading effects across my lid.</li>
            <li>easy to blend and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>And some will run out very quick.</li>
            <li>I love this item, this was a great price for it and a lot cheaper than the actual website had it</li>
            <li>With or without a case there colors are bright and vibrant.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice to have this item at such a good price</li>
            <li>and I can say BH Cosmetics has done an outstanding job with their eyeshadow palettes, specially with the 120 color ones.  </li>
            <li>I got it all happy then barely used.</li>
            <li>Plus, some of these colors would be cool to use for costumes or dress up :)</li>
            <li>Honestly, I was scared at first if to buy it or not.</li>
            <li>i love the quality true to color</li>
            <li>Tis fine.</li>
            <li>but since i love BHCosmetics i quickly got over it</li>
            <li>This pallet deserves 5 stars because they got here quick!</li>
            <li>THAT YOUR PRODUCT IS NEW BEFORE YOU USE IT!!!!!  </li>
            <li>I look forward to getting some more palettes from BH COSMETICS very soon, i have also since this first purchase ordered many of their brushes, brush cleaner, and foundation primer ,lip glosses, pencil/liquid eyeliners and alot more!</li>
            <li>so colors do not usually show up to bright on me...</li>
            <li>so let me first start off by saying that this product is awesome &amp; more than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>So its really good packaging though, somebody simply dropped it by accident, i cant complain pretty good though out of 120</li>
            <li>Very Matte I love this eye shadow palette!</li>
            <li>With their being so many colors for such a good price, high pigmentation, and a good amount of eyeshadow, I very much recommend this!!  </li>
            <li>Okay, these colors are soo much more vibrant and pigmented then in the pictures!</li>
            <li>The colors are super fun, too!!</li>
            <li>I consider myself a #1 fan of the best quality products in the professional and non professional make-up markets</li>
            <li>Colorful logo would have invited me in more.</li>
            <li>Bought this from BH Cosmetics about 2 weeks ago and selected the cheapest shipping option available.</li>
            <li>however i wasn&#x27;t to happy because when i received my palette some of the blue eyeshadow was broke like someone had dropped it before it got to me.</li>
            <li>that it the only thing i wasn&#x27;t to happy about</li>
            <li>and the colors are fantastic</li>
            <li>the color payoff is great especially when used with a primer.</li>
            <li>Now, I did realize it was cheap for a reason, but it also did surprise me how well it did its job.</li>
            <li>The pigments are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I wanted an eyeshadow palette with many fun colors and decided on this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light yet durable and compact for travel.</li>
            <li>If you are a fan of bright colors at a cheap price I would definitely recommend this eyeshadow palette!:)</li>
            <li>Great for multiple looks.</li>
            <li>I recieved this item within 5 days of ordering with free shipping.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s too light.</li>
            <li>Not only was it great for that day</li>
            <li>The amount of product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I have seen many reviews on you tube and looked up swatches and decided it was worth a look.</li>
            <li>the makeup is kinda cheap though.but</li>
            <li>I found this item on eBay and won the bid at $10.55 with free shipping.</li>
            <li>And the palette is so cheap that you can buy another as soon as this one has reached its end!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors in this 1st edition are along all the lines of brights, neons, primary, neutral, pastels, and glitters.</li>
            <li>it came package very well the color are amazing for this price</li>
            <li>the overall product was great</li>
            <li>Enjoy the colors and how they look.</li>
            <li>Great palette of shades, when added with a primer, they last all day.</li>
            <li>For such a reasonable price, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wear many of the shades in this palette, and it would probably be good for theatrical wear.</li>
            <li>other than that the colors are very bright, there are mattes, and shimmery colors (not overly shimmery).  </li>
            <li>The bright colors are great for when I want a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;It&#x27;s very fun job</li>
            <li>I love how you can just add a dab of water to make the colors more vibrant.</li>
            <li>and I can say so far I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>Overall I was very satisfied and would buy more palettes from BH cosmetics and Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product was a great gift, my friend loved it so much I would really buy from this company again for my next event.</li>
            <li>The actual quality of the eyeshadows is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>but it was def worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I love these eyesshadows first of all I was so exited to recieve the palette on monday when i had order it on Saturday.</li>
            <li>I just love it so much!</li>
            <li>It was totally worth the price!</li>
            <li>I recommended them to my sister in law because she fell in love with them as much as I did!</li>
            <li>color I have swatched have been so rich.</li>
            <li>The colors are vivid and there are so many to choose from!</li>
            <li>Totaly worth the money,its a must have!</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Colors are beautiful,pigmented,and budget friendly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you like experimenting with your eye makeup!! :)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to order the other palettes now - the more natural colors. :D</li>
            <li>I like having the many options available when applying my whole</li>
            <li>I love the color selection for all my wild looks that I love to create.  </li>
            <li>i totally loved all the colors, non were broken when i got them, everything was great, the only thing i wish is that it would come with a mirror , but besides that , i totally loved it.</li>
            <li>The color payoff is only great in about half of the shadows, too; some of them are great, though, and I use them to contour</li>
            <li>will always love BH cosmetics very vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>I found this product to be my favorite eyeshadows, very vibrant and glided on like butter.</li>
            <li>Even when mixed with some \\&quot;transformer\\&quot; to make it more vivid, it still wasnt as great as I needed for it to be.</li>
            <li>Product came faster than expected which was great because I ordered it the Thursday before Halloween.</li>
            <li>I received faster than expected, great condition.</li>
            <li>I would have loved it if BH Cosmetics did the same thing.</li>
            <li>so its all cool.</li>
            <li>the colors are very repetitious, too many pinks and greens.</li>
            <li>I was 100% satisfied and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I love this palette, I really do.</li>
            <li>I could in all honesty give this a 4 star, but I love it so much that I decided against that.  </li>
            <li>I think it is very affordable with so many colors in it.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well as a wet/dry shadow, but if you use the primer you don&#x27;t need it to be a wet/dry :)</li>
            <li>and she was so surprised and thrilled at all the colors.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good starter it for teenage girls.</li>
            <li>Overall Good Value</li>
            <li>For the price it is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>you love bold hot colors you will love this!!!I love creating different looks</li>
            <li>So many pretty colors!!I have shown this to my friends and family and they are all anticipating ordering right away.</li>
            <li>This is the perfect professional and non professional vibrant color eyeshadow palette.  </li>
            <li>Many bold color&#x27;s to play around with and good if you want to use the shadow&#x27;s in place of the typical Halloween makeup or whatever.</li>
            <li>I like this palette better than the 2nd edition because they are better organized and have brighter colors.</li>
            <li>But, if you love creating various blended looks, B H C 120 palette is better.</li>
            <li>However, BHC may skimp on packaging materials with free shipping here--since I find that so many people said their palettes were damaged, so maybe order directly from the site instead to avoid that?  </li>
            <li>I got lucky and it was just 2</li>
            <li>I guess others weren&#x27;t so lucky, but by what I can tell, BH Cosmetics has upped their shipping standards since those reviews.  </li>
            <li>Lot&#x27;s of colors, but I don&#x27;t particularly like most of them.</li>
            <li>super pigmented.</li>
            <li>Very beautiful and variety of colors that are simple and extravagant at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great variety of colors very pigmented but feel duped because i was expecting actual BH Cosmetic product and this is a knock off</li>
            <li>Some of the eyeshadows are vibrant, but I found most to be chalky or have a lot of glitter fallout.</li>
            <li>Not only was the package in perfect condition upon its arrival, it also came a day or two earlier then predicted.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this 1st edition palette,  I will be purchasing 2nd edition soon.... :)</li>
            <li>Other wise everything&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I mostly use high end eye shadow, and this just did not compare.</li>
            <li>Highly pigments colors and so many to choose from.</li>
            <li>That is not the case with these, they are very pigmented and go on very smoothly, and you get such a spectrum of color which is pretty awesome when you just want to try something different.</li>
            <li>I have tried other kits and this has been by far the best experience.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>The colors are so bright and they stay on for a long time without smudging and creasing.</li>
            <li>The colors r very pretty</li>
            <li>Colors are beautiful, but I don&#x27;t use them everyday.  </li>
            <li>Especially high end brands like MAC,</li>
            <li>I love my palette, but I may invest in a new set of purples.</li>
            <li>The product itself was exactly what I expected and in great shape.</li>
            <li>colorful, bold colors.</li>
            <li>These shadows are easily blendable with intense color payoff.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>They are so pretty when applied!</li>
            <li>This pallet has every color that you could ever need and that&#x27;s exactly why I bought it!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li>I also recommend their 88 color Neutral palette and/or their 28 color neutral color &amp; blush palette if you prefer more natural looks!</li>
            <li>First off, i was really excited when i purchased this!&lt;br /&gt;Today i decited to use tlthe 120 1st edition</li>
            <li>but it is incredibly pleasing that they thought it through and put in two &amp;#34;pots&amp;#34; of black, two of white, and many shades of brown.</li>
            <li>She was so happy and they even got to do make up on her little brother.</li>
            <li>Luckily I was able to call Amazon and they fixed the problem right away.  </li>
            <li>this eyeshadow is fantastic its very high pigmented as well</li>
            <li>Other than that, WELL WORTH THE PURCHASE!!!!</li>
            <li>I was sooo happy with this product I bought on for my ma, sister, teacher and guy friend who does drag!!!</li>
            <li>This palette is great, especially for a makeup artist that is just starting and doesn&#x27;t have a huge budget to blow.</li>
            <li>My shadow came securely wrapped in bubble wrap &amp; packaged very well.</li>
            <li>The colors are smooth and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>, it was entirely worth it - none of the colours were damaged in shipping and</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will recommend it to anyone considering it - for 120 colour palette, it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was perfectly boxed so no shadows were broken.</li>
            <li>Package arrived in perfect condition, no eye shadows broken or anything.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really fun palette to play with and see what color combinations you can come up with.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this for anyone, it comes in handy and you get every color you may need in any situation.</li>
            <li>I have been having so much fun experimenting with color.</li>
            <li>, I have a tendency to go towards more natural colors</li>
            <li>it is worth the money</li>
            <li>I am no makeup artist , but as a woman I buy a fair share of makeup from Maybelline to MAC, and I really do hate when a color looks to be perfect in a compact</li>
            <li>it is definitely worth using this merchant.  </li>
            <li>The range from matte to shimmer to frost is just such a nice range in selection, a look for every occasion.</li>
            <li>As far as packaging goes, it could&#x27;ve been better hence the fact that two of my colors were damaged.</li>
            <li>I say its deff innately worth the price</li>
            <li>It was packed nicely, I received my purchase completely in tact, there were no broken or shattered shadows.</li>
            <li>and I had so much fun playing with all of them, as soon as it arrives.</li>
            <li>Worth ever dollar .</li>
            <li>I think it was well worth the money I paid for it</li>
            <li>Nice product overall.</li>
            <li>It was well worth it.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth every penny</li>
            <li>Was actually cheaper here than on their own website.</li>
            <li>The colors are strong and vibrant.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had been wanting this palette forever after seeing so many reviews on youtube, so when I had some other gift shopping to do on Amazon, I decided to pick up this palette for myself :)    </li>
            <li>The colors are even more stunning in person and they swatch extremely well.</li>
            <li>I now use the eye shadow daily because it&#x27;s such a good product and so inexpensive!</li>
            <li>This is also good if you love to experiment with different colors as they are set up in a progressive color pattern going from dark to light.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very clean, and feels classy.</li>
            <li>Some colors are not as bright, but then again, there are a lot of other colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a good buy.</li>
            <li>I can say about this the colours are so bright long lasting love</li>
            <li>The color does not fade on my eyes, i use a good primer before application, it blends extremely well and everytime i wear any color on here</li>
            <li>I love the colors, they blend very well and they are highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>I dropped it right on the floor and none of the shadows shattered.  </li>
            <li>and the shipping was right on time</li>
            <li>I normally use Mac eye shadow, but this palette has proven to last just as good all day &amp; night with primer.</li>
            <li>This is a product I would buy for me as well as for a loved one and would suggest it to anyone who is seriously considering to have a broad spectrum of colors in their vanity or make-up trainer / travel case, and will use it wisely and/or artistically.</li>
            <li>case is also slim and roughly the size of a spiral notebook, so it&#x27;s easy to pack; I can fit mine in my backpack with no bulk!</li>
            <li>Love this palette I cannot believe I got all of these beautiful colors for such a small price.</li>
            <li>2 of the colors came broken but not a big deal worked great for everyone&#x27;s makeup I did for Halloween and at a good price</li>
            <li>i love that they arrived right away, the pigment is awesome but must be careful the shadows break easily and can get messy overall</li>
            <li>They arrived in perfect conditions, only one of the colors was a little bit cracked but</li>
            <li>Love them went well with other makeup easy to carry around if need works well with blending colors</li>
            <li>She use it everyday and is having a lot of fun mixing the colors to create her own unique look.</li>
            <li>My mom now wants her own set to replace the current eyeshadows that she has.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and none of the colors were cracked...</li>
            <li>Shipped super fast.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for something, bold, colorful and vibrant-</li>
            <li>i will use this forever great alternative to drugstore brands and even the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>She says they are so soft and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Some of the colors are similar to bh&#x27;s palette, but it would have been nice to have the real thing.</li>
            <li>, i feel that the shimmery ones are more pigmented then the matte&#x27;s but nothing to serious that i wouldnt still love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty and very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The colors are bright and long lasting and are lavishly available.</li>
            <li>i recommend this product very much.</li>
            <li>It is very cheap and the color is vibrate enough.</li>
            <li>And arrived very fast...</li>
            <li>but it don&#x27;t have a large range of dark colors just a lot of pinks , blues , greens, and yellows basically a lot of bright colors no neutral colors....</li>
            <li>It does not have much pigment at all contrary to how dark or bright the colors appear.</li>
            <li>I actually brought two more for family and friends</li>
            <li>I just received my order and the first thing I did was try it on.</li>
            <li>There are many colors and some similar shades but no duplicates.</li>
            <li>i really wish they had more shimmery colors, smoky colors and a few more browns.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty convinced that this is a knock-off.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>Also, the color payoff of these eyeshadows is HIGH!!  </li>
            <li>My current favorite is Too Faced Shadow Insurance, and I also use U.D.P.P.  </li>
            <li>I really recomend this palette!</li>
            <li>My first time using this I looked like a ghost around the eyes.</li>
            <li>and if you are thinking about buying this product, you DEFINITELY should, I PROMISE YOU WONT BE DISAPOINTED! :)</li>
            <li>The palette is pretty hefty, heavier than my coastal scents 88 palettte.  </li>
            <li>I just received the first edition today and</li>
            <li>(the powder is pretty lose</li>
            <li>Everyone is different and some prefer to spend more money, but if I can save money and still get a comparable item</li>
            <li>Other than that I love it thank you!</li>
            <li>the colors are very pigmented and to die for!</li>
            <li>I would have to put a few layers of eyeshadow on for the makeup to be as bright as the palette.</li>
            <li>For starters, this is my first makeup purchase from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Inside the box were multiple layers of brown paper that covered the package from top to bottom.  </li>
            <li>The first palette also contains the six marbled colors.  </li>
            <li>When you&#x27;re done with the palettes, place the first back on top and shut your lid.  </li>
            <li>The others are much more pinkish or orangey than red.  </li>
            <li>You definitely need a base/primer for most of these colors.</li>
            <li>I love the pigmentation, and they do last all day.</li>
            <li>The first time I used to go to the beach and my eyeshadow still there all daay and night.</li>
            <li>I recommended this products really works!</li>
            <li>I love all the colors, but I think that some of them are pretty similar.</li>
            <li>Since that is what I did when I first opened it.  </li>
            <li>First of all I would like to say these shadows have been something I&#x27;ve wanted for a while.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very prompt!     </li>
            <li>I had ordered a different set that was packed much better</li>
            <li>awesome and pigmented u can instantly use them without any base they are great.</li>
            <li>And this palette gave me exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>my first makeup palette purchase.</li>
            <li>Love it because it has various colors to choose from.</li>
            <li>The colors and sizes were exactly as described.</li>
            <li>On time, and exactly like the description.</li>
            <li>Would pay way more if I would bought all those colors individually .</li>
            <li>ALL the colors are really pretty</li>
            <li>As for the product, i do not lie when i say when i bearly touched the first color</li>
            <li>I like that the palette covers all color palettes for the most part so you can do several kinds of looks!</li>
            <li>I have no idea whether this eye shadow is any good in terms of quality, but I can tell you that I feel like I just wasted 20 bucks.  </li>
            <li>These colors are so bold that you really don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>This palette is cheap enough as it is, and they still weaseled their way out of contacting me by phone or sending me a new one after contacting them 7 times!!!!  </li>
            <li>Colors are very bright which I love for changing up my usual everyday makeup look.</li>
            <li>and the most beautiful red, that came broken ):</li>
            <li>i m sure this palette will last me a long time :)</li>
            <li>Great colors last a long time and you can do so much with it.</li>
            <li>They work great especially when used wet.</li>
            <li>I totally recommend this palette for any beginner or even if you&#x27;re a professional or like to do free-lance makeup, this is an amazing addition to your collection.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to a teen or someone who works where bright makeup isnt acceptable.</li>
            <li>It arrived earlier than expected and in great packaging.</li>
            <li>Used it mainly on myself and clients that want colorful eyes..</li>
            <li>so anyways I would recemend this product to anyone because the colors are beautiful and vibrant and you def get your money&#x27;s worth even though one color was broken</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a great place to start if you are just starting to build your makeup collection, or maybe you want to try some bright crazy color combinations without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li>When I first received this palette it was very well wrapped.</li>
            <li>The colors are great: highly pigmented, blend well, stand out, stay put.. in other words they are everything you&#x27;d want from an eye shadow, and the price is way better than their more expensive competitors.</li>
            <li>I use this along with Urban Decay Primer Potion, and it makes the color even more vibrant - and it literally stays on ALL day without any fading or creasing.</li>
            <li>I like being able to blend different colors together and this palette offers so many different colors.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s fun when I try new eyebrow colors.</li>
            <li>and it came in a nice black box.</li>
            <li>The colors are so bright, and they last all day long without smudging or creasing.</li>
            <li>I have yet to try on the eyeshadows but the colors look/seem very vibrant.    </li>
            <li>are very vibrant and stay on forever!&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just strong when I open the dispenser.</li>
            <li>There are a few colors that aren&#x27;t very pigmented, but most of them are!</li>
            <li>Colors are soo pretty and vibrant.  </li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant!</li>
            <li>There is a ton of each color and they&#x27;re very high quality.</li>
            <li>the picture is very deceiving.</li>
            <li>but i cant really find them in stores</li>
            <li>Not so much...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but  some you really have to pack in the color for it to show up on the eyelid.</li>
            <li>, I tested some of the colors and they seem very pigmented</li>
            <li>Just like everyone says they are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The colors really are as pigmented as they look, and all you need is one swipe of your brush, and you have all the color that you need.</li>
            <li>Very unprofessional.    </li>
            <li>With that said I do really like the KIT</li>
            <li>I removed the bubble wrapped palette from the envelope, unwrapped it and the palette itself looked very dirt, looked like chalk,</li>
            <li>The shadows are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re very affordable</li>
            <li>Some of the lighter colors don&#x27;t work real well on me</li>
            <li>I really like the BHCosmetics eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented colors.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I opened the palette and absolutely none of the colors were chattered.  </li>
            <li>It was just a light yellow</li>
            <li>So very pigmented and there is every color you could ever want.</li>
            <li>It was packaged very well</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and are not chalky or cause a lot of fall out.</li>
            <li>Prefect shipping, no broken pots.</li>
            <li>so much</li>
            <li>I wound totally recommend this to beginners and advanced makeup artists.</li>
            <li>haha</li>
            <li>The case is very sturdy and comes wrapped in bubble wrap and a box.  </li>
            <li>Also, you have to use a lot of the product because they don&#x27;t seem to be very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The shipping was extreamly fast.</li>
            <li>You really get a lot for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the very corners of the bottom tray.</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t believed this.    </li>
            <li>My daughter wants to experiment with her eye make-up</li>
            <li>I have been looking for an eyeshadow palette for ages, and couldn&#x27;t really decide on one.</li>
            <li>Very convenient for carrying around and all sorts.  </li>
            <li>Very well wrapped and packed</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend this product!</li>
            <li>so the shades don&#x27;t show very well on me.  </li>
            <li>so the review did not help me much</li>
            <li>The colors are fantastic and it last all day.</li>
            <li>My wife really like this product she uses it all of the time.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>the product was much more than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>No broken shadows.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like they didn&#x27;t even make an effort to make it look like the real thing.  </li>
            <li>It came in a sketchy unmarked box; real palettes have the BH logo and text and pictures all over the box.  </li>
            <li>On the inside of the box, the real palettes have a mirror.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this palette so much to anyone who is beggining to expiriment with colors and practice with blending .</li>
            <li>and it applies very well.  </li>
            <li>Blends very well too.  </li>
            <li>the colors are very pigmented  </li>
            <li>but it was actually very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I thought that it was going to be tiny circles of cheap makeup</li>
            <li>Downfall is I do not use it that much anymore.</li>
            <li>awesome product they shipped rite away and the packaging is superb..however only one of my colours got broken</li>
            <li>Brands like BH Cosmetics, Coastal Scents etc all stick their own brand labels on them but they&#x27;re the same generic palette...</li>
            <li>Well from all the reviews i read, most of them said that theirs came broken and mine fortunately did not!</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t many neutrals, so if you like neutrals, BHCosmetics offers an entire 88 palette of those.    </li>
            <li>Far better than trying to haul five different four-color palettes</li>
            <li>This was completely USED!!!  </li>
            <li>With a good base I can get several hours of bright full color that lasts until I wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you look at all the youtube videos you will believe that it is super easy to get a vibrant color from this collection, but it takes a little talent, skill, primer, and use of your fingers, because brushes aren&#x27;t really gonna do it.</li>
            <li>After removing the brown paper, I found even more protective packaging that other reviewers haven&#x27;t mentioned yet.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend anyone to buy this palette, I can&#x27;t wait to buy the other editions :)</li>
            <li>The colours are rich and last.</li>
            <li>The makeup is long lasting and the palettes have nice colors.  </li>
            <li>I just got this along with two other items I had ordered today, I am impressed for the most part, the colors are very pretty and vibrant, but one of the shadows was broken and another fell out completely when I opened the pallet, other than that</li>
            <li>Some of the colors are highly pigmented but others were very muted.</li>
            <li>I have been wanting a palette like this for so long, something that has every color of the rainbow for cheap.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t completely tell from the pictures, but was very exited!</li>
            <li>I was super excited to have the Little brown box handed to me today.  </li>
            <li>, I mean what more do you want this will most likely have any color you need/want.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I receive my new palette soon!</li>
            <li>Blends beautifully and you don&#x27;t need that much eyeshadow to make a dramatic look!</li>
            <li>I tried out a few colors and it is very high and pigmented some more than others.</li>
            <li>The top criss-cross texture on half of the shadows were rubbed off.  </li>
            <li>The colors are really vibrant</li>
            <li>It literally arrived quickly through standard mail.</li>
            <li>the colors are vibrant, very similar to MAC eyeshadows just make sure your eye lids have been primed prior to application.</li>
            <li>but you have to be realistic</li>
            <li>The colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as they were on here, but they are well pigmented and are creamy.</li>
            <li>To reach the second palette, simply push the top palette up with the space in the side.  </li>
            <li>With the primer, the colors are vibrant and opaque.  </li>
            <li>Its okay for occasional use, but even when Urban Decay primer potion under it, the colors fade and crease through out the day.</li>
            <li>The colors are so vibrant</li>
            <li>the colors are so vibrant.</li>
            <li>vibrant  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s mainly my fault</li>
            <li>of a let down, had been very excited before I received my palatte.</li>
            <li>given you use a base which i always do) I have been able to wear them for hours and have the color stay as bright as when i first applied.</li>
            <li>For someone who wants to play with color but not have it showing vividly, this may be for you.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>High pigment eye shadows...</li>
            <li>I highly doubt that I will order from BH again.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly Pigmented&lt;br</li>
            <li>the hinge for the case is missing a metal piece that&#x27;s why i didn&#x27;t give it five stars but other than that it was a great buy and will definately buy from this seller again</li>
            <li>From other reveiws i read poor shipping, but i decided to take the risk and the shipping was great!</li>
            <li>As far as the potency of the colors goes, you certainly do need an eye shadow base/primer.  </li>
            <li>the shadows are a little tougher to get off then most</li>
            <li>The colors are highly pigmented, very bright and a little goes a long long way!</li>
            <li>My palette was complete with no broken eye shadow.</li>
            <li>i might just have to get a few more to replace them.</li>
            <li>When I learned about the BHCosmetics eyeshadows, I was expecting something very expensive but was pleasantly surprised when I saw how affordable it was and was impressed with the selection in each edition.  </li>
            <li>pretty much every color you could possibly need.</li>
            <li>I wish there were a few more browns</li>
            <li>about a good 5-6 of the colors were broken</li>
            <li>I think this should have been packaged a little better as only the palette itself was wrapped in bubble wrap and was able to move loosely around in the box.</li>
            <li>However, most colors will last a long time!</li>
            <li>This a great amount of colors to choose from if you are into color, however, it is very poorly pigmented.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful set with vibrent long lasting colors and alot bigger than expected for the price.</li>
            <li>When you open the container, you see the first palette, which is mainly blues, greens, yellows, and oranges.  </li>
            <li>And overall it&#x27;s pretty decent</li>
            <li>Think about how many individual eye shadows you&#x27;ve bought in the past and never had the right color for a look.</li>
            <li>She asked for this, I hope that she really liked, she has not saying bad words of this, so I am hoping its ok.</li>
            <li>The shadows are very pigmented &amp; show up very well, with lasting coverage.</li>
            <li>the colors are so bright my package arrived early nun of the makeup came broken</li>
            <li>And was very surprised with the quality of it.</li>
            <li>I definitely selected the right gift for this young lady.</li>
            <li>At first, I was discouraged about this palette because of the number of blue shadows.</li>
            <li>i would use urban decays eyeshawdow potion first and</li>
            <li>I was searching for some vivid color ideas and makeup applications</li>
            <li>and there was the color from that one soft touch!</li>
            <li>It is the 2nd palette I have owned, but the first was a Manly brand.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely comapre this to higher end makeup.</li>
            <li>, hope to try some more of BH cosmetics products and to all who are not sure of this product you need to try it</li>
            <li>a couple days early!)</li>
            <li>Seems pretty obvious to me.  </li>
            <li>There are so many colors to choose from too, that one will never get bored with this palette, and it will be put to good use everyday.  </li>
            <li>This is nice because, obviously, you are going to use a black or white more then a blue, red, or yellow.</li>
            <li>Of course they the color won&#x27;t stay like Shu Uemura, but just for some crazy make up at parties, it does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>I was initially worried about the quality of the product after reading reviews that said the eyeshadows had broken and mixed with other colors during shipping, but my palette was fine and all the colors look great.</li>
            <li>, it was very clear that it was completely USED.</li>
            <li>Eyeshadows feel very soft, look pigment rich and will last all day long.</li>
            <li>I wanted this palette for so long and was so excited when I finally decided to get it.</li>
            <li>I hit pan on the one good eyeshadow (the red) after like 4 uses and the rest of the shadows are too weak to use even with primer.</li>
            <li>Remember you&#x27;re not paying for MAC, so it&#x27;s not super quality but is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>These Colors are hard to find and im glad I ordered them.</li>
            <li>It is hard to separate the top layer from the bottom</li>
            <li>The product came with what I thought was an incredible amount of bubble wrap and when I opened the palette only two eyeshadows were only slightly cracked (not enough to render the eyeshadow unusable, or that they mixed/ruined the other eyeshadows).    </li>
            <li>They were all too bright and flashy for a grown women.</li>
            <li>THE COLORS ARE CLEARLY DEFINED IN THE SKIN, RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>Some colors are not the same in the pallete than what you see in your eyes, but they are really beautifull, anyway.</li>
            <li>colours are really pigmented and the price is really low for the use.&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead!</li>
            <li>Fixed that too, no issues here.  </li>
            <li>I just received my palette today, but I ordered it directly from BH Cosmetics along with 10 brushes, and a gel liner.  </li>
            <li>just buy the real thing for a couple extra bucks.</li>
            <li>they last all day and are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>i swatched only one and it seemed very pigmented.  </li>
            <li>5 colors were completely destroyed bits of powder were everywhere contaminating the rest of the colors.  </li>
            <li>has all the colors you may want as far as the rainbow goes, purples, pinks, blues and teals, yellows, greens, and some neutrals.</li>
            <li>i was like WOW</li>
            <li>but i simply fixed it with alcohol and</li>
            <li>I was surprised how well packaged it was</li>
            <li>2 are completely unusable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i fixed them tho....</li>
            <li>fixed it.</li>
            <li>I am completely unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>I was waiting for my WOW moment.</li>
            <li>They are however, not velvety like say urban decay shadows, they are more along the lines of a wet n wild gritty texture</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that it came completely damaged.</li>
            <li>Well my mom fixed it to the point where it&#x27;s usable</li>
            <li>You should really label them fragile, cause thats what they are.</li>
            <li>Order it directly from bh cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>I wouldnt recommend this for professional use.</li>
            <li>The lid of the palette was also entirely blank, the real ones say BH  Cosmetics 120 Shadow Palette etc.  </li>
            <li>This is a complete scam</li>
            <li>I only gave four stars, rather than five, because there really isn&#x27;t much of each color.</li>
            <li>only con for this is that the circles are not glued in very well.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a self made professional with this.  </li>
            <li>:  As a Professional MUA you may feel like you are not \\&quot;Professional\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a Pro MUA I have to say I bought this because I tried a friends version of this Palette and thought you only paid how much?</li>
            <li>If you want a &#x27;Summer Eye Kissed&#x27; look, that will seem professional and playfull</li>
            <li>The lighter colors need to be applied more heavily, of course, than the darker ones for the same brightness.</li>
            <li>Ok so I would have given 5 stars but one of my colors was broken, really shattered into powder</li>
            <li>, it worth each penny spent on it.</li>
            <li>You just need a few swipes of a certain color, and it shows right up on the lid.  </li>
            <li>I like it more than MAC because in mac, u only get so little color, with such a high price.</li>
            <li>The makeup wells are smaller than i thought they would be, but they are adequate, and their are very few shimmer colors which are the new hot thing.</li>
            <li>The more vivid colors, likely used much less often, will last quite a while.</li>
            <li>well worth your while because it will save you time scanning through all the other reviews.     </li>
            <li>The colors are easy to apply, though some have complained about fall-out, and although the pigmentation is not impeccable, it is more then decent for the price I payed for it.</li>
            <li>and you see the second palette, which is mainly your purples, reds, and neutral colors.  </li>
            <li>(i do suggest it if you want vibrant colors but not necessary)</li>
            <li>It has all basic colors and the palette is highly pigmented.  </li>
            <li>Ending on a high, here, this pallet has a REAL RED!</li>
            <li>I objectively consider BH Cosmetics a high quality make-up product.  </li>
            <li>A big plus for me is that this doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes; which is ALWAYS an issue for me when trying out new products.</li>
            <li>The only reason that I have it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I personally think that it could have been packaged a little bit better.</li>
            <li>(Just use some primer and pat them on gently and the colors tend to streak less but even then you don&#x27;t need as much product.)</li>
            <li>When closed, the case doesn&#x27;t look at pretty with all the marks.</li>
            <li>It was in the original box, wrapped in a type of brown paper, then a weird type of shredded paper/cloth and repackaged into a larger box - cost me a fortune (more than the actual item) to ship it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was definitely sceptical because of the price being so low for so much eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>one of the yellow shadows was broken up and kind of all over the surrounding colors.</li>
            <li>It was NOT due to the packing because this product was packed</li>
            <li>Nothing a little hot glue couldn&#x27;t fix though!</li>
            <li>The colors are vet vibrant and different and go on extremely colorful, not full or faded looking like some eye shadows!</li>
            <li>So, half a star is deducted for needing another product to achieve this product&#x27;s full potential.  </li>
            <li>also, while the greens and yellows are very pigmented and last all day, the other colors do not seem to last as much</li>
            <li>Little disappointing as i was expecting 120 different colors, but other than slight issues, it&#x27;s perfect, especially considering the price. :)</li>
            <li>Some colors I am unlikely to use, like bright neon yellow for example, but that&#x27;s just my personal preference.</li>
            <li>it will not really show much.</li>
            <li>and you barely need any to make it show up intensively.</li>
            <li>That is so what I had NOT expected.</li>
            <li>Overall this is the coolest makeup product I have purchased so far.</li>
            <li>It came in a taped cardboard box marked fragile.  </li>
            <li>Also, the whites barely show up, even with primer.  </li>
            <li>and i barely touched the eyeshadow</li>
            <li>Cant wait to get another one :O)</li>
            <li>I received it next day directly from the company,  </li>
            <li>DONT spend good money on this crappy and downright dangerous palette (some shadows may contain led)</li>
            <li>It got delivered to the wrong apt</li>
            <li>I love the colors but the mirror was broken when I received it and the shadows were falling out</li>
            <li>After I saw that nothing was broken I immediately fell in love with the colors.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Using a good primer or base is extremely necessary for these eyeshadows to reach their full potential, otherwise the colors are powdery and lacking in pigment.</li>
            <li>Another half a star was deducted because, even though the pictures show reds, there is really only one true red in the palette.  </li>
            <li>but if you really need it to last very very long I would recomend using a primer.</li>
            <li>I loved the colors on the palette but half of it was broken when i received it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these to anyone with my frustrations and cannot afford to spend $18.00 on a single palette of MAC eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>So pigmented and the colors are so vibrant and long lasting.</li>
            <li>It can be found on eBay or other sites for a much lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not a single one was broke</li>
            <li>This appeared to be a moderate concern, but when you look more closely at the percentage reviewed versus the percentage that reviewed and received a broken palette, you find the chances are quite slim.</li>
            <li>You just put on a little and it looks pretty.</li>
            <li>The pallette has amazing colors, but as I knew from other reviews, four were broken when they arrived.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Truth is, I don&#x27;t reach for it on a regular basis because for every day wear I generally prefer neutral colors.</li>
            <li>the whites had shattered and gotten eyeshadow dust everywhere, the black were smeared onto most of the other colors due to the plastic that was used to cover the eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>First of all, I ended up ordering this one by mistake, I thought I had ordered another product and panicked a little thinking that I was going to have to send it back.</li>
            <li>Remove and let it dry completely.</li>
            <li>I mainly bought it because I don&#x27;t have enough pink, orange, yellow, and red colors, and in this set, there are PLENTY.    </li>
            <li>Red eye shadow that is true solid red and not brick or burgundy is hard to find.</li>
            <li>I was a little ok ill admit I was very spectacle about the palette because I only is Bare Minerals</li>
            <li>now the reason for the 2 stars, when the palette came the box and cover were fine, nothing broken.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are about the size of a dime maybe a little bit bigger and that may sound like a little</li>
            <li>the color are very pigmented, so i only have to use a little bit,</li>
            <li>Overall I will give it 5 stars because got shipped really fast and also just because 1 broke a little its nature to these eyeshadows</li>
    </ol>

            <li> the colours are so bright</li>
            <li> but if you know how to manipulate the color palette they won&#x27;t be so bright</li>
            <li> The colors are so bright and the color doesn&#x27;t fade off.</li>
            <li> Amazing products for a great price! :)</li>
            <li> They are just as bright as they are in the photos.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m learning how to apply eyeshadow, I muat say these colors are a bit to bright for a starter like me.</li>
            <li> My wife loved it.</li>
            <li> anyway everything else is good.   </li>
            <li> good  Variety:</li>
            <li> good  </li>
            <li> good  Durability:</li>
            <li> purchased this for my daughter who is 16, she loves it and seems to be good quality</li>
            <li> but it holds up way good.</li>
            <li> didnt think that was a good sign.  </li>
            <li> The quality is surprisingly good.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is really good.</li>
            <li> I loved everything about it.</li>
            <li> pigmentation is awesome and so cheap....</li>
            <li> but that is solved with some good eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Loved this palette.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous palette, bright colors, lacks the eye shadow brush but you can do it yourself.</li>
            <li> and I thought this would be a good place to start.</li>
            <li> After watching youtube reviews, I saw how good they packaged their products.  </li>
            <li> The palette itself is gorgeous and the colors are so pigmented.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for really good eyeshadow at a good price, I came across this palette</li>
            <li> Not of good quality...</li>
            <li> If you are light skinned like, lets say Katherine Heigl then it may be awesome.  </li>
            <li> Good pigment  too.  </li>
            <li> the pigmentation was SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> and this work good say on good with primer throw</li>
            <li> I recommend an eye primer and a good make up remover.</li>
            <li> The quality is just as good as anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The product is really good for the price.</li>
            <li> The colors are really beautiful and the pigment is really strong!</li>
            <li> ok let me start off with the quality, it is amazingly bright and beautiful.</li>
            <li> The best makeup that you can purchase for the right price!</li>
            <li> Its good to wear for a day or a night out and has very cute colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are very bright and its easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I Love love love this !!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really amazing and its so bright you can mix and match.</li>
            <li> Colors are great  good price love it perfect for first timers learning how to do</li>
            <li> After Reading many reviews about BHcosmetics and how great of shape their products were in when they arrived</li>
            <li> and she will not be very pleased when she opens it.</li>
            <li> With that said, I am very pleased with the shipping and handling.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t be any more happy.</li>

            <li> I felt it was very safe in the bubble wrap</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very pleased with this product</li>
            <li> Great pigmentation, much better than the ELF 144 pallet.</li>
            <li> But I still love the pallet lol</li>
            <li> Nice and bright.  </li>

            <li> , I will order from them again because they are very fast and a really great company, plus things tend to get damaged evey once in a while</li>
            <li> All of the colors are very pigmented and look absolutely beautiful.</li>
            <li> The colors are great and very pigmented!</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and very pigmented</li>
            <li> Just love playing with all the color combinations &amp; I&#x27;m soooo happy to have purchased it for such a great price.</li>
            <li> It came packaged very securely with bubble wrap, brown packing paper, and a brown mesh packing paper wrapped around everything.  </li>
            <li> And I do know that if you use it without primer, they won&#x27;t show up at all, or just very light.</li>
            <li> I have an olive skin tone, very light but still considered olive.</li>
            <li> a great selection of highly pigmented shadows for an amazing price.</li>
            <li> All of the colors are wonderfully bright and bold.</li>
            <li> lol i dont know which color to use first :)    </li>
            <li> The colors are awesome and are true to color and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I love this palette, I use it all of the time as the colors are vibrant and gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Colors are vibrant and beautiful just as described.</li>
            <li> The colors from the eye shadow palette are so beautiful and vibrant.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and beautiful.</li>
            <li> i still love it and with my primer and eye milk</li>
            <li> Im in love with it</li>
            <li> I love both, but I use the 120 palette more because the colors are easier to blend.</li>
            <li> While I was fixing them (there are many tutorials on youtube)</li>
            <li> Fingerprints were on the glossy parts of the palette, the top textured pattern imprint on the top of each shadow was rubbed off and smudged around in most of the shadows.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m SO GLAD that I checked before I almost gave it as a gift.    </li>
            <li> SURE</li>
            <li> i love the colors in the palette how they come out on my eyes..</li>
            <li> I know how to achieve my desired look, but if you are a rookie all these colors are too many options...</li>
            <li> My sister gave me this palette since I was the one that used it the most  </li>
            <li> but I use the one with the blacks and brown  more</li>
            <li> I just love the BH Cosmetics 120 color eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> and I got all three colors :-).</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this palette</li>
            <li> im satisfied.</li>
            <li> I use mostly MAC makeup, my concealer, foundation, powder, primer, all MAC.</li>
            <li> it stays on for most of my day, throughout school and work.</li>
            <li> But when I&#x27;m in the mood for a bright and colorful look, I will use my 120 palette.</li>
            <li> I have mostly all the colors i would need.</li>
            <li> but hopefully the learn to fix the product shipping packaging better.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love the colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this one.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> The 1st edition has a great variety of colors and the casing is very well made.</li>
            <li> It could use better packaging.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love both sets of shadows &amp; with all the color selections</li>
            <li> I love this palette.</li>
            <li> There was bubble wrap surrounding the palette inside the box, and Amazon added more bubble wrap around the box to protect it.</li>
            <li> There were plastic slips on top of both palettes.  </li>
            <li> My top palette did not come with a ribbon like it shows on the Amazon picture.  </li>
            <li> I might just switch the palettes so that the one with the ribbon is on top.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, place the top palette on the lid</li>
            <li> :)  Count   </li>
            <li> If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!</li>
            <li> To be a women of color I love it no matter what color I choose from it</li>
            <li> shows up I&#x27;ve used many brands with color</li>
            <li> but it would rub off or never show the way they were mentioned this dose the job and more for shades for my money</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Had this for almost 3 years and still love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the matte and satin finishes the most.</li>
            <li> but it still comes with so many colors it didn&#x27;t even matter..</li>
            <li> I love the case</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cute and stylish.</li>
            <li> The colors are a great variety, some of these colors are very dificult to find</li>
            <li> I truly love this product.</li>
            <li> but there are the times I like to be adventurous.</li>
            <li> i love them, i recomend to every girl that loves eyeshadow should buy this product.</li>
            <li> this palette would be better if u were to use a primer of some sort.  </li>
            <li> Waoo i love this eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> and you get more color options.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> it was wrapped like three times in bubble wrap, then inside the box that hold the eyeshadow pallete had more bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors &amp;#60;3.</li>
            <li> I love this palette, but not the shipping.</li>
            <li> It need to be packaged better for sure.</li>
            <li> Aside from that I love the case and the selection of colors inside.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t dream of it being better.</li>
            <li> I love love love this palette.  </li>
            <li> and I have fallen in love with this palette.  </li>
            <li> What I love most about the 120 palette is that there are a lot of matte colors.  </li>
            <li> The 88 palette has more shimmer.  </li>
            <li> With this palette I love the case.  </li>
            <li> so i have the opportunity to wear the funky colors and be really creative.</li>
            <li> i have never gotten so many compliments in one day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I took the plunge</li>
            <li> i am just in love with this pallete.  </li>
            <li> Love love love the colors</li>
            <li> Has so many color cant wait to try them all.great quality</li>
            <li> color payoff depends on the color, but it&#x27;s safe to say that the matte colors are more pigmented than the shimmery colors.</li>
            <li> Of course, you&#x27;ll get much better results if you use an eyeshadow primer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love everything about it except for the fact that it&#x27;s kinda flake-y.</li>
            <li> Gotta love bubble wrap :</li>
            <li> so you can basically do most of the makeups with it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about it.</li>
            <li> I love how there&#x27;s so many colors</li>
            <li> i must say, thank you so much for this great product</li>
            <li> and then you need to find a surface to rest the top layer on.</li>
            <li> Never have I seen such beautiful colors frome a make-up palette!!!</li>
            <li> I am a sexy milk chocolate</li>
            <li> I get many comments on the colors and I wear it just about every day.</li>
            <li> The colors are great and very pigminted.</li>

            <li> I love BH cosmetics and their products</li>
            <li> I do however need to say some are more pigmented then others</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE</li>
            <li> I have been complimented on how I use them I do like the many colors it comes with.</li>
            <li> I am a MAC girl, but didn&#x27;t want to spend oodles of money on a color I wasn&#x27;t sure about.</li>
            <li> There is an interesting odor from the makeup I can&#x27;t seem to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed and definitely would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Really love my palette.</li>
            <li> There are so many</li>
            <li> I have used it in numerous of my daughter&#x27;s theater productions and it works great!!</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this palette.</li>
            <li> They really are great.</li>
            <li> This has to be one of my favorite eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li> Love the pigments love the packaging, love using it.&lt;br /&gt;Work</li>
            <li> I purchased this palette because I like to do elaborate make-up for Halloween and events.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would recommend this palette to anyone and I am personally, very, very happy with mine.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup</li>
            <li> Cute for all tones</li>
            <li> My daughter love this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad she love it.</li>
            <li> So Many Colors&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I played around with all the colors and used them at several photoshoots and must say the product and the price are superb.</li>
            <li> These remind me of Yaby Pearl of Paint shadows..but has more punch than Yaby and MAC&#x27;s matte shadows.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no falling off effect, no horrible after tint color..</li>
            <li> It shipped fast, it got here in decent amount of time, and the colors and pallet its self was a great size and great quality.</li>
            <li> The product itself is very nice with intense colors.</li>
            <li> I received the first palette, and I love the matte finish of the bright colors.</li>
            <li> This pallet, again, full of really nice colors, I love how they come on, but I can&#x27;t use all the colors.</li>
            <li> There nice and clean not caked out like Mac</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented and great colors</li>
            <li> Great assortment of colors that are highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> Very reasonably priced and a good product.</li>
            <li> That was a pretty good trick.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow stays on for hours and still looks as good as it did when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> but it is actually pretty good.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy for my new makeup.</li>
            <li> I really love this palette, it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this brand and was very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have three of the different palettes and I can say that they have nice quality and great colors.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for trying all kinds of colors that you may not normally try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> LOOOOve this product, so many bright colors, but you need to use a primer to get the color to last, Very glad i bought this</li>
            <li> , i refuse to buy more higher priced items when i can get this at cheap price and works just as good.</li>
            <li> is what to do:&lt;br /&gt;Crush up the color in its original circle into a very fine powder.</li>
            <li> Love this product the best, I recommend this to other friends.</li>
            <li> good as new!!)    </li>
            <li> the colors are bright and their very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I would repurchase again, but don&#x27;t think I need too since i don&#x27;t wear bright colors all that much</li>
            <li> It is very well although I received the shimerry ones and not the bright ones....</li>
            <li> I was surprised because my mum dropped it twice lol.  </li>
            <li> whomever does not know how to safely and secure these packages.</li>
            <li> I love the smooth texture eyeshadow that this brand have.</li>
            <li> Great gift for a young lady.</li>
            <li> The most important thing everyone should know is that this IS NOT A BH COSMETICS BRAND PALETTE.</li>
            <li> The product came really carefully packed and every eyeshadow was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> the colors are true to their colors and honestly the picture of the product accurately portrays the colors.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and am really amazed at how good it works.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the eye shadow stays on haha which I guess is good, but I gotta get me</li>
            <li> THE packing was really good came fast</li>
            <li> Came right on time too!!</li>
            <li> I think this is a wonderful product, and it is very handy, not a very BIG BIG case.</li>
            <li> I love the bright vivid colors as well as the speckled ones on the end.  </li>
            <li> Other then that.. very good product!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get this eyeshadow because all the youtube videos i seen and reviews said the colors were amazing.</li>
            <li> Let it sit for 24 hours and your color is good as new!</li>
            <li> I love telling people that talk about how great the price is that you CAN get this same palette for even cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li> After using it, I found the blues to be very wearable and because there are so many of them, I can create amazing fading effects across my lid.</li>
            <li> easy to blend and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> And some will run out very quick.</li>
            <li> I love this item, this was a great price for it and a lot cheaper than the actual website had it</li>
            <li> With or without a case there colors are bright and vibrant.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice to have this item at such a good price</li>
            <li> and I can say BH Cosmetics has done an outstanding job with their eyeshadow palettes, specially with the 120 color ones.  </li>
            <li> I got it all happy then barely used.</li>
            <li> Plus, some of these colors would be cool to use for costumes or dress up :)</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was scared at first if to buy it or not.</li>
            <li> i love the quality true to color</li>
            <li> Tis fine.</li>
            <li> but since i love BHCosmetics i quickly got over it</li>
            <li> This pallet deserves 5 stars because they got here quick!</li>
            <li> THAT YOUR PRODUCT IS NEW BEFORE YOU USE IT!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I look forward to getting some more palettes from BH COSMETICS very soon, i have also since this first purchase ordered many of their brushes, brush cleaner, and foundation primer ,lip glosses, pencil/liquid eyeliners and alot more!</li>
            <li> so colors do not usually show up to bright on me...</li>
            <li> so let me first start off by saying that this product is awesome &amp; more than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> So its really good packaging though, somebody simply dropped it by accident, i cant complain pretty good though out of 120</li>
            <li> Very Matte I love this eye shadow palette!</li>
            <li> With their being so many colors for such a good price, high pigmentation, and a good amount of eyeshadow, I very much recommend this!!  </li>
            <li> Okay, these colors are soo much more vibrant and pigmented then in the pictures!</li>
            <li> The colors are super fun, too!!</li>
            <li> I consider myself a #1 fan of the best quality products in the professional and non professional make-up markets</li>
            <li> Colorful logo would have invited me in more.</li>
            <li> Bought this from BH Cosmetics about 2 weeks ago and selected the cheapest shipping option available.</li>
            <li> however i wasn&#x27;t to happy because when i received my palette some of the blue eyeshadow was broke like someone had dropped it before it got to me.</li>
            <li> that it the only thing i wasn&#x27;t to happy about</li>
            <li> and the colors are fantastic</li>
            <li> the color payoff is great especially when used with a primer.</li>
            <li> Now, I did realize it was cheap for a reason, but it also did surprise me how well it did its job.</li>
            <li> The pigments are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I wanted an eyeshadow palette with many fun colors and decided on this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light yet durable and compact for travel.</li>
            <li> If you are a fan of bright colors at a cheap price I would definitely recommend this eyeshadow palette!:)</li>
            <li> Great for multiple looks.</li>
            <li> I recieved this item within 5 days of ordering with free shipping.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s too light.</li>
            <li> Not only was it great for that day</li>
            <li> The amount of product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I have seen many reviews on you tube and looked up swatches and decided it was worth a look.</li>
            <li> the makeup is kinda cheap though.but</li>
            <li> I found this item on eBay and won the bid at $10.55 with free shipping.</li>
            <li> And the palette is so cheap that you can buy another as soon as this one has reached its end!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The colors in this 1st edition are along all the lines of brights, neons, primary, neutral, pastels, and glitters.</li>
            <li> it came package very well the color are amazing for this price</li>
            <li> the overall product was great</li>
            <li> Enjoy the colors and how they look.</li>
            <li> Great palette of shades, when added with a primer, they last all day.</li>
            <li> For such a reasonable price, it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wear many of the shades in this palette, and it would probably be good for theatrical wear.</li>
            <li> other than that the colors are very bright, there are mattes, and shimmery colors (not overly shimmery).  </li>
            <li> The bright colors are great for when I want a more dramatic look.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It&#x27;s very fun job</li>
            <li> I love how you can just add a dab of water to make the colors more vibrant.</li>
            <li> and I can say so far I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> Overall I was very satisfied and would buy more palettes from BH cosmetics and Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product was a great gift, my friend loved it so much I would really buy from this company again for my next event.</li>
            <li> The actual quality of the eyeshadows is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> but it was def worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I love these eyesshadows first of all I was so exited to recieve the palette on monday when i had order it on Saturday.</li>
            <li> I just love it so much!</li>
            <li> It was totally worth the price!</li>
            <li> I recommended them to my sister in law because she fell in love with them as much as I did!</li>
            <li> color I have swatched have been so rich.</li>
            <li> The colors are vivid and there are so many to choose from!</li>
            <li> Totaly worth the money,its a must have!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Colors are beautiful,pigmented,and budget friendly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you like experimenting with your eye makeup!! :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to order the other palettes now - the more natural colors. :D</li>
            <li> I like having the many options available when applying my whole</li>
            <li> I love the color selection for all my wild looks that I love to create.  </li>
            <li> i totally loved all the colors, non were broken when i got them, everything was great, the only thing i wish is that it would come with a mirror , but besides that , i totally loved it.</li>
            <li> The color payoff is only great in about half of the shadows, too; some of them are great, though, and I use them to contour</li>
            <li> will always love BH cosmetics very vibrant colors.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be my favorite eyeshadows, very vibrant and glided on like butter.</li>
            <li> Even when mixed with some \\&quot;transformer\\&quot; to make it more vivid, it still wasnt as great as I needed for it to be.</li>
            <li> Product came faster than expected which was great because I ordered it the Thursday before Halloween.</li>
            <li> I received faster than expected, great condition.</li>
            <li> I would have loved it if BH Cosmetics did the same thing.</li>
            <li> so its all cool.</li>
            <li> the colors are very repetitious, too many pinks and greens.</li>
            <li> I was 100% satisfied and shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I love this palette, I really do.</li>
            <li> I could in all honesty give this a 4 star, but I love it so much that I decided against that.  </li>
            <li> I think it is very affordable with so many colors in it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well as a wet/dry shadow, but if you use the primer you don&#x27;t need it to be a wet/dry :)</li>
            <li> and she was so surprised and thrilled at all the colors.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good starter it for teenage girls.</li>
            <li> Overall Good Value</li>
            <li> For the price it is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> you love bold hot colors you will love this!!!I love creating different looks</li>
            <li> So many pretty colors!!I have shown this to my friends and family and they are all anticipating ordering right away.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect professional and non professional vibrant color eyeshadow palette.  </li>
            <li> Many bold color&#x27;s to play around with and good if you want to use the shadow&#x27;s in place of the typical Halloween makeup or whatever.</li>
            <li> I like this palette better than the 2nd edition because they are better organized and have brighter colors.</li>
            <li> But, if you love creating various blended looks, B H C 120 palette is better.</li>
            <li> However, BHC may skimp on packaging materials with free shipping here--since I find that so many people said their palettes were damaged, so maybe order directly from the site instead to avoid that?  </li>
            <li> I got lucky and it was just 2</li>
            <li> I guess others weren&#x27;t so lucky, but by what I can tell, BH Cosmetics has upped their shipping standards since those reviews.  </li>
            <li> Lot&#x27;s of colors, but I don&#x27;t particularly like most of them.</li>
            <li> super pigmented.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful and variety of colors that are simple and extravagant at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great variety of colors very pigmented but feel duped because i was expecting actual BH Cosmetic product and this is a knock off</li>
            <li> Some of the eyeshadows are vibrant, but I found most to be chalky or have a lot of glitter fallout.</li>
            <li> Not only was the package in perfect condition upon its arrival, it also came a day or two earlier then predicted.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this 1st edition palette,  I will be purchasing 2nd edition soon.... :)</li>
            <li> Other wise everything&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I mostly use high end eye shadow, and this just did not compare.</li>
            <li> Highly pigments colors and so many to choose from.</li>
            <li> That is not the case with these, they are very pigmented and go on very smoothly, and you get such a spectrum of color which is pretty awesome when you just want to try something different.</li>
            <li> I have tried other kits and this has been by far the best experience.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> The colors are so bright and they stay on for a long time without smudging and creasing.</li>
            <li> The colors r very pretty</li>
            <li> Colors are beautiful, but I don&#x27;t use them everyday.  </li>
            <li> Especially high end brands like MAC,</li>
            <li> I love my palette, but I may invest in a new set of purples.</li>
            <li> The product itself was exactly what I expected and in great shape.</li>
            <li> colorful, bold colors.</li>
            <li> These shadows are easily blendable with intense color payoff.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> They are so pretty when applied!</li>
            <li> This pallet has every color that you could ever need and that&#x27;s exactly why I bought it!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> I also recommend their 88 color Neutral palette and/or their 28 color neutral color &amp; blush palette if you prefer more natural looks!</li>
            <li> First off, i was really excited when i purchased this!&lt;br /&gt;Today i decited to use tlthe 120 1st edition</li>
            <li> but it is incredibly pleasing that they thought it through and put in two &amp;#34;pots&amp;#34; of black, two of white, and many shades of brown.</li>
            <li> She was so happy and they even got to do make up on her little brother.</li>
            <li> Luckily I was able to call Amazon and they fixed the problem right away.  </li>
            <li> this eyeshadow is fantastic its very high pigmented as well</li>
            <li> Other than that, WELL WORTH THE PURCHASE!!!!</li>
            <li> I was sooo happy with this product I bought on for my ma, sister, teacher and guy friend who does drag!!!</li>
            <li> This palette is great, especially for a makeup artist that is just starting and doesn&#x27;t have a huge budget to blow.</li>
            <li> My shadow came securely wrapped in bubble wrap &amp; packaged very well.</li>
            <li> The colors are smooth and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> , it was entirely worth it - none of the colours were damaged in shipping and</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will recommend it to anyone considering it - for 120 colour palette, it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was perfectly boxed so no shadows were broken.</li>
            <li> Package arrived in perfect condition, no eye shadows broken or anything.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really fun palette to play with and see what color combinations you can come up with.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this for anyone, it comes in handy and you get every color you may need in any situation.</li>
            <li> I have been having so much fun experimenting with color.</li>
            <li> , I have a tendency to go towards more natural colors</li>
            <li> it is worth the money</li>
            <li> I am no makeup artist , but as a woman I buy a fair share of makeup from Maybelline to MAC, and I really do hate when a color looks to be perfect in a compact</li>
            <li> it is definitely worth using this merchant.  </li>
            <li> The range from matte to shimmer to frost is just such a nice range in selection, a look for every occasion.</li>
            <li> As far as packaging goes, it could&#x27;ve been better hence the fact that two of my colors were damaged.</li>
            <li> I say its deff innately worth the price</li>
            <li> It was packed nicely, I received my purchase completely in tact, there were no broken or shattered shadows.</li>
            <li> and I had so much fun playing with all of them, as soon as it arrives.</li>
            <li> Worth ever dollar .</li>
            <li> I think it was well worth the money I paid for it</li>
            <li> Nice product overall.</li>
            <li> It was well worth it.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth every penny</li>
            <li> Was actually cheaper here than on their own website.</li>
            <li> The colors are strong and vibrant.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had been wanting this palette forever after seeing so many reviews on youtube, so when I had some other gift shopping to do on Amazon, I decided to pick up this palette for myself :)    </li>
            <li> The colors are even more stunning in person and they swatch extremely well.</li>
            <li> I now use the eye shadow daily because it&#x27;s such a good product and so inexpensive!</li>
            <li> This is also good if you love to experiment with different colors as they are set up in a progressive color pattern going from dark to light.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very clean, and feels classy.</li>
            <li> Some colors are not as bright, but then again, there are a lot of other colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I can say about this the colours are so bright long lasting love</li>
            <li> The color does not fade on my eyes, i use a good primer before application, it blends extremely well and everytime i wear any color on here</li>
            <li> I love the colors, they blend very well and they are highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> I dropped it right on the floor and none of the shadows shattered.  </li>
            <li> and the shipping was right on time</li>
            <li> I normally use Mac eye shadow, but this palette has proven to last just as good all day &amp; night with primer.</li>
            <li> This is a product I would buy for me as well as for a loved one and would suggest it to anyone who is seriously considering to have a broad spectrum of colors in their vanity or make-up trainer / travel case, and will use it wisely and/or artistically.</li>
            <li> case is also slim and roughly the size of a spiral notebook, so it&#x27;s easy to pack; I can fit mine in my backpack with no bulk!</li>
            <li> Love this palette I cannot believe I got all of these beautiful colors for such a small price.</li>
            <li> 2 of the colors came broken but not a big deal worked great for everyone&#x27;s makeup I did for Halloween and at a good price</li>
            <li> i love that they arrived right away, the pigment is awesome but must be careful the shadows break easily and can get messy overall</li>
            <li> They arrived in perfect conditions, only one of the colors was a little bit cracked but</li>
            <li> Love them went well with other makeup easy to carry around if need works well with blending colors</li>
            <li> She use it everyday and is having a lot of fun mixing the colors to create her own unique look.</li>
            <li> My mom now wants her own set to replace the current eyeshadows that she has.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and none of the colors were cracked...</li>
            <li> Shipped super fast.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for something, bold, colorful and vibrant-</li>
            <li> i will use this forever great alternative to drugstore brands and even the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> She says they are so soft and easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Some of the colors are similar to bh&#x27;s palette, but it would have been nice to have the real thing.</li>
            <li> , i feel that the shimmery ones are more pigmented then the matte&#x27;s but nothing to serious that i wouldnt still love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty and very pigmented.</li>
            <li> The colors are bright and long lasting and are lavishly available.</li>
            <li> i recommend this product very much.</li>
            <li> It is very cheap and the color is vibrate enough.</li>
            <li> And arrived very fast...</li>
            <li> but it don&#x27;t have a large range of dark colors just a lot of pinks , blues , greens, and yellows basically a lot of bright colors no neutral colors....</li>
            <li> It does not have much pigment at all contrary to how dark or bright the colors appear.</li>
            <li> I actually brought two more for family and friends</li>
            <li> I just received my order and the first thing I did was try it on.</li>
            <li> There are many colors and some similar shades but no duplicates.</li>
            <li> i really wish they had more shimmery colors, smoky colors and a few more browns.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty convinced that this is a knock-off.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Also, the color payoff of these eyeshadows is HIGH!!  </li>
            <li> My current favorite is Too Faced Shadow Insurance, and I also use U.D.P.P.  </li>
            <li> I really recomend this palette!</li>
            <li> My first time using this I looked like a ghost around the eyes.</li>
            <li> and if you are thinking about buying this product, you DEFINITELY should, I PROMISE YOU WONT BE DISAPOINTED! :)</li>
            <li> The palette is pretty hefty, heavier than my coastal scents 88 palettte.  </li>
            <li> I just received the first edition today and</li>
            <li> (the powder is pretty lose</li>
            <li> Everyone is different and some prefer to spend more money, but if I can save money and still get a comparable item</li>
            <li> Other than that I love it thank you!</li>
            <li> the colors are very pigmented and to die for!</li>
            <li> I would have to put a few layers of eyeshadow on for the makeup to be as bright as the palette.</li>
            <li> For starters, this is my first makeup purchase from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Inside the box were multiple layers of brown paper that covered the package from top to bottom.  </li>
            <li> The first palette also contains the six marbled colors.  </li>
            <li> When you&#x27;re done with the palettes, place the first back on top and shut your lid.  </li>
            <li> The others are much more pinkish or orangey than red.  </li>
            <li> You definitely need a base/primer for most of these colors.</li>
            <li> I love the pigmentation, and they do last all day.</li>
            <li> The first time I used to go to the beach and my eyeshadow still there all daay and night.</li>
            <li> I recommended this products really works!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors, but I think that some of them are pretty similar.</li>
            <li> Since that is what I did when I first opened it.  </li>
            <li> First of all I would like to say these shadows have been something I&#x27;ve wanted for a while.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very prompt!     </li>
            <li> I had ordered a different set that was packed much better</li>
            <li> awesome and pigmented u can instantly use them without any base they are great.</li>
            <li> And this palette gave me exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> my first makeup palette purchase.</li>
            <li> Love it because it has various colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> The colors and sizes were exactly as described.</li>
            <li> On time, and exactly like the description.</li>
            <li> Would pay way more if I would bought all those colors individually .</li>
            <li> ALL the colors are really pretty</li>
            <li> As for the product, i do not lie when i say when i bearly touched the first color</li>
            <li> I like that the palette covers all color palettes for the most part so you can do several kinds of looks!</li>
            <li> I have no idea whether this eye shadow is any good in terms of quality, but I can tell you that I feel like I just wasted 20 bucks.  </li>
            <li> These colors are so bold that you really don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> This palette is cheap enough as it is, and they still weaseled their way out of contacting me by phone or sending me a new one after contacting them 7 times!!!!  </li>
            <li> Colors are very bright which I love for changing up my usual everyday makeup look.</li>
            <li> and the most beautiful red, that came broken ):</li>
            <li> i m sure this palette will last me a long time :)</li>
            <li> Great colors last a long time and you can do so much with it.</li>
            <li> They work great especially when used wet.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this palette for any beginner or even if you&#x27;re a professional or like to do free-lance makeup, this is an amazing addition to your collection.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to a teen or someone who works where bright makeup isnt acceptable.</li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected and in great packaging.</li>
            <li> Used it mainly on myself and clients that want colorful eyes..</li>
            <li> so anyways I would recemend this product to anyone because the colors are beautiful and vibrant and you def get your money&#x27;s worth even though one color was broken</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a great place to start if you are just starting to build your makeup collection, or maybe you want to try some bright crazy color combinations without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> When I first received this palette it was very well wrapped.</li>
            <li> The colors are great: highly pigmented, blend well, stand out, stay put.. in other words they are everything you&#x27;d want from an eye shadow, and the price is way better than their more expensive competitors.</li>
            <li> I use this along with Urban Decay Primer Potion, and it makes the color even more vibrant - and it literally stays on ALL day without any fading or creasing.</li>
            <li> I like being able to blend different colors together and this palette offers so many different colors.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s fun when I try new eyebrow colors.</li>
            <li> and it came in a nice black box.</li>
            <li> The colors are so bright, and they last all day long without smudging or creasing.</li>
            <li> I have yet to try on the eyeshadows but the colors look/seem very vibrant.    </li>
            <li> are very vibrant and stay on forever!&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just strong when I open the dispenser.</li>
            <li> There are a few colors that aren&#x27;t very pigmented, but most of them are!</li>
            <li> Colors are soo pretty and vibrant.  </li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant!</li>
            <li> There is a ton of each color and they&#x27;re very high quality.</li>
            <li> the picture is very deceiving.</li>
            <li> but i cant really find them in stores</li>
            <li> Not so much...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but  some you really have to pack in the color for it to show up on the eyelid.</li>
            <li> , I tested some of the colors and they seem very pigmented</li>
            <li> Just like everyone says they are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> The colors really are as pigmented as they look, and all you need is one swipe of your brush, and you have all the color that you need.</li>
            <li> Very unprofessional.    </li>
            <li> With that said I do really like the KIT</li>
            <li> I removed the bubble wrapped palette from the envelope, unwrapped it and the palette itself looked very dirt, looked like chalk,</li>
            <li> The shadows are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re very affordable</li>
            <li> Some of the lighter colors don&#x27;t work real well on me</li>
            <li> I really like the BHCosmetics eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented colors.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I opened the palette and absolutely none of the colors were chattered.  </li>
            <li> It was just a light yellow</li>
            <li> So very pigmented and there is every color you could ever want.</li>
            <li> It was packaged very well</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented and are not chalky or cause a lot of fall out.</li>
            <li> Prefect shipping, no broken pots.</li>
            <li> so much</li>
            <li> I wound totally recommend this to beginners and advanced makeup artists.</li>
            <li> haha</li>
            <li> The case is very sturdy and comes wrapped in bubble wrap and a box.  </li>
            <li> Also, you have to use a lot of the product because they don&#x27;t seem to be very pigmented.</li>
            <li> The shipping was extreamly fast.</li>
            <li> You really get a lot for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the very corners of the bottom tray.</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t believed this.    </li>
            <li> My daughter wants to experiment with her eye make-up</li>
            <li> I have been looking for an eyeshadow palette for ages, and couldn&#x27;t really decide on one.</li>
            <li> Very convenient for carrying around and all sorts.  </li>
            <li> Very well wrapped and packed</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend this product!</li>
            <li> so the shades don&#x27;t show very well on me.  </li>
            <li> so the review did not help me much</li>
            <li> The colors are fantastic and it last all day.</li>
            <li> My wife really like this product she uses it all of the time.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> the product was much more than I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> No broken shadows.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like they didn&#x27;t even make an effort to make it look like the real thing.  </li>
            <li> It came in a sketchy unmarked box; real palettes have the BH logo and text and pictures all over the box.  </li>
            <li> On the inside of the box, the real palettes have a mirror.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this palette so much to anyone who is beggining to expiriment with colors and practice with blending .</li>
            <li> and it applies very well.  </li>
            <li> Blends very well too.  </li>
            <li> the colors are very pigmented  </li>
            <li> but it was actually very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I thought that it was going to be tiny circles of cheap makeup</li>
            <li> Downfall is I do not use it that much anymore.</li>
            <li> awesome product they shipped rite away and the packaging is superb..however only one of my colours got broken</li>
            <li> Brands like BH Cosmetics, Coastal Scents etc all stick their own brand labels on them but they&#x27;re the same generic palette...</li>
            <li> Well from all the reviews i read, most of them said that theirs came broken and mine fortunately did not!</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t many neutrals, so if you like neutrals, BHCosmetics offers an entire 88 palette of those.    </li>
            <li> Far better than trying to haul five different four-color palettes</li>
            <li> This was completely USED!!!  </li>
            <li> With a good base I can get several hours of bright full color that lasts until I wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you look at all the youtube videos you will believe that it is super easy to get a vibrant color from this collection, but it takes a little talent, skill, primer, and use of your fingers, because brushes aren&#x27;t really gonna do it.</li>
            <li> After removing the brown paper, I found even more protective packaging that other reviewers haven&#x27;t mentioned yet.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend anyone to buy this palette, I can&#x27;t wait to buy the other editions :)</li>
            <li> The colours are rich and last.</li>
            <li> The makeup is long lasting and the palettes have nice colors.  </li>
            <li> I just got this along with two other items I had ordered today, I am impressed for the most part, the colors are very pretty and vibrant, but one of the shadows was broken and another fell out completely when I opened the pallet, other than that</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are highly pigmented but others were very muted.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a palette like this for so long, something that has every color of the rainbow for cheap.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t completely tell from the pictures, but was very exited!</li>
            <li> I was super excited to have the Little brown box handed to me today.  </li>
            <li> , I mean what more do you want this will most likely have any color you need/want.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I receive my new palette soon!</li>
            <li> Blends beautifully and you don&#x27;t need that much eyeshadow to make a dramatic look!</li>
            <li> I tried out a few colors and it is very high and pigmented some more than others.</li>
            <li> The top criss-cross texture on half of the shadows were rubbed off.  </li>
            <li> The colors are really vibrant</li>
            <li> It literally arrived quickly through standard mail.</li>
            <li> the colors are vibrant, very similar to MAC eyeshadows just make sure your eye lids have been primed prior to application.</li>
            <li> but you have to be realistic</li>
            <li> The colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as they were on here, but they are well pigmented and are creamy.</li>
            <li> To reach the second palette, simply push the top palette up with the space in the side.  </li>
            <li> With the primer, the colors are vibrant and opaque.  </li>
            <li> Its okay for occasional use, but even when Urban Decay primer potion under it, the colors fade and crease through out the day.</li>
            <li> The colors are so vibrant</li>
            <li> the colors are so vibrant.</li>
            <li> vibrant  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s mainly my fault</li>
            <li> of a let down, had been very excited before I received my palatte.</li>
            <li> given you use a base which i always do) I have been able to wear them for hours and have the color stay as bright as when i first applied.</li>
            <li> For someone who wants to play with color but not have it showing vividly, this may be for you.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> High pigment eye shadows...</li>
            <li> I highly doubt that I will order from BH again.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly Pigmented&lt;br</li>
            <li> the hinge for the case is missing a metal piece that&#x27;s why i didn&#x27;t give it five stars but other than that it was a great buy and will definately buy from this seller again</li>
            <li> From other reveiws i read poor shipping, but i decided to take the risk and the shipping was great!</li>
            <li> As far as the potency of the colors goes, you certainly do need an eye shadow base/primer.  </li>
            <li> the shadows are a little tougher to get off then most</li>
            <li> The colors are highly pigmented, very bright and a little goes a long long way!</li>
            <li> My palette was complete with no broken eye shadow.</li>
            <li> i might just have to get a few more to replace them.</li>
            <li> When I learned about the BHCosmetics eyeshadows, I was expecting something very expensive but was pleasantly surprised when I saw how affordable it was and was impressed with the selection in each edition.  </li>
            <li> pretty much every color you could possibly need.</li>
            <li> I wish there were a few more browns</li>
            <li> about a good 5-6 of the colors were broken</li>
            <li> I think this should have been packaged a little better as only the palette itself was wrapped in bubble wrap and was able to move loosely around in the box.</li>
            <li> However, most colors will last a long time!</li>
            <li> This a great amount of colors to choose from if you are into color, however, it is very poorly pigmented.  </li>
            <li> Beautiful set with vibrent long lasting colors and alot bigger than expected for the price.</li>
            <li> When you open the container, you see the first palette, which is mainly blues, greens, yellows, and oranges.  </li>
            <li> And overall it&#x27;s pretty decent</li>
            <li> Think about how many individual eye shadows you&#x27;ve bought in the past and never had the right color for a look.</li>
            <li> She asked for this, I hope that she really liked, she has not saying bad words of this, so I am hoping its ok.</li>
            <li> The shadows are very pigmented &amp; show up very well, with lasting coverage.</li>
            <li> the colors are so bright my package arrived early nun of the makeup came broken</li>
            <li> And was very surprised with the quality of it.</li>
            <li> I definitely selected the right gift for this young lady.</li>
            <li> At first, I was discouraged about this palette because of the number of blue shadows.</li>
            <li> i would use urban decays eyeshawdow potion first and</li>
            <li> I was searching for some vivid color ideas and makeup applications</li>
            <li> and there was the color from that one soft touch!</li>
            <li> It is the 2nd palette I have owned, but the first was a Manly brand.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely comapre this to higher end makeup.</li>
            <li> , hope to try some more of BH cosmetics products and to all who are not sure of this product you need to try it</li>
            <li> a couple days early!)</li>
            <li> Seems pretty obvious to me.  </li>
            <li> There are so many colors to choose from too, that one will never get bored with this palette, and it will be put to good use everyday.  </li>
            <li> This is nice because, obviously, you are going to use a black or white more then a blue, red, or yellow.</li>
            <li> Of course they the color won&#x27;t stay like Shu Uemura, but just for some crazy make up at parties, it does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li> I was initially worried about the quality of the product after reading reviews that said the eyeshadows had broken and mixed with other colors during shipping, but my palette was fine and all the colors look great.</li>
            <li> , it was very clear that it was completely USED.</li>
            <li> Eyeshadows feel very soft, look pigment rich and will last all day long.</li>
            <li> I wanted this palette for so long and was so excited when I finally decided to get it.</li>
            <li> I hit pan on the one good eyeshadow (the red) after like 4 uses and the rest of the shadows are too weak to use even with primer.</li>
            <li> Remember you&#x27;re not paying for MAC, so it&#x27;s not super quality but is definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> These Colors are hard to find and im glad I ordered them.</li>
            <li> It is hard to separate the top layer from the bottom</li>
            <li> The product came with what I thought was an incredible amount of bubble wrap and when I opened the palette only two eyeshadows were only slightly cracked (not enough to render the eyeshadow unusable, or that they mixed/ruined the other eyeshadows).    </li>
            <li> They were all too bright and flashy for a grown women.</li>
            <li> THE COLORS ARE CLEARLY DEFINED IN THE SKIN, RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Some colors are not the same in the pallete than what you see in your eyes, but they are really beautifull, anyway.</li>
            <li> colours are really pigmented and the price is really low for the use.&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead!</li>
            <li> Fixed that too, no issues here.  </li>
            <li> I just received my palette today, but I ordered it directly from BH Cosmetics along with 10 brushes, and a gel liner.  </li>
            <li> just buy the real thing for a couple extra bucks.</li>
            <li> they last all day and are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> i swatched only one and it seemed very pigmented.  </li>
            <li> 5 colors were completely destroyed bits of powder were everywhere contaminating the rest of the colors.  </li>
            <li> has all the colors you may want as far as the rainbow goes, purples, pinks, blues and teals, yellows, greens, and some neutrals.</li>
            <li> i was like WOW</li>
            <li> but i simply fixed it with alcohol and</li>
            <li> I was surprised how well packaged it was</li>
            <li> 2 are completely unusable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i fixed them tho....</li>
            <li> fixed it.</li>
            <li> I am completely unsatisfied.</li>
            <li> I was waiting for my WOW moment.</li>
            <li> They are however, not velvety like say urban decay shadows, they are more along the lines of a wet n wild gritty texture</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that it came completely damaged.</li>
            <li> Well my mom fixed it to the point where it&#x27;s usable</li>
            <li> You should really label them fragile, cause thats what they are.</li>
            <li> Order it directly from bh cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> I wouldnt recommend this for professional use.</li>
            <li> The lid of the palette was also entirely blank, the real ones say BH  Cosmetics 120 Shadow Palette etc.  </li>
            <li> This is a complete scam</li>
            <li> I only gave four stars, rather than five, because there really isn&#x27;t much of each color.</li>
            <li> only con for this is that the circles are not glued in very well.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a self made professional with this.  </li>
            <li> :  As a Professional MUA you may feel like you are not \\&quot;Professional\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a Pro MUA I have to say I bought this because I tried a friends version of this Palette and thought you only paid how much?</li>
            <li> If you want a &#x27;Summer Eye Kissed&#x27; look, that will seem professional and playfull</li>
            <li> The lighter colors need to be applied more heavily, of course, than the darker ones for the same brightness.</li>
            <li> Ok so I would have given 5 stars but one of my colors was broken, really shattered into powder</li>
            <li> , it worth each penny spent on it.</li>
            <li> You just need a few swipes of a certain color, and it shows right up on the lid.  </li>
            <li> I like it more than MAC because in mac, u only get so little color, with such a high price.</li>
            <li> The makeup wells are smaller than i thought they would be, but they are adequate, and their are very few shimmer colors which are the new hot thing.</li>
            <li> The more vivid colors, likely used much less often, will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> well worth your while because it will save you time scanning through all the other reviews.     </li>
            <li> The colors are easy to apply, though some have complained about fall-out, and although the pigmentation is not impeccable, it is more then decent for the price I payed for it.</li>
            <li> and you see the second palette, which is mainly your purples, reds, and neutral colors.  </li>
            <li> (i do suggest it if you want vibrant colors but not necessary)</li>
            <li> It has all basic colors and the palette is highly pigmented.  </li>
            <li> Ending on a high, here, this pallet has a REAL RED!</li>
            <li> I objectively consider BH Cosmetics a high quality make-up product.  </li>
            <li> A big plus for me is that this doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes; which is ALWAYS an issue for me when trying out new products.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I have it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I personally think that it could have been packaged a little bit better.</li>
            <li> (Just use some primer and pat them on gently and the colors tend to streak less but even then you don&#x27;t need as much product.)</li>
            <li> When closed, the case doesn&#x27;t look at pretty with all the marks.</li>
            <li> It was in the original box, wrapped in a type of brown paper, then a weird type of shredded paper/cloth and repackaged into a larger box - cost me a fortune (more than the actual item) to ship it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was definitely sceptical because of the price being so low for so much eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> one of the yellow shadows was broken up and kind of all over the surrounding colors.</li>
            <li> It was NOT due to the packing because this product was packed</li>
            <li> Nothing a little hot glue couldn&#x27;t fix though!</li>
            <li> The colors are vet vibrant and different and go on extremely colorful, not full or faded looking like some eye shadows!</li>
            <li> So, half a star is deducted for needing another product to achieve this product&#x27;s full potential.  </li>
            <li> also, while the greens and yellows are very pigmented and last all day, the other colors do not seem to last as much</li>
            <li> Little disappointing as i was expecting 120 different colors, but other than slight issues, it&#x27;s perfect, especially considering the price. :)</li>
            <li> Some colors I am unlikely to use, like bright neon yellow for example, but that&#x27;s just my personal preference.</li>
            <li> it will not really show much.</li>
            <li> and you barely need any to make it show up intensively.</li>
            <li> That is so what I had NOT expected.</li>
            <li> Overall this is the coolest makeup product I have purchased so far.</li>
            <li> It came in a taped cardboard box marked fragile.  </li>
            <li> Also, the whites barely show up, even with primer.  </li>
            <li> and i barely touched the eyeshadow</li>
            <li> Cant wait to get another one :O)</li>
            <li> I received it next day directly from the company,  </li>
            <li> DONT spend good money on this crappy and downright dangerous palette (some shadows may contain led)</li>
            <li> It got delivered to the wrong apt</li>
            <li> I love the colors but the mirror was broken when I received it and the shadows were falling out</li>
            <li> After I saw that nothing was broken I immediately fell in love with the colors.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Using a good primer or base is extremely necessary for these eyeshadows to reach their full potential, otherwise the colors are powdery and lacking in pigment.</li>
            <li> Another half a star was deducted because, even though the pictures show reds, there is really only one true red in the palette.  </li>
            <li> but if you really need it to last very very long I would recomend using a primer.</li>
            <li> I loved the colors on the palette but half of it was broken when i received it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these to anyone with my frustrations and cannot afford to spend $18.00 on a single palette of MAC eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> So pigmented and the colors are so vibrant and long lasting.</li>
            <li> It can be found on eBay or other sites for a much lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a single one was broke</li>
            <li> This appeared to be a moderate concern, but when you look more closely at the percentage reviewed versus the percentage that reviewed and received a broken palette, you find the chances are quite slim.</li>
            <li> You just put on a little and it looks pretty.</li>
            <li> The pallette has amazing colors, but as I knew from other reviews, four were broken when they arrived.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Truth is, I don&#x27;t reach for it on a regular basis because for every day wear I generally prefer neutral colors.</li>
            <li> the whites had shattered and gotten eyeshadow dust everywhere, the black were smeared onto most of the other colors due to the plastic that was used to cover the eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> First of all, I ended up ordering this one by mistake, I thought I had ordered another product and panicked a little thinking that I was going to have to send it back.</li>
            <li> Remove and let it dry completely.</li>
            <li> I mainly bought it because I don&#x27;t have enough pink, orange, yellow, and red colors, and in this set, there are PLENTY.    </li>
            <li> Red eye shadow that is true solid red and not brick or burgundy is hard to find.</li>
            <li> I was a little ok ill admit I was very spectacle about the palette because I only is Bare Minerals</li>
            <li> now the reason for the 2 stars, when the palette came the box and cover were fine, nothing broken.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are about the size of a dime maybe a little bit bigger and that may sound like a little</li>
            <li> the color are very pigmented, so i only have to use a little bit,</li>
            <li> Overall I will give it 5 stars because got shipped really fast and also just because 1 broke a little its nature to these eyeshadows</li>
            <li> and I am afraid that i wont get it in whole and clean if i order it again.</li>
            <li> The palette was packed in a single layer of bubble wrap with an extra layer in the box, but there was nothing on the outside packaging that labeled the product as fragile.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely reorder when I run out far down the road from now.</li>
            <li> It definetely last a long time on you eyelids</li>
            <li> A long strip of brown, fishnet paper that resembled Chinese handcuffs and a long strip of white packaging paper were wrapped three or four times around the palette, which was wrapped in plastic protecting paper and bubble wrap inside a BH Cosmetics box.  </li>
            <li> They even last a long time on .</li>
            <li> Bought it long time back, still using it.</li>
            <li> I got it in a timely manner but upon arrival several of the eyesahdows were cracked and several colors has mixed due to this.</li>
            <li> the only thing i was disappointed about was the fact that 5 of the eyshadows were broken, but i got over that :D</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about shipping after so many reviews about how the package wasn&#x27;t bubble wrapped properly and multiple eyeshadows were broken, but I have to disagree!</li>
            <li> The problem is that the shadows DO crease, even when I use them with NYX eyeshadow base which works Great on other eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> It contains all of the crazy colors that kids love to wear today.  </li>
            <li> For the price, if your a makeup lover, you&#x27;re crazy if you don&#x27;t buy it :)</li>
            <li> It did come 2 days later than expected</li>
            <li> The eye shadows stay on for a long period (</li>
            <li> i received my package a day earlier than i expected, but upon  opening my pallete, i saw 8 colors broken.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i dont know how long it lasts without it.</li>
            <li> I am an aspiring makeup artist and I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase this item for a long time but was hesitant.</li>
            <li> Pour the mix back into the empty pan and wait a bit for some alcohol to evaporate if it&#x27;s too runny.</li>
            <li> Some of the eye shadows broke and it left me a few short, and again, with some mixed</li>
            <li> Yeah, aside from that minor detail, I stand by &amp;#34;decent&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is not a real bh cosmetic palette peopleee its fakeee its a total scam</li>
            <li> BH COSMETICS has my business as long as they make makeup</li>
            <li> Long Lasting&lt;br</li>
            <li> should it be your only palette .. absolutely not..</li>
            <li> Let me also add that BH stands up hands down to the more expensive name brand shadows that I have in my makeup bag.</li>
            <li> , i simply just patted that eyeshadow back down and its all intact.</li>
            <li> The shipment arrived very quicky and not a single shadow was broken.</li>
            <li> The only problem was that one eyeshadow broke a little but that it it was the yellow one</li>
            <li> When it arrived, it was larger than I expected, but that was nothing compared to the packaging!</li>
            <li> It comes with colors not even found in other palettes-such as a red color.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased other ones, and have gone back and forth.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to discover that I was wrong.</li>
            <li> you only get blue green and orange.</li>
            <li> Comparing the two, Coastal Scents comes with a matte case so not as much, if any, fingerprints are left behind.</li>
            <li> The only thing that was wrong I received it with one color broken and had to clean the whole pallet.</li>
            <li> but a little goes a long way, especially with such a wide selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only hit the bottom for a medium matte brown, the tan, and a pale shimmery gold, because I use them daily.</li>
            <li> single eyeshadows cause you can find any colour you need with this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Because they&#x27;re so inexpensive, you can purchase both, and they&#x27;ll still be cheaper than buying five single color MAC shadows.</li>
            <li> I am very annoyed I just got it was excited and saw that it was damaged.</li>
            <li> have different types of shadows in my kit and have spent well over $2000 in eyeshadows from Ben Nye to Yaby to MAC ( no longer use .. absolutely not!)</li>
            <li> At first i felt kinda confused</li>
            <li> I dropped it once off my bathroom counter (yikes) and some of the colors came loose.</li>
            <li> you can use a dime and alcohol, paper towel, or wax paper to smush them back down again.</li>
            <li> Cover a dime with plastic wrap or fabric if you want the cross hatch texture, dip it in some alcohol and press the eyeshadow down evenly with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually looking forward into ordering the other 4 editions!</li>
            <li> There are very few natural and wearable colors.</li>
            <li> I have spent tons of money on eyeshadows &amp; not one but MAC and these show up on my skin tone &amp; stay all day long!</li>
            <li> So I finally received my palette today, after a week and a half.</li>
            <li> The only thing that went wrong was when I opened it for the first time</li>
            <li> IT WAS A MESS WHEN I OPEN IT,</li>
            <li> big but not sweet</li>
            <li> I have the Amazon standard membership, so no special privileges.  </li>
            <li> The only colors lacking in this edition were dark browns, but other than that it has every color you need.</li>
            <li> just wish the circles were a little bigger they are the size of a dime!</li>
            <li> They last all day as well with little to no fading (with a primer of course).</li>
            <li> I used a base eyeshadow primer and the color came out amazing.</li>
            <li> WHAT WAS EXPECTED, THAT HURT ME WITH THE TRANSFER IS damaged 4 SHADOWS, BUT THE SETTLEMENT,</li>
            <li> this is not real bh cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Be careful though, because i dropped it once and a lot of them broke and</li>
            <li> it was an unknown company.   </li>
            <li> I expected some problems, but everything was intact.</li>
            <li> I simply blew on the colors a bit, and then did a few color swatches.  </li>
            <li> Wide range of colors however, some were cracked when it arrived</li>
            <li> This is probably going in the garbage as it&#x27;s not really usable.</li>
            <li> I expected some breakage of the makeup as I read that it&#x27;s happened before.</li>
            <li> I carefully opened it in case there was any damage-</li>
            <li> So you get a really wide variety.</li>
            <li> Colors mixed, cracked, and missing pieces.</li>
            <li> The seal of the package was partially opened too.      </li>
            <li> BUT, for the minimal cost, I guess its a bargain</li>
            <li> Was ligher than expected but still worked for me.</li>
            <li> The 1st edition of the BH Palette has a wide variety of colors including shimmer and matte.</li>
            <li> Instead of applying 3 or 4 layers like you have to with other shadows, you only need a little with this one.</li>
            <li> The container is 9x6\\&quot; long and has a black glossy cover.  </li>
            <li> The makeup itself works extremely well.</li>
            <li> It was all slatteredo n each other.</li>
            <li> in other words it lacks pigment.</li>
            <li> Not like other eyeshadows that u have to keep putting some on to show the color you want.   </li>
            <li> I have other versions of this palette and ordered this one as a gift.</li>
            <li> I usually pay $35 for four eyeshadow colors from benefit, urban decay or two-faced.</li>
            <li> Some of the purples aren&#x27;t as pigmented as other colors, but that&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> Granted, some of the colors do seem to have a bit of dust from other colors on them, but it&#x27;s a negligible amount.  </li>
            <li> I think this is a bit pointless because I won&#x27;t need to take the second palette out.  </li>
            <li> As I noted before, there was a bit of dust from other colors on some of the colors.  </li>
            <li> sometimes I would bring just one of the palette trays and leave the other.</li>
            <li> The packaging is extremely beneficial.</li>
            <li> You can find this palette all over youtube, ebay, and other websites</li>
            <li> and I repurchased this palette and 2 other palettes from the bh cosmetics website.</li>
            <li> Not too small, and also not too big.</li>
            <li> I am planning to purchase the other editions</li>
            <li> , it did not blend or fall into the other colors!)&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Received my palette the other day and of course I had to try it.</li>
            <li> The colors are extremely pigmented</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be looking forward to having the other four editions.</li>
            <li> it was rapped extremely well</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing the other editions too.</li>
            <li> Some people received and opened the palette only to find multiple broken eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> I on the other hand am dark skinned like oooh, maybe Whitney Houston or Vivica Fox</li>
            <li> &quot; I suspect the other buyers weren&#x27;t black</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that 2 of the eyeshadows in the top tray were cracked and falling apart.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe each color has been such a beauty.</li>
            <li> The reds, especially, are rather \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; and can be hard to blend</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it without UDPP, so I&#x27;m not sure just how long it lasts or if the color \\&quot;washes\\&quot; out a bit.</li>
            <li> it ruins my opinion of the product</li>
            <li> I have dark skin.</li>
            <li> Ususually colours disappear into my skin because of my dark complexion but not with this.</li>
            <li> only complaint</li>
            <li> and they show up on dark skin</li>
            <li> so IDK I&#x27;ve seen them on dark tone though.</li>
            <li> I was however worried because frequent reviews on here said that the product arrived broken.</li>
            <li> Also, mine came with 3 shades broken, but I didn&#x27;t bother to contact the seller once I had them fixed myself.</li>
            <li> and we had to track it down.   </li>
            <li> The case is a little hard to open and get to the second layer though at least mine is.  </li>
            <li> I am definately going to buy the other paletts from BH Cosmetics!..    </li>
            <li> But i didnt complain the little plastic sheets held it there blocking it out of the other eyeshadows</li>
            <li> I bought it during the Black Friday sale, and the palette was around $16.50, a bit cheaper than on here.  </li>
            <li> You can get a pack of sponger applicators for less than two dollars at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  </li>
            <li> 1 was black.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve still about two-thirds of each color after a month and a half.</li>
            <li> It came in a sleek black box.  </li>
            <li> so I just tossed it and cleaned up the bit of mess it made.  </li>
            <li> As I had read in other reviews my palette was broken in several places and the colors crumbled into the unbroken colors.  </li>
            <li> The colors a vibrant, no two are the same, and I can find none that I feel are bad and shouldn&#x27;t be in there</li>
            <li> so this was a major disappointment since 2 were white and</li>
            <li> Not one was broken but I was surprised to see how small each eyeshadow was.  </li>
            <li> the browns and golds do a little</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, I was a little startled at how little protection there was and the palette box was on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a little on the container before I start on the product.  </li>
            <li> The small box that comes around it has pictures of BH Cosmetics&#x27; other palettes.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s going to cost you little for some awsome</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews had me a little bit scared.  </li>
            <li> Palette was carefully packaged &amp; wrapped in bubble wrap, none were loose or broken.</li>
            <li> second when i opened the palette there was about 4 colors damaged and broken, and on the other hand the size of the colors are really small</li>
            <li> Without a primer, the colors are dull and not very opaque.  </li>
            <li> You get a tiny palette with cheaply made shadows, that have horrible fallout and crappy color pay off.</li>
            <li> The Neutral had a few cracks.</li>
            <li> the only issue was that my fuchsia color on the bottom palette was broken (i m guessing because of shipping and handling???</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> And yes i do wear eyeshadow everyday.</li>
            <li> My sister put it on without primer and hated it, which was okay with me because I don&#x27;t want her to use it anyway.</li>
            <li> I have had it for a few years now</li>
            <li> However, the makeup was shipped poorly without enough bubble wrapping.  </li>
            <li> Instead of a box it came in a yellow manilla envelope with thin bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> My only issue was that 4 of the colors were broken &gt;.&lt;</li>
            <li> Only 1 of the colors was broken into pieces.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the BH 88 shimmer pallete at the same time &amp; none were broken in either case.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> It is durable and heavy.  </li>
            <li> And can sustain a few drops on accident.  </li>
            <li> The only word of caution: these palettes do have a tendency to arrive with broken eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> I have a bit of trouble with some of the lighter purples, though.</li>
            <li> Was concerned about having the shadows mailed, thinking they&#x27;d be all broken up and such, but not one color was damaged!</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest putting it in a purse for everyday use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hesitated a moment before giving this product a five star rating, but I am also fairly harsh in that department.</li>
            <li> I started crying...</li>
            <li> The Shany brand is much less inexpensive but works just as well in my opinion as the MAC colors!</li>
            <li> I love the colors they are so pigmented, but to my dissapointment 2 of the shadows were broken :(.</li>
            <li> I would BET MONEY that they&#x27;re giving all of their used and broken palettes to amazon and making them ship it out so they can use them as an excuse and blame amazon.</li>
            <li> All in all the only really bad thing about this was the way it was packaged with only one layer of bubble wrap and that it was at the bottom of the box with nothing between it and the box.</li>
            <li> at first when i received the package i was shocked that the size of the palette was small according to the picture and the size</li>
            <li> I still have plenty, my sister has ran out of hers in a little over a year!</li>
            <li> I had to use a eye shadow base and wet the makeup brush to get the vibrant color.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed because I was really looking forward to using this product.</li>
            <li> : One of the sides detaches from the kit and she says that a small mirror mounted there would improve the item appeal.&lt;br</li>
            <li> : Even though there is nothing to compare the sizes to in the pictures, she thought that the colours were too small for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it lasts until I take it off, usually around 10 PM.</li>
            <li> though I&#x27;m not sure if it was just mine alone, but some of the colors repeat.</li>
            <li> I usually wear it like almost everytime now.</li>
            <li> WAS NOT SURE IF IT WAS SHIPPED BREAK UP, BUT SOME OF THE EYESHADOWS CAME BREAK UP</li>
            <li> I ended up ordering ot late because she brought it to me just a few days before her party.</li>
            <li> Inside the wrapping was the box the product usually comes in.</li>
            <li> Its not as pigmented as I was expecting (not sure if they changed their formula because I bought this based on a recommendation).</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t put this on my face as I have no idea who actually made this sketchy fake palette.</li>
            <li> I will change my review if I am not satisfied tomorrow...</li>
            <li> As for the quality of the eyeshadow itself, I was a little disappointed it wasn&#x27;t as vibrant on the skin as I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> packaging was mediocre and unfortunately some of the colors broke leaving yellos and oranges mixed in and messy with my other colors</li>
            <li> With a white base they are even brighter and last all day.</li>
            <li> Packaging and shipping is not very good.</li>
            <li> I didnt have any broken shadows as other customers have complained about.</li>
            <li> I tried them on and was disappointed at how much I had to use.  </li>
            <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter and I was disappointed that it was not packed very well and came damaged.  </li>
            <li> When i opened the box the Black color was all broken and smashed.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find reds, oranges and yellows</li>
            <li> so it is hard to find shadows that shows up well on my skin</li>
            <li> im drak i used to have a hard time with colors that would not show up</li>
            <li> I opened the palette and realized the outside of the palette was dirty because one of the eyeshadows shattered.  </li>
            <li> I am a makeup fanatic</li>
            <li> However, I wouldnt take that complaint out on BH or amazon but with the mail or parcel carrier.</li>
            <li> SUCH a disappointment.</li>
            <li> (to fix broken ones: with a small stick or spatula scrape the pieces into a small mixing container &amp; crush into a powder.</li>
            <li> It was such a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> i have dark skin and the colors still pop with out the need of a white base.</li>
            <li> My 120 color pallet from BH arrived with almost ALL of the colors broken eyeshadow dust everywhere and the black plastic case itself broken.</li>
            <li> Seriously?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a little skeptical about the payoff these colors would have.</li>
            <li> If you are a makeup fanatic like me, you should buy this palette!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup fanatic!</li>
            <li> and when i say load i mean LOAD!</li>
            <li> The 120 came without cracks or any broken makeup.</li>
            <li> they were shipped to me in poor shape.some of the shadows were broken.</li>
            <li> It was packaged well however, three shades were broken in both palettes (2/1).      </li>
            <li> Very unsanitary and disgusting.</li>
            <li> I opened everything, and NOTHING was broken.  </li>
            <li> As a result, some of the palettes were broken.</li>
            <li> The make up arrived broken</li>
            <li> Honestly not happy about this</li>
            <li> One of the hinges was broken</li>
            <li> Alas, the product.  </li>
            <li> , none broken.</li>
            <li> The case was broken when I opened the package, and some of the eye shadows were also broken.</li>
            <li> But I did have ONE eyeshadow broken.</li>
            <li> BH is the makeup lovers secret weapon.  </li>
            <li> but I have been using it on a daily base.</li>
            <li> Each shadow is approximately the circumference of a dime</li>
            <li> There were indeed two broken eyeshadows</li>
            <li> It came it in one piece, nothing was broken or damaged.</li>
            <li> Nothing was broken,  </li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t since it was broken.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t order this product because theres a possibility that you&#x27;ll receive it broken since they package it poorly.  </li>
            <li> none came broken.</li>
            <li> None broken,</li>
            <li> product was not namebrand as advertised and was broken ,i wouldn recomend buying from this company at all,also adding the fact it too about a month for the product to get to my adress</li>
            <li> I saw some reviews about some people ordering their pallettes and when they received them they were broken, but I received mines and none of the colors were broken.</li>
            <li> and I found that two of the eyeshadows are broken.</li>
            <li> The plus side is the broken shadows didn&#x27;t get everywhere...</li>
            <li> Not one color was broken in transit.</li>
            <li> , i kept it anyways, but it came all broken</li>
            <li> lots of my colors were broken.......</li>
            <li> i am NOT happy</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did not arrive with any broken colors.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I always use a primer underneath and a white base so that the colors appear on my eyes like they should.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I have tried a few in the past and was disappointed with them.</li>
            <li> I received this with a couple of the shadows broken, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> but just a little disappointed when u pay for something u want it to be in tact when it gets to you,</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about purchasing it because I didn&#x27;t want to be disappointed in the pigmentation of the colors, and then have this kit of nearly useless eyeshadows just lying around.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with this price for this quality.</li>
            <li> POSTING FAKE REVIEWS</li>
            <li> The colors are well pigmented, running close with expensive department store brands.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, since then I have played around with it quite a bit.</li>
            <li> i dont know if ill be ordering anymore from this seller.</li>
            <li> Not one color was broken!</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product...</li>
            <li> Really sad that I can&#x27;t use them all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed at all.</li>
            <li> The palatte is a bit difficult to manage as well.</li>
            <li> This palette is completely fake.  </li>
            <li> circles was totally broken!</li>
            <li> but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> I was so very afraid that this would come in broken</li>
            <li> I was afraid that some of the make was going to be brocken, and to my surprise NOT ONE was brocken.</li>
            <li> I (being make-up obsessed) was devastated!  </li>
            <li> For the amount of eyeshadow you get in these palettes and the price you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Sorry BH :(</li>
            <li> Which is the bad part, since the packaging was done so carelessly some of the eye shadows broke!</li>
            <li> They called me a liar and said that it was impossible but looking at it in the sunlight</li>
            <li> Bad  Resistance</li>
            <li> : Bad  Still don&#x27;t regret buying them, but I will have to find a solution for creasing.</li>
            <li> and I put one of the blues on my cheek and got a bad rash, just don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> So dont believe the bad reviews &amp; give it a try.</li>
            <li> I think maybe I recieved a bad batch ...</li>
            <li> I am so frustrated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Give it a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> very disappointment</li>
            <li> but boy was I wrong!!</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this palette and BHCosmetics!!</li>
            <li> but I like to apply a base anyway.</li>
            <li> you do need to use some sort of base of primer on your lids for the brightest color.</li>
            <li> Delivery was bad!</li>
            <li> Not an awful purchase, though.</li>
            <li> However, could&#x27;ve been worst.</li>
            <li> hate this product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love them went well with other makeup easy to carry around if need works well with blending colors my go to pallet for bright colors</li>
            <li> Colors are great  good price love it perfect for first timers learning how to do they&#x27;re makeup will def purchase from them again</li>
            <li> Love this product the best, I recommend this to other friends. I actually brought two more for family and friends</li>
            <li> I bought this for Halloween, it works great. I still need to try it for every day use</li>
            <li> i recommend this product very much. My wife loved it. And was very surprised with the quality of it. You should try it.</li>
            <li> the picture is very deceiving. it makes you think your getting a lot of colors and your not at all. you only get blue green and orange.</li>
            <li> I ordered this palette and the 88 Neutral from BH Cosmetics. The 120 came without cracks or any broken makeup. The Neutral had a few cracks. The makeup itself works extremely well. All of the colors are very pigmented and look absolutely beautiful. The lighter colors need to be applied more heavily, of course, than the darker ones for the same brightness. All of the colors are wonderfully bright and bold. I didn&#x27;t like the case. Comparing the two, Coastal Scents comes with a matte case so not as much, if any, fingerprints are left behind. I would have loved it if BH Cosmetics did the same thing. When closed, the case doesn&#x27;t look at pretty with all the marks. Colorful logo would have invited me in more. Other than that, WELL WORTH THE PURCHASE!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered my palette and patiently waited for it, only for it to come in pieces. It was all slatteredo n each other. orange in blues. my greens in yellow. very disappointment and i had to send it back. i wish i could get those colors but i cant really find them in stores and I am afraid that i wont get it in whole and clean if i order it again.</li>
            <li> My friend (who is a makeup artist) has this palette and she did some incredible makeup on me so I decided to purchase the palette as well. The bright colors are great for when I want a more dramatic look. I do get some fallout, but it&#x27;s tolerable.</li>
            <li> I just received my order and the first thing I did was try it on. I did a purple eye. I love the colors, they blend very well and they are highly pigmented. I used a base eyeshadow primer and the color came out amazing. I&#x27;ve got olive skin being asian and oily and I can say so far I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> That was a pretty good trick. I fell for it. I bought the product thinking the product will look as nice on a face as it does in the pallet. Not so much... It was falling off the brush. It was falling off my face. BH Cosmetics must have their employees writing reviews. Then again, everything is not for everybody. This is not for me. Beware. Signed, African American Makeup Lover</li>
            <li> the eyeshadows are great!use a primer so they last longer. they were shipped to me in poor shape.some of the shadows were broken. amazon never got back to me so i probably will not order makeup from them</li>
            <li> the palette is very nice.. lol i dont know which color to use first :)    the only issue was that my fuchsia color on the bottom palette was broken (i m guessing because of shipping and handling??? anyway everything else is good.   the color are very pigmented, so i only have to use a little bit, i m sure this palette will last me a long time :)</li>
            <li> Some colors are not the same in the pallete than what you see in your eyes, but they are really beautifull, anyway. I recommend! 120 color for 25 dollars!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this specifically for a wedding. It did come 2 days later than expected but it was def worth the wait! The colors are great and very pigmented! So glad i found this!</li>
            <li> I love these eyesshadows first of all I was so exited to recieve the palette on monday when i had order it on Saturday. The only problem was that one eyeshadow broke a little but that it it was the yellow one but then again theres like 10 different yellows so its all cool. Overall I will give it 5 stars because got shipped really fast and also just because 1 broke a little its nature to these eyeshadows lol.</li>
            <li> came in an orderly fashion it is nice and im still waiting on my primer in the mail but if you DONT have primer and youre a brown skin woman it will not really show much. the browns and golds do a little but this is not mac and will not show that way. in other words it lacks pigment. i still love it and with my primer and eye milk it is perfect even on my skin tone :) packaging was mediocre and unfortunately some of the colors broke leaving yellos and oranges mixed in and messy with my other colors its alright though.</li>
            <li> Bought this from BH Cosmetics about 2 weeks ago and selected the cheapest shipping option available. When it arrived, it was larger than I expected, but that was nothing compared to the packaging! It was in the original box, wrapped in a type of brown paper, then a weird type of shredded paper/cloth and repackaged into a larger box - cost me a fortune (more than the actual item) to ship it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it was entirely worth it - none of the colours were damaged in shipping and the colours were just about what was shown on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it to anyone considering it - for 120 colour palette, it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife only has 2 \\&quot;problems\\&quot; with it:&lt;br /&gt;1: One of the sides detaches from the kit and she says that a small mirror mounted there would improve the item appeal.&lt;br /&gt;2: Even though there is nothing to compare the sizes to in the pictures, she thought that the colours were too small for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, she IS pleased with my choice for her! After all, it was meant as a surprise, and she loved it!</li>
            <li> Product shipped and arrived on time. Was perfectly boxed so no shadows were broken. Colors are vibrant and beautiful just as described. Would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This gift was for a coworker who loves all the colors in this palette. She use it everyday and is having a lot of fun mixing the colors to create her own unique look. I definitely selected the right gift for this young lady. Thanks</li>
            <li> If you are a makeup fanatic like me, you should buy this palette! Im in love with it and I stopped buying single eyeshadows cause you can find any colour you need with this one.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it 100%!&lt;br /&gt;The colours are really pigmented and the price is really low for the use.&lt;br /&gt;Go ahead!</li>
            <li> The colors are really vibrant but  some you really have to pack in the color for it to show up on the eyelid. Other than that it is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t test it out yet but why didn&#x27;t my palette have anything written on it? Nothing at all indicated that it was BHCosmetics? So I don&#x27;t know what is the product that I have received or if I should even use it or return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, I tested some of the colors and they seem very pigmented but I still want to know why there isn&#x27;t any label whatsoever on the product or the packaging...</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are about the size of a dime. There are many colors and some similar shades but no duplicates. I like this palette better than the 2nd edition because they are better organized and have brighter colors. Some are matte and some are shimmer. Just like everyone says they are very pigmented. If you drop the palette(Like I did) you can use a dime and alcohol, paper towel, or wax paper to smush them back down again. I love telling people that talk about how great the price is that you CAN get this same palette for even cheaper elsewhere.</li>
            <li> the colors are very repetitious, too many pinks and greens. i really wish they had more shimmery colors, smoky colors and a few more browns. also, while the greens and yellows are very pigmented and last all day, the other colors do not seem to last as much and i find myself re-applying after about 6 hours. i do not have the eyeshadow primer though, so that might be the reason.</li>
            <li> I received this with a couple of the shadows broken, unfortunately. The color payoff is only great in about half of the shadows, too; some of them are great, though, and I use them to contour/add detail for body painting. I&#x27;m pretty convinced that this is a knock-off. Not an awful purchase, though.</li>
            <li> I ordered two 1st Edition palettes.  Received them today and the colors are brilliant and really pigmented.  A lot of shades for anytime, any event!    It was packaged well however, three shades were broken in both palettes (2/1).      With that exception, I can&#x27;t wait to order the 3rd Edition Palette!</li>
            <li> Colors do not even work. Does not show up on skin, especially darker skin. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been considering buying this palette for about a year. I was a little hesitant about purchasing it because I didn&#x27;t want to be disappointed in the pigmentation of the colors, and then have this kit of nearly useless eyeshadows just lying around. I watched numerous videos on YouTube with people using this palette, and finally decided to go ahead and give it a try. I am SO glad that I did!  The colors really are as pigmented as they look, and all you need is one swipe of your brush, and you have all the color that you need. I use this along with Urban Decay Primer Potion, and it makes the color even more vibrant - and it literally stays on ALL day without any fading or creasing. I put it on around 6 AM and it lasts until I take it off, usually around 10 PM. I haven&#x27;t tried it without UDPP, so I&#x27;m not sure just how long it lasts or if the color \\&quot;washes\\&quot; out a bit. A big plus for me is that this doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes; which is ALWAYS an issue for me when trying out new products.</li>
            <li> ok let me start off with the quality, it is amazingly bright and beautiful. It works great even without a primer and you barely need any to make it show up intensively. It definetely last a long time on you eyelids but if you really need it to last very very long I would recomend using a primer. The color variation is great but I do feel like it reapeats a lot of the same colors. For example there are like 14 different greens and some look almost the same. But you are getting 120 colors, I mean what more do you want this will most likely have any color you need/want. The eyeshadows are about the size of a dime maybe a little bit bigger and that may sound like a little but I&#x27;ve had mine for almost 8 months and i use a lot of the same colors and i still havent hit pan. And yes i do wear eyeshadow everyday.The packaging is also amazing, nice and sturdy so your eyeshadows are protected and i did drop my palette once and none broke, thank god(:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving these eyeshadows. The colors are beautiful. Highly pigmented. I purchased this palette, and the B H Cosmetics 120 palette at the same time. I love both, but I use the 120 palette more because the colors are easier to blend. Both palettes have two totally different textures. If you&#x27;re applying just one bold beautiful color, I&#x27;d chose 88 CS palette. But, if you love creating various blended looks, B H C 120 palette is better. Because they&#x27;re so inexpensive, you can purchase both, and they&#x27;ll still be cheaper than buying five single color MAC shadows. The quality is very much similar to MAC.</li>
            <li> After watching some makeup tutorials online I decided to purchase this for my daughter and I. I was skeptical because I have tried a few in the past and was disappointed with them. Since I am a big kid at heart and want to use these for some Halloween makeup I thought Id give it a whirl! I would absolutely recommend this to anyone! The colors are highly pigmented, very bright and a little goes a long long way!</li>
            <li> The pallette has amazing colors, but as I knew from other reviews, four were broken when they arrived. While I was fixing them (there are many tutorials on youtube) a fifth one just fell out for no reason. Fixed that too, no issues here.  The problem is that the shadows DO crease, even when I use them with NYX eyeshadow base which works Great on other eyeshadows. That is so what I had NOT expected. So three stars for:  Color: good  Variety: good  Blending: good  Durability: Bad  Resistance: Bad  Still don&#x27;t regret buying them, but I will have to find a solution for creasing.</li>
            <li> purchased this for my daughter who is 16, she loves it and seems to be good quality</li>
            <li> This is  my third purchase from BHcosmetics. I&#x27;ve never been disappointed. The eye shadows are great quality. I use a primer on my lids before hand and the shadows stay all day. The colors are incredible. Think about how many individual eye shadows you&#x27;ve bought in the past and never had the right color for a look. I&#x27;ll never have that problem. At first, I was discouraged about this palette because of the number of blue shadows. After using it, I found the blues to be very wearable and because there are so many of them, I can create amazing fading effects across my lid. Trust me, this is a must have.</li>
            <li> this eyeshadow is fantastic its very high pigmented as well the colors are great i would use urban decays eyeshawdow potion first and then the eyeshawdow it will stay on like all day literally and look so colorful and beautiful as well</li>
            <li> PRODUCT WAS SENT TO ME USED. This palette is cheap enough as it is, and they still weaseled their way out of contacting me by phone or sending me a new one after contacting them 7 times!!!!  I can&#x27;t believe these people!!! Everyone should know about this before buying!!!!!!!  Fingerprints were on the glossy parts of the palette, the top textured pattern imprint on the top of each shadow was rubbed off and smudged around in most of the shadows. The plastic covers were moved around, and there was powder throughout all of the edges. The top criss-cross texture on half of the shadows were rubbed off.  I saw this with my own eyes in the sunlight and I&#x27;m SO GLAD that I checked before I almost gave it as a gift.    Very unsanitary and disgusting. They called me a liar and said that it was impossible but looking at it in the sunlight, it was very clear that it was completely USED. They said that it was from shipping so I even rubbed the plastic on an un-used shadow and it came out glossy. NOT THE SAME! This was completely USED!!!  This type of mistake is unheard of.  When I called customer service, the guy hung up on me three times before he decided to listen to me.  They told me that it wasn&#x27;t their problem since it was ordered through amazon. Very unprofessional.    MAKE 100% SURE THAT YOUR PRODUCT IS NEW BEFORE YOU USE IT!!!!!  I would BET MONEY that they&#x27;re giving all of their used and broken palettes to amazon and making them ship it out so they can use them as an excuse and blame amazon.</li>
            <li> i just got my eyeshadow today and i just used it. i love the colors in the palette how they come out on my eyes..however i wasn&#x27;t to happy because when i received my palette some of the blue eyeshadow was broke like someone had dropped it before it got to me. that it the only thing i wasn&#x27;t to happy about but since i love BHCosmetics i quickly got over it</li>
            <li> I just received my palette today, but I ordered it directly from BH Cosmetics along with 10 brushes, and a gel liner.  It came packaged very securely with bubble wrap, brown packing paper, and a brown mesh packing paper wrapped around everything.  I opened everything, and NOTHING was broken.  However, BHC may skimp on packaging materials with free shipping here--since I find that so many people said their palettes were damaged, so maybe order directly from the site instead to avoid that?  I bought it during the Black Friday sale, and the palette was around $16.50, a bit cheaper than on here.  I have to say, I am VERY impressed.  I use nothing but Urban Decay or MAC eyeshadows, and these eyeshadows are very similar to those two brands!  There are so many colors to choose from too, that one will never get bored with this palette, and it will be put to good use everyday.  I mainly bought it because I don&#x27;t have enough pink, orange, yellow, and red colors, and in this set, there are PLENTY.    Also, the color payoff of these eyeshadows is HIGH!!  You just need a few swipes of a certain color, and it shows right up on the lid.  However, I did have to apply a few layers to really get the color to &#x27;pop&#x27; since I have greasy eyelids.  Don&#x27;t forget to use an eyeshadow primer-My current favorite is Too Faced Shadow Insurance, and I also use U.D.P.P.  I find that the TFSI is easier to apply when you&#x27;re in a rush as opposed to the thicker consistency of Urban Decay&#x27;s.    With their being so many colors for such a good price, high pigmentation, and a good amount of eyeshadow, I very much recommend this!!  It comes with colors not even found in other palettes-such as a red color.  They are also blendable-so you can make a blue or purple smokey eye.  As a side note, their brushes are very soft and pick up color well, and the gel liners are amazing too!!</li>
            <li> The colors are really beautiful and the pigment is really strong! I&#x27;m so happy I bought this palette for a really good price! They arrived in perfect conditions, only one of the colors was a little bit cracked but no big deal! I really recomend this palette!</li>
            <li> Awesome colors! This is a must have for any girl!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a palette that would give me enough colors to pick and choose. I was thrilled with the reviews I read and decided to give it a try. Even though my bf bought it for christmas I couldn&#x27;t wait and had to check it out before he wrapped it. Everything came intact and the colors are beyond beautiful. I was 100% satisfied and shipping was fast. I order it Friday morning and I had it by Monday... Great deal! I will definitely order again with this company</li>
            <li> I really love this palette, it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ordered this brand and was very satisfied. The only colors lacking in this edition were dark browns, but other than that it has every color you need.</li>
            <li> use this all the time. I still have it some of the colors are gone now but it holds up way good. my kids have even thrown it and it did not break so it is durable. the colors come out awesome</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful, every color I&#x27;ve ever had to hunt for in one nice little package that fits in my bag perfectly. though I&#x27;m not sure if it was just mine alone, but some of the colors repeat. Little disappointing as i was expecting 120 different colors, but other than slight issues, it&#x27;s perfect, especially considering the price. :)</li>
            <li> WHAT WAS EXPECTED, THAT HURT ME WITH THE TRANSFER IS damaged 4 SHADOWS, BUT THE SETTLEMENT, THE COLORS ARE CLEARLY DEFINED IN THE SKIN, RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Colors are awesome, colors stay on all day, and very vibrate. This was recommended by a friend and I would recommend this product also.</li>
            <li> I actually have the 3rd addition, and this is definitely a Kit for someone who is not a beginner. If you look at all the youtube videos you will believe that it is super easy to get a vibrant color from this collection, but it takes a little talent, skill, primer, and use of your fingers, because brushes aren&#x27;t really gonna do it. The makeup wells are smaller than i thought they would be, but they are adequate, and their are very few shimmer colors which are the new hot thing. With that said I do really like the KIT and I would order another- when they come out with a shimmer addition. i have been doing my make up for a while, so I know how to achieve my desired look, but if you are a rookie all these colors are too many options... plus you might run into the issue of looking chalky. My first time using this I looked like a ghost around the eyes.</li>
            <li> My sister gave me this palette since I was the one that used it the most  and the colors are fantastic but I use the one with the blacks and brown  more but whenever I want to used a diffrent color its there. I reccomend it</li>
            <li> I am so happy for my new makeup. It literally arrived quickly through standard mail. I was afraid that some of the make was going to be brocken, and to my surprise NOT ONE was brocken. I have not tried on the colors but I am looking forward to it. Will be writing a review for it.</li>
            <li> I just love the BH Cosmetics 120 color eyeshadow palette. It&#x27;s very pretty and very pigmented. I usually wear it like almost everytime now. This 1st edition of the eyeshadow palette rocks!!!</li>
            <li> Hello, ..... Ok so I would have given 5 stars but one of my colors was broken, really shattered into powder I&#x27;ll still use it but just a little disappointed when u pay for something u want it to be in tact when it gets to you, ya know.... ok so anyways I would recemend this product to anyone because the colors are beautiful and vibrant and you def get your money&#x27;s worth even though one color was broken, I will order from them again because they are very fast and a really great company, plus things tend to get damaged evey once in a while nobody&#x27;s perfect.... [[ASIN:B002TPO0W8 120 Color Eyeshadow Palette - 1st Edition]]</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my order. The colors from the eye shadow palette are so beautiful and vibrant. Package arrived in perfect condition, no eye shadows broken or anything. Also no product spills. The case was in perfect condition and it was very well wrapped. I was worried cause I have read that this product did not traveled well, but for me it did. I recommended 200%</li>
            <li> this is not real bh cosmetics. The palette in the picture is not what you get. You get a tiny palette with cheaply made shadows, that have horrible fallout and crappy color pay off. I hit pan on the one good eyeshadow (the red) after like 4 uses and the rest of the shadows are too weak to use even with primer. DONT spend good money on this crappy and downright dangerous palette (some shadows may contain led) just buy the real thing for a couple extra bucks. I threw mine away after I read about the lead and I put one of the blues on my cheek and got a bad rash, just don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> My palette arrived in perfect condition.  Not one was broken but I was surprised to see how small each eyeshadow was.  They are the same size as a dime.  The colors aren&#x27;t as pigmented as I thought they were.  It has great colors and a great mix between matte and shimmers.  I tried them on and was disappointed at how much I had to use.  The case is a little hard to open and get to the second layer though at least mine is.  I wish I would have just order it from ebay because it is the same palette only way cheaper!</li>
            <li> Love this palette I cannot believe I got all of these beautiful colors for such a small price. It is so hard to find reds, oranges and yellows and I got all three colors :-). The colors are so pigmented and brigh. I just love it so much!</li>
            <li> awesome product they shipped rite away and the packaging is superb..however only one of my colours got broken but it was nothing because im from the caribbean so thats alot of shipping and handling..i absolutely love this palette the colours are so bright i cant wait to use them.its a must have.</li>
            <li> I love how you can just add a dab of water to make the colors more vibrant. they last all day and are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I was definitely sceptical because of the price being so low for so much eyeshadow. I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and am really amazed at how good it works. Instead of applying 3 or 4 layers like you have to with other shadows, you only need a little with this one. So even though the shadows are about the size of a dime it will last forever so it doesnt matter. I know alot about make-up and if you are thinking about buying this product, you DEFINITELY should, I PROMISE YOU WONT BE DISAPOINTED! :)</li>
            <li> came in an big yellow envelope, there seemed to be plenty of bubble wrap inside, wrapping the makeup.  I removed the bubble wrapped palette from the envelope, unwrapped it and the palette itself looked very dirt, looked like chalk, didnt think that was a good sign.  The palette is pretty hefty, heavier than my coastal scents 88 palettte.  I opened the palette and realized the outside of the palette was dirty because one of the eyeshadows shattered.  I was kinda bummed. other than that the colors are very bright, there are mattes, and shimmery colors (not overly shimmery).  colorful, bold colors. i swatched only one and it seemed very pigmented.  im satisfied.</li>
            <li> After Reading many reviews about BHcosmetics and how great of shape their products were in when they arrived I was super excited to have the Little brown box handed to me today.  After frantically riping away at the tape to my surprise the entire inside of the box was a Technicolor disaster.  5 colors were completely destroyed bits of powder were everywhere contaminating the rest of the colors.  I (being make-up obsessed) was devastated!  Luckily I was able to call Amazon and they fixed the problem right away.  To tell the truth though, I wont be ordering again.</li>
            <li> This palette is great, especially for a makeup artist that is just starting and doesn&#x27;t have a huge budget to blow. You can do virtually any look with this palette and the color payoff is great especially when used with a primer. This palette also contains two matte red eye shadows. Red eye shadow that is true solid red and not brick or burgundy is hard to find.</li>
            <li> Love this pallete! You cant go wrong with this price for this quality. There is every color you could possibly need.  This is also good if you love to experiment with different colors as they are set up in a progressive color pattern going from dark to light. The eye shadows stay on for a long period (given you use a base which i always do) I have been able to wear them for hours and have the color stay as bright as when i first applied.</li>
            <li> I was so very afraid that this would come in broken but when I received it today only one eyeshadow was chipped. And it was a tiny teeny chip. Overall this is the coolest makeup product I have purchased so far.</li>
            <li> I love this palette, I really do. I use mostly MAC makeup, my concealer, foundation, powder, primer, all MAC. Now, I used this with prep + prime eye by mac, and the color just pops! it stays on for most of my day, throughout school and work. I live off this pallet, it came with great colors! and the most beautiful red, that came broken ):&lt;br /&gt;but the rest were great. Be careful though, because i dropped it once and a lot of them broke and the box thing broke too. i might just have to get a few more to replace them. And I do know that if you use it without primer, they won&#x27;t show up at all, or just very light. My sister put it on without primer and hated it, which was okay with me because I don&#x27;t want her to use it anyway. Now, I did realize it was cheap for a reason, but it also did surprise me how well it did its job.</li>
            <li> Delivery was bad! It got delivered to the wrong apt and we had to track it down.   It wasn&#x27;t like UPS or FEDX it was an unknown company.   Product is awesome! Colors are lovely! You just put on a little and it looks pretty. Not like other eyeshadows that u have to keep putting some on to show the color you want.   These Colors are hard to find and im glad I ordered them. Love it!</li>
            <li> the colors are vibrant, very similar to MAC eyeshadows just make sure your eye lids have been primed prior to application. very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I wanted this palette for so long and was so excited when I finally decided to get it. I have had it for a few years now I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truth is, I don&#x27;t reach for it on a regular basis because for every day wear I generally prefer neutral colors. But when I&#x27;m in the mood for a bright and colorful look, I will use my 120 palette. Whenever I do use it, I always get compliments on my eyeshadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a good primer or base is extremely necessary for these eyeshadows to reach their full potential, otherwise the colors are powdery and lacking in pigment. With a good base I can get several hours of bright full color that lasts until I wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has all the colors you may want as far as the rainbow goes, purples, pinks, blues and teals, yellows, greens, and some neutrals. Some colors I am unlikely to use, like bright neon yellow for example, but that&#x27;s just my personal preference. It has a variety of finishes, matte, satin, shimmer/frost, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great place to start if you are just starting to build your makeup collection, or maybe you want to try some bright crazy color combinations without breaking the bank. It&#x27;s a really fun palette to play with and see what color combinations you can come up with. This is perfect for trying all kinds of colors that you may not normally try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These 120 palettes are all from the same source, it doesn&#x27;t matter where you purchase it. Brands like BH Cosmetics, Coastal Scents etc all stick their own brand labels on them but they&#x27;re the same generic palette... So there is no &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;knockoff&amp;#34; 120 palette in case you were wondering.</li>
            <li> The makeup is long lasting and the palettes have nice colors.  However, the makeup was shipped poorly without enough bubble wrapping.  As a result, some of the palettes were broken.</li>
            <li> The make up arrived broken and it is a gift for my daughter for Christmas and she will not be very pleased when she opens it.</li>
            <li> This item is really good! The colors are amazing and it&#x27;s so affordable. I have other versions of this palette and ordered this one as a gift. Which is the bad part, since the packaging was done so carelessly some of the eye shadows broke! It was not packaged protectively. Instead of a box it came in a yellow manilla envelope with thin bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> Well from all the reviews i read, most of them said that theirs came broken and mine fortunately did not! When i opened it up i was like WOW the colors are bright and their very pigmented. I have mostly all the colors i would need.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get this eyeshadow because all the youtube videos i seen and reviews said the colors were amazing. I was however worried because frequent reviews on here said that the product arrived broken. So UPS delivered this to me today I love the colors they are so pigmented, but to my dissapointment 2 of the shadows were broken :(. I got lucky and it was just 2 but hopefully the learn to fix the product shipping packaging better.</li>
            <li> I received my palette the colors are beautiful. But more then quite a few on the eyeshadows were broken which I am not haPpy about the need to package their product better to eliminate that problem. Honestly not happy about this it ruins my opinion of the product</li>
            <li> I bought this palette for an avante garde project. The shadows are very pigmented. They work great especially when used wet. I definitely recommend this for anyone, it comes in handy and you get every color you may need in any situation. and they&#x27;re very affordable so that&#x27;s a plus, especially if you&#x27;re on a student budget.</li>
            <li> There is an array of colors to choose from (obviously). The quality is surprisingly good. I usually pay $35 for four eyeshadow colors from benefit, urban decay or two-faced. So to get over 100 colors for the same price is a steal. Plus, some of these colors would be cool to use for costumes or dress up :)</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Got this for my daughter for Christmas.  It contains all of the crazy colors that kids love to wear today.  I was a little disappointed that 2 of the eyeshadows in the top tray were cracked and falling apart.  It was NOT due to the packing because this product was packed WELL.  I just think the company needs some Quality Control, like checking all of the eyeshadows in the palette for damage BEFORE shipment to customers.  Otherwise, this is an awesome palette.</li>
            <li> When I learned about the BHCosmetics eyeshadows, I was expecting something very expensive but was pleasantly surprised when I saw how affordable it was and was impressed with the selection in each edition.  I just received the first edition today and though I haven&#x27;t tried it just yet, I&#x27;m quite impressed.  My mom now wants her own set to replace the current eyeshadows that she has.</li>
            <li> WAS NOT SURE IF IT WAS SHIPPED BREAK UP, BUT SOME OF THE EYESHADOWS CAME BREAK UP SOO IT WAS A MESS WHEN I OPEN IT, COLORS EVERY WHERE...&lt;br /&gt;THE SHADOWS ARE GREAT.............I JUST WOULD NOT ORDER EYESHADOWS ONLINE AGAIN....</li>
            <li> I KNOW WHEN YOU READ COMMENTS LIKE THIS YOU THINK IT MIGHT BE PEOPLE THAT WORK HERE AT AMAZON POSTING FAKE REVIEWS BUT I ASHORE YOU THIS AIN&#x27;T ONE....I&#x27;M JUST A SKEPTIC BUYER JUST LIKE YOU AND MAN I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY WIFE AND LET ME TELL YOU IT WAS MONEY WELL SPEND</li>
            <li> Love the colors. The pigmentation is really good.</li>
            <li> The best makeup that you can purchase for the right price! I was totally impressed with my purchase. I am proud to say that I own all 3 editions!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this palette! I&#x27;m so glad I ordered this one. I&#x27;ve recently been watching makeup tutorials online and they&#x27;re always using palettes. Well, I searched and searched and kept reading about all these scams happening on ebay and thought I&#x27;d just order through Amazon, get it in 2 days with the Amazon Prime and take the plunge. I had like 7 tabs open on my browser and was going back and forth comparing makeup and prices. Finally I just ordered this one and waited. As soon as I received it I tore into it. It was a tad smaller than I thought it would be, though I have never seen a palette before. The pigments are fantastic. Some of the lighter colors don&#x27;t work real well on me but I have darker skin. The bright, fun colors are amazing! They go on nice (the powder is pretty lose but you have to be realistic, you&#x27;re paying $25 for 120 colors!), they blend well, what more could you ask for!? I would definitely recommend this palette. Remember you&#x27;re not paying for MAC, so it&#x27;s not super quality but is definitely worth it! I can&#x27;t wait to order the other palettes now - the more natural colors. :D</li>
            <li> First of all, I ended up ordering this one by mistake, I thought I had ordered another product and panicked a little thinking that I was going to have to send it back. I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot and I&#x27;m glad I did. When I opened the box, I was a little startled at how little protection there was and the palette box was on the bottom. I expected some problems, but everything was intact. The colors aren&#x27;t as vibrant as they were on here, but they are well pigmented and are creamy. Some of the purples aren&#x27;t as pigmented as other colors, but that&#x27;s alright. There are enough colors for me to experiment with and none of the colors seems to look the same on the skin like some others do. I would recommend this as a starter for those wanting to expand on makeup. All in all the only really bad thing about this was the way it was packaged with only one layer of bubble wrap and that it was at the bottom of the box with nothing between it and the box.</li>
            <li> This palette is amazing, inexpensive with so many colors. My only issue was that 4 of the colors were broken &gt;.&lt; but i simply fixed it with alcohol and now it&#x27;s great but i wish i didn&#x27;t have to fix it.</li>
            <li> i totally loved all the colors, non were broken when i got them, everything was great, the only thing i wish is that it would come with a mirror , but besides that , i totally loved it.</li>
            <li> I had to use a eye shadow base and wet the makeup brush to get the vibrant color. I have dark skin.</li>
            <li> For the amount of eyeshadow you get in these palettes and the price you can&#x27;t go wrong! The colors are well pigmented, running close with expensive department store brands. I bought one for my sister and one for myself. I still have plenty, my sister has ran out of hers in a little over a year! I really like the BHCosmetics eyeshadows. Everyone is different and some prefer to spend more money, but if I can save money and still get a comparable item then I am all for it and this was one of those purchases!</li>
            <li> Great colors last a long time and you can do so much with it. One of the hinges was broken so I had to put some glue and tap on it. Other than that I love it thank you!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I was scared at first if to buy it or not. But I finally did and let me tel you... I LOVE IT. It&#x27;s really amazing and its so bright you can mix and match. Its amazing what you can do with so many colors. I&#x27;m looking forward to buying the 2nd collecting and even so 3rd.</li>
            <li> When i opened the box the Black color was all broken and smashed. Other wise everything&#x27;s fine. I can&#x27;t wait to start experimenting with all the colors.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the eye shadows from B H Cosmetics! The colors just pop! You don&#x27;t even need primer to have the colors stand out. The 1st edition has a great variety of colors and the casing is very well made. It came in the mail quickly and was packaged great. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I recieved this pallet in the mail yesterday morning. Needless to say, since then I have played around with it quite a bit. All I can say is that I LOVE THIS! It&#x27;s great. Awesome pigmentation. Stays on well (with and without primer). Has awesome, brightly-vivid colors and pretty much every color you could possibly need. They blend well. It is all around an awesome pallet for an awesome price! The only reason that I have it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I personally think that it could have been packaged a little bit better. It was in a bubble envelope and the box was inside of that. So, yeah... It could use better packaging. Only 1 of the colors was broken into pieces.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup fanatic so let me first start off by saying that this product is awesome &amp; more than I expected for the price. I am an African American women with a darked skin tone so it is hard to find shadows that shows up well on my skin but BH cosmetics solved my problem! The shadows are very pigmented &amp; show up very well, with lasting coverage. Let me also add that BH stands up hands down to the more expensive name brand shadows that I have in my makeup bag. I didnt have any broken shadows as other customers have complained about. However, I wouldnt take that complaint out on BH or amazon but with the mail or parcel carrier. My shadow came securely wrapped in bubble wrap &amp; packaged very well. I also purchased the BH 88 shimmer pallete at the same time &amp; none were broken in either case. I absolutely love both sets of shadows &amp; with all the color selections I think I am done with collecting shadows for a while. So dont believe the bad reviews &amp; give it a try. I would definitely reorder when I run out far down the road from now.</li>
            <li> I love this palette. I bought it on Monday around 12pm and got it around 2 Tuesday afternoon. It was in perfect condition. None were broke or harmed. Very pigmented colors. I recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li> I am leaving MAC and Seophora for this product! i love love love it! the colors are very pigmented and to die for!</li>
            <li> I wanted an eyeshadow palette with many fun colors and decided on this one. For the price it is not bad at all. I was surprised how well packaged it was and it came in a nice black box. There was bubble wrap surrounding the palette inside the box, and Amazon added more bubble wrap around the box to protect it. As for the quality of the eyeshadow itself, I was a little disappointed it wasn&#x27;t as vibrant on the skin as I hoped it would be. I have an olive skin tone, very light but still considered olive. I would have to put a few layers of eyeshadow on for the makeup to be as bright as the palette. Overall I was very satisfied and would buy more palettes from BH cosmetics and Amazon.</li>
            <li> BH Cosmetics 120 Color Eye shadow Palette - 1st Edition Review       This review is a bit lengthy, but well worth your while because it will save you time scanning through all the other reviews.     Shipping and Handling    I just received this palette in the mail, and I¡¦m going to give an honest opinion and the facts on it.  For starters, this is my first makeup purchase from Amazon.  I have the Amazon standard membership, so no special privileges.  I received my package with 6 days.  I have been crossing my fingers that none of the colors would break, and they didn&#x27;t.  I guess others weren&#x27;t so lucky, but by what I can tell, BH Cosmetics has upped their shipping standards since those reviews.  My package was shipped from west coast to east through UPS.  It came in a taped cardboard box marked fragile.  Inside the box were multiple layers of brown paper that covered the package from top to bottom.  After removing the brown paper, I found even more protective packaging that other reviewers haven&#x27;t mentioned yet.  A long strip of brown, fishnet paper that resembled Chinese handcuffs and a long strip of white packaging paper were wrapped three or four times around the palette, which was wrapped in plastic protecting paper and bubble wrap inside a BH Cosmetics box.  You can see this in the customer photos.  Anyway, I opened the palette and absolutely none of the colors were chattered.  There were plastic slips on top of both palettes.  Granted, some of the colors do seem to have a bit of dust from other colors on them, but it&#x27;s a negligible amount.  It doesn&#x27;t affect the colors.  With that said, I am very pleased with the shipping and handling.  The Palette   Here&#x27;s a little on the container before I start on the product.  The container is 9x6\\&quot; long and has a black glossy cover.  It&#x27;s light yet durable and compact for travel. The small box that comes around it has pictures of BH Cosmetics&#x27; other palettes.  When you open the container, you see the first palette, which is mainly blues, greens, yellows, and oranges.  The first palette also contains the six marbled colors.  To reach the second palette, simply push the top palette up with the space in the side.  My top palette did not come with a ribbon like it shows on the Amazon picture.  However, the second one did.  I think this is a bit pointless because I won&#x27;t need to take the second palette out.  I might just switch the palettes so that the one with the ribbon is on top.  Anyway, place the top palette on the lid and you see the second palette, which is mainly your purples, reds, and neutral colors.  The swatches are actually about the size of a penny.  When you&#x27;re done with the palettes, place the first back on top and shut your lid.  No worries, there&#x27;s enough space that the colors won&#x27;t scrape against the lids.  The Product   Alas, the product.  As I noted before, there was a bit of dust from other colors on some of the colors.  I simply blew on the colors a bit, and then did a few color swatches.  You couldn&#x27;t even tell that there might have been another color on the colors.  As far as the potency of the colors goes, you certainly do need an eye shadow base/primer.  I would suggest a lighter primer, not a neutral or orangey one.  A lot of people seem to prefer NYX or Urban Decay.  Without a primer, the colors are dull and not very opaque.  With the primer, the colors are vibrant and opaque.  So, half a star is deducted for needing another product to achieve this product&#x27;s full potential.  Another half a star was deducted because, even though the pictures show reds, there is really only one true red in the palette.  The others are much more pinkish or orangey than red.  Also, the whites barely show up, even with primer.  That&#x27;s why I suggest a lighter primer.  Oh, and if you don&#x27;t have eye shadow brushes or sponge applicators, you&#x27;ll need some for this palette.  You can get a pack of sponger applicators for less than two dollars at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply.  All-in-all, thispalette is still an excellent, inexpensive product.  I would definitely suggest it to a friend.  But don&#x27;t take my word for it; you should try it out yourself! :)  Count   This section is a courtesy add-in based off my sight. I haven¡¦t tested all the colors and you may think one color belongs in a different color category than I think.  Reds/Pinks- 16  Oranges- 10  Yellows- 14  Greens- 22  Blues- 23  Purples- 12  Whites- 3  Browns- 8  Blacks- 3  Silver- 3  Marble- 6  Mattes- 58  Shimmers- 62   If you have any questions, please feel free to ask!</li>
            <li> To be a women of color I love it no matter what color I choose from it shows up I&#x27;ve used many brands with color but it would rub off or never show the way they were mentioned this dose the job and more for shades for my money I love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved this makeup!!! The colors are so bright, and they last all day long without smudging or creasing. I was initially worried about the quality of the product after reading reviews that said the eyeshadows had broken and mixed with other colors during shipping, but my palette was fine and all the colors look great. If you are a fan of bright colors at a cheap price I would definitely recommend this eyeshadow palette!:)</li>
            <li> Had this for almost 3 years and still love it. Some colors are chalky, some are shimmer, satin and some are matte. I LOVE the matte and satin finishes the most. You definitely need a base/primer for most of these colors. Some you don&#x27;t even need but I like to apply a base anyway. Wide range of colors however, some were cracked when it arrived and I believe 2 fell out but it still comes with so many colors it didn&#x27;t even matter.. Used it mainly on myself and clients that want colorful eyes..sometimes I would bring just one of the palette trays and leave the other. Great for multiple looks. Freelance-beginners</li>
            <li> Product came faster than expected which was great because I ordered it the Thursday before Halloween. 2 of the colors came broken but not a big deal worked great for everyone&#x27;s makeup I did for Halloween and at a good price</li>
            <li> I could in all honesty give this a 4 star, but I love it so much that I decided against that.  I ordered it, and got my 2 day free shipping, so maybe the rush shipping was the cause, but when I got it, one shadow was broken. It was just a light yellow so I just tossed it and cleaned up the bit of mess it made.  Anyway, the colors are amazing. So very pigmented and there is every color you could ever want. I&#x27;ve wanted this for months and am so happy I bought it. (:</li>
            <li> I have never owned a 120 palette before. I was searching for some vivid color ideas and makeup applications and I kept hearing about this 120 Palette thing. After going on Amazon and reading a bunch of reviews I bought this one on Amazon and a MAC one somewhere else. The Shany brand is much less inexpensive but works just as well in my opinion as the MAC colors! I have been having so much fun experimenting with color. I could not be happier with this product. I will definently be buying the Shany one agian when I run out. Great quality at a great price. TOTALLY happy.</li>
            <li> I recieved this item within 5 days of ordering with free shipping. It was packaged very well, none broken. I love the case it&#x27;s cute and stylish. The colors are a great variety, some of these colors are very dificult to find so it&#x27;s nice to have this item at such a good price, I seen this same palette at Sears for $55 so this price is a steal! I would recommend anyone to buy this palette, I can&#x27;t wait to buy the other editions :)</li>
            <li> I have three of the different palettes and I can say that they have nice quality and great colors. I like the fact that they are inexpensive and have a variety of colors.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend this palette for any beginner or even if you&#x27;re a professional or like to do free-lance makeup, this is an amazing addition to your collection. The colors are very pigmented and are not chalky or cause a lot of fall out. For the price, if your a makeup lover, you&#x27;re crazy if you don&#x27;t buy it :)</li>
            <li> I truly love this product. Prefect shipping, no broken pots. The colors are amazing. I wish there were a few more browns, I have a tendency to go towards more natural colors but there are the times I like to be adventurous. I do advise using a primer. It helps to keep the color longer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. The item was shipped and over 15 of the colors were damaged when they arrived. 2 are completely unusable. SUCH a disappointment. I ordered a similar pallet from Coastal Scents and I will be keeping that. This is probably going in the garbage as it&#x27;s not really usable.</li>
            <li> These are amazing colors. I love the pigmentation, and they do last all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Daughter who was having a sleepover birthday party and they wanted to do makeup, nails, hair do&#x27;s. I ended up ordering ot late because she brought it to me just a few days before her party. But it came with one day to spare. She was so happy and they even got to do make up on her little brother. Over all it&#x27;s made nice, tons of colors in a nice case. You&#x27;ll need your applicators though. Great price too.</li>
            <li> Amazing beautiful gorgeous so much I can say about this the colours are so bright long lasting love the shimmer colours also</li>
            <li> i received my package a day earlier than i expected, but upon  opening my pallete, i saw 8 colors broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i fixed them tho....i stumbled upon a vid in you tube that  shows how to \\&quot;press them\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and  fixed it.</li>
            <li> i am very pleased with this product :D i ordered it Sunday and got it on Wednesday. The actual quality of the eyeshadows is AMAZING! personally i am a very colorful person, so these eyshadows fit my personality perfectly. the only thing i was disappointed about was the fact that 5 of the eyshadows were broken, but i got over that :D i love them, i recomend to every girl that loves eyeshadow should buy this product. TRUST ME! it is worth the money xD&#x27;</li>
            <li> I got my BH Cosmetics Palette today! It&#x27;s so beautiful!! Not a single one was broke so I am thrilled. I can&#x27;t wait to actually use this. Yay!!</li>
            <li> I like this palette it have very nice colors but it don&#x27;t have a large range of dark colors just a lot of pinks , blues , greens, and yellows basically a lot of bright colors no neutral colors....</li>
            <li> The case was broken when I opened the package, and some of the eye shadows were also broken. I had to return it. I was a little disappointed because I was really looking forward to using this product.</li>
            <li> The package came to me within the dates estimated. I expected some breakage of the makeup as I read that it&#x27;s happened before. Well, upon opening it I realized there could be no way any of my eye shadows could have cracked. The packaging is extremely beneficial. Bubble wrap and all. All my colors were in perfect shape and I couldn&#x27;t be any more happy.</li>
            <li> the colors were good, although some pigments come on better than others. this palette would be better if u were to use a primer of some sort.  now the reason for the 2 stars, when the palette came the box and cover were fine, nothing broken. the problem was the pigments. the whites had shattered and gotten eyeshadow dust everywhere, the black were smeared onto most of the other colors due to the plastic that was used to cover the eyeshadows. about a good 5-6 of the colors were broken so this was a major disappointment since 2 were white and 1 was black.  i dont know if ill be ordering anymore from this seller.</li>
            <li> Waoo i love this eyeshadow. The first time I used to go to the beach and my eyeshadow still there all daay and night. wwaaaaaaaaoo great.</li>
            <li> Bought for my sister and we both love the colors! The colors seem very bright but if you know how to manipulate the color palette they won&#x27;t be so bright and you get more color options. The quality is impressive for the price, do recommend!</li>
            <li> This is the best product Ive ever used. I think it is very affordable with so many colors in it. I like it more than MAC because in mac, u only get so little color, with such a high price. This is a great set for beginners too, since it has all the colors you&#x27;ll need. I love it. This is very suitable for makeup tutorials too, if u do them. I think this is a wonderful product, and it is very handy, not a very BIG BIG case. I also like the packaging, it&#x27;s very clean, and feels classy. I wound totally recommend this to beginners and advanced makeup artists.</li>
            <li> Okay, these colors are soo much more vibrant and pigmented then in the pictures! The colors are sooo beautiful! I got this palette yesterday and i did swatches and i barely touched the eyeshadow and there was the color from that one soft touch! The colors are beautiful and are so pigmented! I am definately going to buy the other paletts from BH Cosmetics!..    From other reveiws i read poor shipping, but i decided to take the risk and the shipping was great! it was wrapped like three times in bubble wrap, then inside the box that hold the eyeshadow pallete had more bubble wrap. It was wrappped amazing. But I did have ONE eyeshadow broken. But i didnt complain the little plastic sheets held it there blocking it out of the other eyeshadows, i simply just patted that eyeshadow back down and its all intact. So its really good packaging though, somebody simply dropped it by accident, i cant complain pretty good though out of 120 only 1 broke? haha im a happy camper!    Well, amazing colors, pigmented, and packaging really good!(:    I recommend</li>
            <li> Good product for the price!! Great inversion for the money. Very good beauty products!! I recommended this products really works!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors &amp;#60;3. They even last a long time on .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m such a makeup-junkie!!If you love bold hot colors you will love this!!!I love creating different looks i get compliments all the time,great buy!!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting a palette like this for so long, something that has every color of the rainbow for cheap. I mostly use high end eye shadow, and this just did not compare. Its okay for occasional use, but even when Urban Decay primer potion under it, the colors fade and crease through out the day. some shades swatch awesome, and others are crappy.</li>
            <li> I love all the colors, but I think that some of them are pretty similar. Also, mine came with 3 shades broken, but I didn&#x27;t bother to contact the seller once I had them fixed myself.</li>
            <li> this is my 2nd palette from BH and I am still in love with it ! I already got 3 products from them and they are all good!</li>
            <li> I ordered this almost 3 years ago, AND I&#x27;M STILL USING IT!!!! I LOVE THIS PALETTE! I&#x27;ve purchased other ones, and have gone back and forth. Great price too! BH Cosmetics is a winner!</li>
            <li> This company is great. I have not yet had a chance to use this product but it came 2 days earlier than the estimated date. It was labeled fragile and put in a box wrapped for protection. Inside the wrapping was the box the product usually comes in. Not onnly that, but the makeup was further wrappedbin bubble wrap. Not one color was broken!</li>
            <li> I love this palette, but not the shipping. I got it in a timely manner but upon arrival several of the eyesahdows were cracked and several colors has mixed due to this. It need to be packaged better for sure. Aside from that I love the case and the selection of colors inside.</li>
            <li> Love BH Cosmetics! Tried it thru a friend of mine &amp; can&#x27;t wait to get more!! Lose this eye palette. Colors are bright &amp; beautiful! Definitely recommend this product! Came right on time too!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup fanatic! Love this palet of bright colors!! For the price and timly delivery yessss I will order another one in the future!</li>
            <li> I have tried other kits and this has been by far the best experience. The colours are rich and last. Ususually colours disappear into my skin because of my dark complexion but not with this. I am very satisfied with my purchase?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give it 5 is because it does not have a gold colour...</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC. Couldn&#x27;t dream of it being better. My friend tried mine out for a show and ended up buying one for her self.</li>
            <li> I am no makeup artist , but as a woman I buy a fair share of makeup from Maybelline to MAC, and I really do hate when a color looks to be perfect in a compact and then you go to apply and it&#x27;s too light. That is not the case with these, they are very pigmented and go on very smoothly, and you get such a spectrum of color which is pretty awesome when you just want to try something different.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product twice and both times the product was damaged. It only has a flimsy bubble wrap to protect it, so I can see why! The product itself is very nice with intense colors.</li>
            <li> Love this set too!  Colors are soo pretty and vibrant.  The price is great!  To have all there colors in a name brand would coat a fortune!!  BH is the makeup lovers secret weapon.  Can&#x27;t wait to get the 4th edition.</li>
            <li> Color quality on this is amazing!!! I purchased this instead of buying Halloween paint for my face. Not only was it great for that day but I have been using it on a daily base. The only thing that was wrong I received it with one color broken and had to clean the whole pallet. Not a big deal but just thought I should mention that.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas gift.  It is the 2nd palette I have owned, but the first was a Manly brand.  The colors are very bright and nicely pigmented.  The case is very sturdy and comes wrapped in bubble wrap and a box.  Great price, would recommend to any aspiring makeup artist.</li>
            <li> No complains!! I loved everything about it. I am a makeup artist and very happy with the quality of this makeup.</li>
            <li> The quality of these shadows are very nice. Colors are very bright which I love for changing up my usual everyday makeup look.</li>
            <li> I love love love this palette.  I have the 88, 28, Contour, and Blush Palette.  And now have added the 120 Palette to my collection and I have fallen in love with this palette.  The color payoff is great.  The amount of product is fantastic.  Each shadow is about the size of a nickel,  which is larger than the 88 palette which are about the size of a dime.  What I love most about the 120 palette is that there are a lot of matte colors.  For some people that may not be what the are looking for.  The 88 palette has more shimmer.  With this palette I love the case.  It is durable and heavy.  And can sustain a few drops on accident.  Since that is what I did when I first opened it.  I dropped it right on the floor and none of the shadows shattered.  You can find this palette all over youtube, ebay, and other websites but I can say for the price, the shipping method and cost it is definitely worth using this merchant.  Give it a try you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> this palette is AMAZING!!! the colors are so bright!! im a hairstylist so i have the opportunity to wear the funky colors and be really creative. i have never gotten so many compliments in one day. someone even asked me if it was MAC!! who needs mac when i have this palette. i also wear it with two faced shadow insurance and it last all day and actually makes it brighter. never tried it without the primer so i dont know how long it lasts without it. i will definitely buy it again!!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! All the colors you will ever need!!!</li>
            <li> This pallet deserves 5 stars because they got here quick! &amp; also because the colors are amazing! I&#x27;m actually looking forward into ordering the other 4 editions! It was totally worth the price! I recommended them to my sister in law because she fell in love with them as much as I did!</li>
            <li> Lot&#x27;s of colors, but I don&#x27;t particularly like most of them. Also, you have to use a lot of the product because they don&#x27;t seem to be very pigmented. I would not purchase this product again</li>
            <li> I am an aspiring makeup artist and I&#x27;ve been wanting to purchase this item for a long time but was hesitant. I read a lot of mixed reviews on this item but I must say I am very pleased with this and I will be ordering another palette soon. The shipping was extreamly fast. I ordered it on a Tuesday and had it byy Saturday. I would definitely comapre this to higher end makeup.</li>
            <li> pero para pagar 30 dolares como que les falto un espejito y tambien tengo la 2 edicion esta mucho mejor tiene mas surtido de colores. se las recomiendo</li>
            <li> This was the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made. The palette has all the colors you could possibly want, my color combinations are now limitless.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and none of the colors were cracked...pigmentation is awesome and so cheap....the hinge for the case is missing a metal piece that&#x27;s why i didn&#x27;t give it five stars but other than that it was a great buy and will definately buy from this seller again</li>
            <li> Very Matte I love this eye shadow palette!</li>
            <li> First of all I would like to say these shadows have been something I&#x27;ve wanted for a while. I&#x27;ve been a little skeptical about the payoff these colors would have. I have seen many reviews on you tube and looked up swatches and decided it was worth a look. I&#x27;m so glad I took the plunge now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each color I have swatched have been so rich. It&#x27;s hard to believe each color has been such a beauty. Even the colors that some mention as chalky are nice. (Just use some primer and pat them on gently and the colors tend to streak less but even then you don&#x27;t need as much product.) The pictures do nothing to the justice of these shadows. The range from matte to shimmer to frost is just such a nice range in selection, a look for every occasion. Each shadow is approximately the circumference of a dime but a little goes a long way, especially with such a wide selection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I could say about this palette is the shadows are a little tougher to get off then most but that is solved with some good eye makeup remover. Even so for me it wasn&#x27;t so much a big deal.I would definitely recommend this to anyone on a budget who loves makeup or any beginner makeup artists. You really get a lot for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally,  the package I received was well wrapped with tons of paper packaging and bubble wrap. None of my shadows were damaged and it shows bh took care in shipping them. Overall I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> i am just in love with this pallete.  Beautiful color and very pigmented, it worth each penny spent on it.</li>
            <li> Love love love the colors the case 4 the makeup is kinda cheap though.but the makeup its self is pretty good and good price</li>
            <li> Loved this palette. Has so many color cant wait to try them all.great quality and you get it at such a deal</li>
            <li> I had been wanting this palette forever after seeing so many reviews on youtube, so when I had some other gift shopping to do on Amazon, I decided to pick up this palette for myself :)    Shipping was very prompt!     The only word of caution: these palettes do have a tendency to arrive with broken eyeshadows. I carefully opened it in case there was any damage- I didn&#x27;t want to lose any pieces of product. There were indeed two broken eyeshadows In the very corners of the bottom tray. However I ordered fully expecting this and they are VERY easy to fix. I have done so already and am very happy with the palette.   *(to fix broken ones: with a small stick or spatula scrape the pieces into a small mixing container &amp; crush into a powder. Add alcohol to mix into a paste. Pour the mix back into the empty pan and wait a bit for some alcohol to evaporate if it&#x27;s too runny. Cover a dime with plastic wrap or fabric if you want the cross hatch texture, dip it in some alcohol and press the eyeshadow down evenly with it. Remove and let it dry completely. good as new!!)    There are a mixture of matte, frost and shimmer shadows in the palette, with lots of beautiful bright colors. There aren&#x27;t many neutrals, so if you like neutrals, BHCosmetics offers an entire 88 palette of those.    You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product...a great selection of highly pigmented shadows for an amazing price. This is a must have for anyone who loves makeup! Especially high end brands like MAC, Makeup Forever, Urban Decay etc.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter and I was disappointed that it was not packed very well and came damaged.  I had ordered a different set that was packed much better and I was very pleased with that.</li>
            <li> My 120 color pallet from BH arrived with almost ALL of the colors broken eyeshadow dust everywhere and the black plastic case itself broken. I WILL be returning it. I am completely unsatisfied. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Seriously? I ordered edition 3 as well as this one, both in the same condition? This pallet, again, full of really nice colors, I love how they come on, but I can&#x27;t use all the colors. Some of the eye shadows broke and it left me a few short, and again, with some mixed so i can&#x27;t use those either. BH needs to work on packaging, will not be buying from them again. Really sad that I can&#x27;t use them all.</li>
            <li> So I finally received my palette today, after a week and a half. I&#x27;m not impressed at all. As far as packaging goes, it could&#x27;ve been better hence the fact that two of my colors were damaged. However, could&#x27;ve been worst. The product....I was waiting for my WOW moment. It never happened. Some of the colors are highly pigmented but others were very muted. You have to keep reapplying for the color to show. Beautiful colors but its not at all what its hyped up to be. Sorry BH :(</li>
            <li> at first when i received the package i was shocked that the size of the palette was small according to the picture and the size the mentioned i thought it was big.  second when i opened the palette there was about 4 colors damaged and broken, and on the other hand the size of the colors are really small they didn&#x27;t look that way in the picture. however the colors are awesome and pigmented u can instantly use them without any base they are great. i would buy this product again but if it was in a bigger size.</li>
            <li> I found this item on eBay and won the bid at $10.55 with free shipping. The thing about this palette is that it is a wholesale item--BH Cosmetics just slaps their logo on the front. It can be found on eBay or other sites for a much lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, it contains 120 colors (60 to a tray) and each pan is about the size of a penny. However, most colors will last a long time! I&#x27;ve only hit the bottom for a medium matte brown, the tan, and a pale shimmery gold, because I use them daily. I&#x27;ve still about two-thirds of each color after a month and a half. The more vivid colors, likely used much less often, will last quite a while. And the palette is so cheap that you can buy another as soon as this one has reached its end!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color payoff depends on the color, but it&#x27;s safe to say that the matte colors are more pigmented than the shimmery colors. The reds, especially, are rather \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; and can be hard to blend but they are incredibly pigmented! I have a bit of trouble with some of the lighter purples, though. Of course, you&#x27;ll get much better results if you use an eyeshadow primer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is also slim and roughly the size of a spiral notebook, so it&#x27;s easy to pack; I can fit mine in my backpack with no bulk! Far better than trying to haul five different four-color palettes every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The palette is a great place to start, but you might find yourself taking forever to decide on a color combination because of all the options! I love my palette, but I may invest in a new set of purples.</li>
            <li> Great best quality and colors</li>
            <li> When I saw this I assumed it was way smaller and that the shadows were going to be mini but boy was I wrong!! It&#x27;s just amazing! Great color payoff from what I&#x27;ve swatched I haven&#x27;t swatched them all just the really bright ones for now and they seem great! They are however, not velvety like say urban decay shadows, they are more along the lines of a wet n wild gritty texture but it&#x27;s not a big deal! The colors in this 1st edition are along all the lines of brights, neons, primary, neutral, pastels, and glitters. So you get a really wide variety. Very happy with this purchase I will be buying more of them!</li>
            <li> it came package very well the color are amazing for this price it was great buy, its kind of cheap some colors fell out a lil i didnt like that . the overall product was great</li>
            <li> Gorgeous palette, bright colors, lacks the eye shadow brush but you can do it yourself. Also the mirror in the picture is not in the palette.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the colors and how they look. I like having the many options available when applying my whole make up.</li>
            <li> High pigment eye shadows...beautiful rich colors...highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> The colors are very bright and pretty. It came it in one piece, nothing was broken or damaged. I love everything about it except for the fact that it&#x27;s kinda flake-y.</li>
            <li> This palette is AWESOME!  Shipped super fast.  Nothing was broken,  I was surprised because my mum dropped it twice lol.  Gotta love bubble wrap :P.  I would reccomend this to anyone.  Oh, and the eye shadow stays on haha which I guess is good, but I gotta get me some make up remover :p.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that it came completely damaged. I am very annoyed I just got it was excited and saw that it was damaged. Colors mixed, cracked, and missing pieces. I really can&#x27;t believed this.    Edit  Well my mom fixed it to the point where it&#x27;s usable, I still don&#x27;t appreciate the fact BH or whomever does not know how to safely and secure these packages. You should really label them fragile, cause thats what they are. I highly doubt that I will order from BH again. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> My daughter wants to experiment with her eye make-up and I thought this would be a good place to start.</li>
            <li> I loved the colors on the palette but half of it was broken when i received it. It was such a disappointment.  I wanted to bring it with me on vacation but I couldn&#x27;t since it was broken.  I&#x27;m returning it and I repurchased this palette and 2 other palettes from the bh cosmetics website. After watching youtube reviews, I saw how good they packaged their products.  I received my product in a yellow shipping envelope.  There was no bubble wrap around the palette.  The seal of the package was partially opened too.      Bottom line: don&#x27;t order this product because theres a possibility that you&#x27;ll receive it broken since they package it poorly.  Order it directly from bh cosmetics.  The palette itself is gorgeous and the colors are so pigmented.  Hopefully I receive my new palette soon!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! This palette is AMAZING! super pigmented. none came broken. Super happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> It is very cheap and the color is vibrate enough. And there is matte and shimmering colors so you can basically do most of the makeups with it. Of course they the color won&#x27;t stay like Shu Uemura, but just for some crazy make up at parties, it does a pretty good job.  Packaging and shipping is not very good.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for really good eyeshadow at a good price, I came across this palette I wasn&#x27;t too sure about it. But when I got it and tried it out I fell in love with it! The colors are so bright and the color doesn&#x27;t fade off. The only thing that went wrong was when I opened it for the first time one of the yellow shadows was broken up and kind of all over the surrounding colors. Other then that.. very good product! :) I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> love love loooove it! None broken, Cant wait to get another one :O) Will recommend to a friend i want the second edition</li>
            <li> Very very nice! I have been looking for an eyeshadow palette for ages, and couldn&#x27;t really decide on one. I was looking for something, bold, colorful and vibrant- And this palette gave me exactly what I was looking for.  The colors are vivid and there are so many to choose from! The size of the palette is just perfect. Not too small, and also not too big. Very convenient for carrying around and all sorts.  Very well wrapped and packed so the colors won&#x27;t shatter. I highly reccommend this product! 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This pallet is awesome I love how there&#x27;s so many colors and it&#x27;s so pigmented I say its deff innately worth the price and the shipping was right on time</li>
            <li> Not of good quality...big but not sweet</li>
            <li> I love this palette, I use it all of the time as the colors are vibrant and gorgeous! Check out my youtube video in which I am using the shadows!&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> i must say, thank you so much for this great product and i can&#x27;t wait to play dress up, i have always wanted a 120 color palette now i have a great one, hope to try some more of BH cosmetics products and to all who are not sure of this product you need to try it it&#x27;s going to cost you little for some awsome make up....</li>
            <li> my first makeup palette purchase. great deal. awesome pigments even without eye primer. love it!</li>
            <li> product was not namebrand as advertised and was broken ,i wouldn recomend buying from this company at all,also adding the fact it too about a month for the product to get to my adress</li>
            <li> Almost a year later and i am still loving this palette!! Highly pigmented and great colors, i refuse to buy more higher priced items when i can get this at cheap price and works just as good. Worth the buy!!</li>
            <li> This a great amount of colors to choose from if you are into color, however, it is very poorly pigmented.  It does not have much pigment at all contrary to how dark or bright the colors appear. If you are light skinned like, lets say Katherine Heigl then it may be awesome.  I on the other hand am dark skinned like oooh, maybe Whitney Houston or Vivica Fox so the shades don&#x27;t show very well on me.  It was packed nicely, I received my purchase completely in tact, there were no broken or shattered shadows. The palatte is a bit difficult to manage as well. It is hard to separate the top layer from the bottom and then you need to find a surface to rest the top layer on. I would have like the layers to be attached and just flip up BUT, for the minimal cost, I guess its a bargain and you can actually say, \\&quot;I have 120 shades of shadows.\\&quot; I suspect the other buyers weren&#x27;t black so the review did not help me much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sort of a let down, had been very excited before I received my palatte.</li>
            <li> Never have I seen such beautiful colors frome a make-up palette!!! I am a sexy milk chocolate so colors do not usually show up to bright on me...but with this, everything can be seen. from the palest of yellows to the lightest of pinks!!! I was sooo happy with this product I bought on for my ma, sister, teacher and guy friend who does drag!!!</li>
            <li> The colors are so bright and they stay on for a long time without smudging and creasing. I get many comments on the colors and I wear it just about every day.</li>
            <li> Bought it long time back, still using it. Love it because it has various colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> I received faster than expected, great condition. The colors are so vibrant and I had so much fun playing with all of them, as soon as it arrives.</li>
            <li> The colors are fantastic and it last all day. I have no complaints of this product at all. I will buy more and more!</li>
            <li> Its not as pigmented as I was expecting (not sure if they changed their formula because I bought this based on a recommendation). I used it for a fashion show and it was quite powdery. Even when mixed with some \\&quot;transformer\\&quot; to make it more vivid, it still wasnt as great as I needed for it to be. For someone who wants to play with color but not have it showing vividly, this may be for you. I would definitely recommend this to a teen or someone who works where bright makeup isnt acceptable. I wouldnt recommend this for professional use.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about shipping after so many reviews about how the package wasn&#x27;t bubble wrapped properly and multiple eyeshadows were broken, but I have to disagree! The product came with what I thought was an incredible amount of bubble wrap and when I opened the palette only two eyeshadows were only slightly cracked (not enough to render the eyeshadow unusable, or that they mixed/ruined the other eyeshadows).    The colors and sizes were exactly as described. I have yet to try on the eyeshadows but the colors look/seem very vibrant.    This definitely lives up to its name as one of BHCosmetics&#x27; best-selling eyeshadow palettes. For such a reasonable price, it&#x27;s a great product! It definitely has my recommendation!</li>
            <li> On time, and exactly like the description. The only problem I had was one of the colors came out of the pan. Nothing a little hot glue couldn&#x27;t fix though!</li>
            <li> Great palette of shades, when added with a primer, they last all day. This is a must have for any beauty gals</li>
            <li> These colors are so bold that you really don&#x27;t need much. With a white base they are even brighter and last all day. I am very happy I bought this because now I can play as if I know what I&#x27;m doing.</li>
            <li> This is the second palette I purchase from BH Cosmetics and I am very happy. So many colors, makeup heaven!</li>
            <li> She asked for this, I hope that she really liked, she has not saying bad words of this, so I am hoping its ok.</li>
            <li> My wife really like this product she uses it all of the time.  She likes all of the different varities to choose from when doing her makeup.</li>
            <li> Enjoying all the bright beautiful colors!!! Worth ever dollar . Would pay way more if I would bought all those colors individually .</li>
            <li> It shipped fast, it got here in decent amount of time, and the colors and pallet its self was a great size and great quality. Im very happy &lt;3</li>
            <li> I give this shadow a five star! The colors are great and very pigminted. I love them. Its good to wear for a day or a night out and has very cute colors. Totaly worth the money,its a must have!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful and variety of colors that are simple and extravagant at the same time!&lt;br /&gt;I just wish the circles were a little bigger they are the size of a dime! But beautiful indeed!</li>
            <li> I like being able to blend different colors together and this palette offers so many different colors.  Good pigment  too.  Got it as a Christmas present for someone else, but I couldn&#x27;t stay out of it!</li>
            <li> This product has beautiful colors! One to go with every outfit in your closet! you do need to use some sort of base of primer on your lids for the brightest color. Doesn&#x27;t work very well as a wet/dry shadow, but if you use the primer you don&#x27;t need it to be a wet/dry :)</li>
            <li> I love all the colors. I am definitely buying another one when mines run out. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have never owned and eyeshadow palette before, but I received mines two days ago and have been wearing the colors. I must say I am very impressed! I saw some reviews about some people ordering their pallettes and when they received them they were broken, but I received mines and none of the colors were broken. They were in all in tact and had a lot of bubble wrap in the box and outside the box to protect the eyeshadow palette from breaking. The colors are awesome and are true to color and very pigmented. I would definitely purchase it again and will be purchasing for my mom&#x27;s Bday! Thank you Amazon!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! It arrived earlier than expected and in great packaging. I felt it was very safe in the bubble wrap and all else it came in. The product itself was exactly what I expected and in great shape. Exactly what I wanted! Thanks</li>
            <li> Was ligher than expected but still worked for me. Beautiful colors.</li>
            <li> will always love BH cosmetics very vibrant colors. i will use this forever great alternative to drugstore brands and even the more expensive brands. easy to blend and easy to apply. i have dark skin and the colors still pop with out the need of a white base. (i do suggest it if you want vibrant colors but not necessary)</li>
            <li> I like to do bridel makeups&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very fun job and I love to do that&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m developing more and more&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking more cosmetic</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail (a couple days early!) and I found that two of the eyeshadows are broken. The plus side is the broken shadows didn&#x27;t get everywhere...So I will just re-press them and hope for the best. The colors are even more stunning in person and they swatch extremely well. I think this should have been packaged a little better as only the palette itself was wrapped in bubble wrap and was able to move loosely around in the box.</li>
            <li> Beautiful set with vibrent long lasting colors and alot bigger than expected for the price.</li>
            <li> the product was much more than I expected for the price. Not one color was broken in transit. Very reasonably priced and a good product. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> These colors are amazing! They are so pretty when applied! They just look like the MAC ones. This product is very similar. Its a nice and beautiful product. There are so many colors.</li>
            <li> ALL the colors are really pretty I think it was well worth the money I paid for it def would by again.</li>
            <li> Buenos dias,&lt;br /&gt;Reciba un cordial saludo, me gusto el producto cumplio con las espectativas del cliente.&lt;br /&gt;Muchas gracias.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;feliz dia</li>
            <li> Love it.  It has all basic colors and the palette is highly pigmented.  I received it next day directly from the company,  I appreciate the way they package it to ensure safe delivery.  Will definitely order again from them.</li>
            <li> 100 % satisfied defiantly will buy it again</li>
            <li> Got this a while back (like a couple of year&#x27;s ago) and am still using it (don&#x27;t judge me). And overall it&#x27;s pretty decent...*notices the mirror in the thumbnail* ...Did not get a mirror like that though... &#x27;Tis fine. Yeah, aside from that minor detail, I stand by &amp;#34;decent&amp;#34;. Many bold color&#x27;s to play around with and good if you want to use the shadow&#x27;s in place of the typical Halloween makeup or whatever.</li>
            <li> I am so frustrated.  As I had read in other reviews my palette was broken in several places and the colors crumbled into the unbroken colors.  The palette was packed in a single layer of bubble wrap with an extra layer in the box, but there was nothing on the outside packaging that labeled the product as fragile.  Seems pretty obvious to me.  I have no idea whether this eye shadow is any good in terms of quality, but I can tell you that I feel like I just wasted 20 bucks.  I don&#x27;t even see the point of returning it.  I will not ever buy this again though.</li>
            <li> When I first received this palette it was very well wrapped. No broken shadows. Love the variety of the colors... Very pigmented... I am planning to purchase the other editions and I would recommend this palette to everyone I know. VERY HAPPY WITH THIS BUY!!</li>
            <li> I just got this along with two other items I had ordered today, I am impressed for the most part, the colors are very pretty and vibrant, but one of the shadows was broken and another fell out completely when I opened the pallet, other than that, I think it&#x27;s great, looking forward to using it!</li>
            <li> Orded this before my cruise and i didnt have time to return it, i kept it anyways, but it came all broken</li>
            <li> this product its completely amazing. the colors are so vibrant. easy to apply and everything was in great condition when i got it and im completely in love with palette!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The colors are very bright and its easy to apply. I love the smooth texture eyeshadow that this brand have.</li>
            <li> this is the best variety that i have seen for the bh cosmetics eyeshadow palette these colors rock. i recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It came on time with no bumps or bruises. Blends beautifully and you don&#x27;t need that much eyeshadow to make a dramatic look! Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> This pallet has every color that you could ever need and that&#x27;s exactly why I bought it! :-D 100% satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This palette is completely fake.  It&#x27;s like they didn&#x27;t even make an effort to make it look like the real thing.  It came in a sketchy unmarked box; real palettes have the BH logo and text and pictures all over the box.  The lid of the palette was also entirely blank, the real ones say BH  Cosmetics 120 Shadow Palette etc.  On the inside of the box, the real palettes have a mirror.  There was no mirror.  This is a complete scam and I can&#x27;t put this on my face as I have no idea who actually made this sketchy fake palette.</li>
            <li> I ordered my palette on the 5th of May and recieved it by the 9th. I&#x27;m very pleased with everything the colors are absolutely beautiful. and the packaging was perfect. I tried out a few colors and it is very high and pigmented some more than others. all and all i&#x27;m very pleased with this product and i will definately be doing a youtube tutorial on this make-up palette. love! love! love!</li>
            <li> A couple colors are more difficult to pick up on brushes than others but if I use eyedrops they come up nicely. Nice product overall.</li>
            <li> The colors are bright and long lasting and are lavishly available. I love BH cosmetics and their products and I&#x27;ll always be a supporter.</li>
            <li> This set is amazing for the price.  This was a gift for my Granddaughter and she was so surprised and thrilled at all the colors.  She wears them all the time.  She says they are so soft and easy to apply.  Great gift for a young lady.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good starter it for teenage girls. My daughter also uses the colors to mix up her own nail polish colors.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed! Highly pigments colors and so many to choose from. I received the first palette, and I love the matte finish of the bright colors. And the shimmer pots are beautiful.</li>
            <li> Colors are beautiful, but I don&#x27;t use them everyday.  This product will be with me for a while.  I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Okay so i ordered this on accident! I thought i ordered the Manly palette but to my surprise it said \\&quot;BH COSMETICS\\&quot; on it. At first i felt kinda confused but when i opened it i saw all these colors and i decided to try it out. None of them came damaged, the packaging was VERY nice. Mine even came with a \\&quot;FRAGILE\\&quot; sticker on it which i appreciate! As for the product, i do not lie when i say when i bearly touched the first color the pigmentation was SO GOOD. I couldnt wait to try it on my eyes!. I do however need to say some are more pigmented then others, i feel that the shimmery ones are more pigmented then the matte&#x27;s but nothing to serious that i wouldnt still love it! The color does not fade on my eyes, i use a good primer before application, it blends extremely well and everytime i wear any color on here i get so many compliments on my eyeshadow! I recommend this palette so much to anyone who is beggining to expiriment with colors and practice with blending . I look forward to getting some more palettes from BH COSMETICS very soon, i have also since this first purchase ordered many of their brushes, brush cleaner, and foundation primer ,lip glosses, pencil/liquid eyeliners and alot more! Amazing products for a great price! :)</li>
            <li> This has a great selection of colors and they&#x27;re great quality. The eyeshadow stays on for hours and still looks as good as it did when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! The colors are vet vibrant and different and go on extremely colorful, not full or faded looking like some eye shadows! I bought this so that I could do rainbow eye shadow for St Louis Pridefest, and I tried it out as soon as I got this and it looks great! Was concerned about having the shadows mailed, thinking they&#x27;d be all broken up and such, but not one color was damaged! I only gave four stars, rather than five, because there really isn&#x27;t much of each color. And some will run out very quick. Ending on a high, here, this pallet has a REAL RED! Couldn&#x27;t completely tell from the pictures, but was very exited! (I needed red for my rainbow eyes) buy buy buy!</li>
            <li> I love this item, this was a great price for it and a lot cheaper than the actual website had it</li>
            <li> Great value for the money, so many great colors! I am really happy with this purchase. I recommend them to everybody.</li>
            <li> This product was a great gift, my friend loved it so much I would really buy from this company again for my next event.</li>
            <li> Perfect !! I love it !! And arrived very fast...&lt;br /&gt;Thanks a lot !!&lt;br /&gt;Now I can do a lot of beautiful makes...</li>
            <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS THE COLORS R SO NICE I WILL GET THIS AGAIN THE packing was really good came fast&lt;br /&gt;and the color r true what u see there bright and nice and they show up on dark skin trust me im drak i used to have a hard time with colors that would not show up and this work good say on good with primer throw</li>
            <li> Not as pigmented as I&#x27;ve see in tutorials and in reviews, pigment was the reason I choose BH. I even changed brushes but no difference; am a light/medium tone so IDK I&#x27;ve seen them on dark tone though. I think maybe I recieved a bad batch ... I have been complimented on how I use them I do like the many colors it comes with. Good deal for so many colors I wish the red was redder that was my reason for the purchase. I recommend an eye primer and a good make up remover. Overall Good Value</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PALETTE, ITS SO GORGOUS AND BRIGHT. GREAT FOR SUMMER. THERE ARE WARM TONES ALSO BUT MORE EYE POPING COLORS THERE JUST GORGOUS. BUY THEM YOU WILL NOT REGRET</li>
            <li> PRO&#x27;S:&lt;br /&gt;This is a really nice palette!&lt;br /&gt;It was wrapped up all nice and neat when I got it in the mail.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are very vibrant and stay on forever!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use for a photo shoot- I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and it&#x27;s been GREAT!!!&lt;br /&gt;Now...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON&#x27;S:&lt;br /&gt;Once I opened the package,one of the colors in the palette was broken/shattered.&lt;br /&gt;(However, it did not blend or fall into the other colors!)&lt;br /&gt;This palette can be a tad bit bulky for carrying around- I wouldn&#x27;t suggest putting it in a purse for everyday use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Product!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after watching some Youtube videos with different colors. I am a MAC girl, but didn&#x27;t want to spend oodles of money on a color I wasn&#x27;t sure about. The 1st edition of the BH Palette has a wide variety of colors including shimmer and matte. I can&#x27;t say that the quality of eye shadow is on par with MAC but it is actually pretty good. The sizes are a lot bigger than I anticipated also. My palette was complete with no broken eye shadow. There is an interesting odor from the makeup I can&#x27;t seem to get rid of. I don&#x27;t smell it when I apply, it&#x27;s just strong when I open the dispenser. I am really impressed and definitely would purchase again.</li>
            <li> ESTA SOMBRA TRAE COLORES BELLISIMOS PARA LOS OJOS, AUNQUE LLEGO CON UN COLOR PARTIDO IGUAL LA AMO MUCHÍSIMO ES LA MEJOR SOMBRA PARA OJOS QUE HE TENIDO</li>
            <li> I love these eyeshadows!  I have spent tons of money on eyeshadows &amp; not one but MAC and these show up on my skin tone &amp; stay all day long! I highly recommend these to anyone with my frustrations and cannot afford to spend $18.00 on a single palette of MAC eyeshadow. The only reason I gave it four stars was because 5 of the eyeshadow palettes were cracked when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I was a little ok ill admit I was very spectacle about the palette because I only is Bare Minerals but these eye shadows are just great!!! There nice and clean not caked out like Mac make up I love them!!!</li>
            <li> Really love my palette. So many pretty colors!!I have shown this to my friends and family and they are all anticipating ordering right away.</li>
            <li> i love that they arrived right away, the pigment is awesome but must be careful the shadows break easily and can get messy overall i love the quality true to color will buy again going for all pallets.</li>
            <li> Most  amazing  vibrant  colors  for  eyeshadow  that  Ive ever  had!  Love  this!!! I cant find enough outfits to match is with!</li>
            <li> LOOOOve this product, so many bright colors, but you need to use a primer to get the color to last, Very glad i bought this</li>
            <li> I found that in this entire collection there was not one color I could use. They were all too bright and flashy for a grown women. Big mistake buying these.</li>
            <li> I like this eyeshadow palette. The colors are vibrant! You have alot to use from to mix and match and create the look that you want. I love it for upcoming makeup artist! I recommend for others to try it!</li>
            <li> love this product, great colors just to accent eyes, I&#x27;m having a lot of fun with it, my daughter also bought one,</li>
            <li> This is a great product in regards to colors!! There are so many and it applies very well.  I have used it in numerous of my daughter&#x27;s theater productions and it works great!!</li>
            <li> Received my palette the other day and of course I had to try it. The colors are so pigmented even the lighter colors show and the color lasts all day. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone and everyone.  2 thumbs up.</li>
            <li> i love the product, the colors are amazing and&lt;br /&gt;it just awesome, what i didnt like its that one of the&lt;br /&gt;little circles was totally broken! which is not much&lt;br /&gt;to me but people could easily be bother about this!</li>
            <li> Me encanto esta paleta aunque 3 colores m llegaron rotos solo deverian de protéger mas la forma de enviarlas :$</li>
            <li> I Love love love this !!!!!!!! So many beautiful colors, First time buying eye shadow and im so happy i did</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this palette and BHCosmetics!! I do virtually all my makeup with their palettes!! I like that the palette covers all color palettes for the most part so you can do several kinds of looks! I also recommend their 88 color Neutral palette and/or their 28 color neutral color &amp; blush palette if you prefer more natural looks!</li>
            <li> I love the colors but the mirror was broken when I received it and the shadows were falling out</li>
            <li> Great variety of colors very pigmented but feel duped because i was expecting actual BH Cosmetic product and this is a knock off</li>
            <li> This is not a real bh cosmetic palette peopleee its fakeee its a total scam</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this palette. The colors are great: highly pigmented, blend well, stand out, stay put.. in other words they are everything you&#x27;d want from an eye shadow, and the price is way better than their more expensive competitors. They really are great.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for people that are just beginning with makeup! The colors are extremely pigmented</li>
            <li> This has to be one of my favorite eyeshadow palette. So pigmented and the colors are so vibrant and long lasting. I do recommend this palette.</li>
            <li> The pigments are great and you never run out of options</li>
            <li> Beautiful beautiful mix of colors! Love the pigments love the packaging, love using it.&lt;br /&gt;Work well with every skin type.</li>
            <li> I purchased this palette because I like to do elaborate make-up for Halloween and events. The quality is just as good as anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. I now use the eye shadow daily because it&#x27;s such a good product and so inexpensive!</li>
            <li> The most important thing everyone should know is that this IS NOT A BH COSMETICS BRAND PALETTE. The palette I received does not have any name on the packaging like a Bh cosmetics product should. Some of the colors are similar to bh&#x27;s palette, but it would have been nice to have the real thing. Some of the eyeshadows are vibrant, but I found most to be chalky or have a lot of glitter fallout.</li>
            <li> Product as described, great price, great seller!</li>
            <li> With or without a case there colors are bright and vibrant. I love the color selection for all my wild looks that I love to create.  The colors are smooth and very pigmented. Used with a primer they jape all day and night.  Really great product bh I&#x27;ll be looking forward to having the other four editions. When they go nor2don&#x27;t of course.</li>
            <li> I hesitated a moment before giving this product a five star rating, but I am also fairly harsh in that department. I have no room to complain about this product, however,  because the price versus the quality is quite acceptable. I read reviews on amazon and YouTube before making this purchase and was a bit worried about the issues I found there. Some people received and opened the palette only to find multiple broken eyeshadows. This appeared to be a moderate concern, but when you look more closely at the percentage reviewed versus the percentage that reviewed and received a broken palette, you find the chances are quite slim. This is why I took the risk and ordered. It was well worth it. Not only was the package in perfect condition upon its arrival, it also came a day or two earlier then predicted. Already a bonus. Now onto the product itself. The colors a vibrant, no two are the same, and I can find none that I feel are bad and shouldn&#x27;t be in there (aka, gross color). The colors are easy to apply, though some have complained about fall-out, and although the pigmentation is not impeccable, it is more then decent for the price I payed for it. Not only that, but it is incredibly pleasing that they thought it through and put in two &amp;#34;pots&amp;#34; of black, two of white, and many shades of brown. So, not only can u find a brown to suit your specific skin tone, but you will also be more unlikely to run out of your basic colors. This is nice because, obviously, you are going to use a black or white more then a blue, red, or yellow. Overall, I would recommend this palette to anyone and I am personally, very, very happy with mine.</li>
            <li> Now this palette, I absolutely LOVE!!! It&#x27;s got a great selection of colors AND it&#x27;s pigmented!!! There are a few colors that aren&#x27;t very pigmented, but most of them are! I love the bright vivid colors as well as the speckled ones on the end.  There&#x27;s a combo of matte, satin, and frosty finishes. They last all day as well with little to no fading (with a primer of course). Blends very well too.  Definitely worth the money! I would repurchase again, but don&#x27;t think I need too since i don&#x27;t wear bright colors all that much lol.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this 1st edition palette,  I will be purchasing 2nd edition soon.... :)</li>
            <li> lots of my colors were broken....... i am NOT happy</li>
            <li> Great pigmentation, much better than the ELF 144 pallet. VERY Bright colors. There are very few natural and wearable colors. Don&#x27;t wear many of the shades in this palette, and it would probably be good for theatrical wear.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup the colors are so bright my package arrived early nun of the makeup came broken the colors are very pigmented  it was rapped extremely well my case was not glossy and shiny but I was so in love with the colors who cares about the case LOL love it BH COSMETICS has my business as long as they make makeup</li>
            <li> I was on pins and needles til I received it.Colors are beautiful,pigmented,and budget friendly.It will save you alot of money from buying alot of shadows.</li>
            <li> I got it all happy then barely used. That&#x27;s mainly my fault but it&#x27;s the truth. Do like the colors so it&#x27;s fun when I try new eyebrow colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and beautiful. Definitely worth every penny but it was actually very inexpensive. Was actually cheaper here than on their own website. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> The product is really good for the price. Some colors are not as bright, but then again, there are a lot of other colors to choose from. The product came really carefully packed and every eyeshadow was in perfect condition. Happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I got this product on time and it was in perfect condition. The colors are strong and vibrant. They are just as bright as they are in the photos. I would recommend any starter in makeup or makeup artist to buy this product. I have been a makeup artist for years and this is my to go product.</li>
            <li> Luv the colors Great quality and  very good pigmentation and best of all great price</li>
            <li> really great product, stays on well and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot of the color to stick,</li>
            <li> Best makeup I have ever owned. I thought that it was going to be tiny circles of cheap makeup but I was wrong. There is a ton of each color and they&#x27;re very high quality. They blend well and last all day. The colors are super fun, too!! If you&#x27;re not into these colors you could try the second edition of this palette.&lt;br /&gt;It did not arrive with any broken colors.&lt;br /&gt;My only con for this is that the circles are not glued in very well. I dropped it once off my bathroom counter (yikes) and some of the colors came loose. I&#x27;ve had to re-glue a bunch of them in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you drop it and your colors shatter here is what to do:&lt;br /&gt;Crush up the color in its original circle into a very fine powder. Then pour in rubbing alcohol/surgical spirits into it and stir it up into a paste. Then take a paper towel and a coin (I used a nickle I think for this palette) and press it gently back into place. Let it sit for 24 hours and your color is good as new!</li>
            <li> I found this product to be my favorite eyeshadows, very vibrant and glided on like butter. Cute for all tones</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m learning how to apply eyeshadow, I muat say these colors are a bit to bright for a starter like me. But I still love the pallet lol</li>
            <li> Ordered on a Sunday &amp; received by Tuesday afternoon. Palette was carefully packaged &amp; wrapped in bubble wrap, none were loose or broken. Just love playing with all the color combinations &amp; I&#x27;m soooo happy to have purchased it for such a great price. I normally use Mac eye shadow, but this palette has proven to last just as good all day &amp; night with primer. Highly recommend if you like experimenting with your eye makeup!! :)</li>
            <li> First off, i was really excited when i purchased this!&lt;br /&gt;Today i decited to use tlthe 120 1st edition palette.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate this product! The colors r very pretty but the shadows dont stick on... My makeup brushes didnt even sweep it on. I had to load it on with my finger and when i say load i mean LOAD! n still the colors look all powdery on my lids... it doesnt blend or move. Literal the colors where falling off my face, all over every wherrle the sink and everything... I been stuck in the bathroom for 3hrs trying to get this product on my lids... Made me sooo angery... I started crying... My money was falling off my face and i am a profession makeup artist... Never in my life has this happend to me. It dryed out my eyelids... Even el thats 1$ at target... Works better! I wanted to brake every shadow i had from bh cosmetics... DONT BYE IT!</li>
            <li> Great assortment of colors that are highly pigmented. Comes with matte and shimmer shades. Downfall is I do not use it that much anymore.</li>
            <li> I just got this palette in the mail today.  It came in a sleek black box.  I opened it up and nothing was broke.  Some of the reviews had me a little bit scared.  After I saw that nothing was broken I immediately fell in love with the colors.  Nice and bright.  Each color is about the size of a dime.  I haven&#x27;t put it on yet since I am already wearing my makeup for the day.  I did however put some of the brighter/neon looking colors on my wrist.  They showed up nice and bright, so I am looking forward to putting my makeup on tomorrow.  I will change my review if I am not satisfied tomorrow...but I hope I don&#x27;t have to.</li>
            <li> I waited months to order this palette because for the price listed, I figured the shadows would be crappy. I was so excited to discover that I was wrong. The shipment arrived very quicky and not a single shadow was broken. Yep, all 120 shadows arrived perfectly in tact. These shadows are easily blendable with intense color payoff. I always use a primer underneath and a white base so that the colors appear on my eyes like they should. I will be purchasing the other editions too.</li>
            <li> My daughter love this.  She ask for this for christmas.  She&#x27;s a self made professional with this.  I&#x27;m glad she love it.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Cheap&lt;br /&gt;  So Many Colors&lt;br /&gt;  Highly Pigmented&lt;br /&gt;  Long Lasting&lt;br /&gt;  Flawless Finish&lt;br /&gt;  Compact&lt;br /&gt;  Plenty of Product&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  As a Professional MUA you may feel like you are not \\&quot;Professional\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Pro MUA I have to say I bought this because I tried a friends version of this Palette and thought you only paid how much? I played around with all the colors and used them at several photoshoots and must say the product and the price are superb. These remind me of Yaby Pearl of Paint shadows..but has more punch than Yaby and MAC&#x27;s matte shadows. You get 120 colors to pick from ..what else do you want. There&#x27;s no falling off effect, no horrible after tint color.. the colors are true to their colors and honestly the picture of the product accurately portrays the colors. These are dime sized shadows and are packed to the rim. This is well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have different types of shadows in my kit and have spent well over $2000 in eyeshadows from Ben Nye to Yaby to MAC ( no longer use .. absolutely not!) ..this is a great extension to your kit..should it be your only palette .. absolutely not.. but it definitely should be in your kit</li>
            <li> This is the perfect professional and non professional vibrant color eyeshadow palette.  If you want a &#x27;Summer Eye Kissed&#x27; look, that will seem professional and playfull this is the product for you to try.  I am still amazed about this having a 120 colors at an unbeleivable price.  I objectively consider BH Cosmetics a high quality make-up product.  Eyeshadows feel very soft, look pigment rich and will last all day long. I consider myself a #1 fan of the best quality products in the professional and non professional make-up markets and I can say BH Cosmetics has done an outstanding job with their eyeshadow palettes, specially with the 120 color ones.  This is a product I would buy for me as well as for a loved one and would suggest it to anyone who is seriously considering to have a broad spectrum of colors in their vanity or make-up trainer / travel case, and will use it wisely and/or artistically.</li>
            <li> It is very well although I received the shimerry ones and not the bright ones....&lt;br /&gt;I would buy it again.</li>
