            <li>This dryer is 100% better than the Chi dryer I paid $130 dollars for!</li>
            <li>I will be buying two more!</li>
            <li>The infrared lights are to provide more heat, which in fact, it does!  </li>
            <li>I  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I purchased this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest.</li>
            <li>the style is nice too</li>
            <li>The design of this hair dryer is also pretty stylish, for the price that I bought this, it was a great steal!</li>

            <li>And the attachments are a lot more handy</li>
            <li>Love love love!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;m not the first person who&#x27;s experienced this issue with the hair dryer.</li>

            <li>I am so pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t feel satisfied with this purchase.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the attachments it comes with as well.</li>
            <li>I love dis product cuz it has more watts than my mom&#x27;s dryer.</li>
            <li>She can&#x27;t tell if the infrared is a better for hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love the settings.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The dryer is also great with blow drying my hair straight with a brush.</li>
            <li>For $35, it had everything I could have wanted, and more.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very impressed with it and would purchase again if I have to.</li>
            <li>I love this blow dryer...</li>
            <li>My 26 year old granddaughter wanted it for Christmas and was delighted to receive it!</li>
            <li>Removal screen to clean is nice.</li>
            <li>It works well and quickly, and my hair dries nicely without feeling burned or crunchy.</li>
            <li>Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret the light weight and elegant hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It looks nice, but the air for the high setting doesn&#x27;t seem to be very strong.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s quite easy to accidently to shut it off.</li>
            <li>The doctor confirmed that I had a contact burn and it was already blistering on the lines of my palm.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair dryer for a low price!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s much quieter than any dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned!!!</li>
            <li>The Rusk feels super lightweight yet very substantial and the diffuser is really nice too.</li>
            <li>I ordered this one based on reviews and a significant drop in price</li>
            <li>My hair feel great after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li>However, it does dry very nicely.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of getting my hair dry quickly.</li>
            <li>Really good hair dryer, especially for the money.</li>
            <li>Love this dryer doesn&#x27;t burn the hair and drys my hair much faster</li>
            <li>I like that it has the cool air button.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer so much</li>
            <li>I hopped online and quickly ordered another.</li>
            <li>Works better than my old one!</li>
            <li>So far so good with my new hairdryer.</li>
            <li>It drys my hair fine, but I find my hair is very frizzy after using this dryer.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase if you&#x27;re looking for a &amp;#34;salon-quality&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty cool hair dryer.</li>
            <li>The hot setting doesn&#x27;t get very hot</li>
            <li>She absolutely loved it, now my other two daughters want one each.</li>
            <li>The heat is just about right</li>
            <li>This product is a great replacement for my old one, dry my hair a lot faster too.</li>
            <li>It does dry my hair nicely.</li>
            <li>It has high and low, and warm and hot.</li>
            <li>On the daily that&#x27;s more hair than ends up in my shower drain.</li>
            <li>Overall I am satisfied with my purchase and do not feel the need to purchase a $200 hairdryer to blow wind around my head.</li>
            <li>which is actually probably better for your hair.</li>
            <li>A man, with short hair, designed this blow dryer :)</li>
            <li>Dryer is awkward to handle for me and only gets warm at best.</li>
            <li>On the highest heat setting, it gets REALLY hot.  </li>
            <li>Simple and stylish.</li>
            <li>The hot setting  doesn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I decided to give up my heavy hairdryer even though it was working fine.</li>
            <li>was drying my hair, on the warm (not hot) setting.</li>
            <li>It was all the positive reviews that convinced me to buy this dryer</li>
            <li>Definitely a design flaw - Revlon really should do a recall and fix them and come back strong because it really is a good dryer, especially for the price tag!!</li>
            <li>It not only dries the hair but adds VOLUME &amp; SOFTNESS to my hair that stays for 2 FULL DAYS!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the red lights do anything either, but they do look cool!</li>
            <li>Really powerful and my hair dries much better then with my previous dryer.</li>
            <li>Revion Laser Brilliance 1875W Infrared Heat Hair Dryer was pretty decent.</li>
            <li>Revlon certainly has a winner here with the product and the reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>She really likes it a lot.</li>
            <li>She really likes this model because the air intake is on the end which has ended the problem of her hair getting caught in the intake.  </li>
            <li>After much research I went for this dryer, and for the price, I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit correctly on the dryer and is CONSTANTLY falling off as you&#x27;re drying your hair.</li>
            <li>The buttons are awkward switches and aren&#x27;t designed in the best way.</li>
            <li>My better half needed a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Decent deal for the price.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine, straight hair, and this dries my hair so much faster than my last blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it dries my hair so much quicker than my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see the promised shine and don&#x27;t really notice it drying any faster than my old blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much lighter than my old dryer, which is a relief.  </li>
            <li>My old one really must have been on</li>
            <li>/&gt;For a few dollar more, I bough the Rusk CTC Lite, 1900 watts dryer</li>
            <li>The motor burns out after about 6 months of normal use.</li>
            <li>Not as heavy as many dryers.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure if the infrared does anything but for my fine wavy hair it dries in enough time on the light heat setting with the diffuser and no frizz combo using Shiseido Tsubaki Shining Shampoo and Conditioner and Phyto hair balm.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how that compares with other dryers, but the db meter is a free app.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m looking for a new one.  </li>
            <li>but it felt so cheap to me that I ended up taking it back to the store the very next day...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a hair dryer work so quickly before in getting my hair dry.</li>
            <li>My hair was very soft as well.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>you have an old blow dryer and are on the fence about trying a new one, go with this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair enough to say its good or bad but it looks nice</li>
            <li>She has very curly hair and had picked this one out especially!</li>
            <li>Works well, so far no issues</li>
            <li>I probably would have given it a fifth star if it was quieter than my old one.</li>
            <li>I was suspicious of a hairdryer actually making my hair softer and smoother, but I decided to try out the ionic thing, and it really has made a difference.  </li>
            <li>Dries hair MUCH faster than the standard bloW dryer...</li>
            <li>Gave this blow dryer 3 stars because while it works it is pretty loud and leaves your hair with a bit of a wind blown look and feel, like as if you dried your hair while driving with the top down in a convertible.</li>
            <li>Another thing I like is that it has red lights at the tip, so I can actually see the red light reflecting off my blonde hair, so I know what part of my hair</li>
            <li>They were the same, both 84 db on high.</li>
            <li>It ended up leaving a huge black mark and a burn on my left palm.</li>
            <li>It has the required options to dry curly hair, such as cool shot, different temperature settings and</li>
            <li>This blow dryer felt flimsy and delicate and the diffuser is cheap, clear plastic.  </li>
            <li>Which is a good thing for me because I can sometimes be careless and will realize I am not actually pointing the dryer at my head.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it dried my daughter&#x27;s stuff animal fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had healthy hair in the past and am certain that this hair dryer is completely destroying my hair.</li>
            <li>I used this hair dryer 3-4 times per week for about 2 months, with no other changes to my hair care routine.</li>
            <li>Definitely dries my hair faster than my old blow dryer.</li>
            <li>The attachments came clear instead of black like in the picture, which makes them a little tough to find in my huge hair product basket, but they are easy to use.</li>
            <li>First, my hair gets caught in the little red pieces at the end of the dryer.  </li>
            <li>However, while I was drying my hair this morning, the dryer started acting funny as if it was burning out (I&#x27;d only been using it for a few minutes).</li>
            <li>I do really like the little loop on the handle to hang it up</li>

            <li> which is actually probably better for your hair.</li>
            <li> A man, with short hair, designed this blow dryer :)</li>
            <li> Dryer is awkward to handle for me and only gets warm at best.</li>
            <li> On the highest heat setting, it gets REALLY hot.  </li>
            <li> Simple and stylish.</li>
            <li> The hot setting  doesn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I decided to give up my heavy hairdryer even though it was working fine.</li>
            <li> was drying my hair, on the warm (not hot) setting.</li>
            <li> It was all the positive reviews that convinced me to buy this dryer</li>
            <li> Definitely a design flaw - Revlon really should do a recall and fix them and come back strong because it really is a good dryer, especially for the price tag!!</li>
            <li> It not only dries the hair but adds VOLUME &amp; SOFTNESS to my hair that stays for 2 FULL DAYS!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the red lights do anything either, but they do look cool!</li>
            <li> Really powerful and my hair dries much better then with my previous dryer.</li>
            <li> Revion Laser Brilliance 1875W Infrared Heat Hair Dryer was pretty decent.</li>
            <li> Revlon certainly has a winner here with the product and the reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> She really likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> She really likes this model because the air intake is on the end which has ended the problem of her hair getting caught in the intake.  </li>
            <li> After much research I went for this dryer, and for the price, I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit correctly on the dryer and is CONSTANTLY falling off as you&#x27;re drying your hair.</li>
            <li> The buttons are awkward switches and aren&#x27;t designed in the best way.</li>
            <li> My better half needed a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Decent deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine, straight hair, and this dries my hair so much faster than my last blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it dries my hair so much quicker than my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the promised shine and don&#x27;t really notice it drying any faster than my old blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much lighter than my old dryer, which is a relief.  </li>
            <li> My old one really must have been on</li>
            <li> /&gt;For a few dollar more, I bough the Rusk CTC Lite, 1900 watts dryer</li>
            <li> The motor burns out after about 6 months of normal use.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy as many dryers.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if the infrared does anything but for my fine wavy hair it dries in enough time on the light heat setting with the diffuser and no frizz combo using Shiseido Tsubaki Shining Shampoo and Conditioner and Phyto hair balm.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how that compares with other dryers, but the db meter is a free app.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking for a new one.  </li>
            <li> but it felt so cheap to me that I ended up taking it back to the store the very next day...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a hair dryer work so quickly before in getting my hair dry.</li>
            <li> My hair was very soft as well.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> you have an old blow dryer and are on the fence about trying a new one, go with this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair enough to say its good or bad but it looks nice</li>
            <li> She has very curly hair and had picked this one out especially!</li>
            <li> Works well, so far no issues</li>
            <li> I probably would have given it a fifth star if it was quieter than my old one.</li>
            <li> I was suspicious of a hairdryer actually making my hair softer and smoother, but I decided to try out the ionic thing, and it really has made a difference.  </li>
            <li> Dries hair MUCH faster than the standard bloW dryer...</li>
            <li> Gave this blow dryer 3 stars because while it works it is pretty loud and leaves your hair with a bit of a wind blown look and feel, like as if you dried your hair while driving with the top down in a convertible.</li>
            <li> Another thing I like is that it has red lights at the tip, so I can actually see the red light reflecting off my blonde hair, so I know what part of my hair</li>
            <li> They were the same, both 84 db on high.</li>
            <li> It ended up leaving a huge black mark and a burn on my left palm.</li>
            <li> It has the required options to dry curly hair, such as cool shot, different temperature settings and</li>
            <li> This blow dryer felt flimsy and delicate and the diffuser is cheap, clear plastic.  </li>
            <li> Which is a good thing for me because I can sometimes be careless and will realize I am not actually pointing the dryer at my head.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it dried my daughter&#x27;s stuff animal fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had healthy hair in the past and am certain that this hair dryer is completely destroying my hair.</li>
            <li> I used this hair dryer 3-4 times per week for about 2 months, with no other changes to my hair care routine.</li>
            <li> Definitely dries my hair faster than my old blow dryer.</li>
            <li> The attachments came clear instead of black like in the picture, which makes them a little tough to find in my huge hair product basket, but they are easy to use.</li>
            <li> First, my hair gets caught in the little red pieces at the end of the dryer.  </li>
            <li> However, while I was drying my hair this morning, the dryer started acting funny as if it was burning out (I&#x27;d only been using it for a few minutes).</li>
            <li> I do really like the little loop on the handle to hang it up</li>
            <li> As I was moving the hair dryer down to look at it, the bottom near the cord suddenly sparked and burned!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and bought this model because the current blow dryer she&#x27;d been using had the air intake on the side and with her long hair it was getting caught in the air intake.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for 3 months with minimal daily use and it totally died this morning, with no recourse for return or refund.</li>
            <li> It was working fine in the beginning, and I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but in less than eight months the other day the motor started slowing down, then I smelled something burning and smoke started coming out of the hairdryer, then it just died!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; tips are plastic and if you have long, curly hair like mine, your hair will get caught in these &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; features.  </li>
            <li> if its not a large amount of $, I try to get things that look/feel substation so that they will last.  </li>
            <li> I rarely use any other type of heated appliance on my hair so this product was the only change in the past few months.</li>
            <li> I have also dried my hair straight in less time without using the diffusers.</li>
            <li> I bought it for the price, weight and color as I was simply sick of brightly colored or black hair dryers.</li>
            <li> Other people complailned about the switches being turned off during use because of their location on the back of the handle.  </li>
            <li> I looked for a hair drier for my daughter that would dry her hair faster than the one she had.</li>
            <li> I had my previous Revlon for several years and it was just about to die.</li>
            <li> I rough dry my hair and then use the nozzle and my drying time is much shorter, at least cut in half.</li>
            <li> The minor problem for this hair dryer is that the cold air is pretty much put where my index finger usually holding</li>
            <li> It takes less time to dry my hair and my hair doesn&#x27;t look as dry as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, minimally faster.  </li>
            <li> Not really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> No as lite as I expected.  </li>
            <li> I does not cut my drying time in half; it still takes 5-6 minutes to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I like that it weighs less than my old hair dryer, making it easier on my arms since I have long thick hair that typically requires about 6 minutes of drying time.</li>
            <li> The Revlon Laser Brillance is a little different than my previous one.</li>
            <li> My wife says it is quicker and not nearly as hot.</li>
            <li> Then the other day I got to experience the &#x27;exploding, shooting flames&#x27; out of the cord where it comes into the handle.  </li>
            <li> The other Revlon has them on the inside</li>
            <li> Other than that, it seems to be a satisfactory hairdryer.</li>
            <li> my other hairdryers lasted for years.</li>
            <li> I have very thick naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> drys my hair in half the time it takes with any other hair dyer</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would cut my drying time down.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that my hair gets stuck on the little plastic lights and rips out of my head...</li>
            <li> The infrared dried it in 6.5 minutes, the other dryer in 8.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend after we destroyed her previous one trying to blow up an air mattress.</li>
            <li> Yet, I have had this dryer for less than 2 weeks</li>
            <li> so less damaging to the hair...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick hair but this dryer takes a long time to do the job.</li>
            <li> It is less heavier than my previous small travel hairdryer and the heat doesn&#x27;t cook your hair like other hairdryers.</li>
            <li> It is lighter in weight and a little bit less noisy as well.  </li>
            <li> Little did I know the softness &amp; brilliance that were in store for me with this infrared experience.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the 2nd day I just take a round brush and slide it under sections of hair to refresh the volume!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this sketchy bastard.</li>
            <li> it dried her hair in about 10 minutes compared to 40 to 45 min.</li>
            <li> My hair does not seem to be getting dried out by using this dryer.  </li>
            <li> Especially if you have thin hair shafts as I do.</li>
            <li> Heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m going to crack one while trying to pull them out, and they are so hot after I finish drying my hair that they are hard to touch.  </li>
            <li> (it went down to $20!  who could resist!).  </li>
            <li> Not sure why</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened but will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Cuts drying thick hair in half the time!</li>
            <li> Leaves my untreated, natural gray hair soft, silky and eliminates the gray crinkles that I&#x27;ve had a terrible time eliminating.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to hold.  </li>
            <li> Second, when you hold the dryer your finger will rest not the cold blast button.  </li>
            <li> At least for me, I do not think this dryer does as claims.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was just bad luck, or if this specific model had problems.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair quickly and hasn&#x27;t made my hair nasty yet.</li>
            <li> I find the attachments difficult to get off - they are very tightly snapped in.  </li>
            <li> I tried washing off the black burn mark, but the pain was so bad that I did end up going to the doctor.</li>
            <li> However, the switches are in the wrong place as I was continually flipping them off while drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> I wonder why it&#x27;s so expensive here.</li>
            <li> I like this hairdryer, but I do think the buttons are awkwardly placed.</li>
            <li> or i keep turning the air cold.  </li>
            <li> hair was tangling like crazy from the attachments</li>
            <li> Needless to say I was not expecting that!  </li>
            <li> Bad design.</li>
            <li> It also hurt really bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed......</li>
            <li> Very inconvenient.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife uses it and very happy about.</li>
            <li> Those sassy red lights around the opening will rip out all of your hair. Cover with a hair tie, or duct tape, or you&#x27;ll lose ~3-6 strands a sesh. On the daily that&#x27;s more hair than ends up in my shower drain. Avoid at all costs</li>
            <li> Decent deal for the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend after we destroyed her previous one trying to blow up an air mattress. She really likes it a lot. Really good hair dryer, especially for the money.</li>
            <li> I am floored how well this dryer works!!! And an added bonus, it&#x27;s much quieter than any dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying it. works good.</li>
            <li> I sent this to my sister for a Christmas gift and she absolutely loved it!</li>
            <li> Love this dryer doesn&#x27;t burn the hair and drys my hair much faster</li>
            <li> So far so good with my new hairdryer. Was happy that this came with the attachments instead of having to purchase them separately. It is less heavier than my previous small travel hairdryer and the heat doesn&#x27;t cook your hair like other hairdryers. I am not sure if the infrared does anything but for my fine wavy hair it dries in enough time on the light heat setting with the diffuser and no frizz combo using Shiseido Tsubaki Shining Shampoo and Conditioner and Phyto hair balm. I have also dried my hair straight in less time without using the diffusers. Overall I am satisfied with my purchase and do not feel the need to purchase a $200 hairdryer to blow wind around my head.</li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer, but I don&#x27;t love it.  I find the attachments difficult to get off - they are very tightly snapped in.  I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m going to crack one while trying to pull them out, and they are so hot after I finish drying my hair that they are hard to touch.  It drys my hair fine, but I find my hair is very frizzy after using this dryer.  I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li> You can even touch the nozzle portion without getting yourself burned!! Now that impressed me...</li>
            <li> My wife says it is quicker and not nearly as hot. Likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> Good hair dryer, haven&#x27;t had any problems with it!</li>
            <li> My 26 year old granddaughter wanted it for Christmas and was delighted to receive it! She has very curly hair and had picked this one out especially!</li>
            <li> Not sure why but it didn&#x27;t work, tried everything couldn&#x27;t get it to turn on</li>
            <li> Wow!  I am so pleased with this purchase.  I have been using the same blow dryer for almost 20 years, and it finally crapped out on me.  I ordered this one based on reviews and a significant drop in price (it went down to $20!  who could resist!).  I have long, fine, straight hair, and this dries my hair so much faster than my last blow dryer.  It is lighter in weight and a little bit less noisy as well.  I have not used the attachments.  Another thing I like is that it has red lights at the tip, so I can actually see the red light reflecting off my blonde hair, so I know what part of my hair I am drying.  Which is a good thing for me because I can sometimes be careless and will realize I am not actually pointing the dryer at my head.&lt;br /&gt;If you have an old blow dryer and are on the fence about trying a new one, go with this.</li>
            <li> I like this hairdryer, but I do think the buttons are awkwardly placed. It does a great job of getting my hair dry quickly. Just wish the buttons were on the inside of the handle rather than the outside.</li>
            <li> I did not like this hair dryer...It has the required options to dry curly hair, such as cool shot, different temperature settings and so on but it felt so cheap to me that I ended up taking it back to the store the very next day...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if its not a large amount of $, I try to get things that look/feel substation so that they will last.  This blow dryer felt flimsy and delicate and the diffuser is cheap, clear plastic.  I just didn&#x27;t feel satisfied with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a few dollar more, I bough the Rusk CTC Lite, 1900 watts dryer and I&#x27;m a very happy camper.  The Rusk feels super lightweight yet very substantial and the diffuser is really nice too.</li>
            <li> I had the same hair dryer for 10 years, and when it finally gave out, I did a lot of research before purchasing this one. It&#x27;s been sketchy from then day I got it--wouldn&#x27;t heat up, turned itself off all the time, etc. I haven&#x27;t even had it six months, and today it turned on for a bit, then seems to have shut itself off forever. No amount of resetting or checking circuit breakers can resurrect it. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this sketchy bastard.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that my hair gets stuck on the little plastic lights and rips out of my head...</li>
            <li> I rough dry my hair and then use the nozzle and my drying time is much shorter, at least cut in half. My hair was very soft as well.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this hair dryer.  First, my hair gets caught in the little red pieces at the end of the dryer.  Second, when you hold the dryer your finger will rest not the cold blast button.  Every time i use it i have to move my finger or i keep turning the air cold.  Bad design.</li>
            <li> I agree that this is a good blow dryer - good heat and good air flow.  However, the switches are in the wrong place as I was continually flipping them off while drying my hair.  Then the other day I got to experience the &#x27;exploding, shooting flames&#x27; out of the cord where it comes into the handle.  Needless to say I was not expecting that!  Definitely a design flaw - Revlon really should do a recall and fix them and come back strong because it really is a good dryer, especially for the price tag!!</li>
            <li> Gave this blow dryer 3 stars because while it works it is pretty loud and leaves your hair with a bit of a wind blown look and feel, like as if you dried your hair while driving with the top down in a convertible. The hot setting doesn&#x27;t get very hot which is actually probably better for your hair. I have used the attachments. Definitely dries my hair faster than my old blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Only had this dryer for about 5 months before it exploded internally while in use. Not sure what happened but will not be purchasing again. Also the end does &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; your hair.</li>
            <li> Simply blown away by this lightweight and elegantly white Hair Dryer. I bought it for the price, weight and color as I was simply sick of brightly colored or black hair dryers. Little did I know the softness &amp; brilliance that were in store for me with this infrared experience. It not only dries the hair but adds VOLUME &amp; SOFTNESS to my hair that stays for 2 FULL DAYS! Seriously, the 2nd day I just take a round brush and slide it under sections of hair to refresh the volume! I&#x27;ve even stopped using my Redken Volume Mousse! I&#x27;m so glad that I decided to give up my heavy hairdryer even though it was working fine. This Revlon would have been even more perfect had it been a cord-keeper. But that&#x27;s alright. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret the light weight and elegant hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It takes less time to dry my hair and my hair doesn&#x27;t look as dry as before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this hair dryer in Target last month.  The list price is $29.99 with $10 Target store card rebate.  It&#x27;s a great value.  I wonder why it&#x27;s so expensive here.</li>
            <li> Awesome hair dryer! I feel like it dries my hair so much quicker than my old hair dryer. I like that it has the cool air button.</li>
            <li> It does dry my hair nicely. I don&#x27;t see the promised shine and don&#x27;t really notice it drying any faster than my old blow dryer. I do really like the little loop on the handle to hang it up</li>
            <li> My better half needed a hair dryer. Works well, so far no issues and she loves the way it works (no burning or ruining ends of hair etc.).</li>
            <li> I used this hair dryer 3-4 times per week for about 2 months, with no other changes to my hair care routine. My stylist said my hair looked burnt and I had to cut over 3 inches of split ends off. I&#x27;ve always had healthy hair in the past and am certain that this hair dryer is completely destroying my hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and bought this model because the current blow dryer she&#x27;d been using had the air intake on the side and with her long hair it was getting caught in the air intake.  She really likes this model because the air intake is on the end which has ended the problem of her hair getting caught in the intake.  Its also light weight and fairly compact.  Good buy.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This dryer works great! I love the attachments it comes with as well. Really powerful and my hair dries much better then with my previous dryer.</li>
            <li> This dryer is 100% better than the Chi dryer I paid $130 dollars for!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I purchased this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest. unbiased review. Revion Laser Brilliance 1875W Infrared Heat Hair Dryer was pretty decent. I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair enough to say its good or bad but it looks nice and it dried my daughter&#x27;s stuff animal fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I love dis product cuz it has more watts than my mom&#x27;s dryer. My hair feel great after I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the diffuser on this hairdryer, and it works well for her. She can&#x27;t tell if the infrared is a better for hair.</li>
            <li> Love love love! Easy to use. Cuts drying thick hair in half the time!</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE THIS HAIR DRYER!!!! I&#x27;ve had mine for about a year and thought it was a good purchase based on the reviews. However, while I was drying my hair this morning, the dryer started acting funny as if it was burning out (I&#x27;d only been using it for a few minutes). As I was moving the hair dryer down to look at it, the bottom near the cord suddenly sparked and burned! It ended up leaving a huge black mark and a burn on my left palm. It also hurt really bad. I tried washing off the black burn mark, but the pain was so bad that I did end up going to the doctor. The doctor confirmed that I had a contact burn and it was already blistering on the lines of my palm. I started doing some research after this happened and I&#x27;ve found that I&#x27;m not the first person who&#x27;s experienced this issue with the hair dryer. Bottom line: don&#x27;t buy it!!</li>
            <li> The motor burns out after about 6 months of normal use. I returned it and they said they get a lot of returns</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- drys my hair in half the time it takes with any other hair dyer&lt;br /&gt;- the initial &amp;#34;plastic burning smell&amp;#34; disappeared within 10 seconds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;-my hair was tangling like crazy from the attachments</li>
            <li> I was a die-hard Yellowbird fan until my husband broke mine trying to pull up linoleum floors. After much research I went for this dryer, and for the price, I&#x27;m a fan. It&#x27;s much lighter than my old dryer, which is a relief.  It works well and quickly, and my hair dries nicely without feeling burned or crunchy. The attachments came clear instead of black like in the picture, which makes them a little tough to find in my huge hair product basket, but they are easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer so much I ordered a second one to keep in reserve.  Leaves my untreated, natural gray hair soft, silky and eliminates the gray crinkles that I&#x27;ve had a terrible time eliminating.  I use it with the concentrator attachment. Now my hair dries as wonderfully as from the salon and I didn&#x27;t have to pay $150 for the dryer the salon sells.  It was all the positive reviews that convinced me to buy this dryer and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  Revlon certainly has a winner here with the product and the reasonable price.  No, I don&#x27;t work for Revlon; I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer in upstate NY.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to hold.  However, it does dry very nicely.</li>
            <li> I looked for a hair drier for my daughter that would dry her hair faster than the one she had. I finally decided on this one because of the infrared heat.My daughter has enough hair for five people (thickness) it dried her hair in about 10 minutes compared to 40 to 45 min. She absolutely loved it, now my other two daughters want one each.I will be buying two more!</li>
            <li> I ordered this because of the infrared heating.  I was hoping it would cut my drying time down.  I have another revlon dryer (RV544PKF), and I timed drying my hair with both of these.  The infrared dried it in 6.5 minutes, the other dryer in 8.  So, minimally faster.  I also checked the loudness using a decibel meter on my phone.  They were the same, both 84 db on high. 78 on low.  Don&#x27;t know how that compares with other dryers, but the db meter is a free app.  My hair does not seem to be getting dried out by using this dryer.  I like that it is lightweight.  Other people complailned about the switches being turned off during use because of their location on the back of the handle.  I haven&#x27;t had this problem.  The other Revlon has them on the inside and I accidently turn them off all the time. I probably would have given it a fifth star if it was quieter than my old one.</li>
            <li> Lots of power. Has enough settings for personal use.  Not as heavy as many dryers.  Easy to handle.  Removal screen to clean is nice.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer for a low price!</li>
            <li> Best&lt;br /&gt;Light weight&lt;br /&gt;Fast&lt;br /&gt;No damage</li>
            <li> I liked this blow dryer for many reasons.  Yet, I have had this dryer for less than 2 weeks and I&#x27;m looking for a new one.  Look closely at the end of the dryer. The &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; tips are plastic and if you have long, curly hair like mine, your hair will get caught in these &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; features.  A man, with short hair, designed this blow dryer :)</li>
            <li> Great dryer. I love the settings. It has high and low, and warm and hot. So you can switch to 4 different settings. I love it.</li>
            <li> Works great except where you hold handle it&#x27;s quite easy to accidently to shut it off.</li>
            <li> Works better than my old one!</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer. I have very thick naturally curly hair. The diffuser works great to keep my curls frizz free and beautiful. The dryer is also great with blow drying my hair straight with a brush.</li>
            <li> Just returned from a hair appointment where my stylist said my ends were burnt. She cut about 2&amp;#34; off of both the length and layers. I rarely use any other type of heated appliance on my hair so this product was the only change in the past few months. Beware!  Especially if you have thin hair shafts as I do.</li>
            <li> I was suspicious of a hairdryer actually making my hair softer and smoother, but I decided to try out the ionic thing, and it really has made a difference.  This hairdryer is not as lightweight as you might hope, but it is efficient and does what it says.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Not really what I was looking for. Not enough power if time is short. Dryer is awkward to handle for me and only gets warm at best. I don&#x27;t have thick hair but this dryer takes a long time to do the job. I made a mistake by not looking into the specifics before purchasing this product. Disappointed......</li>
            <li> Dries my hair quickly and hasn&#x27;t made my hair nasty yet.</li>
            <li> soooo good to use-  the style is nice too</li>
            <li> It is very good just like I expect</li>
            <li> After shopping around for a blow drier for a solid month, I finally found my way to Target, and this gem was waiting for me. For $35, it had everything I could have wanted, and more. Works like a champ and is making my hair healthier each day.</li>
            <li> Great inexpensive hair blower. Met&lt;br /&gt;my expectations.</li>
            <li> Heavy.  No as lite as I expected.  But it does the job.</li>
            <li> This product is a great hair dryer and I would recommend it if you don&#x27;t plan on using the included concentrator attachment. It doesn&#x27;t fit correctly on the dryer and is CONSTANTLY falling off as you&#x27;re drying your hair. Very inconvenient.</li>
            <li> This product is a great replacement for my old one, dry my hair a lot faster too. The heat is just about right so you don&#x27;t feel burn on your scalp. The minor problem for this hair dryer is that the cold air is pretty much put where my index finger usually holding so it can be accidentally press anytime during usage. The design of this hair dryer is also pretty stylish, for the price that I bought this, it was a great steal!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.  Definitely worth the purchase if you&#x27;re looking for a &amp;#34;salon-quality&amp;#34; hair dryer.  On the highest heat setting, it gets REALLY hot.  The infrared lights are to provide more heat, which in fact, it does!  I bought mine from Target for $30. It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> It looks nice, but the air for the high setting doesn&#x27;t seem to be very strong. The buttons are awkward switches and aren&#x27;t designed in the best way. Other than that, it seems to be a satisfactory hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Work like a charm. Simple and stylish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seldom left reviews for items but I was blown away (pun intended) by this hair dryer. I had my previous Revlon for several years and it was just about to die. I hopped online and quickly ordered another. The Revlon Laser Brillance is a little different than my previous one. I&#x27;ve never had a hair dryer work so quickly before in getting my hair dry. My old one really must have been on it&#x27;s last leg. Overall I&#x27;m very impressed with it and would purchase again if I have to.</li>
            <li> It was working fine in the beginning, and I don&#x27;t use it everyday, but in less than eight months the other day the motor started slowing down, then I smelled something burning and smoke started coming out of the hairdryer, then it just died!&lt;br /&gt;All my other hairdryers lasted for years. Not sure if it was just bad luck, or if this specific model had problems.</li>
            <li> one of the best blow dryers I have every owned</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer.  Just wish it had 3 temperature settings and 3 speeds and a longer cord.</li>
            <li> Great until it died. Just petered out whileI was drying my hair, on the warm (not hot) setting. The hot setting  doesn&#x27;t work either. Tried several outlets, reset the circuit thing on the cord, nothing. Junk.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer...The variety of settings are perfect. And the attachments are a lot more handy then I would have ever imagined. I would highly recommend this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty cool hair dryer. I like that it weighs less than my old hair dryer, making it easier on my arms since I have long thick hair that typically requires about 6 minutes of drying time. At least for me, I do not think this dryer does as claims. I does not cut my drying time in half; it still takes 5-6 minutes to dry my hair. I don&#x27;t think the red lights do anything either, but they do look cool!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for 3 months with minimal daily use and it totally died this morning, with no recourse for return or refund.</li>
            <li> Dries hair MUCH faster than the standard bloW dryer...so less damaging to the hair...I  LOVE IT!</li>
