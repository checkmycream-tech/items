            <li>Good price too.</li>
            <li>I tried this on a whim because I also had good luck with neutrogena Gel..</li>
            <li>Good shaving gel.</li>
            <li>and I had been using Nivea for Men after shave for years and loved it (no alcohol).</li>
            <li>alot of good options in market...</li>
            <li>Saw it one time on the shelf, tried it &amp; loved it since.</li>
            <li>Use good oil afterward.</li>
            <li>It is really good shaving gel.</li>
            <li>Good value.</li>
            <li>Want to feel smooth and wonderful?</li>
            <li>Good texture and consistency.</li>
            <li>And although the purists may brand me a heretic for saying so, in all honesty this product gives a superior shave.</li>
            <li>good lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;seems</li>
            <li>like a superior shaving product</li>
            <li>Good smell.</li>
            <li>It feels good and somehow make me achieve a closer shave.  </li>
            <li>so it does a good job of helping prevent nick and cuts.</li>
            <li>is a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lastly, there is light fragrance to the gel, I guess the best way to describe</li>
            <li>It smells really good.</li>
            <li>Which is actually a good thing.</li>
            <li>good quality and design.</li>
            <li>you like shave gels, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good value for the price.</li>
            <li>Both are good</li>
            <li>I like the thicker feel to the gel as it holds onto the skin nicely and feels great when shaving.  </li>
            <li>Good shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It lathers a good amount which is good if you like that.</li>
            <li>quality is good .</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good and feel good on the skin, It isn&#x27;t the best product I have used in terms of improving the shave</li>
            <li>Great product, very smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a great bargain shaving gel that does a great clean shave without irritation or drying.  </li>
            <li>This makes Nivea shaving gel not just an outstanding product but also a great value.</li>
            <li>All in all, performance is great, value is ok.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a nice creamy feel on the face and, coupled with a good multi-blade razor (e.g., Quattro)</li>
            <li>Fair deal, nice to get this delivered at home rather than having to run our to get a can of shaving cream when I need one.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, good product.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great shaving cream, it&#x27;s the best i&#x27;ve used so far</li>
            <li>so smooth!!</li>
            <li>I love this shaving gel!  </li>
            <li>But I just had to, this stuff works GREAT, so smooth, I love it!  </li>
            <li>amazing dont listen to the snobby brush and blade crowd this stuff works..</li>
            <li>plus this has alchohol free with witch hazel...which is an astringent and is great for the skin..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smooth and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li>I found the lubrication that they give to be amazing</li>
            <li>The gel itself is great and makes for a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>Lathers great, and goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li>, it gives me a nice, irritation-free shave.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a great many shaving gels, but this one is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I hoped the Nivea for my Norelco razor seems to work better.</li>
            <li>Nice mix of lotion and foam feel.</li>
            <li>This effectively protects my skin from irritation effects of the razor.</li>
            <li>It feels really nice before and after shaving.</li>
            <li>: It smells nice and manly.</li>
            <li>but when you rub it with your hand, it turns into a nice foamy cream.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this gel is that it doesn&#x27;t foam much at all.  </li>
            <li>nice product.</li>
            <li>Nice on the skin too.</li>
            <li>I bought more so he would have a good supply.</li>
            <li>But I really liked this product.</li>
            <li>The gel is has a nice, cooling texture that lathers with a mixture of water.</li>
            <li>Helps with making the shave smoother, and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a kind of menthol-like burn on the skin.</li>
            <li>I am loving this product.  </li>
            <li>Nice lather.</li>
            <li>Allows me to get a nice close shave.</li>
            <li>The scent is really nice.</li>
            <li>Nivea For Men delivers a nice shave.</li>
            <li>My husband loves it and always carries it for travel, very good price to have such good shaving product!</li>
            <li>The texture is great and the cream is rich.</li>
            <li>Smells great and feels pretty good.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant, perfumey scent, but it is rather strong.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have both this and the gillete one, and this is a bit nicer as it moisturizes more and has a more pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, very handsome</li>
            <li>Like a lot of Nivea after shaving products it feels great on your face cool</li>
            <li>I love the smell, very handsome</li>
            <li>As advertised, quick shipment, great product.</li>
            <li>Nothing more to add really, just an excellent product from Nivea!    </li>
            <li>Best shaving gel I have come across, works well, reasonably priced and no negatives.6 more words added to make review work.</li>
            <li>Still on the whole, a good product at a great price.</li>
            <li>Excellent product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The nivea, 4 men sensitive shaving gel has to be the best thing since sliced bread.</li>
            <li>and it gives me a good, smooth shave</li>
            <li>this  sensitive gel  very happy</li>
            <li>gives good comfortable shave...</li>
            <li>Nivea Sensitive Shaving Gel is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>but besides how effective it is with a razor, the number of shaves I get is better than any gel I have used before.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shaving cream out there.</li>
            <li>Good comfortable shaving gel.</li>
            <li>Nivea shave cream is an excellent product for people with sensitive skin type.  </li>
            <li>Best shaving cream for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I liked Nivea better than the Edge I was using.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic smell, works, really good price.</li>
            <li>This works the best for my sensitive skin while shaving.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent shaving cream for those with sensitive skin of for those who want to treat themselves well.</li>
            <li>The Art of Shaving is by far the best.</li>
            <li>BY FAR THE BEST SHAVING CREAM</li>
            <li>This shaving gel is great, because its light on my skin, and doesnt smell strongly, it also makes my shave a lot smoother, and faster.</li>
            <li>but they give a great shave if you use the right technique.....</li>
            <li>The razor goes perfectly into skin, no complications, it&#x27;s simple and quick, wash it off, feels great.</li>
            <li>It gave him a good clean shave.</li>
            <li>review of four stars isn&#x27;t five, simply because I prefer a shaving cream as opposed to a gel, but if you like gels, this is a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it, specially since it was on a good price break.</li>
            <li>Its smooth, gives a comfortable shave, finish feels good after the shave, nice smell and uses a pea-sized amount for lots of foam.</li>
            <li>But the product itself is very good and pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>It has a very mild scent, zero irritation and the best creamy lathering action I&#x27;ve seen out there.  </li>
            <li>Try shaving every three days you&#x27;ll probably notice how much better your skin feels very quickly and most work places wont notice a bit of scruff is kind of in now days.</li>
            <li>Great stuff - works really well and very comfortable for shaving.  </li>
            <li>Nivea gel creates an even better lather using a shaving mug and brush.  </li>
            <li>Better and cheaper than Gillette.</li>
            <li>but I always prefer this Nivea product for sure.</li>
            <li>I tried many products, however, I seem to always return to Nivea.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for more as I love the all in one body wash.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;He wanted more</li>
            <li>I love everything about it except the dispenser.  </li>
            <li>Gives me a nice smooth shave esp.</li>
            <li>It needs a better dispenser control.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this on my skin.</li>
            <li>the Dove Men+Care hydrate shave gel... which is much much better</li>
            <li>The price I got from Amazon was much better than your neighborhood chain drug store.</li>
            <li>Its better than foam.</li>
            <li>like it but can&#x27;t give it more than 3 stars.</li>
            <li>This shaving cream is just okay.</li>
            <li>I often steal this form my boyfriend for my legs :)</li>
            <li>Great formula to leave your skin feeling smooth after shaving, great quality overall</li>
            <li>He is able to get a closer shave.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a woman, and I love this shave gel for my legs.  </li>
            <li>Nivea is an excellent product in many areas for facial care.  </li>
            <li>My skin felt better after shaving.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I was able to use this product twice.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It works much better than the Gillette gel I was using before.  </li>
            <li>This dispenser design doesn&#x27;t do that nearly as much, which is a welcome change.  </li>
            <li>This shaves much better than foam.</li>
            <li>The best thing about this specific shaving cream is it moisturizes your face to the point where you can skip a day and use no cream and still no bumps!</li>
            <li>It lubes better than Gillette too IMO.</li>
            <li>It might be a couple more bucks</li>
            <li>and I end up with much more shaving cream than needed.</li>
            <li>And after more than 10 years of not using any foam or lotion</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll take the hit to my wallet and by a better lotion</li>
            <li>This shaving gel is okay.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>After doing quite a bit of online reading, I found that many people are using shaving cream with these electric shavers.  </li>
            <li>Many of these findings are subjective (like smell).  </li>
            <li>6 min. 16 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5</li>
            <li>Eshu lubricated my face better and felt like it was more soothing after shaving.  </li>
            <li>It provided better lubrication, but was also foamier.  </li>
            <li>The odor was better than the lower rated gels but still wasn&#x27;t something desirable.  </li>
            <li>Tolerable would be a better</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nivea for men was the second best gel I tried.  </li>
            <li>It has many positives.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was my favorite of the shaving gels I tried.  </li>
            <li>I can understand why this is a top selling shaving gel.</li>
            <li>I love the shave, but you can almost break your fingers pressing the top waiting for the stuff to start coming out of it.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>This product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>I could find, and some were better than others.</li>
            <li>It comes out with greater force to penetrate the built up crust.</li>
            <li>Feels great, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The shave seems OK.</li>
            <li>It is outstanding.</li>
            <li>love this product  always have&lt;</li>
            <li>My husband love&#x27;s this shaving gel.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried about forty different shaving gels, looking for the best one, and believe me, this is it!</li>
            <li>I like this a bit more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit more soapy than the gillette stuff.</li>
            <li>I just feel each press releases a bit more of the cream than needed.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love how it leaves my face feeling softer and prevents any razor burn.</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a great, skin-friendly shave gel!</li>
            <li>I am getting a better shave.</li>
            <li>Better than Gillette.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I have had better</li>
            <li>It produces a bit more</li>
            <li>I would be better without fragrance.</li>
            <li>Smells great, sensitive in skin, lathers nicely and bottom of</li>
            <li>I found my favorite Shaving Gel after trying this product.</li>
            <li>so the purchase of this item was more of &amp;#34;Why not for that price.&amp;#34; Glad I did.</li>
            <li>love the smoothing effect during the shave.</li>
            <li>and I think I like this better</li>
            <li>more words more words more words.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Edge and Barbasol competitors.</li>
            <li>I suspect this was done to get you to use more product.  </li>
            <li>I really love this shaving cream, I find that it&#x27;s one of the better ones.</li>
            <li>My favorite shave gel.</li>
            <li>but I would say that the gel is better.  </li>
            <li>and i love it, for the price</li>
            <li>Many are like whipped cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the EDGE shaving gels for many years</li>
            <li>This is one of the better deals I&#x27;ve found on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Nivea Shaving Gel works well and minimizes after-dispensing &amp;#34;oozing&amp;#34; better than a competing make I had been using.</li>
            <li>This my favorite shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>This was much, much better than anything that I had used in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li>protected my skin better and gave me a cleaner shave.  </li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to find something better at this price.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It also costs the most.</li>
            <li>- This is the next best thing to Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li>This shave cream is not that much better than Gillette Foamy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line - If you want Ferrarri performance you have to pay top dollar.</li>
            <li>- If you want Ferrarri performance you have to pay top dollar.</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li>This gel gives a very nice very close shave.</li>
            <li>The gel is rich and it lathers nicely.  </li>
            <li>This became a nice gift for my sons, and they liked it very much</li>
            <li>I like this product as it gives a clean shave with nice foam.</li>
            <li>Great price, super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>My hubby loves this product and I love his clean shave!</li>
            <li>Normally I didn&#x27;t notice a difference between shaving gels but that one was great.</li>
            <li>Good for first use, after that gel won&#x27;t come out of the dispenser.</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff. .  </li>
            <li>Smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li>Super rich cream with superior rinsability.  </li>
            <li>my favorite, great on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>The scent is mild, but nice.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>A great amount of shave gel for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Great on sensitive faces.</li>
            <li>Great shave gel would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great shaving cream for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin,close shave with no irritation</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this more than shaving foam because it isn&#x27;t as bulky.</li>
            <li>So much better than cheap no-name stuff from Walmart</li>
            <li>I love that it is fragrance free</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is just as good and much cheaper.</li>
            <li>This has a good lather production, and has worked very well with my razor.</li>
            <li>But this stuff is really that damn good.</li>
            <li>I Have Used Other Lathering Gel and This Is One Of The Best With No Itching or No Reactions To My Skin.</li>
            <li>The shaving cream itself is the best I have ever used and refuse to use any other brands.</li>
            <li>It has a very mild scent.  </li>
            <li>so I wasnt sure if he would like this, but he said he loved it and that his skin felt really soft.</li>
            <li>The scent is very mild and is not by any means overpowering.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely would recommend giving this a shot if you get razor bumps easily.</li>
            <li>You could easily see your skin and hair stubble.  </li>
            <li>I get razor burn and ingrown hairs easily.</li>
            <li>Many of their products, though great performing, are simply overpriced for store brands.  </li>
            <li>I also had a bottle of Edge shaving gel, but it had a strong fragrance, and it was mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I soaked it in warm, then hot water, disassembled the head and tried to run water through it.</li>
            <li>It is not bad, however for the money I still prefer Shick Hydro or even better, Target Gel with Lanolin.  </li>
            <li>7-Ounce Canister works fine</li>
            <li>I used to use the gillette stuff which was fine.</li>
            <li>It goes on easy with a light coat.</li>
            <li>or if it had to have one, that it was more mild.  </li>
            <li>It works great for sensitive skin/ like the fact there is lil to no fragrance added (whatever it is, can be described mild, non-irritating to your olfactory senses).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell too strong, the bottle looks good without obnoxious loud colors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure how to describe it, except to say that it works very well and makes my skin feel very comfortable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;manly, clean, excellent for sensitive skin and a high quality product.</li>
            <li>One huge difference between this and gillete shaving creams is that this can doesn&#x27;t rust.</li>
            <li>Cheap ass barbasol still last 9 years with one bottle and works great.</li>
            <li>It does not give me a smooth shave as the edge gel.  </li>
            <li>Helps with smooth shave without any irritation or cuts.</li>
            <li>Smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Keeps the shaved area smooth.</li>
            <li>it is cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m leaning towards light shaving creams as they work well</li>
            <li>Smooth on skin.</li>
            <li>use this in the shower and shave primarily on my neck.  </li>
            <li>With free shipping it saves me a trip and shows up in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it give a smooth shave, don&#x27;t cause a rash.  </li>
            <li>The canister does not rust which is important to me as I shave in the shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth a dollar, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay most store&#x27;s asking price ($3+) for it.</li>
            <li>Fragrance Free:  </li>
            <li>Smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, but still there.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent&lt;br /&gt;There is a light scent, but it won&#x27;t interfere with any scented aftershave splash/balm/lotion you want to use.</li>
            <li>I used to buy the cheap stuff but am now a lifer with this shaving gel.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using Nivea products for decades and this shaving gel is such a great product.</li>
            <li>idk that I&#x27;d be willing to pay full, regular price, but for the sale price, it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>smooth experience and value to money</li>
            <li>I tried their aftershave and liked it so much I tried this shaving cream as well.  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for a Smooth shave, this is what you need.</li>
            <li>Leaving my skin feeling silky smooth</li>
            <li>it is a fresh scent that is not overpowering at all especially first thing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>I had to add on an item for free shipping</li>
            <li>I recently decided to try it with an electric rotary shaver and it did a great job with that as well.  </li>
            <li>attentive to Cart</li>
            <li>I have used Edge gel for many years and was hesitant to change, but it was worth the change.</li>
            <li>a nice shaving cream for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Feels smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a fantastic shave you need to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also like that it alcohol free.</li>
            <li>awesome pantry filler item straight from Amazon w/ no extra trip to the supermarket needed!</li>
            <li>The shaving gel is surprisingly like the old shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>The gel is good for sensitive skin, I think.  </li>
            <li>well the results were outstanding far better glide and protection than taylors..  yielding a smooth and irritation free shave ..one of the closest I have been able to get..</li>
            <li>As far as Shaving gel/cream/foams go, it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not good enough........not by far.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Not bad at all... easy on face but</li>
            <li>This gel very rarely causes me problems.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it because it was a lower cost item on Amazon, but I&#x27;ve noticed a smooth shave when using it.</li>
            <li>reading many reviews and having had excellent success with Nivea products in the past, i decided to try this shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and the shaving experience is smooth.</li>
            <li>This shaving gel works exactly as advertised and is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Imagine lathering a dove soap bar really good, this is pretty much what you get when you lather this on your face, just thicker.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipment and a recommende good product for self shaving type men for easy smmoth and refreshing shave ,works up a big amount of foam or lather for a non - abrasive shave.</li>
            <li>He uses a cartridge razor and with the Nivea, he noticed a significant difference on the way his skin feels as well as how often he can shave.  </li>
            <li>to Shave:  5 min. 21 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  3 out of 5</li>
            <li>Dog Original Shave Gel:  </li>
            <li>sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br</li>
            <li>As long as it worked I was happy.</li>
            <li>With this shaving gel I&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
            <li>This is a unique product.</li>
            <li>Overall great for sensitive skin and has a nice crisp clean smell!</li>
            <li>It feels clean and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Helps shave cleanly.</li>
            <li>I love using this when I shave, I have found the price cheaper a few places but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>This stuff keeps its viscosity and makes for a close, clean shave.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li>This meant it took longer to shave and longer to clean my razor afterwards.  </li>
            <li>My husband is not a product man but this shave cream had him raving about how nice it is on his skin and how much better than the big box stuff he bought before.</li>
            <li>The gel itself has a clean, neutral scent.</li>
            <li>Easy to shave - great lather - cheap price and less than Target or Walmart.  </li>
            <li>It lathers well, smells good (but not overpowering), and does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s super important for shaving, since this thick foam holds in a lot of moisture, which makes it the perfect shave</li>
            <li>so every time you press the top, a large amount comes out.</li>
            <li>I changed over from Edge products because the price of this always is on special.  </li>
            <li>Works well, but nothing too special.  </li>
            <li>Has worked great so far, no bumps with a decent razor ( I&#x27;ve been using the Bic semi-disposable orange one)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and have enjoyed it - very comparable to Aveno shea butter shaving gel.</li>
            <li>I always loved Nivea products so the quality lives up to the standard.</li>
            <li>Really wish they could keep in stock at the drugstore but thank goodness for being able to buy here.</li>
            <li>I shave with a straight razor most of the time.</li>
            <li>Low odor, but still has a good manly scent.</li>
            <li>Shave Cool Mint.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much thicker and better than Barbasol, that I was reluctant to say that the gel foams.</li>
            <li>Its not bad - actually quite good in terms of glide and lubrication.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product otherwise</li>
            <li>Very good for sensitive skin ridiculous good price.</li>
            <li>When new/full the gel squirts out VERY fast, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Feel clean and fresh after shaving and washing face.</li>
            <li>Ever since I discovered this product a while ago, I have been a loyal user.  </li>
            <li>Again as described and quick arrival.</li>
            <li>The latter is definitely the best value.</li>
            <li>Also, on many shaving gels, the gel will ooze out after dispensing, causing a gross buildup around the top.  </li>
            <li>It does not provide adequate lubrication while shaving and all the foam</li>
            <li>Again the Eshu was faster to shave with than the Bold for Men or the Alphagel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel made my skin feel more smooth than [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Part of me thinks that this is on purpose to make you run out quickly.</li>
            <li>A good shave soap provides a much better shave with less irritation!</li>
            <li>This comes highly recommended for use with an appropriate electric shavers.</li>
            <li>It is so better than the normal shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It is probably one of the most cost effective due to this.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that it takes very little of the product to get a good covering.  </li>
            <li>straight razors are a unique skill in getting the blade properly sharpened and also having a good prep..</li>
            <li>i am sure its not,,, just like a shirt which has been unwrapped with all its pins removed... might still be new,,, but someone might have tried it before....</li>
            <li>My new favorite shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t need to use much per shave as it spreads easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Dispensing the gel from the can is very smooth, lightly press down on the top actuator and you can control the amount of gel</li>
            <li>Let me first say the positive things about this gel: It is cool, easy and moisturizing on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, but to be honest I really dont see much of a difference between this and other products.</li>
            <li>The Alphagel left it feeling more smooth and cool.  </li>
            <li>I had been using the more advertised brands up until then, boy was I surprised!  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s high quality and a you don&#x27;t have to use much for a close and comfortable shave, it&#x27;s thick and very smooth, but does not clog up your blade, it rinses clean, and leaves your skin feeling moisturized and great</li>
            <li>It makes the shave smooth and fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using shaving soaps for awhile now, and honestly picked this up simply as a cart filler.  </li>
            <li>The last gels and foams I&#x27;ve used, well, they just were not that great especially when compared to a good shaving soap, but I&#x27;m definitely going to keep a can of this on hand for those times</li>
            <li>Saving a dollar or two just isn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li>For sensitive skin, make sure you read the label closely and buy this version.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Clinique , its worth that price...</li>
            <li>It gives a terrific lather, has a nice refreshing smell, and helps me get a consistently smooth shave with my double edged razor.</li>
            <li>It is far better</li>
            <li>For that price, it&#x27;s well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>they just seem to fit more gel in the same sized bottle.</li>
            <li>But those red marks are greatly reduced with Nivea for Men Sensitive Shaving Gel.</li>
            <li>this gel shapes up my facial hair nicely and lets me get a near-new-blade shave</li>
            <li>This one is definitely worth a look.</li>
            <li>Let soak in for 2 minutes on warm clean wet beard.</li>
            <li>The two different gillete cans I&#x27;ve used rusted under the plastic nozzle, resulting in rust particles draining out of it if I ever clean off the top with water.</li>
            <li>Everything positive about this gel written here in the reviews are true.</li>
            <li>It rinses right out and makes shaving a lot easier.  </li>
            <li>If I can figure out how to get that coupon again I would order right now.</li>
            <li>I love this shaving cream, since my first buy I haven&#x27;t changed from nivea sensitive gel.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your face as conditioned as the top two performers but does a better than average  job.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>It is waaay better than the other brands, and has an excellent scent and even though only 7 ounces, it produces very much foam from its gel, and surely lasts much longer than other shaving foams or gels.&lt;br /&gt;AND</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this gel for a long time, and always liked it.</li>
            <li>This one might be just a bit more on the lotion side with the edge gel being a little more on the foam side . . .  </li>
            <li>It produces a soft lathering foam and he swears it is better then the other popular store brand.</li>
            <li>An almond sized dollop is enough to work up a good lather with your fingertips directly on your face.</li>
            <li>It is soft, stays well on the face, cleans quickly off the blade, and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product, and I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li>I  highly recommend both these products for those who want a close, clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The most helpful critical review is right.  </li>
            <li>Also, when you&#x27;re rubbing the gel on your skin, it dries out quickly because its so think, so you&#x27;ll find yourself using a little more water to keep it smooth and</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>It prepare our skin to shave very gently.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li>This nivea get works better at giving me a smooth shave than other products I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I like Nivea because they are consistent and</li>
            <li>I&amp;#34;m pretty convinced that most shaving creams are the same thing.  </li>
            <li>The Only Thing Better Would Be A Brush and Powder</li>
            <li>, this is the first time am using this</li>
            <li>Almost exploded out of the can when I first  used it.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li>That all changed the day I met my first can of Nivea for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I actually like it more than my electric now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>you first pump it out</li>
            <li>to Shave:  4 min. 58 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  1 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  1 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  5 out of 5</li>

            <li>After I was done shaving and I washed the gel off of my face, I found it made my face feel really hot.  </li>

            <li>Nevertheless, given the low price, I will continue to use non-comedogenic products to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li>product does pretty well.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much, fyi!</li>
            <li>After 1 shave I was back online getting more for when I ran out.</li>
            <li>I find it gives me a really clean shave; better than other brands.</li>
            <li>This says it&#x27;s a men&#x27;s shaving gel, but I got it for my (female) legs as a prime add on for super cheap</li>
            <li>It really foams well and does the trick right.</li>
            <li>better than all the other brands hands down, and the smell is nice too!</li>
            <li>A little thicker than edge gel (which I&#x27;ve used for 30 years) - gives a very good shave - enough to get me to switch!</li>
            <li>It helps prevent rash and skin irritation with its soft creamy texture and allows a clean shave without problems.  </li>
            <li>First time in almost 20 years of using a manual razor, not sure what was good</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and simply smells \\&quot;clean\\&quot;; not musky, not citrusy, not flowery or feminine; just clean.</li>
            <li>It took a little more time to clean my razor afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The first use always sort of explodes out fast.  </li>
            <li>This is one of those products you discover and hope they never stop making it because it&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;ve been looking for your whole life.</li>
            <li>Bull Dog had about as much foam as I would be willing to put up with and still use with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>Not bad, but I prefer the Gillette Fusion for Sensitive skin over this product.</li>
            <li>Not sure what they did to this shaving gel, but they seem to have done a good job.  </li>
            <li>- It spreads on and lathers thick and provides good protection for the shave of which I use a single blade razor - No bad smells , lasts a long time , does what is required that a plus in my book - Good Job Nivea</li>
            <li>My face felt only mildly irritated after each shave (barely noticeable) and my skin was in much better condition by the end of the week.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised, I have used a much more expensive product for many many years</li>
            <li>The stuff is very firm and gives a good shave.</li>
            <li>This forces me to use the right hand for everything where I am normally a switch hitter.</li>
            <li>I enjoy supporting local Connecticut companies.  </li>
            <li>And your skin feels smooth and not dry</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Long lasting and good product.</li>
            <li>A small amount lather your whole face and this stuff is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Classic shaving gel!</li>
            <li>A little squirt goes a long way I honestly believe this is better then the foam brands I normally use when I use foam</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started with a quarter-sized blob and it was way too much.  </li>
            <li>The can is pressurized so use a light touch or you will have a giant glob in your hand.</li>
            <li>but the can just doesn&#x27;t get it out very well</li>
            <li>Lathers reasonably well.  </li>
            <li>reasonably good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the fragrance is acceptable and it goes on very well and stays on until you shave it off.  </li>
            <li>Very foamy.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need too much for whatever youre working with.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t need that</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t provide - IMHO - as smooth or as comfortable shave as Aveeno, and even though Aveeno is more expensive, it&#x27;ll be my default.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>* Lathers better in wet environments (shower)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li>i stopped bleeding as much when shaving</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t care for brand names or fancy marketing gimmicks.</li>
            <li>I tried this because it was one of the cheapest shaving creams available locally</li>
            <li>Shaves much closer and easier to put on shaving area.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want as much foam with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li>It was much thicker than any of the lower rated gels I tested.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much to shave with it.  </li>
            <li>We are currently living overseas and while Nivea is available worldwide, no one come close to the US price.  </li>
            <li>Invariably too much comes out.</li>
            <li>As for how much to use, you don&#x27;t really need that much unless you really like to lather it</li>
            <li>It lathers very well</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave without razorburn.</li>
            <li>I also like that the product is very affordable.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent either</li>
            <li>Truth be told, I don&#x27;t think there is much of a difference.</li>
            <li>But it is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for the lather, it isn&#x27;t as much as foam from Barbasol cans, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting that from a gel.</li>
            <li>very much&lt;br</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and makes shaving so much easier.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need a whole lot to shave.</li>
            <li>Or, if it does, no one is really sniffing my legs or pits anyway</li>
            <li>Very Emollient Shave</li>
            <li>Audi - Very Emollient&lt;br</li>
            <li>Here is my car/shave cream  analogy: Ferrarri - Art of Shaving BMW/Audi - Very</li>
            <li>Been using Gillette for decades and Nivea is so much smoother and leaves skin softer.</li>
            <li>Husband really likes.</li>
            <li>Then I tried Nivea Shaving Gel, and WOW, it&#x27;s smooth, doesn&#x27;t irritate, leaves the skin soft, and the razor just seems to glide over my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of shaving methods (including DE shaving), products (many different blades and cartridges), and creams to deal with the sensitive skin on my neck.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m allergic to almost everything I only buy unscented products, my nose has gotten more sensitive over the years.</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant subtle fragrance that is not obtrusive.</li>
            <li>As most dark Asian&#x27;s know/find out, any form of skin irritation will easily scar our skin.</li>
            <li>(Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  3 out 5</li>
            <li>This is great, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>This shaving cream moisturizes better then any other one that hubby has used.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than other products I have used.</li>
            <li>Just like the other members of this product family, I love it.  </li>
            <li>like the other Nivea shaving gels better.</li>
            <li>Better than all the other gels I have used before.</li>
            <li>I have been using US made shaving foams for a year or so (being realistic, not racist), but went back to my (g)old NIVEA shaving foam and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Lasts a long time and allows for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Of the gels I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many, it&#x27;s second only to Neutrogena Men Razor Defense Gel, but much easier for me to find in stores.</li>
            <li>But the solution for me has been a Gillette ProGlide razor (manual, NO &amp;#34;FlexBall&amp;#34;) with Nivea Sensitive Shave Gel and Post Shave Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very difficult to find the perfect shaving cream.</li>
            <li>Overall, not a bad shave, but</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, what little shaving gel was left in the can, I salvaged before I threw out, and it was quite good shaving gel.</li>
            <li>Works better than gillette and is half the price.</li>
            <li>Initially appears as opaque jelly that quickly foams and expands in size once massaged in skin.</li>
            <li>Mild and enough moisturizing</li>
            <li>Most of these gels are similar and provide similar shaves.</li>
            <li>As I grew older I gradually noticed that the shaving gels I had been using for decades just didn&#x27;t seem to do it anymore.</li>
            <li>Creates a thin layer although configurable based on amount you use, works perfectly for my wet Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li>Thick shaving cream that only requires a &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; to get a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li>Very smooth shave with no significant aroma.</li>
            <li>A little gel goes a long way and best applied to a wet face.</li>
            <li>I notice nothing superior in it&#x27;s performance, but it&#x27;s going to last half as long as my last brand, and cost considerably more.</li>
            <li>I use this in combination with a few other shaving products to get a nice clean shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and leave lots of razor bumps.</li>
            <li>My kids were highly amused.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>this stuff is misadvertised: it smells to high heaven.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys not bleeding after a shave.</li>
            <li>Nivea for Men products are consistently high quality in my experience.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Now I have used almost every brand among the &#x27;high style&#x27; shaving creams.</li>
            <li>product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>HIghly recommend if you have had shave problems before.</li>
            <li>This is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>It runs about $30 a bottle which may seem high</li>
            <li>good price.&lt;br /&gt;Gel turns into a very thick</li>
            <li>On my can, I need to really press hard on the top, then too much comes out.  </li>
            <li>Be careful when you dispense the gel though, a lot comes out if you don&#x27;t press it lightly.</li>
            <li>I like this shave gel as much as I like the Edge progel for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>It shaves very well and leaves your face feeling soft and nourished from all the conditioners/essential oils it contains.</li>
            <li>I buy this when fragrance free shaving gel is not readily available; this comes pretty close.</li>
            <li>The stuff is magic: what looks like it&#x27;ll be barely enough gel to cover a small patch of leg will often end up covering a full leg.  </li>
            <li>, normally I like either shave oils (preferred) or cup/brush.  </li>
            <li>I normally use a shaving brush and shaving soap</li>
            <li>B005FNVINA Barbasol Original Thick and Rich Cream Men Shaving Cream, 10 Ounce]].</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>Normally I would scoff at paying $25 for a six month tub of shaving cream</li>
            <li>This one feels different right out of the can.</li>
            <li>This gives a smoother, more comfortable shave than ANY of my expensive creams, does not over dry my skin and with three traditional passes ( with the grain, across and finally against ) gives me a smooth, nick free finish.</li>
            <li>My skin was more irritated by the end of a week of usage; I had three nicks on the last day (only 1 for the Alphagel); and it left my face feeling really rawafter shaving.  </li>
            <li>After Use  3 out of 5  (felt raw but pretty smooth and 1 nick)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  5th</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, that is sensitive to touch and to certain chemicals.</li>
            <li>I live in Korea, republic</li>
            <li>This is my new go to shaving gel.</li>
            <li>I bought this because i have sensitive skin, particularly to fragrance in shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I found that I use my left hand t0 spread it and leave the gel on the hand so that it is available for a second pass.</li>
            <li>Used Gillette stuff for years made the switch its just as good if not better and lasts twice as long</li>
            <li>I would consider my skin to be very sensitive and somewhat oily.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This shaving gel is actually the first one I use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it works because acne has many causes.  </li>
            <li>The formula does not negatively affect my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>For $3 there is no better shaving gel, I&#x27;m not sure you can pay more and get anything significantly better than this either.</li>
            <li>NIVEA shaving gel for sensitive skin does everything it claims to do!</li>
            <li>My grandson has sensitive skin and loves this stuff!</li>
            <li>and this is the only shaving gel I&#x27;m willing to use.  </li>
            <li>I usually use shaving soap, but this is much better.</li>
            <li>, the Gillette can sits full on my bathroom vanity while the Nivea can is almost empty.</li>
            <li>your going to get this product be very careful with the top dispenser part as it is very fragile.</li>
            <li>It has a hair trigger and you can easily overuse what you need and not just by a little.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i highly recommend this product to anyone seeking a shave gel that doesn&#x27;t make you smell like a man-whore or a 13 year old boy using Axe to pick up 12 year old girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>gel is very smooth, no real scent to speak of, rinsed from my face without feeling like a film, but not leaving my skin dry from cetyl alcohol</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do anything special compared to other creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re smart, you are already using ProGlide (NOT regular Fusion).</li>
            <li>: it&#x27;ll last a while, I&#x27;m certain of that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very dense and under such pressure that a lot will dispense when you depress the button so squeeze carefully or you&#x27;ll get a lot more product than you</li>
            <li>After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  </li>
            <li>After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  2rd</li>
            <li>After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  1st</li>
            <li>One of the few things I liked about the Alphagel was that it left my face feeling cool instead of raw like the Eshu.  </li>
            <li>I have used both now and the clear winner is the Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it comes out looking clear but as soon as you apply it to your face it lathers up.</li>
            <li>After the shave you face feels soft like you used hand cream, not soap.</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s what sensitive means.</li>
            <li>the bumper looks classy but the outer ring comes off after 1 month</li>
            <li>you have truly sensitive skin, the type that breaks out from NON-comedogenic moisturizer, then avoid this.</li>
            <li>For Men Sensitive)</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin its something I have had to come to terms with.</li>
            <li>but you have to understand unless your in the military you don&#x27;t need to shave every day and most of us actually shouldn&#x27;t shaving daily</li>
            <li>Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel.</li>
            <li>Been always using Gillette so far</li>
            <li>* Better than Edge Progel (I used progel for at least 10</li>
            <li>thks the Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel,</li>
            <li>, not heavily scented, bottom of the canister doesn&#x27;t leave rust rings.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li>in all, for someone with sensitive skin, this is the product to buy and the organic versions just don&#x27;t lather.</li>
            <li>indeed WOW</li>
            <li>Even with a Mach 3 razor that is over a year old.</li>
            <li>Alphagel Sensitive Skin:  </li>
            <li>It just wasn&#x27;t think enough to lubricate very well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Nivea for Men, Sensitive Shaving Gel: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BIL9HZE/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i was surprised to see it without a cap when it was shipped....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried lots of sensitive skin gels/foams and this one beats them by far.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re on a budget and need a shaving cream for sensitive skin, give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t like having scented shaving cream but even though this product is not unscented, it&#x27;s not so much so that it would bother me.</li>
            <li>I purchased this directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>being that my skin is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>(Contains vitamin E &amp; natural Chamomile).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like this shaving get except it isn&#x27;t as soft feeling as others.  </li>
            <li>The Nivea Men Sensitive Shaving Gel is an exception.  </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel,</li>
            <li>i had been using Edge Sensitive formula for years</li>
            <li>Protects your sensitive skin but allows a close shave.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 cans and while I could have purchased them cheaper at my local store, the extra price was worth it.</li>
            <li>A+ - recommend, like this better than more expensive other shaving gels I was using.</li>
            <li>and i mean LOVE.</li>
            <li>Smooth feeling last longer than other brands I have tried, will buy it again on Amazon.</li>
            <li>With just a small dab you get plenty of thick cream lather that is great for sensitive skin as this formula does not use alcohol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little too lazy to mix up a good bowl.</li>
            <li>You may have different results if you use a different shaver or if your skin is more or less sensitive.  </li>
            <li>I love this shaving gel, no more itching or redness, not an annoyingly strong essence and a little bit of gel goes a long way!</li>
            <li>Also very important, with other foams my skin was starting to dry out, but not with this Sensitive Shaving Gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too easy to hold it down for a split second too long and get way too much gel.  </li>
            <li>I have ranked them starting with the worst, Bold for Men and finished with the best, Kiss My Face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold</li>
            <li>How do people give this such a high rating?</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a change from the big names, I highly recommend Nivea.</li>
            <li>I an bout to start my second can and can highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>A very little dab gives a very nice thick shaving cream.</li>
            <li>I have used the Norelco 9000 series and I feel it shaves lousy dry but great with this.</li>
            <li>The small is fantastic and the shave is as close as a man could ask for.</li>
            <li>The scent is REALLY strong, and it&#x27;s hard to wash off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s his new standard brand to use.</li>
            <li>Its a big turn off to get started with a new product that a person is unfamiliar with in that way, having to worry if I was delivered a non operating can of shaving gel.</li>
            <li>I bought a can of this several months ago after purchasing a new Gillette Fusion Pro Glide (non powered Razor).</li>
            <li>I just recently picked three new shave creams/gels to compare against The Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the shaving soaps as they dry my skin too much.</li>
            <li>The few minutes of that masculine ritual, done properly, allow a gentleman ten to fifteen minutes of enjoyable, private time and turn what was once drudgery into a moment of relaxation.  </li>
            <li>(the thick lather, the can design) except it has a fairly strong fragrance, and I just don&#x27;t like fragrances.</li>
            <li>Only criticism is that there is not a small travel size.</li>
            <li>I thought at first it was my shoddy skill with my new straight edge razor, but then I realized after using a different Gel that this stuff has basically no lubrication.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t necessarily note tremendous irritation to begin with, but I would say I have noticed a bit less irritation once using this product.</li>
            <li>Very thick lather, but not the thickest, better than competitors</li>
            <li>While described as fragrance free, there was a very slight plastic smell that I could only smell if I stuck it right up to my nose and sniffed heavily.  </li>
            <li>I generally just need shaving cream to help make the shave smoother and this does what it claims it will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used a different nivea shaving cream in the past which was fantastic.</li>
            <li>I should have looked closer but Sensitive does not always equal fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>I used various Gels, but I prefer aveeno All Natural Shaving Gel along with this(Nivea</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and shave daily with no problem.</li>
            <li>I barely ever cut myself anymore.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall:  I have used the regular one and this sensitive one of the Nivea creams.</li>
            <li>Nivea for Men Sensitive is the only brand I use for shaving, hair and products.</li>
            <li>I just recently purchased  this Sensitive  </li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and have often used much more expensive products to alleviate the razor burn and other discomfort.  </li>
            <li>Expands and foams very thick, leaves your skin feeling noticeably moisturized and smelling very clean.</li>
            <li>(Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  2 out 5</li>
            <li>(Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  1 out 5</li>
            <li>(Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  </li>
            <li>(Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5</li>
            <li>(Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5</li>
            <li>Better than other shaving creams I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>I am writing this for those who, like myself, have discovered ( or perhaps re-discovered) the pleasantness of old school &#x27;wet shaving&#x27; using a solid, heft steel razor and a double edge blade.... or for those who dare, the &#x27;cut-throat&#x27; straight razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not so much upset about the $3 can of shaving cream as I was about the fact that it ruined the other stuff</li>
            <li>Gel shoots out and does not spread as easily as other products, but I have been using it for over a month now and have not nicked myself once, so it really works.  </li>
            <li>The container is easy to use and a little goes a long way, so as someone who shaves about twice a week, one container lasts me for quite a long time.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I have only been able to use about half to 3/4&#x27;s of the can because the stuff comes out so unbearably slow that I end up tossing it and using a new can.  </li>
            <li>I am actually thinking of trying old school with a double edge razor and cream.</li>
            <li>Thick lather with a clean feel.</li>
            <li>I had a similar issue with another brand, but with that one I was never able to use even close to a full can.  </li>
            <li>This Nivea, so far, seems to be working as well as the much more expensive gels and</li>
            <li>It also seems to last a lot longer than other products I&#x27;ve used as you barely have to use any to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li>dog represented a major step up from the last shave gel (the Eshu).  </li>
            <li>the the bigger oz cans of foam but will last longer most like and waste less wish I would of found this before will buy again.</li>
            <li>Significantly better than the Gillette and other common brands.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a long time user of Gilette products for Sensitive Skin.  </li>
            <li>However, after the second use the dispenser apparently clogged.</li>
            <li>This gel works fine in general, but there are usually some harder &amp;#34;clumps&amp;#34; within the amount it dispenses so the application is not entirely even.</li>
            <li>The white plastic &amp;#34;trigger cap&amp;#34; on the top of the canister was broken into several different pieces and not attached to the canister itself.</li>
            <li>You only need a small amount for it to work; it is thick enough to protect my skin well (meaning my face felt good after a shave instead of raw); and I got a reasonably close shave from it.  </li>
            <li>cuts scan happen easily if you are inattantive or have poor prep.......</li>
            <li>Just a little bit of gel lathers up to be very puffy .</li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling cool like the Alphagel, it was the least irritating and my facefelt better after shaving than with any other product.  </li>
            <li>Got this with a coupon... little hesitant on buying this as I am allergic to regular Gels, but this one worked really well..</li>
            <li>is hard on your skin and very demanding on those of us with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I put a small glob of this into the center of my very wet, warm shaving brush and with only a few drops of water, whip this into a thick, smooth cream in my mug and thence onto my face.</li>
            <li>This was both good and bad.  </li>

            <li> And although the purists may brand me a heretic for saying so, in all honesty this product gives a superior shave.</li>
            <li> good lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;seems</li>
            <li> like a superior shaving product</li>
            <li> Good smell.</li>
            <li> It feels good and somehow make me achieve a closer shave.  </li>
            <li> so it does a good job of helping prevent nick and cuts.</li>
            <li> is a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, there is light fragrance to the gel, I guess the best way to describe</li>

            <li> Which is actually a good thing.</li>

            <li> I like the thicker feel to the gel as it holds onto the skin nicely and feels great when shaving.  </li>
            <li> Good shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It lathers a good amount which is good if you like that.</li>
            <li> quality is good .</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good and feel good on the skin, It isn&#x27;t the best product I have used in terms of improving the shave</li>
            <li> Great product, very smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a great bargain shaving gel that does a great clean shave without irritation or drying.  </li>
            <li> This makes Nivea shaving gel not just an outstanding product but also a great value.</li>
            <li> All in all, performance is great, value is ok.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a nice creamy feel on the face and, coupled with a good multi-blade razor (e.g., Quattro)</li>
            <li> Fair deal, nice to get this delivered at home rather than having to run our to get a can of shaving cream when I need one.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, good product.</li>

            <li> I love this shaving gel!  </li>
            <li> But I just had to, this stuff works GREAT, so smooth, I love it!  </li>
            <li> amazing dont listen to the snobby brush and blade crowd this stuff works..</li>
            <li> plus this has alchohol free with witch hazel...which is an astringent and is great for the skin..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smooth and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> I found the lubrication that they give to be amazing</li>
            <li> The gel itself is great and makes for a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> Lathers great, and goes on really smooth.</li>
            <li> , it gives me a nice, irritation-free shave.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a great many shaving gels, but this one is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I hoped the Nivea for my Norelco razor seems to work better.</li>
            <li> Nice mix of lotion and foam feel.</li>
            <li> This effectively protects my skin from irritation effects of the razor.</li>
            <li> It feels really nice before and after shaving.</li>
            <li> : It smells nice and manly.</li>
            <li> but when you rub it with your hand, it turns into a nice foamy cream.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this gel is that it doesn&#x27;t foam much at all.  </li>
            <li> nice product.</li>
            <li> Nice on the skin too.</li>
            <li> I bought more so he would have a good supply.</li>
            <li> But I really liked this product.</li>
            <li> The gel is has a nice, cooling texture that lathers with a mixture of water.</li>
            <li> Helps with making the shave smoother, and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a kind of menthol-like burn on the skin.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product.  </li>
            <li> Nice lather.</li>
            <li> Allows me to get a nice close shave.</li>
            <li> The scent is really nice.</li>
            <li> Nivea For Men delivers a nice shave.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and always carries it for travel, very good price to have such good shaving product!</li>
            <li> The texture is great and the cream is rich.</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels pretty good.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant, perfumey scent, but it is rather strong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have both this and the gillete one, and this is a bit nicer as it moisturizes more and has a more pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, very handsome</li>
            <li> Like a lot of Nivea after shaving products it feels great on your face cool</li>
            <li> I love the smell, very handsome</li>
            <li> As advertised, quick shipment, great product.</li>
            <li> Nothing more to add really, just an excellent product from Nivea!    </li>
            <li> Best shaving gel I have come across, works well, reasonably priced and no negatives.6 more words added to make review work.</li>
            <li> Still on the whole, a good product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The nivea, 4 men sensitive shaving gel has to be the best thing since sliced bread.</li>
            <li> and it gives me a good, smooth shave</li>
            <li> this  sensitive gel  very happy</li>
            <li> gives good comfortable shave...</li>
            <li> Nivea Sensitive Shaving Gel is perfect for me.  </li>
            <li> but besides how effective it is with a razor, the number of shaves I get is better than any gel I have used before.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaving cream out there.</li>
            <li> Good comfortable shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Nivea shave cream is an excellent product for people with sensitive skin type.  </li>
            <li> Best shaving cream for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I liked Nivea better than the Edge I was using.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic smell, works, really good price.</li>
            <li> This works the best for my sensitive skin while shaving.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaving cream for those with sensitive skin of for those who want to treat themselves well.</li>
            <li> The Art of Shaving is by far the best.</li>
            <li> BY FAR THE BEST SHAVING CREAM</li>
            <li> This shaving gel is great, because its light on my skin, and doesnt smell strongly, it also makes my shave a lot smoother, and faster.</li>
            <li> but they give a great shave if you use the right technique.....</li>
            <li> The razor goes perfectly into skin, no complications, it&#x27;s simple and quick, wash it off, feels great.</li>
            <li> It gave him a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> review of four stars isn&#x27;t five, simply because I prefer a shaving cream as opposed to a gel, but if you like gels, this is a great product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it, specially since it was on a good price break.</li>
            <li> Its smooth, gives a comfortable shave, finish feels good after the shave, nice smell and uses a pea-sized amount for lots of foam.</li>
            <li> But the product itself is very good and pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li> It has a very mild scent, zero irritation and the best creamy lathering action I&#x27;ve seen out there.  </li>
            <li> Try shaving every three days you&#x27;ll probably notice how much better your skin feels very quickly and most work places wont notice a bit of scruff is kind of in now days.</li>
            <li> Great stuff - works really well and very comfortable for shaving.  </li>
            <li> Nivea gel creates an even better lather using a shaving mug and brush.  </li>
            <li> Better and cheaper than Gillette.</li>
            <li> but I always prefer this Nivea product for sure.</li>
            <li> I tried many products, however, I seem to always return to Nivea.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping for more as I love the all in one body wash.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;He wanted more</li>
            <li> I love everything about it except the dispenser.  </li>
            <li> Gives me a nice smooth shave esp.</li>
            <li> It needs a better dispenser control.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this on my skin.</li>
            <li> the Dove Men+Care hydrate shave gel... which is much much better</li>
            <li> The price I got from Amazon was much better than your neighborhood chain drug store.</li>
            <li> Its better than foam.</li>
            <li> like it but can&#x27;t give it more than 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is just okay.</li>
            <li> I often steal this form my boyfriend for my legs :)</li>
            <li> Great formula to leave your skin feeling smooth after shaving, great quality overall</li>
            <li> He is able to get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman, and I love this shave gel for my legs.  </li>
            <li> Nivea is an excellent product in many areas for facial care.  </li>
            <li> My skin felt better after shaving.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I was able to use this product twice.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It works much better than the Gillette gel I was using before.  </li>
            <li> This dispenser design doesn&#x27;t do that nearly as much, which is a welcome change.  </li>
            <li> This shaves much better than foam.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this specific shaving cream is it moisturizes your face to the point where you can skip a day and use no cream and still no bumps!</li>
            <li> It lubes better than Gillette too IMO.</li>
            <li> It might be a couple more bucks</li>
            <li> and I end up with much more shaving cream than needed.</li>
            <li> And after more than 10 years of not using any foam or lotion</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll take the hit to my wallet and by a better lotion</li>
            <li> This shaving gel is okay.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> After doing quite a bit of online reading, I found that many people are using shaving cream with these electric shavers.  </li>
            <li> Many of these findings are subjective (like smell).  </li>
            <li> 6 min. 16 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5</li>
            <li> Eshu lubricated my face better and felt like it was more soothing after shaving.  </li>
            <li> It provided better lubrication, but was also foamier.  </li>
            <li> The odor was better than the lower rated gels but still wasn&#x27;t something desirable.  </li>
            <li> Tolerable would be a better</li>
            <li> /&gt;Nivea for men was the second best gel I tried.  </li>
            <li> It has many positives.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was my favorite of the shaving gels I tried.  </li>
            <li> I can understand why this is a top selling shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I love the shave, but you can almost break your fingers pressing the top waiting for the stuff to start coming out of it.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> I could find, and some were better than others.</li>
            <li> It comes out with greater force to penetrate the built up crust.</li>
            <li> Feels great, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The shave seems OK.</li>
            <li> It is outstanding.</li>
            <li> love this product  always have&lt;</li>
            <li> My husband love&#x27;s this shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about forty different shaving gels, looking for the best one, and believe me, this is it!</li>
            <li> I like this a bit more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit more soapy than the gillette stuff.</li>
            <li> I just feel each press releases a bit more of the cream than needed.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I love how it leaves my face feeling softer and prevents any razor burn.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a great, skin-friendly shave gel!</li>
            <li> I am getting a better shave.</li>
            <li> Better than Gillette.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I have had better</li>
            <li> It produces a bit more</li>
            <li> I would be better without fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smells great, sensitive in skin, lathers nicely and bottom of</li>
            <li> I found my favorite Shaving Gel after trying this product.</li>
            <li> so the purchase of this item was more of &amp;#34;Why not for that price.&amp;#34; Glad I did.</li>
            <li> love the smoothing effect during the shave.</li>
            <li> and I think I like this better</li>
            <li> more words more words more words.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Edge and Barbasol competitors.</li>
            <li> I suspect this was done to get you to use more product.  </li>
            <li> I really love this shaving cream, I find that it&#x27;s one of the better ones.</li>
            <li> My favorite shave gel.</li>
            <li> but I would say that the gel is better.  </li>
            <li> and i love it, for the price</li>
            <li> Many are like whipped cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the EDGE shaving gels for many years</li>
            <li> This is one of the better deals I&#x27;ve found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nivea Shaving Gel works well and minimizes after-dispensing &amp;#34;oozing&amp;#34; better than a competing make I had been using.</li>
            <li> This my favorite shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> This was much, much better than anything that I had used in the past.&lt;br</li>
            <li> protected my skin better and gave me a cleaner shave.  </li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to find something better at this price.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It also costs the most.</li>
            <li> - This is the next best thing to Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li> This shave cream is not that much better than Gillette Foamy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line - If you want Ferrarri performance you have to pay top dollar.</li>
            <li> - If you want Ferrarri performance you have to pay top dollar.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff</li>
            <li> This gel gives a very nice very close shave.</li>
            <li> The gel is rich and it lathers nicely.  </li>
            <li> This became a nice gift for my sons, and they liked it very much</li>
            <li> I like this product as it gives a clean shave with nice foam.</li>
            <li> Great price, super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this product and I love his clean shave!</li>
            <li> Normally I didn&#x27;t notice a difference between shaving gels but that one was great.</li>
            <li> Good for first use, after that gel won&#x27;t come out of the dispenser.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff. .  </li>
            <li> Smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Super rich cream with superior rinsability.  </li>
            <li> my favorite, great on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> The scent is mild, but nice.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> A great amount of shave gel for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Great on sensitive faces.</li>
            <li> Great shave gel would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great shaving cream for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin,close shave with no irritation</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this more than shaving foam because it isn&#x27;t as bulky.</li>
            <li> So much better than cheap no-name stuff from Walmart</li>
            <li> I love that it is fragrance free</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is just as good and much cheaper.</li>
            <li> This has a good lather production, and has worked very well with my razor.</li>
            <li> But this stuff is really that damn good.</li>
            <li> I Have Used Other Lathering Gel and This Is One Of The Best With No Itching or No Reactions To My Skin.</li>
            <li> The shaving cream itself is the best I have ever used and refuse to use any other brands.</li>
            <li> It has a very mild scent.  </li>
            <li> so I wasnt sure if he would like this, but he said he loved it and that his skin felt really soft.</li>
            <li> The scent is very mild and is not by any means overpowering.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely would recommend giving this a shot if you get razor bumps easily.</li>
            <li> You could easily see your skin and hair stubble.  </li>
            <li> I get razor burn and ingrown hairs easily.</li>
            <li> Many of their products, though great performing, are simply overpriced for store brands.  </li>
            <li> I also had a bottle of Edge shaving gel, but it had a strong fragrance, and it was mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I soaked it in warm, then hot water, disassembled the head and tried to run water through it.</li>
            <li> It is not bad, however for the money I still prefer Shick Hydro or even better, Target Gel with Lanolin.  </li>
            <li> 7-Ounce Canister works fine</li>
            <li> I used to use the gillette stuff which was fine.</li>
            <li> It goes on easy with a light coat.</li>
            <li> or if it had to have one, that it was more mild.  </li>
            <li> It works great for sensitive skin/ like the fact there is lil to no fragrance added (whatever it is, can be described mild, non-irritating to your olfactory senses).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell too strong, the bottle looks good without obnoxious loud colors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure how to describe it, except to say that it works very well and makes my skin feel very comfortable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;manly, clean, excellent for sensitive skin and a high quality product.</li>
            <li> One huge difference between this and gillete shaving creams is that this can doesn&#x27;t rust.</li>
            <li> Cheap ass barbasol still last 9 years with one bottle and works great.</li>
            <li> It does not give me a smooth shave as the edge gel.  </li>
            <li> Helps with smooth shave without any irritation or cuts.</li>
            <li> Smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Keeps the shaved area smooth.</li>
            <li> it is cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leaning towards light shaving creams as they work well</li>
            <li> Smooth on skin.</li>
            <li> use this in the shower and shave primarily on my neck.  </li>
            <li> With free shipping it saves me a trip and shows up in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it give a smooth shave, don&#x27;t cause a rash.  </li>
            <li> The canister does not rust which is important to me as I shave in the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth a dollar, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay most store&#x27;s asking price ($3+) for it.</li>
            <li> Fragrance Free:  </li>
            <li> Smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, but still there.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scent&lt;br /&gt;There is a light scent, but it won&#x27;t interfere with any scented aftershave splash/balm/lotion you want to use.</li>
            <li> I used to buy the cheap stuff but am now a lifer with this shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Nivea products for decades and this shaving gel is such a great product.</li>
            <li> idk that I&#x27;d be willing to pay full, regular price, but for the sale price, it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> smooth experience and value to money</li>
            <li> I tried their aftershave and liked it so much I tried this shaving cream as well.  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for a Smooth shave, this is what you need.</li>
            <li> Leaving my skin feeling silky smooth</li>
            <li> it is a fresh scent that is not overpowering at all especially first thing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> I had to add on an item for free shipping</li>
            <li> I recently decided to try it with an electric rotary shaver and it did a great job with that as well.  </li>
            <li> attentive to Cart</li>
            <li> I have used Edge gel for many years and was hesitant to change, but it was worth the change.</li>
            <li> a nice shaving cream for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Feels smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a fantastic shave you need to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also like that it alcohol free.</li>
            <li> awesome pantry filler item straight from Amazon w/ no extra trip to the supermarket needed!</li>
            <li> The shaving gel is surprisingly like the old shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> The gel is good for sensitive skin, I think.  </li>
            <li> well the results were outstanding far better glide and protection than taylors..  yielding a smooth and irritation free shave ..one of the closest I have been able to get..</li>
            <li> As far as Shaving gel/cream/foams go, it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not good enough........not by far.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all... easy on face but</li>
            <li> This gel very rarely causes me problems.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased it because it was a lower cost item on Amazon, but I&#x27;ve noticed a smooth shave when using it.</li>
            <li> reading many reviews and having had excellent success with Nivea products in the past, i decided to try this shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is clean and the shaving experience is smooth.</li>
            <li> This shaving gel works exactly as advertised and is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Imagine lathering a dove soap bar really good, this is pretty much what you get when you lather this on your face, just thicker.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipment and a recommende good product for self shaving type men for easy smmoth and refreshing shave ,works up a big amount of foam or lather for a non - abrasive shave.</li>
            <li> He uses a cartridge razor and with the Nivea, he noticed a significant difference on the way his skin feels as well as how often he can shave.  </li>
            <li> to Shave:  5 min. 21 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  3 out of 5</li>
            <li> Dog Original Shave Gel:  </li>
            <li> sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as it worked I was happy.</li>
            <li> With this shaving gel I&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a unique product.</li>
            <li> Overall great for sensitive skin and has a nice crisp clean smell!</li>
            <li> It feels clean and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Helps shave cleanly.</li>
            <li> I love using this when I shave, I have found the price cheaper a few places but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps its viscosity and makes for a close, clean shave.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and leaves me feeling clean.</li>
            <li> This meant it took longer to shave and longer to clean my razor afterwards.  </li>
            <li> My husband is not a product man but this shave cream had him raving about how nice it is on his skin and how much better than the big box stuff he bought before.</li>
            <li> The gel itself has a clean, neutral scent.</li>
            <li> Easy to shave - great lather - cheap price and less than Target or Walmart.  </li>
            <li> It lathers well, smells good (but not overpowering), and does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s super important for shaving, since this thick foam holds in a lot of moisture, which makes it the perfect shave</li>
            <li> so every time you press the top, a large amount comes out.</li>
            <li> I changed over from Edge products because the price of this always is on special.  </li>
            <li> Works well, but nothing too special.  </li>
            <li> Has worked great so far, no bumps with a decent razor ( I&#x27;ve been using the Bic semi-disposable orange one)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and have enjoyed it - very comparable to Aveno shea butter shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I always loved Nivea products so the quality lives up to the standard.</li>
            <li> Really wish they could keep in stock at the drugstore but thank goodness for being able to buy here.</li>
            <li> I shave with a straight razor most of the time.</li>
            <li> Low odor, but still has a good manly scent.</li>
            <li> Shave Cool Mint.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much thicker and better than Barbasol, that I was reluctant to say that the gel foams.</li>
            <li> Its not bad - actually quite good in terms of glide and lubrication.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product otherwise</li>
            <li> Very good for sensitive skin ridiculous good price.</li>
            <li> When new/full the gel squirts out VERY fast, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Feel clean and fresh after shaving and washing face.</li>
            <li> Ever since I discovered this product a while ago, I have been a loyal user.  </li>
            <li> Again as described and quick arrival.</li>
            <li> The latter is definitely the best value.</li>
            <li> Also, on many shaving gels, the gel will ooze out after dispensing, causing a gross buildup around the top.  </li>
            <li> It does not provide adequate lubrication while shaving and all the foam</li>
            <li> Again the Eshu was faster to shave with than the Bold for Men or the Alphagel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel made my skin feel more smooth than [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Part of me thinks that this is on purpose to make you run out quickly.</li>
            <li> A good shave soap provides a much better shave with less irritation!</li>
            <li> This comes highly recommended for use with an appropriate electric shavers.</li>
            <li> It is so better than the normal shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It is probably one of the most cost effective due to this.  </li>
            <li> Love the fact that it takes very little of the product to get a good covering.  </li>
            <li> straight razors are a unique skill in getting the blade properly sharpened and also having a good prep..</li>
            <li> i am sure its not,,, just like a shirt which has been unwrapped with all its pins removed... might still be new,,, but someone might have tried it before....</li>
            <li> My new favorite shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t need to use much per shave as it spreads easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dispensing the gel from the can is very smooth, lightly press down on the top actuator and you can control the amount of gel</li>
            <li> Let me first say the positive things about this gel: It is cool, easy and moisturizing on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but to be honest I really dont see much of a difference between this and other products.</li>
            <li> The Alphagel left it feeling more smooth and cool.  </li>
            <li> I had been using the more advertised brands up until then, boy was I surprised!  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s high quality and a you don&#x27;t have to use much for a close and comfortable shave, it&#x27;s thick and very smooth, but does not clog up your blade, it rinses clean, and leaves your skin feeling moisturized and great</li>
            <li> It makes the shave smooth and fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using shaving soaps for awhile now, and honestly picked this up simply as a cart filler.  </li>
            <li> The last gels and foams I&#x27;ve used, well, they just were not that great especially when compared to a good shaving soap, but I&#x27;m definitely going to keep a can of this on hand for those times</li>
            <li> Saving a dollar or two just isn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li> For sensitive skin, make sure you read the label closely and buy this version.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Clinique , its worth that price...</li>
            <li> It gives a terrific lather, has a nice refreshing smell, and helps me get a consistently smooth shave with my double edged razor.</li>
            <li> It is far better</li>
            <li> For that price, it&#x27;s well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they just seem to fit more gel in the same sized bottle.</li>
            <li> But those red marks are greatly reduced with Nivea for Men Sensitive Shaving Gel.</li>
            <li> this gel shapes up my facial hair nicely and lets me get a near-new-blade shave</li>
            <li> This one is definitely worth a look.</li>
            <li> Let soak in for 2 minutes on warm clean wet beard.</li>
            <li> The two different gillete cans I&#x27;ve used rusted under the plastic nozzle, resulting in rust particles draining out of it if I ever clean off the top with water.</li>
            <li> Everything positive about this gel written here in the reviews are true.</li>
            <li> It rinses right out and makes shaving a lot easier.  </li>
            <li> If I can figure out how to get that coupon again I would order right now.</li>
            <li> I love this shaving cream, since my first buy I haven&#x27;t changed from nivea sensitive gel.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your face as conditioned as the top two performers but does a better than average  job.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face super smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> It is waaay better than the other brands, and has an excellent scent and even though only 7 ounces, it produces very much foam from its gel, and surely lasts much longer than other shaving foams or gels.&lt;br /&gt;AND</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this gel for a long time, and always liked it.</li>
            <li> This one might be just a bit more on the lotion side with the edge gel being a little more on the foam side . . .  </li>
            <li> It produces a soft lathering foam and he swears it is better then the other popular store brand.</li>
            <li> An almond sized dollop is enough to work up a good lather with your fingertips directly on your face.</li>
            <li> It is soft, stays well on the face, cleans quickly off the blade, and rinses clean.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product, and I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I  highly recommend both these products for those who want a close, clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The most helpful critical review is right.  </li>
            <li> Also, when you&#x27;re rubbing the gel on your skin, it dries out quickly because its so think, so you&#x27;ll find yourself using a little more water to keep it smooth and</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> It prepare our skin to shave very gently.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin.</li>
            <li> This nivea get works better at giving me a smooth shave than other products I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> I like Nivea because they are consistent and</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m pretty convinced that most shaving creams are the same thing.  </li>
            <li> The Only Thing Better Would Be A Brush and Powder</li>
            <li> , this is the first time am using this</li>
            <li> Almost exploded out of the can when I first  used it.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described.</li>
            <li> That all changed the day I met my first can of Nivea for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I actually like it more than my electric now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> you first pump it out</li>
            <li> to Shave:  4 min. 58 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  1 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  1 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  5 out of 5</li>
            <li> (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face</li>
            <li> After I was done shaving and I washed the gel off of my face, I found it made my face feel really hot.  </li>
            <li> (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  </li>
            <li> (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  </li>

            <li> Nevertheless, given the low price, I will continue to use non-comedogenic products to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> product does pretty well.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much, fyi!</li>
            <li> After 1 shave I was back online getting more for when I ran out.</li>
            <li> I find it gives me a really clean shave; better than other brands.</li>
            <li> This says it&#x27;s a men&#x27;s shaving gel, but I got it for my (female) legs as a prime add on for super cheap</li>
            <li> It really foams well and does the trick right.</li>
            <li> better than all the other brands hands down, and the smell is nice too!</li>
            <li> A little thicker than edge gel (which I&#x27;ve used for 30 years) - gives a very good shave - enough to get me to switch!</li>
            <li> It helps prevent rash and skin irritation with its soft creamy texture and allows a clean shave without problems.  </li>
            <li> First time in almost 20 years of using a manual razor, not sure what was good</li>
            <li> The scent is mild and simply smells \\&quot;clean\\&quot;; not musky, not citrusy, not flowery or feminine; just clean.</li>
            <li> It took a little more time to clean my razor afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The first use always sort of explodes out fast.  </li>
            <li> This is one of those products you discover and hope they never stop making it because it&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;ve been looking for your whole life.</li>
            <li> Bull Dog had about as much foam as I would be willing to put up with and still use with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> Not bad, but I prefer the Gillette Fusion for Sensitive skin over this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure what they did to this shaving gel, but they seem to have done a good job.  </li>
            <li> - It spreads on and lathers thick and provides good protection for the shave of which I use a single blade razor - No bad smells , lasts a long time , does what is required that a plus in my book - Good Job Nivea</li>
            <li> My face felt only mildly irritated after each shave (barely noticeable) and my skin was in much better condition by the end of the week.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised, I have used a much more expensive product for many many years</li>
            <li> The stuff is very firm and gives a good shave.</li>
            <li> This forces me to use the right hand for everything where I am normally a switch hitter.</li>
            <li> I enjoy supporting local Connecticut companies.  </li>
            <li> And your skin feels smooth and not dry</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Long lasting and good product.</li>
            <li> A small amount lather your whole face and this stuff is great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Classic shaving gel!</li>
            <li> A little squirt goes a long way I honestly believe this is better then the foam brands I normally use when I use foam</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started with a quarter-sized blob and it was way too much.  </li>
            <li> The can is pressurized so use a light touch or you will have a giant glob in your hand.</li>
            <li> but the can just doesn&#x27;t get it out very well</li>
            <li> Lathers reasonably well.  </li>
            <li> reasonably good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the fragrance is acceptable and it goes on very well and stays on until you shave it off.  </li>
            <li> Very foamy.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need too much for whatever youre working with.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t need that</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t provide - IMHO - as smooth or as comfortable shave as Aveeno, and even though Aveeno is more expensive, it&#x27;ll be my default.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> * Lathers better in wet environments (shower)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> i stopped bleeding as much when shaving</li>
            <li> so I really don&#x27;t care for brand names or fancy marketing gimmicks.</li>
            <li> I tried this because it was one of the cheapest shaving creams available locally</li>
            <li> Shaves much closer and easier to put on shaving area.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want as much foam with an electric shaver.  </li>
            <li> It was much thicker than any of the lower rated gels I tested.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much to shave with it.  </li>
            <li> We are currently living overseas and while Nivea is available worldwide, no one come close to the US price.  </li>
            <li> Invariably too much comes out.</li>
            <li> As for how much to use, you don&#x27;t really need that much unless you really like to lather it</li>
            <li> It lathers very well</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave without razorburn.</li>
            <li> I also like that the product is very affordable.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent either</li>
            <li> Truth be told, I don&#x27;t think there is much of a difference.</li>
            <li> But it is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for the lather, it isn&#x27;t as much as foam from Barbasol cans, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting that from a gel.</li>
            <li> very much&lt;br</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and makes shaving so much easier.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need a whole lot to shave.</li>
            <li> Or, if it does, no one is really sniffing my legs or pits anyway</li>
            <li> Very Emollient Shave</li>
            <li> Audi - Very Emollient&lt;br</li>
            <li> Here is my car/shave cream  analogy: Ferrarri - Art of Shaving BMW/Audi - Very</li>
            <li> Been using Gillette for decades and Nivea is so much smoother and leaves skin softer.</li>
            <li> Husband really likes.</li>
            <li> Then I tried Nivea Shaving Gel, and WOW, it&#x27;s smooth, doesn&#x27;t irritate, leaves the skin soft, and the razor just seems to glide over my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of shaving methods (including DE shaving), products (many different blades and cartridges), and creams to deal with the sensitive skin on my neck.  </li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m allergic to almost everything I only buy unscented products, my nose has gotten more sensitive over the years.</li>
            <li> It also has a pleasant subtle fragrance that is not obtrusive.</li>
            <li> As most dark Asian&#x27;s know/find out, any form of skin irritation will easily scar our skin.</li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  3 out 5</li>
            <li> This is great, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This shaving cream moisturizes better then any other one that hubby has used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than other products I have used.</li>
            <li> Just like the other members of this product family, I love it.  </li>
            <li> like the other Nivea shaving gels better.</li>
            <li> Better than all the other gels I have used before.</li>
            <li> I have been using US made shaving foams for a year or so (being realistic, not racist), but went back to my (g)old NIVEA shaving foam and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and allows for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Of the gels I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many, it&#x27;s second only to Neutrogena Men Razor Defense Gel, but much easier for me to find in stores.</li>
            <li> But the solution for me has been a Gillette ProGlide razor (manual, NO &amp;#34;FlexBall&amp;#34;) with Nivea Sensitive Shave Gel and Post Shave Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to find the perfect shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Overall, not a bad shave, but</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, what little shaving gel was left in the can, I salvaged before I threw out, and it was quite good shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Works better than gillette and is half the price.</li>
            <li> Initially appears as opaque jelly that quickly foams and expands in size once massaged in skin.</li>
            <li> Mild and enough moisturizing</li>
            <li> Most of these gels are similar and provide similar shaves.</li>
            <li> As I grew older I gradually noticed that the shaving gels I had been using for decades just didn&#x27;t seem to do it anymore.</li>
            <li> Creates a thin layer although configurable based on amount you use, works perfectly for my wet Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> Thick shaving cream that only requires a &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; to get a nice clean shave.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave with no significant aroma.</li>
            <li> A little gel goes a long way and best applied to a wet face.</li>
            <li> I notice nothing superior in it&#x27;s performance, but it&#x27;s going to last half as long as my last brand, and cost considerably more.</li>
            <li> I use this in combination with a few other shaving products to get a nice clean shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and leave lots of razor bumps.</li>
            <li> My kids were highly amused.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> this stuff is misadvertised: it smells to high heaven.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys not bleeding after a shave.</li>
            <li> Nivea for Men products are consistently high quality in my experience.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Now I have used almost every brand among the &#x27;high style&#x27; shaving creams.</li>
            <li> product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> HIghly recommend if you have had shave problems before.</li>
            <li> This is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> It runs about $30 a bottle which may seem high</li>
            <li> good price.&lt;br /&gt;Gel turns into a very thick</li>
            <li> On my can, I need to really press hard on the top, then too much comes out.  </li>
            <li> Be careful when you dispense the gel though, a lot comes out if you don&#x27;t press it lightly.</li>
            <li> I like this shave gel as much as I like the Edge progel for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> It shaves very well and leaves your face feeling soft and nourished from all the conditioners/essential oils it contains.</li>
            <li> I buy this when fragrance free shaving gel is not readily available; this comes pretty close.</li>
            <li> The stuff is magic: what looks like it&#x27;ll be barely enough gel to cover a small patch of leg will often end up covering a full leg.  </li>
            <li> , normally I like either shave oils (preferred) or cup/brush.  </li>
            <li> I normally use a shaving brush and shaving soap</li>
            <li> B005FNVINA Barbasol Original Thick and Rich Cream Men Shaving Cream, 10 Ounce]].</li>
            <li> Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Normally I would scoff at paying $25 for a six month tub of shaving cream</li>
            <li> This one feels different right out of the can.</li>
            <li> This gives a smoother, more comfortable shave than ANY of my expensive creams, does not over dry my skin and with three traditional passes ( with the grain, across and finally against ) gives me a smooth, nick free finish.</li>
            <li> My skin was more irritated by the end of a week of usage; I had three nicks on the last day (only 1 for the Alphagel); and it left my face feeling really rawafter shaving.  </li>
            <li> After Use  3 out of 5  (felt raw but pretty smooth and 1 nick)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  5th</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, that is sensitive to touch and to certain chemicals.</li>
            <li> I live in Korea, republic</li>
            <li> This is my new go to shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i have sensitive skin, particularly to fragrance in shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> I found that I use my left hand t0 spread it and leave the gel on the hand so that it is available for a second pass.</li>
            <li> Used Gillette stuff for years made the switch its just as good if not better and lasts twice as long</li>
            <li> I would consider my skin to be very sensitive and somewhat oily.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend has very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This shaving gel is actually the first one I use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works because acne has many causes.  </li>
            <li> The formula does not negatively affect my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> For $3 there is no better shaving gel, I&#x27;m not sure you can pay more and get anything significantly better than this either.</li>
            <li> NIVEA shaving gel for sensitive skin does everything it claims to do!</li>
            <li> My grandson has sensitive skin and loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> and this is the only shaving gel I&#x27;m willing to use.  </li>
            <li> I usually use shaving soap, but this is much better.</li>
            <li> , the Gillette can sits full on my bathroom vanity while the Nivea can is almost empty.</li>
            <li> your going to get this product be very careful with the top dispenser part as it is very fragile.</li>
            <li> It has a hair trigger and you can easily overuse what you need and not just by a little.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i highly recommend this product to anyone seeking a shave gel that doesn&#x27;t make you smell like a man-whore or a 13 year old boy using Axe to pick up 12 year old girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> gel is very smooth, no real scent to speak of, rinsed from my face without feeling like a film, but not leaving my skin dry from cetyl alcohol</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything special compared to other creams I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re smart, you are already using ProGlide (NOT regular Fusion).</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;ll last a while, I&#x27;m certain of that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dense and under such pressure that a lot will dispense when you depress the button so squeeze carefully or you&#x27;ll get a lot more product than you</li>
            <li> After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  </li>
            <li> After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  2rd</li>
            <li> After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  1st</li>
            <li> One of the few things I liked about the Alphagel was that it left my face feeling cool instead of raw like the Eshu.  </li>
            <li> I have used both now and the clear winner is the Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it comes out looking clear but as soon as you apply it to your face it lathers up.</li>
            <li> After the shave you face feels soft like you used hand cream, not soap.</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s what sensitive means.</li>
            <li> the bumper looks classy but the outer ring comes off after 1 month</li>
            <li> you have truly sensitive skin, the type that breaks out from NON-comedogenic moisturizer, then avoid this.</li>
            <li> For Men Sensitive)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin its something I have had to come to terms with.</li>
            <li> but you have to understand unless your in the military you don&#x27;t need to shave every day and most of us actually shouldn&#x27;t shaving daily</li>
            <li> Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel.</li>
            <li> Been always using Gillette so far</li>
            <li> * Better than Edge Progel (I used progel for at least 10</li>
            <li> thks the Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel,</li>
            <li> , not heavily scented, bottom of the canister doesn&#x27;t leave rust rings.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and</li>
            <li> in all, for someone with sensitive skin, this is the product to buy and the organic versions just don&#x27;t lather.</li>
            <li> indeed WOW</li>
            <li> Even with a Mach 3 razor that is over a year old.</li>
            <li> Alphagel Sensitive Skin:  </li>
            <li> It just wasn&#x27;t think enough to lubricate very well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Nivea for Men, Sensitive Shaving Gel: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BIL9HZE/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i was surprised to see it without a cap when it was shipped....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of sensitive skin gels/foams and this one beats them by far.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re on a budget and need a shaving cream for sensitive skin, give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like having scented shaving cream but even though this product is not unscented, it&#x27;s not so much so that it would bother me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> being that my skin is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> (Contains vitamin E &amp; natural Chamomile).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this shaving get except it isn&#x27;t as soft feeling as others.  </li>
            <li> The Nivea Men Sensitive Shaving Gel is an exception.  </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel,</li>
            <li> i had been using Edge Sensitive formula for years</li>
            <li> Protects your sensitive skin but allows a close shave.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 cans and while I could have purchased them cheaper at my local store, the extra price was worth it.</li>
            <li> A+ - recommend, like this better than more expensive other shaving gels I was using.</li>
            <li> and i mean LOVE.</li>
            <li> Smooth feeling last longer than other brands I have tried, will buy it again on Amazon.</li>
            <li> With just a small dab you get plenty of thick cream lather that is great for sensitive skin as this formula does not use alcohol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little too lazy to mix up a good bowl.</li>
            <li> You may have different results if you use a different shaver or if your skin is more or less sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I love this shaving gel, no more itching or redness, not an annoyingly strong essence and a little bit of gel goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Also very important, with other foams my skin was starting to dry out, but not with this Sensitive Shaving Gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too easy to hold it down for a split second too long and get way too much gel.  </li>
            <li> I have ranked them starting with the worst, Bold for Men and finished with the best, Kiss My Face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold</li>
            <li> How do people give this such a high rating?</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a change from the big names, I highly recommend Nivea.</li>
            <li> I an bout to start my second can and can highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> A very little dab gives a very nice thick shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I have used the Norelco 9000 series and I feel it shaves lousy dry but great with this.</li>
            <li> The small is fantastic and the shave is as close as a man could ask for.</li>
            <li> The scent is REALLY strong, and it&#x27;s hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s his new standard brand to use.</li>
            <li> Its a big turn off to get started with a new product that a person is unfamiliar with in that way, having to worry if I was delivered a non operating can of shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I bought a can of this several months ago after purchasing a new Gillette Fusion Pro Glide (non powered Razor).</li>
            <li> I just recently picked three new shave creams/gels to compare against The Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the shaving soaps as they dry my skin too much.</li>
            <li> The few minutes of that masculine ritual, done properly, allow a gentleman ten to fifteen minutes of enjoyable, private time and turn what was once drudgery into a moment of relaxation.  </li>
            <li> (the thick lather, the can design) except it has a fairly strong fragrance, and I just don&#x27;t like fragrances.</li>
            <li> Only criticism is that there is not a small travel size.</li>
            <li> I thought at first it was my shoddy skill with my new straight edge razor, but then I realized after using a different Gel that this stuff has basically no lubrication.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily note tremendous irritation to begin with, but I would say I have noticed a bit less irritation once using this product.</li>
            <li> Very thick lather, but not the thickest, better than competitors</li>
            <li> While described as fragrance free, there was a very slight plastic smell that I could only smell if I stuck it right up to my nose and sniffed heavily.  </li>
            <li> I generally just need shaving cream to help make the shave smoother and this does what it claims it will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used a different nivea shaving cream in the past which was fantastic.</li>
            <li> I should have looked closer but Sensitive does not always equal fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> I used various Gels, but I prefer aveeno All Natural Shaving Gel along with this(Nivea</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and shave daily with no problem.</li>
            <li> I barely ever cut myself anymore.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall:  I have used the regular one and this sensitive one of the Nivea creams.</li>
            <li> Nivea for Men Sensitive is the only brand I use for shaving, hair and products.</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased  this Sensitive  </li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and have often used much more expensive products to alleviate the razor burn and other discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Expands and foams very thick, leaves your skin feeling noticeably moisturized and smelling very clean.</li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  2 out 5</li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  1 out 5</li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  </li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5</li>
            <li> (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5</li>
            <li> Better than other shaving creams I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> I am writing this for those who, like myself, have discovered ( or perhaps re-discovered) the pleasantness of old school &#x27;wet shaving&#x27; using a solid, heft steel razor and a double edge blade.... or for those who dare, the &#x27;cut-throat&#x27; straight razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not so much upset about the $3 can of shaving cream as I was about the fact that it ruined the other stuff</li>
            <li> Gel shoots out and does not spread as easily as other products, but I have been using it for over a month now and have not nicked myself once, so it really works.  </li>
            <li> The container is easy to use and a little goes a long way, so as someone who shaves about twice a week, one container lasts me for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I have only been able to use about half to 3/4&#x27;s of the can because the stuff comes out so unbearably slow that I end up tossing it and using a new can.  </li>
            <li> I am actually thinking of trying old school with a double edge razor and cream.</li>
            <li> Thick lather with a clean feel.</li>
            <li> I had a similar issue with another brand, but with that one I was never able to use even close to a full can.  </li>
            <li> This Nivea, so far, seems to be working as well as the much more expensive gels and</li>
            <li> It also seems to last a lot longer than other products I&#x27;ve used as you barely have to use any to cover your whole face.</li>
            <li> dog represented a major step up from the last shave gel (the Eshu).  </li>
            <li> the the bigger oz cans of foam but will last longer most like and waste less wish I would of found this before will buy again.</li>
            <li> Significantly better than the Gillette and other common brands.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a long time user of Gilette products for Sensitive Skin.  </li>
            <li> However, after the second use the dispenser apparently clogged.</li>
            <li> This gel works fine in general, but there are usually some harder &amp;#34;clumps&amp;#34; within the amount it dispenses so the application is not entirely even.</li>
            <li> The white plastic &amp;#34;trigger cap&amp;#34; on the top of the canister was broken into several different pieces and not attached to the canister itself.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount for it to work; it is thick enough to protect my skin well (meaning my face felt good after a shave instead of raw); and I got a reasonably close shave from it.  </li>
            <li> cuts scan happen easily if you are inattantive or have poor prep.......</li>
            <li> Just a little bit of gel lathers up to be very puffy .</li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling cool like the Alphagel, it was the least irritating and my facefelt better after shaving than with any other product.  </li>
            <li> Got this with a coupon... little hesitant on buying this as I am allergic to regular Gels, but this one worked really well..</li>
            <li> is hard on your skin and very demanding on those of us with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I put a small glob of this into the center of my very wet, warm shaving brush and with only a few drops of water, whip this into a thick, smooth cream in my mug and thence onto my face.</li>
            <li> This was both good and bad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the right amount.</li>
            <li> not feel that it was any special product compared to other shavings that i have used in past</li>
            <li> just pressing it a little pours out so much gel, that is good for multiple times!&lt;br /&gt;After closing it, some froth will keep on leaking out of it, and it looks so unclean :(&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
            <li> given that I shave only twice a week due to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with other shaving creams where it doesn&#x27;t provide enough moisture for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and shaving causes me problems with other products,</li>
            <li> The can and the rest of the items I ordered were just thrown loosely in a box and apparently the can exploded during shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You only need to use a small amount because it foams up really well.</li>
            <li> those of not old enough to remember the commercial with Farrah and Broadway Joe, go google it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a very slight fragrance to this product (a little sweet and flowery-smelling), but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  </li>
            <li> Either nothing comes out or you get too much for a small shave.</li>
            <li> A can will last a long time.</li>
            <li> While this smelled a little better than the Alphagel, I thought this gel produced worse results.  </li>
            <li> new everyday shave cream</li>
            <li> One bottle last a very long time in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> shave dry out the skin and have an alcohol/chemical smell, which is gross.</li>
            <li> I will next try my Aquatec, then my Arcitec which both work well dry shaving, just to see how they do with foaming gel.</li>
            <li> One can will last the average male about a month, if he is a daily shaver.  </li>
            <li> long as I slow down, I feel that this gel is a little better than the Edge Progel at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;</li>
            <li> So far I think it has a thicker foam when lathered and doesn&#x27;t fall apart if your hands are a little over moistured.&lt;br</li>
            <li> haha learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> so I was not surprised when I realized it was unusable.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time</li>
            <li> Goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When this German brand was introduced in the U.S. a few years ago, especially in the men&#x27;s line, I became a regular user.</li>
            <li> I spent some time researching which shaving creams and gels to try and settled on the following.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and must shave almost everyday and still no bumps with this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for a long time now, and I never cut myself.  </li>
            <li> , it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> My skin is not sensitive, but the shave quality is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least for me.&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy sensitive skin shaving cream, but this is the first time that I have bragged about it.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> I really like this product, the gel transforms into a thick lather.</li>
            <li> The only issue is that it has a mildly sticky feel to it and is difficult to rinse out of razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s all the same to</li>
            <li> Its just a little bit smoother on your face than the regular stuff, but that can make a big difference sometimes.</li>
            <li> then prior Gillete gels i&#x27;ve used and move away from due to cost.</li>
            <li> I never have to worry about dry, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> and he says that it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin at all or dry it out.  </li>
            <li> shaving gel is described as a dry shaving gel.  </li>
            <li> The gel also does what it promises in that my face doesn&#x27;t get irritated or dry.  </li>
            <li> I shave every single day and use this</li>
            <li> This gel is clear and has very little (if any) scent.  </li>
            <li> Very little amount of product is sufficient for a complete shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark Asian.</li>
            <li> The only reason it gets 3 stars for average is because of the price.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful notto press the button or actuator too hard as its pressured and a slight press is enough for a decent amount.     </li>
            <li> I prefer the &amp;#34;Gel&amp;#34; over the &amp;#34;Cream&amp;#34;, always, because there is less potential of a clog in the razor.  </li>
            <li> This is probably why it lubricated my face so well and left it feeling less irritation.  </li>
            <li> B004UQ6Q62 Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver]].</li>
            <li> I kept using it because I notice I&#x27;m less likely to cut my self and</li>
            <li> I only have to use a small amount each use so the bottle lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> The expected.</li>
            <li> The aerosol used in this brand always seems to peter out to a dribble before the can is entirely empty.</li>
            <li> Have not used wet/dry shaver in wet mode and consequently the product listed here after that experience.</li>
            <li> Very creamy but not great fragrance.</li>
            <li> I use it with electric shavers (for wet use), [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Of course as with any wet shave, I DO apply an after shave balm to keep the skin supple.</li>
            <li> But if you are a wet shaver, do yourself a favor and try this.</li>
            <li> as expected.</li>
            <li> I have used it wet shaving with a Schick Hydro blade and with a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> Not much of a fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> I have no or minimal razor burn after using this gel.</li>
            <li> For the money spent it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> After a few uses it calms down and towards the end it barely comes out at all.  </li>
            <li> I have to shave daily for work, and I found that a lot of the other shaving creams/gels were too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> He is of half Asian and Black descent so that gives you an idea on the grade of his hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Underneath all this, the &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; that pushes down into the canister to release the gel was loose and bent leaving me with no way to dispense the product</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way.  </li>
            <li> A little gel goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way....</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> one bottle has lasted about 2x longer than other products.</li>
            <li> Like other gels, this is just too sticky on the face and doesn&#x27;t feel good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am usually a brush and soap or cream guy but somebody  left this lying around</li>
            <li> Been using this shaving gel for several years and one of the few out there that agrees with my skin!</li>
            <li> This did not happen with any other gel/foam I&#x27;ve tried, so I probably won&#x27;t use this again.</li>
            <li> I had a lot of trouble getting it to shave closely, which is why it took so long to shave with</li>
            <li> Odered it the second time for my husband, but if I&#x27;m out of my gel, I usually steal this one for myself.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream feels smoother than other brands in my opinion.</li>
            <li> so I can buy more :(</li>
            <li> I was having issues with eczema in my underarms, and all other shaving creams caused burning and discomfort when I tried to use them.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers stated, I haven&#x27;t ever used shaving gel like this.</li>
            <li> I usually go with the edge gel, but I saw that this one had some solid reviews</li>
            <li> my face reacts to some other types of shaving gels but this one works.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nivea for a couple of years now and would not change to any other.</li>
            <li> it is a little difficult to get the right amount of gel.</li>
            <li> I usually use Aveeno&#x27;s oatmeal shaving cream, but I can never find it at our local stores and it&#x27;s not available via Amazon Prime or via subscription through Amazon, so</li>
            <li> That is probably the only negative point I have with this product.</li>
            <li> This one is just average.</li>
            <li> My facial hair is rediculously thick</li>
            <li> However, when the can is full, very difficult to contain or control the nozzle output</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as thick as the barbasol I am used to using, so I did nick myself a couple of times - the only reason its not a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I found that if i use a pair of tweezers to push down on the seal to dispense the gel, I can still use it.&lt;br /&gt;if</li>
            <li> This product quickly turns from a gel into goopy fake and thick lather.</li>
            <li> what I mean by that is there is no need to shake the can prior to dispensing, in fact,</li>
            <li> My husband tried a sample of this and was shocked at how it really was different from other products!  </li>
            <li> I like to use it as a lubricant slightly diluted with water with my electric razor.</li>
            <li> for several years used a brush and may of the expensive creams such as Taylors....</li>
            <li> I will retire the taylors at 15+ a tub and go with this for less than 3 bucks on sale...</li>
            <li> Less irritation after a shev now and rinses from the razor well also.</li>
            <li> I dont have the typical razor burn or a need for any moisturizing products</li>
            <li> May cut off half my tash and goatee.</li>
            <li> Typically lasts me about 1.5 months, shaving M-F.</li>
            <li> so I waste about half the can down the drain.  </li>
            <li> On my neck the grows against itself in several spots which is usually irritates my neck pretty bad if I shave quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It took a little time to adjust to a gel because you use much less.</li>
            <li> I can squeeze a little out</li>
            <li> It was also a little faster shaving with this than the Alphagel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little about me</li>
            <li> A little bit goes along way.</li>
            <li> It is impossible for me to get the right amount without overdoing it</li>
            <li> My skin is tough enough to use soap for a shaving lubricant</li>
            <li> I use a lot and waste a lot this stuff</li>
            <li> Dead</li>
            <li> There are a few negatives however.  </li>
            <li> didnt like it and its gas disppeared after a few uses and nothing came out.</li>
            <li> It is wasteful and messy.</li>
            <li> and I wasted 3/4 of what landed in the palm of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was a few bucks cheaper</li>
            <li> Probably not an issue for ladies doing legs but a waste for the guys.</li>
            <li> My Face Moisture Shave Bamboo Green Tea -</li>
            <li> Like some of the other reviewers said, it comes out thick.</li>
            <li> and I hardly let any go down the sink.</li>
            <li> I used to have pretty bad razor burn problemail before I started using this stuff.  </li>
            <li> not smelly, heavy lather with just a small amount of product.</li>
            <li> After Use  2 out of 5  (raw, 2 nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  4th</li>
            <li> I did notice that by the end of the week my face was feeling raw</li>
            <li> This product is thick and I can use less and it moisturizes my face without causing pimples.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Use just a little!  </li>
            <li> Other products do not allow me to get an ultra close shave, but this one does!!!</li>
            <li> Two blind pimples and hive-like red spots.</li>
            <li> Not sure if can will rust in the shower</li>
            <li> I usually prefer foam products but this gel changed my mind.</li>
            <li> The foaminess isn&#x27;t so excessive that I would discourage people from not using it with an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I guarantee you, you will not go back to your expensive creams after using this.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s slick, and it&#x27;s paraben-free.  </li>
            <li> They cram a lot of this into a small container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> a lifelong sufferer of plaque psoriasis on my face, I have grown accustomed to seeing angry red marks on my face after shaving, bad enough that people thought I was having an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> Other gels are kinda wimpy and thin out after you start lathering up your legs and sundry parts.</li>
            <li> Caution no returns and is an average product that can be purchased less expensively at Walgreen.</li>
            <li> its a little difficult to start foam ejection without causing much excessive emission and waste.</li>
            <li> It does have an odor that I don&#x27;t care for but it wasn&#x27;t anywhere near as bad as the Alphagel.  </li>
            <li> Used to buy this from Wal Mart before they replaced them with terrible cheap products.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know who sent it, but I complained to Nivea and Amazon and they sent a replacement.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t smell like a dingy bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell was the least objectionable of any of the six that I tried.  </li>
            <li> Over drying, irritation, and breakouts were common place before I tried Nivea.</li>
            <li> Lately I have been using the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It has a thick and slippery feel that seems to cling to the face.</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my head and because it&#x27;s so thick (the gel not my head)</li>
            <li> After Use  1 out of 5  (very raw, 3 nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  </li>
            <li> It may have been the thickest of the gels, but wasn&#x27;t so thick to create a problem.  </li>
            <li> The cream is thick once you lather it up a bit against your beard/mustache or in your palm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick</li>
            <li> Buy it and you will see what i mean.</li>
            <li> well doesn&#x27;t mean I want to smell like a bed of flowers all the time using a girls shaving gel.</li>
            <li> no more gillette, this is all i will ever use!</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> and I thought that was ridiculous, so</li>
            <li> This is not a good thing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thick gel that turns into a gel-like foam.</li>
            <li> It does, but still in a very thick way.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this shaving cream is as it came with a broken dispenser.</li>
            <li> Lubrication was poor during shaving too.  </li>
            <li> The Nivea Shaving Cream is just too thin</li>
            <li> I am upgrading from one to four stars with a bit of reservation because of the initially bad experience that seems to be due to the product.  </li>
            <li> I have not seen any skin irritation , other bad symptoms with this .</li>
            <li> and my bathroom still stinks, and it&#x27;s not a nice smell.  </li>
            <li> I had a bottle of Dove shaving gel and it was surprisingly thin and watery, which made it useless.</li>
            <li> nothing wrong with a product though</li>
            <li> It is so difficult to use his shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to control the release of shaving creme.</li>
            <li> I only wish that every time i pressed it, i wouldn&#x27;t get insane amount of product.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Nivea</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because for years i have been using gellete fusion gel.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s increasingly difficult to find ANYTHING that doesn&#x27;t have a ton of scent to it.</li>
            <li> Now the bad part, in terms of usability it is very thick gel</li>
            <li> It smells like those pucks you find in dirty highway gas station urinals.  </li>
            <li> Etiher way, it&#x27;s a terrible lubricant and I am returning this shoddy product.</li>
            <li> My wife thought my face didn&#x27;t smell bad afterwards, but when I had her smell the gel from the tube, she said, &amp;#34;Oh my god, that is awful!&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell.</li>
            <li> Dispenser is bad because lots of shaving gel comes out .&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like crazy!</li>
            <li> I have a nasty razor burn all through my face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I found this shaving gel to have the worst smell of any that I tried.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this shaving cream, since my first buy I haven&#x27;t changed from nivea sensitive gel. I shave every day and I have not gotten any bumps or burns with the use of this cream.</li>
            <li> My wife said: &#x27;You got Nivea?&amp;#34;  Yup, for the same reason she does. It works extremely well.  It has a very mild scent.  The razor glides across your skin.  After the shave you face feels soft like you used hand cream, not soap. It is reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use just a little!  I started with a quarter-sized blob and it was way too much.  An almond sized dollop is enough to work up a good lather with your fingertips directly on your face. Nivea gel creates an even better lather using a shaving mug and brush.  The can is pressurized so use a light touch or you will have a giant glob in your hand. My kids were highly amused.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t  receive it. It can&#x27;t ride  aircraft. I live in Korea, republic</li>
            <li> Better and cheaper than Gillette.</li>
            <li> I used to have pretty bad razor burn problemail before I started using this stuff.  This is my new go to shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Excellent shaving cream. Smoothhh</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin. Just a little bit of gel lathers up to be very puffy . Buy it and you will see what i mean.</li>
            <li> works well but the can just doesn&#x27;t get it out very well</li>
            <li> Just as described. Thank you. Great shipping A++++</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and always carries it for travel, very good price to have such good shaving product!</li>
            <li> I prefer the &amp;#34;Gel&amp;#34; over the &amp;#34;Cream&amp;#34;, always, because there is less potential of a clog in the razor.  I like Nivea because they are consistent and I enjoy supporting local Connecticut companies.  The price, with the $1.00 rebate, came to $2 including shipping.  Can&#x27;t beat it!  When I am on a budget I get the store brand equivalent of the Aveeno product but I always prefer this Nivea product for sure.</li>
            <li> The best shave cream,period!!!!</li>
            <li> I tried many products, however, I seem to always return to Nivea.  Their foam shave is very good, but I found the gel even better.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Very fast shipment and a recommende good product for self shaving type men for easy smmoth and refreshing shave ,works up a big amount of foam or lather for a non - abrasive shave.</li>
            <li> This shaving gel is so so at best.  I was hoping for more as I love the all in one body wash.  It does not give me a smooth shave as the edge gel.  Ill use up what I have..but will not purchase more.</li>
            <li> I bought this because i have sensitive skin, particularly to fragrance in shaving cream.  this stuff is misadvertised: it smells to high heaven.</li>
            <li> Buy it if you need a shaving gel, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Lathers reasonably well.  Smells reasonably good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price.</li>
            <li> I thought at first it was my shoddy skill with my new straight edge razor, but then I realized after using a different Gel that this stuff has basically no lubrication. It&#x27;s almost like nothing on my skin. Maybe that&#x27;s what sensitive means. Etiher way, it&#x27;s a terrible lubricant and I am returning this shoddy product. How do people give this such a high rating?</li>
            <li> Not bad, but I prefer the Gillette Fusion for Sensitive skin over this product. Does not irritate my skin, but not quite as close a shave as the Fusion product.</li>
            <li> Really good. Helps with smooth shave without any irritation or cuts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying off brand stuff for years not knowing what I was missing...and all for about the same price! The small is fantastic and the shave is as close as a man could ask for. It also seems to last a lot longer than other products I&#x27;ve used as you barely have to use any to cover your whole face. I have a beard and only shave my neck...one bottle has lasted about 2x longer than other products.</li>
            <li> This is great, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving cream I have found.  the fragrance is acceptable and it goes on very well and stays on until you shave it off.  I think it is not just for men!</li>
            <li> I love this shaving gel.  There&#x27;s a premium quality to it that I just haven&#x27;t found in Edge, Gillette, and Shick gels.. It&#x27;s got a nice creamy feel on the face and, coupled with a good multi-blade razor (e.g., Quattro), it gives me a nice, irritation-free shave.  Of the gels I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many, it&#x27;s second only to Neutrogena Men Razor Defense Gel, but much easier for me to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I have tried a great many shaving gels, but this one is definitely my favorite. Other products do not allow me to get an ultra close shave, but this one does!!! I never have to worry about dry, irritated skin. This is defiantly my #1 choice for shaving cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband.  He&#x27;s a long time user of Gilette products for Sensitive Skin.  I bought the Nivea one day from the drugstore because they had a promotion and I had coupons---and he has never turned back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wanted more so I bought this one from Amazon which was a great price.  He shaves his face and his head and has coarse hair. He uses a cartridge razor and with the Nivea, he noticed a significant difference on the way his skin feels as well as how often he can shave.  He says that Nivea allows him to shave every day if he wanted because it works that well.  He is of half Asian and Black descent so that gives you an idea on the grade of his hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it takes very little of the product to get a good covering.  Smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Always loved Nivea, they had done well with products for the longest time.&lt;br /&gt;I remember using Nivea creams in winters almost 30 years ago as a 4 yr old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaving cream is also good. Would recommend it, specially since it was on a good price break.</li>
            <li> Great product for shaving! The razor goes perfectly into skin, no complications, it&#x27;s simple and quick, wash it off, feels great.</li>
            <li> A great amount of shave gel for the price!&lt;br /&gt;Great on sensitive faces. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and have enjoyed it - very comparable to Aveno shea butter shaving gel.</li>
            <li> I use it daily in the shower.  I love everything about it except the dispenser.  It&#x27;s hard to get the right amount. It&#x27;s too easy to hold it down for a split second too long and get way too much gel.  I would consider my skin to be very sensitive and somewhat oily.  Works well for me.</li>
            <li> Works well, no skin irritation</li>
            <li> I have both this and the gillete one, and this is a bit nicer as it moisturizes more and has a more pleasant smell. I like to use it as a lubricant slightly diluted with water with my electric razor. Electric razor shave aides like Lectric shave dry out the skin and have an alcohol/chemical smell, which is gross.</li>
            <li> the bumper looks classy but the outer ring comes off after 1 month</li>
            <li> Not sure what they did to this shaving gel, but they seem to have done a good job.  Gives me a nice smooth shave esp. given that I shave only twice a week due to my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m pretty convinced that most shaving creams are the same thing.  Seriously. With the gel ones, what can the difference be?  I&#x27;ve always bought this one a it is for &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; skin which my boys have and it&#x27;s from Nivea, a great brand. Other than that, it&#x27;s all the same to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With subscribe and save, though, I get a good price and always have it on hand.</li>
            <li> Great shaving gel.  I&#x27;ve been using shaving soaps for awhile now, and honestly picked this up simply as a cart filler.  What a very pleasant surprise to find out this is a very, very good shaving gel.  The last gels and foams I&#x27;ve used, well, they just were not that great especially when compared to a good shaving soap, but I&#x27;m definitely going to keep a can of this on hand for those times I&#x27;m a little too lazy to mix up a good bowl.</li>
            <li> Very smooth shave with no significant aroma. Initially appears as opaque jelly that quickly foams and expands in size once massaged in skin.</li>
            <li> I will never use another shaving cream again. Thank you Nivea!</li>
            <li> As advertised, quick shipment, great product. Recommended seller.</li>
            <li> The shaving gel works great and doesn&#x27;t cost an arm &amp; leg. It feels clean and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> The youtube ad says you won&#x27;t get cut even if you use a knife. Well I got a hundreds cut</li>
            <li> Mild and enough moisturizing</li>
            <li> I like this product but the dispenser pushes out too much and some of it going to waste.. It needs a better dispenser control.</li>
            <li> Helps shave cleanly. I love the feel of this on my skin. Keeps the shaved area smooth.</li>
            <li> Works Great and Is Sold At A Great Price. I Have Used Other Lathering Gel and This Is One Of The Best With No Itching or No Reactions To My Skin. The Only Thing Better Would Be A Brush and Powder But That is Time Consuming.</li>
            <li> Everything about it is good (the thick lather, the can design) except it has a fairly strong fragrance, and I just don&#x27;t like fragrances. I don&#x27;t want to be smelling that all day, so I will not use it again. I should have looked closer but Sensitive does not always equal fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> My husband has used the same shaving cream all his life so I wasnt sure if he would like this, but he said he loved it and that his skin felt really soft. It gave him a good clean shave.</li>
            <li> I thought this was good until I tried the Dove Men+Care hydrate shave gel... which is much much better</li>
            <li> Like other gels, this is just too sticky on the face and doesn&#x27;t feel good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up tossing off of my gel cans and switched to tube-based creams.</li>
            <li> My husband says this is the best shave cream he has ever used.&lt;br /&gt;And he has a lot of acreage to shave...lol...head, beard and neck...so he should know.&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent, good protection.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I hoped the Nivea for my Norelco razor seems to work better.</li>
            <li> Very foamy. Don&#x27;t need too much for whatever youre working with. Great price for the amount too</li>
            <li> Ever since I discovered this product a while ago, I have been a loyal user.  A very superior product. I am a repeat buyer.  The price I got from Amazon was much better than your neighborhood chain drug store.</li>
            <li> Its better than foam. It has a thick and slippery feel that seems to cling to the face. It is a good product by my view.</li>
            <li> Great.  Nice mix of lotion and foam feel.</li>
            <li> Though this product provided a drag-free shave it caused an allergic reaction on my face. Two blind pimples and hive-like red spots. I really didn&#x27;t need that and I wonder which ingredient or ingredients in this Nivea product caused this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have truly sensitive skin, the type that breaks out from NON-comedogenic moisturizer, then avoid this.</li>
            <li> Husband loves this shave cream</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good and feel good on the skin, It isn&#x27;t the best product I have used in terms of improving the shave but it does work.</li>
            <li> Let me first say the positive things about this gel: It is cool, easy and moisturizing on my skin. I always loved Nivea products so the quality lives up to the standard. Now the bad part, in terms of usability it is very thick gel so every time you press the top, a large amount comes out. Also, when you&#x27;re rubbing the gel on your skin, it dries out quickly because its so think, so you&#x27;ll find yourself using a little more water to keep it smooth and flowy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it but can&#x27;t give it more than 3 stars. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, I&#x27;d stick with edge or schick hydro brand shaving gels.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this shaving cream is as it came with a broken dispenser. Packaging looked like it had been in storage for months so I was not surprised when I realized it was unusable.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is just okay. It just doesn&#x27;t provide - IMHO - as smooth or as comfortable shave as Aveeno, and even though Aveeno is more expensive, it&#x27;ll be my default. Saving a dollar or two just isn&#x27;t worth it to me.</li>
            <li> The expected. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> My husband will use just about any shaving cream but loves this Nivea!  It&#x27;s great for legs too! :)&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> This shaving gel is actually the first one I use. I only used hand soap before. It actually helps me with irritation I had been having before. Good product and it is cheap.</li>
            <li> I am usually a brush and soap or cream guy but somebody  left this lying around so I tried it. Its not bad - actually quite good in terms of glide and lubrication. My issue with it is that it can&#x27;t be used with a brush. I kniow - I&#x27;ve tried it- so once you spread it over you face what do you do for the 2nd or #3d pass? I found that I use my left hand t0 spread it and leave the gel on the hand so that it is available for a second pass. This forces me to use the right hand for everything where I am normally a switch hitter. But the product itself is very good and pretty cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark Asian. This is great for my skin. As most dark Asian&#x27;s know/find out, any form of skin irritation will easily scar our skin. This effectively protects my skin from irritation effects of the razor. Used to buy this from Wal Mart before they replaced them with terrible cheap products.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells like crazy! Its been almost an hour and my bathroom still stinks, and it&#x27;s not a nice smell.  Think of any generic department store cologne section, its like rubbing that all over your face.  I can&#x27;t believe no one else has mention this.  Not a bad product otherwise but I can&#x27;t see myself using it again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It lasts a long time and I never have problems with bumps or irritation when I shave with the grain.</li>
            <li> Got this with a coupon... little hesitant on buying this as I am allergic to regular Gels, but this one worked really well.. I used various Gels, but I prefer aveeno All Natural Shaving Gel along with this(Nivea For Men Sensitive)</li>
            <li> Thick lather with a clean feel. Be careful when you dispense the gel though, a lot comes out if you don&#x27;t press it lightly. haha learned the hard way.</li>
            <li> This nivea get works better at giving me a smooth shave than other products I have used.&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint I have is that after only a few uses the top of the container snapped off. I found that if i use a pair of tweezers to push down on the seal to dispense the gel, I can still use it.&lt;br /&gt;if your going to get this product be very careful with the top dispenser part as it is very fragile.</li>
            <li> Really wish they could keep in stock at the drugstore but thank goodness for being able to buy here. Excellent product for sensitive skin. I often steal this form my boyfriend for my legs :)</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin its something I have had to come to terms with. Although just because I have to treat my skin well doesn&#x27;t mean I want to smell like a bed of flowers all the time using a girls shaving gel. So I use this when I shave every three days yes it means by day two I have a bit of scruff but you have to understand unless your in the military you don&#x27;t need to shave every day and most of us actually shouldn&#x27;t shaving daily is hard on your skin and very demanding on those of us with sensitive skin. Try shaving every three days you&#x27;ll probably notice how much better your skin feels very quickly and most work places wont notice a bit of scruff is kind of in now days.</li>
            <li> Great Shaving Gel, very effective in preventing irritation.</li>
            <li> A very little dab gives a very nice thick shaving cream. I have sensitive skin and shave daily with no problem. Give it a try. If you don&#x27;t like it return it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and that&#x27;s why I continued to get it. You will by it again if you try it</li>
            <li> Been using this shaving gel for several years and one of the few out there that agrees with my skin! Great formula to leave your skin feeling smooth after shaving, great quality overall</li>
            <li> It works well without all the smell.</li>
            <li> I took a chance and bought this for my husband when he was out of shaving cream. This shaving cream moisturizes better then any other one that hubby has used. He is able to get a closer shave. It produces a soft lathering foam and he swears it is better then the other popular store brand.</li>
            <li> Great shave gel would recommend to anyone with sensitive skin. Nice lather once rubbed onto face and great feel after shave.</li>
            <li> Really nice stuff, use it to shave my head and my face and works great</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my skin. It&#x27;s better than other products I have used.</li>
            <li> Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel. hvnt used it, Seems good for this price from Nivea. Been always using Gillette so far</li>
            <li> The stuff is very firm and gives a good shave. I&#x27;m leaning towards light shaving creams as they work well and you can see where you are shaving. The Nivea is good as a change up/back up shaving techique or something.</li>
            <li> Works really well. Goes a long way. Smooth on skin. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a woman, and I love this shave gel for my legs.  It has a very mild scent, zero irritation and the best creamy lathering action I&#x27;ve seen out there.  A little goes a LONG way.  I&#x27;m buying men&#x27;s shave gel from hereon out.</li>
            <li> As I child I remember my mother using Nivea facial cream in the royal blue tin cans. When this German brand was introduced in the U.S. a few years ago, especially in the men&#x27;s line, I became a regular user. I trust all Nivea products.</li>
            <li> Husband tried and seems to like this product.  Nivea is an excellent product in many areas for facial care.  Again as described and quick arrival.</li>
            <li> Great Lather. Use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I like this shave gel as much as I like the Edge progel for sensitive skin.  So far I think it has a thicker foam when lathered and doesn&#x27;t fall apart if your hands are a little over moistured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in the shower and shave primarily on my neck.  My facial hair is rediculously thick and I have had hair splinters before.  On my neck the grows against itself in several spots which is usually irritates my neck pretty bad if I shave quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as I slow down, I feel that this gel is a little better than the Edge Progel at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;* Better than Edge Progel (I used progel for at least 10 years)&lt;br /&gt;* Thicker lather than Progel&lt;br /&gt;* Lathers better in wet environments (shower)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;* Not sure if can will rust in the shower</li>
            <li> thks the Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel, 7-Ounce Canister works fine, this is the first time am using this</li>
            <li> I love using this when I shave, I have found the price cheaper a few places but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Good for first use, after that gel won&#x27;t come out of the dispenser. I cleaned it and still no luck.</li>
            <li> This comes highly recommended for use with an appropriate electric shavers. It makes the shave smooth and fast. I have used the Norelco 9000 series and I feel it shaves lousy dry but great with this. I will next try my Aquatec, then my Arcitec which both work well dry shaving, just to see how they do with foaming gel. If I do not update they did great. I recommend this,would buy again, an I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I have used a few cans of this stuff now and really like it for shaving.  The problem I have had is how it dispenses out of the can.  The first use always sort of explodes out fast.  After a few uses it calms down and towards the end it barely comes out at all.  Sometimes I have only been able to use about half to 3/4&#x27;s of the can because the stuff comes out so unbearably slow that I end up tossing it and using a new can.  I had a similar issue with another brand, but with that one I was never able to use even close to a full can.  I think again I will look for a different product to use for shaving.  I am actually thinking of trying old school with a double edge razor and cream.</li>
            <li> I buy this when fragrance free shaving gel is not readily available; this comes pretty close. The aerosol used in this brand always seems to peter out to a dribble before the can is entirely empty. For sensitive skin, make sure you read the label closely and buy this version. Their foaming shave product, which makes for a bumpier ride, packing is almost identical.</li>
            <li> Best shave gel I have used. Good price too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shave gel for about two years. The container is easy to use and a little goes a long way, so as someone who shaves about twice a week, one container lasts me for quite a long time. The scent is very mild and is not by any means overpowering. I use this in combination with a few other shaving products to get a nice clean shave that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and leave lots of razor bumps. Also - VERY good value for the price. I would recommend this product. Blessings!</li>
            <li> It makes my shaving easier and helps to prevent any irritation on my face afterwards.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift, he loves this</li>
            <li> My favorite shaving cream, and a great value for the price!</li>
            <li> I tried this with no expectations. It turned out to be a very good product. Gave me a smoother shave. My skin felt better after shaving. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaving cream for over a month and have been very happy with it. I usually use Aveeno&#x27;s oatmeal shaving cream, but I can never find it at our local stores and it&#x27;s not available via Amazon Prime or via subscription through Amazon, so I thought I&#x27;d give this gel a try. It is a great contender against the Aveeno product. Very smooth and creamy. Other gels are kinda wimpy and thin out after you start lathering up your legs and sundry parts. This stuff keeps its viscosity and makes for a close, clean shave.</li>
            <li> Almost exploded out of the can when I first  used it. Have not used wet/dry shaver in wet mode and consequently the product listed here after that experience.</li>
            <li> Just like the other members of this product family, I love it.  Perhaps the only shaving gel that does NOT stick to your hands.  It is soft, stays well on the face, cleans quickly off the blade, and rinses clean.</li>
            <li> awesome pantry filler item straight from Amazon w/ no extra trip to the supermarket needed!</li>
            <li> Classic shaving gel! :) I like Nivea!!</li>
            <li> This gel works fine in general, but there are usually some harder &amp;#34;clumps&amp;#34; within the amount it dispenses so the application is not entirely even. This did not happen with any other gel/foam I&#x27;ve tried, so I probably won&#x27;t use this again.</li>
            <li> Garbage. If you&#x27;re smart, you are already using ProGlide (NOT regular Fusion). Razor bumps galore with this rubbish.</li>
            <li> Lets keep this one simple:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good price.&lt;br /&gt;Gel turns into a very thick foam.&lt;br /&gt;Smell is not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;Close Shave.&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention, good price!</li>
            <li> The shaving gel is surprisingly like the old shaving cream.  It is not bad, however for the money I still prefer Shick Hydro or even better, Target Gel with Lanolin.  The latter is definitely the best value.</li>
            <li> I was able to use this product twice.  The gel is good for sensitive skin, I think.  However, after the second use the dispenser apparently clogged. I soaked it in warm, then hot water, disassembled the head and tried to run water through it. Nothing worked.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a clog or if the gas escaped or what.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s return policy only says they don&#x27;t accept back aerosol products.  So, I guess I get to eat the price and the shipping.  Next time I go to Rite Aid or buy from a web site that backs the products it sells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five months later:&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know who sent it, but I complained to Nivea and Amazon and they sent a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;It has worked well.  A little gel goes a long way.  I am upgrading from one to four stars with a bit of reservation because of the initially bad experience that seems to be due to the product.  From the other reviews I saw, other people didn&#x27;t have the problem I did with my first can of this stuff.  After all, if you can&#x27;t get it out of the can, you can&#x27;t use it to shave.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for and worked exactly as described. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> A great no-frills product. Razor glides great, not heavily scented, bottom of the canister doesn&#x27;t leave rust rings. And your lady can use it for her legs, too. Quality product.</li>
            <li> Insanely good shaving gel!</li>
            <li> Very good shaving gel! Once i started using this gel i stopped bleeding as much when shaving and i also got a closer cut!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, that is sensitive to touch and to certain chemicals. This shaving gel is great, because its light on my skin, and doesnt smell strongly, it also makes my shave a lot smoother, and faster.</li>
            <li> Better than other shaving creams I have used in the past.  And this was a great price.</li>
            <li> I shave with a straight razor most of the time. I have  for several years used a brush and may of the expensive creams such as Taylors....straight razors are a unique skill in getting the blade properly sharpened and also having a good prep..cuts scan happen easily if you are inattantive or have poor prep.......but they give a great shave if you use the right technique..... I tried this on a whim because I also had good luck with neutrogena Gel..well the results were outstanding far better glide and protection than taylors..  yielding a smooth and irritation free shave ..one of the closest I have been able to get..I will retire the taylors at 15+ a tub and go with this for less than 3 bucks on sale...amazing dont listen to the snobby brush and blade crowd this stuff works..plus this has alchohol free with witch hazel...which is an astringent and is great for the skin..dont hesitate.......</li>
            <li> this product I bought for my husband and me. It prepare our skin to shave very gently.  I am happy to have it .thanks</li>
            <li> Great price, super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> my favorite, great on my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Great product, very smooth. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Plenty of foam for beard to soften and shave with razor. When you push the valve it does come out a lot.</li>
            <li> Good shaving gel. It keeps my skin from being irritated. A little goes a long way. This bottle seems to last forever on using it for weekly shaving. Feel clean and fresh after shaving and washing face.</li>
            <li> Great shaving cream for my sensitive skin. Less irritation after a shev now and rinses from the razor well also.</li>
            <li> better than all the other brands hands down, and the smell is nice too! no more gillette, this is all i will ever use!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this works great.  Easy to shave - great lather - cheap price and less than Target or Walmart.  With free shipping it saves me a trip and shows up in 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, for someone with sensitive skin, this is the product to buy and the organic versions just don&#x27;t lather.</li>
            <li> I use this to shave my head and because it&#x27;s so thick (the gel not my head) I barely ever cut myself anymore. I love it. This is one of those products you discover and hope they never stop making it because it&#x27;s exactly what you&#x27;ve been looking for your whole life. I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys not bleeding after a shave.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I are always trying to find good products that are not tested on animals and this one is it!  It was $3.17 a bottle, so I ordered 4.  My boyfriend has very sensitive skin and he says that it doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin at all or dry it out.  He recommends it!</li>
            <li> i like it, however, my wife stole it for her legs in the shower.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this gel for a long time, and always liked it. Its just a little bit smoother on your face than the regular stuff, but that can make a big difference sometimes.</li>
            <li> Great shaving cream. I just need a spot of gel only the size of a dime and it lathers up my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> Fair deal, nice to get this delivered at home rather than having to run our to get a can of shaving cream when I need one.</li>
            <li> Opened the box and found foam covering everything. The can and the rest of the items I ordered were just thrown loosely in a box and apparently the can exploded during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not so much upset about the $3 can of shaving cream as I was about the fact that it ruined the other stuff I ordered.&lt;br /&gt;This is an item sold and shipped by Amazon...very irresponsible of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, what little shaving gel was left in the can, I salvaged before I threw out, and it was quite good shaving gel. Expands and foams very thick, leaves your skin feeling noticeably moisturized and smelling very clean.</li>
            <li> Smooth feeling last longer than other brands I have tried, will buy it again on Amazon. Great price indeed WOW</li>
            <li> Very creamy but not great fragrance. Would stick with Barbasol.&lt;br /&gt;Nice bottle and ejection system but m&lt;br /&gt;Would not get again.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer foam products but this gel changed my mind. It works great for sensitive skin/ like the fact there is lil to no fragrance added (whatever it is, can be described mild, non-irritating to your olfactory senses). Works like charm with gillette fusion. Probably would purchase again on amazon deal.</li>
            <li> Great product, does not irritate skin and smells well too. Very little amount of product is sufficient for a complete shave. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband tried a sample of this and was shocked at how it really was different from other products!  It&#x27;s his new standard brand to use.</li>
            <li> Nivea for Men products are consistently high quality in my experience. This shaving cream is no exception. My skin is tough enough to use soap for a shaving lubricant so I really don&#x27;t care for brand names or fancy marketing gimmicks. I tried this because it was one of the cheapest shaving creams available locally and I had been using Nivea for Men after shave for years and loved it (no alcohol). Being a &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; version is just icing on the cake for me, not needed.</li>
            <li> This gel is clear and has very little (if any) scent.  It works much better than the Gillette gel I was using before.  Also, on many shaving gels, the gel will ooze out after dispensing, causing a gross buildup around the top.  This dispenser design doesn&#x27;t do that nearly as much, which is a welcome change.  Overall, this is a great product, and I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> so smooth!! great price!!</li>
            <li> I was expecting a gel all around, however once you spread it around it becomes a bit foamy. It feels really nice before and after shaving. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> This shaves much better than foam. Shaves much closer and easier to put on shaving area.</li>
            <li> I like this shaving cream. It&#x27;s smooth and feels great on the skin. The can is of great quality along with the cap.</li>
            <li> it give a smooth shave, don&#x27;t cause a rash.  I tested it on a used razor that I was about to throw away. Still no cuts.</li>
            <li> I used to use another brand that rhymes with &#x60;Jillette&#x27;. I used to get razor bumps occasionally. That all changed the day I met my first can of Nivea for men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:  I have used the regular one and this sensitive one of the Nivea creams. The best thing about this specific shaving cream is it moisturizes your face to the point where you can skip a day and use no cream and still no bumps! Even with a Mach 3 razor that is over a year old. Never using another shaving cream again. My wife even uses it to shave her legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell: It smells nice and manly. My wife likes how it makes her legs smell too, manly and strong?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend giving this a shot if you get razor bumps easily. Believe me, you will not use anything else after trying this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shop On!</li>
            <li> Nivea for Men Sensitive is the only brand I use for shaving, hair and products. Low odor, but still has a good manly scent. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and leaves me feeling clean. Every product from this line is great.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this.  I have a lot of allergies and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  It lubes better than Gillette too IMO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving my face with an electric razor for years, and I decided to start shaving my legs with an inline razor recently, so I bought some gel and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought the highest-rated shaving gel within my budget, and ended up with this.  The stuff is magic: what looks like it&#x27;ll be barely enough gel to cover a small patch of leg will often end up covering a full leg.  It lubricates well and I actually like it more than my electric now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely buy again, and I recommend you try it too: it&#x27;ll last a while, I&#x27;m certain of that.</li>
            <li> Just Started to use this one... Not bad at all... easy on face but alot of good options in market...&lt;br /&gt;See Clinique , its worth that price...</li>
            <li> As far as Shaving gel/cream/foams go, it&#x27;s good.  I thought I would give it a try, normally I like either shave oils (preferred) or cup/brush.  This became a nice gift for my sons, and they liked it very much</li>
            <li> Saw it one time on the shelf, tried it &amp; loved it since. Makes shaving easier unlike foamy creams.</li>
            <li> It is so better than the normal shaving cream. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> A little squirt goes a long way I honestly believe this is better then the foam brands I normally use when I use foam I use a lot and waste a lot this stuff I can squeeze a little out and I hardly let any go down the sink. It might be a couple more bucks the the bigger oz cans of foam but will last longer most like and waste less wish I would of found this before will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the Aveeno brand next. The canister does not rust which is important to me as I shave in the shower. However, when the can is full, very difficult to contain or control the nozzle output and I end up with much more shaving cream than needed.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaving cream. It does it&#x27;s job perfectly leaving my face feel silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;When you first pump it out it comes out as a lotion-like cream but when you rub it with your hand, it turns into a nice foamy cream.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a Harry&#x27;s blade kit.  And after more than 10 years of not using any foam or lotion I found the lubrication that they give to be amazing (I&#x27;ve been a shower shaver for years).  Harry&#x27;s shaving lotion is $8 a bottle and I thought that was ridiculous, so I have this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not good enough........not by far.  The only reason it gets 3 stars for average is because of the price.  It does not provide adequate lubrication while shaving and all the foam it creates just makes it so you have to rise the blade constantly.  After shaving with the same blade as yesterday and the only difference being this gel I have a nasty razor burn all through my face.  If your used to it.... it might be great for you..... but I&#x27;ll take the hit to my wallet and by a better lotion</li>
            <li> Works well with no burn or iratation afterward. Use good oil afterward. Let soak in for 2 minutes on warm clean wet beard.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this product and I love his clean shave! Long lasting and good product. I recommend it to anybody!</li>
            <li> This shaving gel is okay. I bought it from Amazon when it was on sale for about a buck. It&#x27;s well worth a dollar, but I wouldn&#x27;t pay most store&#x27;s asking price ($3+) for it. Most of these gels are similar and provide similar shaves. A good shave soap provides a much better shave with less irritation!</li>
            <li> It is really good shaving gel. I love it</li>
            <li> For Christmas I received a Braun Series 7 799CC-AWD shaver.  This electric shaver is designed for use in the shower.  After doing quite a bit of online reading, I found that many people are using shaving cream with these electric shavers.  Please note that using shaving cream with an electric shaver is different than using shaving cream with a blade.  You don&#x27;t want as much foam with an electric shaver.  Some are even oils instead of creams.  I spent some time researching which shaving creams and gels to try and settled on the following.  I tried them all out for several months.  Here are my findings based on shaving with my electric shaver with my skin.  You may have different results if you use a different shaver or if your skin is more or less sensitive.  Many of these findings are subjective (like smell).  I have ranked them starting with the worst, Bold for Men and finished with the best, Kiss My Face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bold for Men:  http://www.amazon.com/Bold-For-Men-Dry-Shave/dp/B000OZZH18/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390669335&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;bold+for+men+shave+gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  4 min. 58 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  1 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  1 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  5 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  2 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  1 out of 5  (very raw, 3 nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  Dead last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaving gel is described as a dry shaving gel.  I used it in the shower on my damp face without any water.  I don&#x27;t think this impeded its usage at all.  I selected it to test because of the favorable reviews for using it, including reviewers who used it in the shower.  While this smelled a little better than the Alphagel, I thought this gel produced worse results.  My skin was more irritated by the end of a week of usage; I had three nicks on the last day (only 1 for the Alphagel); and it left my face feeling really rawafter shaving.  After I was done shaving and I washed the gel off of my face, I found it made my face feel really hot.  This is not a good thing.  The Alphagel left it feeling more smooth and cool.  I did like how this gel didn&#x27;t foam at all.  You could easily see your skin and hair stubble.  It was also a little faster shaving with this than the Alphagel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington Alphagel Sensitive Skin:  http://www.amazon.com/Remington-Shaves-Alphagel-Sensitive-Shave/dp/B005ACNPLO/ref&#x3D;sr_1_15?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1390068105&amp;sr&#x3D;8-15&amp;keywords&#x3D;alpha+gel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  6 min. 16 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  4 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  1 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  3 out of 5  (felt raw but pretty smooth and 1 nick)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  5th overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I found this shaving gel to have the worst smell of any that I tried.  It smells like those pucks you find in dirty highway gas station urinals.  My wife thought my face didn&#x27;t smell bad afterwards, but when I had her smell the gel from the tube, she said, &amp;#34;Oh my god, that is awful!&amp;#34;.  The best thing about this gel is that it doesn&#x27;t foam much at all.  After shaving with it for a week my skin became irritated and started to bleed in a couple of places.  Lubrication was poor during shaving too.  It just wasn&#x27;t think enough to lubricate very well.  I had a lot of trouble getting it to shave closely, which is why it took so long to shave with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eshu Shave Gel:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SOMEG2/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  5 min. 21 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  2 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  3 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  3 out5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  2 out of 5  (raw, 2 nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  4th Overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a noticeable improvement between the last shaving gel and this one.  Eshu lubricated my face better and felt like it was more soothing after shaving.  It does have an odor that I don&#x27;t care for but it wasn&#x27;t anywhere near as bad as the Alphagel.  It comes out as an oil but does foam up as you shave with it.  The foaminess isn&#x27;t so excessive that I would discourage people from not using it with an electric razor.  Overall, not a bad shave, but I did notice that by the end of the week my face was feeling raw and I definitely needed a day or two for it to recover before shaving again.  One of the few things I liked about the Alphagel was that it left my face feeling cool instead of raw like the Eshu.  Again the Eshu was faster to shave with than the Bold for Men or the Alphagel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bull Dog Original Shave Gel:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004IX45FQ/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  7 min. 22 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  3 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  2 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  3 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  3rd Overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bull dog represented a major step up from the last shave gel (the Eshu).  It was much thicker than any of the lower rated gels I tested.  This was both good and bad.  It provided better lubrication, but was also foamier.  This meant it took longer to shave and longer to clean my razor afterwards.  Bull Dog had about as much foam as I would be willing to put up with and still use with an electric razor.  My face felt only mildly irritated after each shave (barely noticeable) and my skin was in much better condition by the end of the week.  No nicks all week.  The odor was better than the lower rated gels but still wasn&#x27;t something desirable.  Tolerable would be a better description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea for Men, Sensitive Shaving Gel: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BIL9HZE/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  6 min. 48 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  4 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  1 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  2rd Overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea for men was the second best gel I tried.  It has many positives.  You only need a small amount for it to work; it is thick enough to protect my skin well (meaning my face felt good after a shave instead of raw); and I got a reasonably close shave from it.  There are a few negatives however.  It had was the foamiest of any of the gels I tried.  It took a little more time to clean my razor afterwards.  It has a pleasant, perfumey scent, but it is rather strong.  I would have preferred that it didn&#x27;t have a scent at all or if it had to have one, that it was more mild.  At least it didn&#x27;t smell like a dingy bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kiss My Face Moisture Shave, Fragrance Free:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DU1Q4W/ref&#x3D;wms_ohs_product?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to Shave:  4 min. 12 sec.&lt;br /&gt;Closeness of Shave:  5 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Irritation:  5 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Lubrication:  5 out of 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Foaminess:  5 out of 5 (Higher means less foam)&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  4 out 5 (Higher is better)&lt;br /&gt;Feel of Face After Use  4 out of 5  (smooth, little abrasion, no nicks)&lt;br /&gt;Subjectives:  1st Overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my favorite of the shaving gels I tried.  While it didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling cool like the Alphagel, it was the least irritating and my facefelt better after shaving than with any other product.  It comes out of the tube as a cream consistency.  It may have been the thickest of the gels, but wasn&#x27;t so thick to create a problem.  This is probably why it lubricated my face so well and left it feeling less irritation.  It doesn&#x27;t take much to shave with it.  It is probably one of the most cost effective due to this.  The smell was the least objectionable of any of the six that I tried.  While described as fragrance free, there was a very slight plastic smell that I could only smell if I stuck it right up to my nose and sniffed heavily.  While shaving I didn&#x27;t notice an odor.  This gel also was the fastest to shave with and also gave me the closest shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I had tried all of these for several months I also tried the Kiss My Face Moisture Shave Cool Mint.  It has a mint scent to it.  I didn&#x27;t notice any cooling effect and after shaving and getting dressed, my wife didn&#x27;t notice any mint smell at all.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin,close shave with no irritation</li>
            <li> I think this shaving cream is a steal at current price. With just a small dab you get plenty of thick cream lather that is great for sensitive skin as this formula does not use alcohol. The scent is clean and the shaving experience is smooth. I get the best result with a DE safety razor. Designed and formulated in Germany but made in Thailand according to label.</li>
            <li> this is the brand I have been using for years</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff. .  Does what its supposed to do. Very good for sensitive skin ridiculous good price. will likely continue to subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I can understand why this is a top selling shaving gel. I normally use a shaving brush and shaving soap but sometimes I&#x27;m in a hurry so I&#x27;ll use this with my badger brush. It gives a terrific lather, has a nice refreshing smell, and helps me get a consistently smooth shave with my double edged razor.</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Lathers well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Good value.</li>
            <li> i was surprised to see it without a cap when it was shipped.... i would not have realised it, but i checked at a local store to find that it has a cap... nothing wrong with a product though but i had a brief doubt that it might have been a used product.... i am sure its not,,, just like a shirt which has been unwrapped with all its pins removed... might still be new,,, but someone might have tried it before....</li>
            <li> This Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel made my skin feel more smooth than [[ASIN:B005FNVINA Barbasol Original Thick and Rich Cream Men Shaving Cream, 10 Ounce]]. But the smell is why I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars out of 5. Like some of the other reviewers said, it comes out thick. It gets the job done though.</li>
            <li> I get acne so I decided to try this non-comedogenic shaving gel.  I&#x27;m not sure if it works because acne has many causes.  Nevertheless, given the low price, I will continue to use non-comedogenic products to be on the safe side.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommended. Use it along with a Gillette Turbo razor and it will provide you with the closest shave ever.</li>
            <li> This gel gives a very nice very close shave. I love the shave, but you can almost break your fingers pressing the top waiting for the stuff to start coming out of it. Its a big turn off to get started with a new product that a person is unfamiliar with in that way, having to worry if I was delivered a non operating can of shaving gel. I like the shave, but the dispensing problem has not gone away, and I will probably not by this product again.</li>
            <li> it is a little difficult to get the right amount of gel. Either nothing comes out or you get too much for a small shave. The gel itself gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Great shaving gel that lathers up immediately, and allows for a wonderful shave with a razor by Harry&#x27;s. Only criticism is that there is not a small travel size.</li>
            <li> This Shaving Gel is very good for the price. Odered it the second time for my husband, but if I&#x27;m out of my gel, I usually steal this one for myself. Love it.</li>
            <li> This product is outstanding.  The formula does not negatively affect my sensitive skin.  The gel is rich and it lathers nicely.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of sensitive skin gels/foams and this one beats them by far.  I will not purchase anything but this in the future.</li>
            <li> Need to shave your face? Want to feel smooth and wonderful? This shaving gel is awesome. I would purchase it every time. I&#x27;m old-fashioned that way.</li>
            <li> Very nice. Smooth. Lathers well. When new/full the gel squirts out VERY fast, but that&#x27;s fine. It doesn&#x27;t leave anything when washed off. The scent is mild, but nice.</li>
            <li> For $3 there is no better shaving gel, I&#x27;m not sure you can pay more and get anything significantly better than this either. Everything positive about this gel written here in the reviews are true. Its smooth, gives a comfortable shave, finish feels good after the shave, nice smell and uses a pea-sized amount for lots of foam. Just be careful notto press the button or actuator too hard as its pressured and a slight press is enough for a decent amount.     Nothing more to add really, just an excellent product from Nivea!    FYI I use it with electric shavers (for wet use), [[ASIN:B005DKKBP6 Panasonic ES-LV81-K Arc5 ]] and [[ASIN:B004UQ6Q62 Braun 3Series 340S-4 Wet &amp; Dry Shaver]].</li>
            <li> As I grew older I gradually noticed that the shaving gels I had been using for decades just didn&#x27;t seem to do it anymore. I must have tried almost every shaving gel, cream, oil I could find, and some were better than others. Then I tried Nivea Shaving Gel, and WOW, it&#x27;s smooth, doesn&#x27;t irritate, leaves the skin soft, and the razor just seems to glide over my face. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> nice product. Will rebuy or reorder.</li>
            <li> Great Product use this for a great shave a must have.</li>
            <li> Good texture and consistency.</li>
            <li> Perfect for close shave.  I changed over from Edge products because the price of this always is on special.  One bottle last a very long time in my opinion.  I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> If you shave your head (which I do), then this is the only shaving cream to use.  I don&#x27;t know why it is but this is the only shaving cream that doesn&#x27;t clog up a 3 or 4 blade razor.  It rinses right out and makes shaving a lot easier.  Nice on the skin too.</li>
            <li> NIVEA shaving gel for sensitive skin does everything it claims to do! It comes out like a gel then spreads into a cream when applied to your body. It lathers well, smells good (but not overpowering), and does not dry out your skin. 5 stars</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way....lathers great!</li>
            <li> My husband is not a product man but this shave cream had him raving about how nice it is on his skin and how much better than the big box stuff he bought before. I bought more so he would have a good supply.</li>
            <li> It is so difficult to use his shaving cream. just pressing it a little pours out so much gel, that is good for multiple times!&lt;br /&gt;After closing it, some froth will keep on leaking out of it, and it looks so unclean :(&lt;br /&gt;Did not feel that it was any special product compared to other shavings that i have used in past</li>
            <li> We are currently living overseas and while Nivea is available worldwide, no one come close to the US price.  This is a product we stock up on when we are back home.</li>
            <li> The package (sold by Amazon) arrived with the canister unusable beyond repair. The white plastic &amp;#34;trigger cap&amp;#34; on the top of the canister was broken into several different pieces and not attached to the canister itself. Underneath all this, the &amp;#34;tube&amp;#34; that pushes down into the canister to release the gel was loose and bent leaving me with no way to dispense the product manually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The internal packaging was a wad of brown paper. The canister was placed OUTSIDE of this wad, between it and the actual box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because this item is not allowed to be returned, I can not receive a refund (even though it&#x27;s three bucks- I&#x27;m going on principle here) for an issue that was created by Amazon&#x27;s packaging.</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve used. It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin. I&#x27;ve had problems with other shaving creams where it doesn&#x27;t provide enough moisture for my sensitive skin. This one is great.</li>
            <li> I always been ho-hum about shaving cream. As long as it worked I was happy. But I really liked this product. I originally purchased it because it was a lower cost item on Amazon, but I&#x27;ve noticed a smooth shave when using it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this more than shaving foam because it isn&#x27;t as bulky. The gel is has a nice, cooling texture that lathers with a mixture of water. It does have a tendency to clump on the nozzle and crust. It has built up over the months, but the gel does come out. It comes out with greater force to penetrate the built up crust. That is probably the only negative point I have with this product. Otherwise, try out a shaving gel if you hadn&#x27;t already.</li>
            <li> The nivea, 4 men sensitive shaving gel has to be the best thing since sliced bread. I shave every single day and use this and I never get any shaving cuts.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream feels smoother than other brands in my opinion. One huge difference between this and gillete shaving creams is that this can doesn&#x27;t rust. The two different gillete cans I&#x27;ve used rusted under the plastic nozzle, resulting in rust particles draining out of it if I ever clean off the top with water. This one has no issues. Feels great, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> didnt like it and its gas disppeared after a few uses and nothing came out. threw it out</li>
            <li> Gel shoots out and does not spread as easily as other products, but I have been using it for over a month now and have not nicked myself once, so it really works.  No scent.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to control the release of shaving creme. Invariably too much comes out. It is wasteful and messy. The shave seems OK.</li>
            <li> I am writing this for those who, like myself, have discovered ( or perhaps re-discovered) the pleasantness of old school &#x27;wet shaving&#x27; using a solid, heft steel razor and a double edge blade.... or for those who dare, the &#x27;cut-throat&#x27; straight razor.  The few minutes of that masculine ritual, done properly, allow a gentleman ten to fifteen minutes of enjoyable, private time and turn what was once drudgery into a moment of relaxation.  Now I have used almost every brand among the &#x27;high style&#x27; shaving creams. I don&#x27;t use the shaving soaps as they dry my skin too much. But I have tried the various creams from England, Germany, Scotland, and so on, ranging in price from nine to twenty five dollars per jar, or tub. And although the purists may brand me a heretic for saying so, in all honesty this product gives a superior shave. I put a small glob of this into the center of my very wet, warm shaving brush and with only a few drops of water, whip this into a thick, smooth cream in my mug and thence onto my face. This gives a smoother, more comfortable shave than ANY of my expensive creams, does not over dry my skin and with three traditional passes ( with the grain, across and finally against ) gives me a smooth, nick free finish. Of course as with any wet shave, I DO apply an after shave balm to keep the skin supple. But if you are a wet shaver, do yourself a favor and try this. I guarantee you, you will not go back to your expensive creams after using this. It is outstanding.</li>
            <li> Best shave gel I ever used. I have sensitive skin and must shave almost everyday and still no bumps with this one.</li>
            <li> Works well, but nothing too special.  I like the scent and it gives me a good, smooth shave</li>
            <li> Helps with making the shave smoother, and feels nice on the skin. The cream is thick once you lather it up a bit against your beard/mustache or in your palm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a kind of menthol-like burn on the skin. It&#x27;s light, but still there. I suggest that if you use this, shave with lukewarm water or cooler. Any hotter and you&#x27;ll likely end up with irritated skin. As for how much to use, you don&#x27;t really need that much unless you really like to lather it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on a budget and need a shaving cream for sensitive skin, give this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness&lt;br /&gt;This product does pretty well. I generally just need shaving cream to help make the shave smoother and this does what it claims it will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent&lt;br /&gt;There is a light scent, but it won&#x27;t interfere with any scented aftershave splash/balm/lotion you want to use. I personally don&#x27;t like having scented shaving cream but even though this product is not unscented, it&#x27;s not so much so that it would bother me.</li>
            <li> Bought this based of the recommendations of everyone on here.  I used to buy the cheap stuff but am now a lifer with this shaving gel.  You don&#x27;t need to use much, fyi!</li>
            <li> My grandson has sensitive skin and loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> Great stuff - works really well and very comfortable for shaving.  A+ - recommend, like this better than more expensive other shaving gels I was using.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, but to be honest I really dont see much of a difference between this and other products. I bought it because it was the cheapest one I could find online and I saw a TV Commercial about it.</li>
            <li> love this product  always have&lt;br /&gt;after shave problems my reserched&lt;br /&gt;found this  sensitive gel  very happy&lt;br /&gt;will continue to use and recommend</li>
            <li> I love the smell, very handsome and I got it for my boyfriend so it was perfect. It works well for shaving so he and I are both happy</li>
            <li> This is the best gel i&#x27;ve had. I had a bottle of Dove shaving gel and it was surprisingly thin and watery, which made it useless. I threw it away after the second use. I also had a bottle of Edge shaving gel, but it had a strong fragrance, and it was mediocre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel gives an incredible lather. A little goes a long way. It doesn&#x27;t smell too strong, the bottle looks good without obnoxious loud colors. And your skin feels smooth and not dry afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy anything else now.</li>
            <li> gives good comfortable shave... its a little difficult to start foam ejection without causing much excessive emission and waste.</li>
            <li> The most helpful critical review is right.  On my can, I need to really press hard on the top, then too much comes out.  I notice nothing superior in it&#x27;s performance, but it&#x27;s going to last half as long as my last brand, and cost considerably more.</li>
            <li> Caution no returns and is an average product that can be purchased less expensively at Walgreen.</li>
            <li> good lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;seems like a superior shaving product&lt;br /&gt;my new everyday shave cream</li>
            <li> Nivea Sensitive Shaving Gel is perfect for me.  I only have to use a small amount each use so the bottle lasts a long time.  The gel also does what it promises in that my face doesn&#x27;t get irritated or dry.  Will continue to purchase. P.S.- I purchased this directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My husband love&#x27;s this shaving gel.</li>
            <li> Best shaving gel I have come across, works well, reasonably priced and no negatives.6 more words added to make review work.</li>
            <li> I am loving this product.  I only wish that every time i pressed it, i wouldn&#x27;t get insane amount of product.  Part of me thinks that this is on purpose to make you run out quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a review for the product.  I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of shaving methods (including DE shaving), products (many different blades and cartridges), and creams to deal with the sensitive skin on my neck.  I used to get razor burn and bumps on my neck every time I shaved.  But the solution for me has been a Gillette ProGlide razor (manual, NO &amp;#34;FlexBall&amp;#34;) with Nivea Sensitive Shave Gel and Post Shave Balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a very slight fragrance to this product (a little sweet and flowery-smelling), but it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  It lathers very well, it&#x27;s slick, and it&#x27;s paraben-free.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using Nivea products for decades and this shaving gel is such a great product. It really foams well and does the trick right. Also very important, with other foams my skin was starting to dry out, but not with this Sensitive Shaving Gel. I know Shaving Gel is a bit of personal taste and feelings, but I would recommend this product in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this is the only shaving gel I&#x27;m willing to use.  Works well in the shower as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  idk that I&#x27;d be willing to pay full, regular price, but for the sale price, it is wonderful.  Lasts a long time and allows for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I had never used this brand before but besides how effective it is with a razor, the number of shaves I get is better than any gel I have used before. This makes Nivea shaving gel not just an outstanding product but also a great value.</li>
            <li> Works better than gillette and is half the price.</li>
            <li> I love this shaving gel!  It&#x27;s the only one on the market that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this to aid in the shaving of my gentials. Works great. I use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for a long time now, and I never cut myself.  However, of course it&#x27;s also the razor.</li>
            <li> Good smell. Nice lather. Great shave!</li>
            <li> Well what can I say - I shave semi-often about every 3 days or so and I bought this in February and its July and I still have gel left - It spreads on and lathers thick and provides good protection for the shave of which I use a single blade razor - No bad smells , lasts a long time , does what is required that a plus in my book - Good Job Nivea</li>
            <li> I love this shaving gel, no more itching or redness, not an annoyingly strong essence and a little bit of gel goes a long way! great product, recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 cans and while I could have purchased them cheaper at my local store, the extra price was worth it. The shaving cream itself is the best I have ever used and refuse to use any other brands.</li>
            <li> I like this product as it gives a clean shave with nice foam. would like to recommend to friends and buy everytime</li>
            <li> My new favorite shaving cream.  Works really well.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Has worked great so far, no bumps with a decent razor ( I&#x27;ve been using the Bic semi-disposable orange one)</li>
            <li> More expensive than the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; ones but it still does the job well. I can&#x27;t say I feel a noticeable difference. All in all, performance is great, value is ok.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaving cream out there. And, it&#x27;s been the best since Aveeno reformulated their oatmeal gel, which is no longer very good. But this is awesome! I&#x27;ve tried about forty different shaving gels, looking for the best one, and believe me, this is it! It&#x27;s a very thick gel that turns into a gel-like foam. It&#x27;s so much thicker and better than Barbasol, that I was reluctant to say that the gel foams. It does, but still in a very thick way. That&#x27;s super important for shaving, since this thick foam holds in a lot of moisture, which makes it the perfect shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, it lasts for a long time. They cram a lot of this into a small container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this every day to shave with. It gives a very close shave without razorburn. It&#x27;s awesome, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and get a brush and apothecary mug, just like grandpa had when shaving was an art.</li>
            <li> Good comfortable shaving gel. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This shaving gel is a great product.  It feels good and somehow make me achieve a closer shave.  I wish it was cheaper so I can buy more :(</li>
            <li> as expected. smooth experience and value to money</li>
            <li> I used to use the gillette stuff which was fine. I like this a bit more. I like the smell. It&#x27;s a bit more soapy than the gillette stuff. Imagine lathering a dove soap bar really good, this is pretty much what you get when you lather this on your face, just thicker. I kept using it because I notice I&#x27;m less likely to cut my self and my skin just looks great afer using it.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shaving creams I&#x27;ve ever used! It leaves your face super smooth and soft. It doesn&#x27;t have that perfume smell, which is great. It&#x27;s really thick so it does a good job of helping prevent nick and cuts. I will definitely be purchasing it again. Overall great for sensitive skin and has a nice crisp clean smell!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Nivea</li>
            <li> Excellent for skin prone to razor burn.</li>
            <li> I tried their aftershave and liked it so much I tried this shaving cream as well.  It is far better that the Edge product I was using before!  After 1 shave I was back online getting more for when I ran out.</li>
            <li> The texture is great and the cream is rich. I just feel each press releases a bit more of the cream than needed.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> The cream provides great protection and improves razor performance.  I love how it leaves my face feeling softer and prevents any razor burn.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a Smooth shave, this is what you need.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin. This gel very rarely causes me problems.</li>
            <li> Has become my go-to for shaving.</li>
            <li> So much better than cheap no-name stuff from Walmart</li>
            <li> I just recently purchased  this Sensitive  I love that it is fragrance free That&#x27;s a big deal for me  being that my skin is extremely sensitive. It&#x27;s very difficult to find the perfect shaving cream. So when I used Nivea&#x27;s, I was estatic You only need to use a small amount because it foams up really well.I find it gives me a really clean shave; better than other brands. Leaving my skin feeling silky smooth I also like that the product is very affordable. Thank you for making such a great, skin-friendly shave gel!</li>
            <li> I get razor burn and ingrown hairs easily. With this shaving gel I&#x27;m never disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought a can of this several months ago after purchasing a new Gillette Fusion Pro Glide (non powered Razor). First time in almost 20 years of using a manual razor, not sure what was good so I purchased this and a can of Gillette Fusion Proglide Soothing Shave Gel., the Gillette can sits full on my bathroom vanity while the Nivea can is almost empty. I have used both now and the clear winner is the Nivea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can tell it is a quality product the second you dispense it out of the can, it comes out looking clear but as soon as you apply it to your face it lathers up. You dont have to use a lot either, unlike the Gillette Fusion gel, perhaps a quarters size amount lathers up your entire face. Like a lot of Nivea after shaving products it feels great on your face cool and I think it may even be moisturizing your face as well cause after I shave I dont have the typical razor burn or a need for any moisturizing products (Contains vitamin E &amp; natural Chamomile).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is under pressure in the can and what I mean by that is there is no need to shake the can prior to dispensing, in fact, if you shake the can you feel nothing moving inside the can itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dispensing the gel from the can is very smooth, lightly press down on the top actuator and you can control the amount of gel the comes out (takes some practice). In contrast, the Gillette gel shot out of the can and I wasted 3/4 of what landed in the palm of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, there is light fragrance to the gel, I guess the best way to describe it is a fresh scent that is not overpowering at all especially first thing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> great product, reliably good and repeat buyer</li>
            <li> Nivea shave cream is an excellent product for people with sensitive skin type.  It helps prevent rash and skin irritation with its soft creamy texture and allows a clean shave without problems.  HIghly recommend if you have had shave problems before.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than the store and again I don&#x27;t have to wait at in a line to get it. I can only use this shaving cream without irritation.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shaving cream&#x27;s I&#x27;ve ever used, and my husband agrees. We used to get Edge shaving cream, and the difference between that and Nivea is like night and day.  I was having issues with eczema in my underarms, and all other shaving creams caused burning and discomfort when I tried to use them.  This is the only one that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and actually feels like it&#x27;s helping moisturize and protect during the process of shaving.</li>
            <li> Got this for my exboyfriend. I used it a couple of times. It smells really good. And it&#x27;s good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Best shaving cream for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, good product.</li>
            <li> I liked Nivea better than the Edge I was using.  Smoother richer lather.  I am getting a better shave.</li>
            <li> This shaving gel works exactly as advertised and is great for sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent either</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers stated, I haven&#x27;t ever used shaving gel like this. Which is actually a good thing. Great for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> this stuff is great. I was skeptical because for years i have been using gellete fusion gel. This is just as good and much cheaper. A little about me i use the proglide razor, i don&#x27;t like shave cream i do like the gel. I had to add on an item for free shipping and i picked this. I think it is great for the price.</li>
            <li> my husband didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> great product! recommended. good quality and design.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, very handsome and I got for my boyfriend so it is perfect. It works well for shaving so he and I are both happy.</li>
            <li> This was on sale for some low, low price (about $1 each for 2) so I tried it out. Better than Gillette. Will see if I reorder at the regular price when I run out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything special compared to other creams I&#x27;ve used. Cheap ass barbasol still last 9 years with one bottle and works great.</li>
            <li> Great product ! Love the smell.</li>
            <li> I always use this this. Love it</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with a coupon for $2.15. For that price, it&#x27;s well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a shaving snob, but a use a Edwin Jagger Double-Edged Safety Razor and brush. The gel itself has a clean, neutral scent. It&#x27;s not overpowering. My skin is not sensitive, but the shave quality is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review of four stars isn&#x27;t five, simply because I prefer a shaving cream as opposed to a gel, but if you like gels, this is a great product for a great price. Buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> I used a different nivea shaving cream in the past which was fantastic. Normally I didn&#x27;t notice a difference between shaving gels but that one was great. This one is just average.</li>
            <li> I usually go with the edge gel, but I saw that this one had some solid reviews and it was a few bucks cheaper so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Truth be told, I don&#x27;t think there is much of a difference. This one might be just a bit more on the lotion side with the edge gel being a little more on the foam side . . .  but the difference is super subtle if it&#x27;s there at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like shave gels, this is a good choice.</li>
            <li> I like this shaving get except it isn&#x27;t as soft feeling as others.  I use it and am trying others to find my &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the other Nivea shaving gels better.</li>
            <li> Used Gillette stuff for years made the switch its just as good if not better and lasts twice as long they just seem to fit more gel in the same sized bottle.</li>
            <li> Why am I leaving a review for shaving cream!  Ah!  But it is really nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.  Shave with it.  Go outside.</li>
            <li> Great for use with safety razors.</li>
            <li> it was shaving cream. I have had better and I have had worse.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not like Farrah Fawcett was in my bathroom and slathered it on my face. If that was the case, I&#x27;d give it 10 stars.&lt;br /&gt;For those of not old enough to remember the commercial with Farrah and Broadway Joe, go google it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to notice multiple issues with shaving creams. This has a good lather production, and has worked very well with my razor. I don&#x27;t necessarily note tremendous irritation to begin with, but I would say I have noticed a bit less irritation once using this product. As for the lather, it isn&#x27;t as much as foam from Barbasol cans, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting that from a gel. It produces a bit more then prior Gillete gels i&#x27;ve used and move away from due to cost.</li>
            <li> Great product and value.  A little bit goes along way.</li>
            <li> Nivea products are a staple in our house.  I have been using them since I was a teenager.  Many of their products, though great performing, are simply overpriced for store brands.  The Nivea Men Sensitive Shaving Gel is an exception.  This is a great bargain shaving gel that does a great clean shave without irritation or drying.  I have super sensitive skin and sometimes I have to cycle through products because my skin gets used to a pH and I have to move on.  This has been in my cabinet for about 5 years and works great.  One can will last the average male about a month, if he is a daily shaver.  I have used it wet shaving with a Schick Hydro blade and with a safety razor.  I recently decided to try it with an electric rotary shaver and it did a great job with that as well.  This is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Significantly better than the Gillette and other common brands.  I&#x27;m not quite sure how to describe it, except to say that it works very well and makes my skin feel very comfortable.</li>
            <li> excellent product as it appears on the page and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;more attentive to Cart</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  Super rich cream with superior rinsability.  If you&#x27;re looking for a change from the big names, I highly recommend Nivea.</li>
            <li> Wow. Excellent shave gel for price. I have used much more expensive, this is on par ay bargain price.</li>
            <li> The scent is too perfumy.. I would be better without fragrance.</li>
            <li> This product quickly turns from a gel into goopy fake and thick lather. Can&#x27;t see where I&#x27;m shaving. May cut off half my tash and goatee. Just don&#x27;t care for it. Will give it to my wife.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Smells great, sensitive in skin, lathers nicely and bottom of can doesn&#x27;t rust like the Gilette cans I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have used Edge gel for many years and was hesitant to change, but it was worth the change. This product is thick and I can use less and it moisturizes my face without causing pimples.</li>
            <li> I found my favorite Shaving Gel after trying this product. I do not have sensitive skin so the purchase of this item was more of &amp;#34;Why not for that price.&amp;#34; Glad I did.</li>
            <li> Rating says it all. Hope they keep making this! The best shave I felt in a while, Get it !</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and makes shaving so much easier. It leaves my skin smoother and well moisturized after shaving.</li>
            <li> love the smoothing effect during the shave. this product is a great companion for the manual razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good value for the price. The scent is REALLY strong, and it&#x27;s hard to wash off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised, I have used a much more expensive product for many many years and I think I like this better</li>
            <li> But I just had to, this stuff works GREAT, so smooth, I love it!  more words more words more words.</li>
            <li> a nice shaving cream for a reasonable price. don&#x27;t need to use much per shave as it spreads easily. shake well before use.</li>
            <li> Fantastic smell, works, really good price. Much better than the Edge and Barbasol competitors.</li>
            <li> The gel itself is great and makes for a smooth shave.  I downvoted this item because of the packaging. It has a hair trigger and you can easily overuse what you need and not just by a little.  One split second on the button can either leave you with nothing or a giant blob.  I suspect this was done to get you to use more product.  It is impossible for me to get the right amount without overdoing it so I waste about half the can down the drain.  Probably not an issue for ladies doing legs but a waste for the guys.</li>
            <li> Very good shave cream</li>
            <li> I really love this shaving cream, I find that it&#x27;s one of the better ones. Don&#x27;t need a whole lot to shave. Allows me to get a nice close shave. Will be buying again.</li>
            <li> My favorite shave gel. Worth the extra money. Great smell and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I got the Nivea Shaving Gel along with the Nivea Men Shaving Cream.  Both are good but I would say that the gel is better.  I like the thicker feel to the gel as it holds onto the skin nicely and feels great when shaving.  The Nivea Shaving Cream is just too thin so the blade doesn&#x27;t glide through facial hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent on both is very nice.</li>
            <li> i recently decided to try this shaving cream and i love it, for the price, it&#x27;s a great shaving cream, it&#x27;s the best i&#x27;ve used so far, it&#x27;s high quality and a you don&#x27;t have to use much for a close and comfortable shave, it&#x27;s thick and very smooth, but does not clog up your blade, it rinses clean, and leaves your skin feeling moisturized and great, it smells great also, i will be buying this again</li>
            <li> I have to shave daily for work, and I found that a lot of the other shaving creams/gels were too harsh on my skin. Over drying, irritation, and breakouts were common place before I tried Nivea. Delivery through S&amp;S is perfect, as I am sure I always have a can on hand. Typically lasts me about 1.5 months, shaving M-F.</li>
            <li> Well, it is a NIVEA product, the name explains it. I have been using US made shaving foams for a year or so (being realistic, not racist), but went back to my (g)old NIVEA shaving foam and was not disappointed. It is waaay better than the other brands, and has an excellent scent and even though only 7 ounces, it produces very much foam from its gel, and surely lasts much longer than other shaving foams or gels.&lt;br /&gt;AND the nice thing is that it comes in a great price!</li>
            <li> This Gel gets the job done and I like the shaving experience with it.  Not much of a fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of shaving creams in my lifetime. Many are like whipped cream. It took a little time to adjust to a gel because you use much less. A small amount lather your whole face and this stuff is great for sensitive skin. The price is the same as Walmart too.</li>
            <li> This works the best for my sensitive skin while shaving. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of the others but always come back to Nivea shaving cream.</li>
            <li> At least for me.&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy sensitive skin shaving cream, but this is the first time that I have bragged about it.&lt;br /&gt;As a lifelong sufferer of plaque psoriasis on my face, I have grown accustomed to seeing angry red marks on my face after shaving, bad enough that people thought I was having an allergic reaction. But those red marks are greatly reduced with Nivea for Men Sensitive Shaving Gel. I don&#x27;t know why, maybe it is the witch hazel in the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen some complaints about shaving bumbs. Don&#x27;t blame Nivea, blame your genetics and your razor blade.</li>
            <li> Excellent, very good buy. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is a unique product. I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen different creams and gels, including some mug soaps. This one feels different right out of the can. It&#x27;s DENSE; lots of protection. The scent is mild and simply smells \\&quot;clean\\&quot;; not musky, not citrusy, not flowery or feminine; just clean.</li>
            <li> my face reacts to some other types of shaving gels but this one works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the EDGE shaving gels for many years but it&#x27;s increasingly difficult to find ANYTHING that doesn&#x27;t have a ton of scent to it. Since I&#x27;m allergic to almost everything I only buy unscented products, my nose has gotten more sensitive over the years. I can smell the lotion from the hands of the barista who hands me my coffee on the cup etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this once using a 3 blade disposable razor but man o man I&#x27;m so happy with this. It&#x27;s very dense and under such pressure that a lot will dispense when you depress the button so squeeze carefully or you&#x27;ll get a lot more product than you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel is very smooth, no real scent to speak of, rinsed from my face without feeling like a film, but not leaving my skin dry from cetyl alcohol either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I clipped a $1 coupon and had this delivered to my door for $2.18. YAH $2.18! If I can figure out how to get that coupon again I would order right now. This is one of the better deals I&#x27;ve found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nivea Shaving Gel works well and minimizes after-dispensing &amp;#34;oozing&amp;#34; better than a competing make I had been using. I have no or minimal razor burn after using this gel.</li>
            <li> Great product for shaving. Lathers great, and goes on really smooth. Doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell.</li>
            <li> A little thicker than edge gel (which I&#x27;ve used for 30 years) - gives a very good shave - enough to get me to switch!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent shaving cream for those with sensitive skin of for those who want to treat themselves well. I an bout to start my second can and can highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and have often used much more expensive products to alleviate the razor burn and other discomfort.  This Nivea, so far, seems to be working as well as the much more expensive gels and the price was really low so I bought two cans.  I have not had any razor burn since starting this gel.</li>
            <li> I never thought that I would use anything so girly in my life, but I can’t argue with the results either.</li>
            <li> This my favorite shaving gel.  I have sensitive skin and shaving causes me problems with other products, not so with this one.  I have been using Nivea for a couple of years now and would not change to any other.</li>
            <li> Nivea For Men Sensitive Shaving Gel, 7-Ounce Canister&lt;br /&gt;My Step-Son suggested that I try this.  I had been using the more advertised brands up until then, boy was I surprised!  This was much, much better than anything that I had used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;It protected my skin better and gave me a cleaner shave.  I use a blade of course.  Lately I have been using the [[ASIN:B006DR2BO2 Schick Hydro 5 Power Select Razor]]  I  highly recommend both these products for those who want a close, clean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gunner  June, 2013</li>
            <li> i had been using Edge Sensitive formula for years but i noticed a change in my shave since Edge reformulated their product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after reading many reviews and having had excellent success with Nivea products in the past, i decided to try this shave gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;absofreaking love this shave gel. not perfumy. not smelly, heavy lather with just a small amount of product. i now get a great shave every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use my Gillette Fusion Proglide blades for around 30 shaves before discarding them. this gel shapes up my facial hair nicely and lets me get a near-new-blade shave every time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i highly recommend this product to anyone seeking a shave gel that doesn&#x27;t make you smell like a man-whore or a 13 year old boy using Axe to pick up 12 year old girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;manly, clean, excellent for sensitive skin and a high quality product. you&#x27;ll be hard-pressed to find something better at this price.</li>
            <li> This says it&#x27;s a men&#x27;s shaving gel, but I got it for my (female) legs as a prime add on for super cheap and it&#x27;s the best shaving gel I&#x27;ve used.  it does have a somewhat &#x27;manly&#x27; scent, but it doesn&#x27;t linger post shaving.  Or, if it does, no one is really sniffing my legs or pits anyway so I wouldn&#x27;t know.</li>
            <li> A great product. Better than all the other gels I have used before. Protects your sensitive skin but allows a close shave. Works perfect for me. A little gel goes a long way and best applied to a wet face. A can will last a long time. Smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> This is my third order&lt;br /&gt;I think that would speak volumes</li>
            <li> Great price for a good product. Close shave no razor burn.</li>
            <li> Good shaving cream. I have skin issues with others, this stuff works for me.</li>
            <li> Got hooked after my brother introduced me to gel Nivea brand. Love it. Creates a thin layer although configurable based on amount you use, works perfectly for my wet Panasonic shaver.</li>
            <li> I just recently picked three new shave creams/gels to compare against The Art of Shaving. Art of Shaving being the undisputed champion. Gillette Foamy Regular being the baseline of just acceptable.  Here is the breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing is the tool. I have tried the 4 blade Schick and the Mach3 and Fusion. I always return to my trusty Gillette Sensor3 Conditioning[green] disposable. Post shave I use Art of Shaving aftershave [Lemon or Sandalwood]. It runs about $30 a bottle which may seem high but I have been using the same two bottles for over two years. Two pumps is all you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The Art of Shaving is by far the best. It also costs the most. For the money spent it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. It goes on easy with a light coat. It shaves very well and leaves your face feeling soft and nourished from all the conditioners/essential oils it contains. Normally I would scoff at paying $25 for a six month tub of shaving cream [I shave about 3x a week]. But this stuff is really that damn good. It exceeds expectations and then some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Alba Very Emollient Shave Cream Coconut Lime - This is the next best thing to Art of Shaving. Excellent shave. Very good skin conditioners. The scent is really nice. Finish it off with Art of Shaving Lemon aftershave. And at a price that is 1/4 of Art of Shaving. This one is definitely worth a look. The only issue is that it has a mildly sticky feel to it and is difficult to rinse out of razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Nivea For Men delivers a nice shave. Feels smooth afterwards. It lathers a good amount which is good if you like that. I am now a low foam or no foam fan. It doesn&#x27;t leave your face as conditioned as the top two performers but does a better than average  job. When considering cost and performance this is a best bet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Kiss My Face Moisture Shave Bamboo Green Tea - This shave cream is not that much better than Gillette Foamy. Certainly not enough to justify the difference in cost. If you are looking for a fantastic shave you need to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - If you want Ferrarri performance you have to pay top dollar. Here is my car/shave cream  analogy:&lt;br /&gt;Ferrarri - Art of Shaving&lt;br /&gt;BMW/Audi - Very Emollient&lt;br /&gt;Honda - Nivea&lt;br /&gt;Chevrolet - Kiss My Face&lt;br /&gt;Pontiac - Gillette FoamyBottom line - If you want Ferrarri performance you have to pay top dollar. Here is my car/shave cream  analogy: Ferrarri - Art of Shaving BMW/Audi - Very Emollient Honda - Nivea Chevrolet - Kiss My Face Pontiac - Gillette Foamy</li>
            <li> The only shaving cream I use.</li>
            <li> Been using Gillette for decades and Nivea is so much smoother and leaves skin softer.</li>
            <li> Thick shaving cream that only requires a &amp;#34;dab&amp;#34; to get a nice clean shave. LOVE this stuff and i mean LOVE. I have been mistreating my face for years up until i decided to purchase this item. BY FAR THE BEST SHAVING CREAM I HAVE EVER USED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer for life unless something changes.</li>
            <li> Dispenser is bad because lots of shaving gel comes out .&lt;br /&gt;Gel quality is good . I have not seen any skin irritation , other bad symptoms with this .</li>
            <li> Husband really likes.</li>
            <li> i bought this as a present for my husband, he loves it</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels pretty good. It&#x27;s not as thick as the barbasol I am used to using, so I did nick myself a couple of times - the only reason its not a 5 star rating. Still on the whole, a good product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, the gel transforms into a thick lather. I tried this brand because Amazon was running a promo of a dollar off.&lt;br /&gt;I would rate this product the best shaving gel that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Very thick lather, but not the thickest, better than competitors</li>
            <li> Wonderful, creamy gel. I usually use shaving soap, but this is much better. Will continue to buy it for my shaving needs.</li>
            <li> This shaving gel performs well allowing for a close shave. It also has a pleasant subtle fragrance that is not obtrusive. I also like that it alcohol free.</li>
    </ol>
