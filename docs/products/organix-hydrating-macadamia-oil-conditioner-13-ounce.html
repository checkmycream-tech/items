    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It is still an excellent product however and I would recommend to anyone if asked.</li>
            <li>I color my hair and use curling irons so its not in the best condition.</li>
            <li>I must say I&#x27;m completely impressed with how well this conditioner went on and melted into my hair.  </li>
            <li>The softness and the shine was soo nice!!!</li>
            <li>For starters, it SMELLS REALLY GOOD!</li>
            <li>Great conditioner.</li>
            <li>It smells great.</li>
            <li>Absolutely Great.</li>
            <li>Argan Oil is good, but not as good as the Macadamia Oil.  </li>
            <li>do think that the Biotin and Collagen SHAMPOO has been good for my hair...</li>
            <li>The product smells good and there was no noticeable damage to my hair</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is actually good for your hair or not</li>
            <li>but I went with this one because it says it&#x27;s good for hydrating your hair</li>
            <li>SO HAPPY :)</li>
            <li>just works ok but smells great.</li>
            <li>My 3a hair seems to love this condish!</li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to buy!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>It is nearly as effective as coconut oil.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t run all over the place and it smells nice too.  </li>
            <li>It soaks into your hair and makes it much healthier feeling and smelling wonderful! :)</li>
            <li>It may be that this formula just doesn&#x27;t work well with the type of hair I have, since others have had great success with it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love the smell too.</li>
            <li>they aren&#x27;t that cheap!  :)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>This is probably one of my favorite conditioners that I have ever tried (I have tried a LOT).</li>
            <li>i find herbal essences hello hydration much better</li>
            <li>Make sure to rinse thoroughly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had Mane n Tail Herbal Gro before this, and it&#x27;s wonderful for my hair, so I&#x27;m going back to that brand.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>For the money there is bound to be something better.</li>
            <li>It looks and feel healthy</li>
            <li>I will try more products from Organix.</li>
            <li>me being the PJ that I am :)  </li>
            <li>My hair is in better condition than it ever has been.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve notice that my hair is snapping and breaking a lot more when brushing.</li>
            <li>Try this one if your looking for a more natural organic conditioner, the argan oil conditioner from them is also great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for co-washes without mixing in oils and it&#x27;s great for a nice deep condition.</li>
            <li>The best out of their all other shampoos and conditioners that OGX has.</li>
            <li>This leaves it SUPER soft and shiny, and it also smells SOOOOO good!</li>
            <li>It breaks easily.</li>
            <li>It is very lightly scented and smells fresh.  </li>
            <li>Free of scalp scales for a number of days.</li>
            <li>followed up with my moisturizing sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>This product leaves it feeling silky smooth, and keeps the curls in line.</li>
            <li>sulfate free.</li>
            <li>My hair is shinny and smooth but it also has zero body.</li>
            <li>This product adds moisture and shine, and protects the hair for a beautiful, healthy show shine and less breakage.</li>
            <li>More importantly, it HYDRATES really well!</li>
            <li>Great for dry and color treated hair.</li>
            <li>conditioner is nice and buttery and moisturized my hair very well at first.</li>
            <li>, thats the only conditioner that I really love &amp; worth every penny to be honest.</li>
            <li>: I think this conditioner works way better than the macadamia oil intense conditioning</li>
            <li>use this conditioner right after I bleach my hair</li>
            <li>I was so happy that I finally stopped listening  to others and finally did something i thought would work for me.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like the shampoo very much--</li>
            <li>But the best part is it leaves my hair soft and shiny, but not too soft that it weighs down my hair when I style it; if anything, it made my hair easier to style and curl!</li>
            <li>I love the macadamia oil intensive moisture mask as a deep conditioner on my transitioning 3c/4a hair, so I thought I&#x27;d try the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I purchased this at Target for $5.00 (that should have been my first clue).</li>
            <li>I have been using organix brand shampoo and conditioner exclusively for over a year now, generally using the tea tree oil and mint products with fantastic success.</li>
            <li>and since I&#x27;m on this new hair regimen where I cowash more frequently</li>
            <li>it was still soft!!!!</li>
            <li>keeps my hair super soft, got a compliment just today!</li>
            <li>My hair is SO much softer and has fewer tangles now.</li>
            <li>But i wanted to find something that i didn&#x27;t have to use to much of because i am doing the transition.</li>
            <li>Really compliments the shampoo.</li>
            <li>This in turn makes my conditioner run out much sooner than my shampoo.</li>
            <li>It dries out your hair so much that you have no choice but to use the conditioner in conjunction with</li>
            <li>its really done a number on my hair</li>
            <li>The conditioner&#x27;s smell is wonderfully light and fruity, but not overbearing, which was a definite plus!</li>
            <li>Personally, I like to alternate with Bed Head for men---which I think is a nice balance.</li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner are for me at least as good as a salon brand.  </li>
            <li>So when I got home I rinsed under warm water for a few minutes</li>
            <li>Overall, this is still a good product, but not a GREAT product like many others offered by the organix brand.</li>
            <li>Great stuff for African American hair which is naturally dry.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m a platinum blonde, so this happens a lot), and afterward I can comb right through it, its super soft after it dries</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner, leaves hair silky without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>but it certainly coats each strand leaving your hair very soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>This really makes my hair very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice thick conditioner</li>
            <li>My hair is thick, curly, and dry, and this conditioner is pretty good for that.</li>
            <li>And well....combing new growth and permed hair together damages it.</li>
            <li>This product seemed as if it would fit the bill - moisturizing oil, and a lovely scent - unfortunately this was not correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it very much but not on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>I bought this conditioner in September 2012, and all I can say is WOW!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>My curly new growth became so soft the comb just glided though my hair.</li>
            <li>It hydrates my curls so well and will keep getting it as long as the price is right.</li>
            <li>but i generally have soft hair since i maintain it very well.</li>
            <li>I am strictly sulfate free in my hair products and I read mixed reviews about the tendency of sulfonates to act like sulfates and dry out the hair.</li>
            <li>Rinses clean easily and not a ton of weird fragrance in it.  </li>
            <li>That kept my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair extremely soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>In addition to this, my hair felt difficult to work with, which is unusual for my naturally straight, relatively healthy hair.</li>
            <li>It did in fact leave my hair pretty dry.</li>
            <li>And of course, organic products to generally tend to be better, but I just wish the bottle was a little bigger.</li>
            <li>The first noticeable difference was the texture of the product - it seemed thin, and had a more oily feeling than expected, and as a result of this almost twice as much product was needed to fully coat the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>It made my hair very dry didn&#x27;t like it at all,  I need something to smooth out my hair not make it dry</li>
            <li>I only bought this because I was perusing through Target and looking to see if there were any new conditioners on the market,</li>
            <li>(I have very long, very thing hair and my hair will NOT hold a style for anything)</li>
            <li>Works very well, giving me soft hair with minimal frizz.  </li>
            <li>It is quite pricy for the small size but it is SO WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>The Havanese coat is extremely fine and delicate.</li>
            <li>Even the 2nd day i can just rinse my hair, no shampoo or conditioner, and it feels soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves quite a bit of buildup if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>My hair are very dry and frizzy and I have never found a product that used in such less quantity and for such a short while gave such amazing results.</li>
            <li>The only thing that really makes my dry wave hair feel like hair and not hay.</li>
            <li>However, due to the harsh dryness that accompanies winter, I decided to try a different product from the line to better protect and moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t work for me but other products from the OGX line is a regular purchase, such as shampoos and intense mask conditioners.</li>
            <li>When I use this line of products it leaves my hair incredibly soft even with using an organic macadamia oil to pre-condition my hair or dry my hair with.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m just so sick of this stuff, it&#x27;s good for people with naturally dry hair &amp; scalp, not good for people with a tendency to produce more oil.</li>
            <li>I live in a desert climate and its just impossible but this really helps more than any of the other scents</li>

            <li> When I use this line of products it leaves my hair incredibly soft even with using an organic macadamia oil to pre-condition my hair or dry my hair with.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m just so sick of this stuff, it&#x27;s good for people with naturally dry hair &amp; scalp, not good for people with a tendency to produce more oil.</li>
            <li> I live in a desert climate and its just impossible but this really helps more than any of the other scents</li>
            <li> The constant bleaching, the dyeing, the daily flat ironing and blow drying...</li>
            <li> BUT, it is not so soft that you can&#x27;t control it---as some other conditioners make it.  </li>
            <li> not too heavy, really helped my dry, static-y hair</li>
            <li> The shampoo on its own isn&#x27;t moisturizing at all, it just dried out my hair and made it so difficult to deal with.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been so long since I even thought about trying it that I forgot about it.  </li>
            <li> After my hair (air) dried it was admittedly shiny, but did not feel as moisturized as I expected, nor as moisturized as normal after use of the tea tree formula conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have medium curly hair and it can get dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> and then rinsed and my hair and wrapped it with my tshirt to dry for a while.  </li>
            <li> I started out liking it; it does work on my slight to moderately coarse, medium-length hair that requires a lot of nourishment.</li>
            <li> , which is way better than a bad hair day.</li>
            <li> I have to be careful to use the conditioner sparingly and keep it from my scalp</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had hair stylists tell me there&#x27;s not much I can do to fix it.  </li>
            <li> I use this along with the shampoo and it really sucks into my hair - goes on really thick and absorbs right into the hair.  </li>
            <li> OMG I&#x27;m so surprised at this conditioner, it&#x27;s unbelievable!</li>
            <li> With this conditioner, however, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Either it&#x27;s too moisturizing and leaves my hair greasy, or not moisturizing enough and leave my hair dry and hard to untangle.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use a lot of conditioner in order to feel like it&#x27;s penetrating my coarse hair.</li>
            <li> After rinsing, the bottle had a small sample of dry styling oil.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that using this conditioner makes my hair look oilier with less time in between washes.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t look or feel ANYTHING like the dead rubbery straw-like hair I have without it.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the \\&quot;miniscule\\&quot; amount complaints are, it&#x27;s 13oz.  </li>
            <li> I put my hair through so much abuse, it could put me in a treatment program. :(</li>
            <li> The product was also very difficult to rinse out completely.</li>
            <li> I find it hard to find conditioner that get along with my hair:</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to put in a pony tail!</li>
            <li> As time has gone on, I&#x27;ve gotten really annoyed with the macadamia</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of their other conditioners Sea Minerals &amp; Kukui Nut did not condition my hair, but made it drier :(&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a try but was disappointed with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> I hope this was not a one time thing because I&#x27;ll be very disappointed if it was</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an amazing product. It hydrates my curls so well and will keep getting it as long as the price is right.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, curly, and dry, and this conditioner is pretty good for that. And of course, organic products to generally tend to be better, but I just wish the bottle was a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner. My hair is SO much softer and has fewer tangles now. Even the 2nd day i can just rinse my hair, no shampoo or conditioner, and it feels soft. I love the smell too. SO HAPPY :)</li>
            <li> I am african american but i generally have soft hair since i maintain it very well. But i wanted to find something that i didn&#x27;t have to use to much of because i am doing the transition. And well....combing new growth and permed hair together damages it. So i brought this at my local supermarket and it did wonders. My curly new growth became so soft the comb just glided though my hair. I left the conditioner in for awhile just to feel the softness. After rinsing, the bottle had a small sample of dry styling oil. That kept my hair soft and shiny. I was so happy that I finally stopped listening  to others and finally did something i thought would work for me. I am now going to invest in this. It is quite pricy for the small size but it is SO WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> Great conditioner. Really compliments the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of their other conditioners Sea Minerals &amp; Kukui Nut did not condition my hair, but made it drier :(&lt;br /&gt;The Argan Oil is good, but not as good as the Macadamia Oil.  I&#x27;ve not tried anything else...they aren&#x27;t that cheap!  :)&lt;br /&gt;I do think that the Biotin and Collagen SHAMPOO has been good for my hair...not as frizzed/dry.</li>
            <li> not too heavy, really helped my dry, static-y hair</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. The best out of their all other shampoos and conditioners that OGX has. I&#x27;m trying to find this product in stores here in Tucson but I think it just discontinued cuz I can&#x27;t find it in any store which is suck, thats the only conditioner that I really love &amp; worth every penny to be honest.</li>
            <li> When I use this line of products it leaves my hair incredibly soft even with using an organic macadamia oil to pre-condition my hair or dry my hair with.  Great stuff for African American hair which is naturally dry.  Will definitely keep it around.  It is nearly as effective as coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my scalp psoriasis.  I leave in on my entire scalp, wrapping my scalp with a plastic bag. I shampoo several times to get the oil off.  The result?  Free of scalp scales for a number of days.</li>
            <li> I usually have to use a lot of conditioner in order to feel like it&#x27;s penetrating my coarse hair. This in turn makes my conditioner run out much sooner than my shampoo. With this conditioner, however, a little goes a long way. It leaves my hair extremely soft and manageable. Would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love the macadamia oil intensive moisture mask as a deep conditioner on my transitioning 3c/4a hair, so I thought I&#x27;d try the shampoo. I am strictly sulfate free in my hair products and I read mixed reviews about the tendency of sulfonates to act like sulfates and dry out the hair. I decided to give it a try but was disappointed with this shampoo. It did in fact leave my hair pretty dry. I only did one rinse with this product then followed up with my moisturizing sulfate free shampoo. The product smells good and there was no noticeable damage to my hair so I will probably use it again if I feel like my hair has a lot of product build up or something. But I will not be repurchasing this product.</li>
            <li> The only thing that really makes my dry wave hair feel like hair and not hay. I live in a desert climate and its just impossible but this really helps more than any of the other scents</li>
            <li> My hair are very dry and frizzy and I have never found a product that used in such less quantity and for such a short while gave such amazing results.</li>
            <li> keeps my hair super soft, got a compliment just today!</li>
            <li> This is probably one of my favorite conditioners that I have ever tried (I have tried a LOT). For starters, it SMELLS REALLY GOOD! More importantly, it HYDRATES really well! I can feel the oil in the conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling oily itself after use. It soaks into your hair and makes it much healthier feeling and smelling wonderful! :)</li>
            <li> just works ok but smells great. decided not to buy again. i find herbal essences hello hydration much better</li>
            <li> I tried the Macadamia oil shampoo &amp; conditioner because Brazilian Keratin therapy was out of stock at Target. There&#x27;s pros and cons to this variety. I started out liking it; it does work on my slight to moderately coarse, medium-length hair that requires a lot of nourishment. As time has gone on, I&#x27;ve gotten really annoyed with the macadamia oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the shampoo very much--every so often I like to just shampoo to remove buildup. The shampoo on its own isn&#x27;t moisturizing at all, it just dried out my hair and made it so difficult to deal with. It dries out your hair so much that you have no choice but to use the conditioner in conjunction with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is nice and buttery and moisturized my hair very well at first. I have to be careful to use the conditioner sparingly and keep it from my scalp--I wash my hair every 2 days, and by the time the second day rolls around, I&#x27;ve usually got pretty oily hair. It leaves quite a bit of buildup if you&#x27;re not careful. Make sure to rinse thoroughly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just so sick of this stuff, it&#x27;s good for people with naturally dry hair &amp; scalp, not good for people with a tendency to produce more oil. I&#x27;ve got about 1/3 left in the bottles, and I&#x27;m tempted to just get rid of it. I had Mane n Tail Herbal Gro before this, and it&#x27;s wonderful for my hair, so I&#x27;m going back to that brand.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me but other products from the OGX line is a regular purchase, such as shampoos and intense mask conditioners. It is still an excellent product however and I would recommend to anyone if asked. It is also a bonus that this company does not test on animals - which satisfies the animal activists that we all are in this household.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner in September 2012, and all I can say is WOW! It smells great. But the best part is it leaves my hair soft and shiny, but not too soft that it weighs down my hair when I style it; if anything, it made my hair easier to style and curl! (I have very long, very thing hair and my hair will NOT hold a style for anything) The bottle claims that the product has not been tested on animals, the packaging is made from recycled post-consumer resin, and it is made in the USA! What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is actually good for your hair or not but it certainly coats each strand leaving your hair very soft and shiny.  BUT, it is not so soft that you can&#x27;t control it---as some other conditioners make it.  It is very lightly scented and smells fresh.  I like it very much but not on a daily basis.  Personally, I like to alternate with Bed Head for men---which I think is a nice balance.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Great. I have medium curly hair and it can get dry and frizzy. This product leaves it feeling silky smooth, and keeps the curls in line.</li>
            <li> Purchased at the big red bullseye store.  Works very well, giving me soft hair with minimal frizz.  I&#x27;ve used the shampoo and intensive mask from this line as well.  Rinses clean easily and not a ton of weird fragrance in it.  The shampoo and conditioner are for me at least as good as a salon brand.  Not sure what the \\&quot;miniscule\\&quot; amount complaints are, it&#x27;s 13oz.  Not like they are sending it to you in an eyedropper.  I&#x27;m planning to keep using this for my daily routine.</li>
            <li> It made my hair very dry didn&#x27;t like it at all,  I need something to smooth out my hair not make it dry</li>
            <li> My 3a hair seems to love this condish! I find it hard to find conditioner that get along with my hair: Either it&#x27;s too moisturizing and leaves my hair greasy, or not moisturizing enough and leave my hair dry and hard to untangle. This leaves it SUPER soft and shiny, and it also smells SOOOOO good! I</li>
            <li> I wont be purchasing this product again. The amount is miniscule and the resuts are lackluster. For the money there is bound to be something better.</li>
            <li> I color my hair and use curling irons so its not in the best condition. I love this conditioner, leaves hair silky without weighing it down. Adds moister and softness. sulfate free. Try this one if your looking for a more natural organic conditioner, the argan oil conditioner from them is also great.</li>
            <li> I use this along with the shampoo and it really sucks into my hair - goes on really thick and absorbs right into the hair.  I love it and will continue to buy!</li>
            <li> I put my hair through so much abuse, it could put me in a treatment program. :( The constant bleaching, the dyeing, the daily flat ironing and blow drying... its really done a number on my hair and I&#x27;ve had hair stylists tell me there&#x27;s not much I can do to fix it.  :( I had all but given up hope, and then I tried OGX macadamia oil shampoo/conditioner! My hair is so silky it&#x27;s hard to put in a pony tail! --&amp;#62; &amp;#34;pretty girl dilemma&amp;#34;, which is way better than a bad hair day. 5 stars all the way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I think this conditioner works way better than the macadamia oil intense conditioning mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this conditioner right after I bleach my hair (I&#x27;m a platinum blonde, so this happens a lot), and afterward I can comb right through it, its super soft after it dries and it doesn&#x27;t look or feel ANYTHING like the dead rubbery straw-like hair I have without it.</li>
            <li> My hair has bounce and shine. It looks and feel healthy and I&#x27;m loving it. I will try more products from Organix.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this line out for a while, I initially wanted to try the biotin one but it&#x27;s been so long since I even thought about trying it that I forgot about it.  I only bought this because I was perusing through Target and looking to see if there were any new conditioners on the market, me being the PJ that I am :)  so anyway I saw this and remembered that I did want to try this line out and since I&#x27;m on this new hair regimen where I cowash more frequently I&#x27;ve been trying out different conditioners so I thought hey why not give this one a try.  They had this one and the argan oil one but I went with this one because it says it&#x27;s good for hydrating your hair which is what I need.  So when I got home I rinsed under warm water for a few minutes and then I began to apply this conditioner.  WOW! I must say I&#x27;m completely impressed with how well this conditioner went on and melted into my hair.  It&#x27;s a nice thick conditioner so it didn&#x27;t run all over the place and it smells nice too.  While applying I literally felt like and it looked like I was putting oil on my hair!  The softness and the shine was soo nice!!! I left it on for about 20 mins. and then rinsed and my hair and wrapped it with my tshirt to dry for a while.  When I unwrapped my hair it was still soft!!!! and shiny!!!!!!!  I hope this was not a one time thing because I&#x27;ll be very disappointed if it was but I will definitely be using this again and if the results change I will update my review but if not it will remain the same and I will be going to purchase the argan oil and the biotin one!!!! OMG I&#x27;m so surprised at this conditioner, it&#x27;s unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Great for dry and color treated hair. My hair is in better condition than it ever has been.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this at Target for $5.00 (that should have been my first clue). I have to use about a cup of the conditioner before my hair is saturated enough to run my fingers through. I&#x27;ve used this conditioner twice and I&#x27;ve notice that my hair is snapping and breaking a lot more when brushing. I can even feel strands snapping when I pull it up in a pony tail. My hair is shinny and smooth but it also has zero body. I will not purchase again. I&#x27;m going to see if I can return it.</li>
            <li> I have been using organix brand shampoo and conditioner exclusively for over a year now, generally using the tea tree oil and mint products with fantastic success. However, due to the harsh dryness that accompanies winter, I decided to try a different product from the line to better protect and moisturize my hair. This product seemed as if it would fit the bill - moisturizing oil, and a lovely scent - unfortunately this was not correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my hair with the tea tree oil shampoo, I opened the conditioner and began to spread it in my hair. The conditioner&#x27;s smell is wonderfully light and fruity, but not overbearing, which was a definite plus! The first noticeable difference was the texture of the product - it seemed thin, and had a more oily feeling than expected, and as a result of this almost twice as much product was needed to fully coat the ends of my hair. The product was also very difficult to rinse out completely. After my hair (air) dried it was admittedly shiny, but did not feel as moisturized as I expected, nor as moisturized as normal after use of the tea tree formula conditioner. In addition to this, my hair felt difficult to work with, which is unusual for my naturally straight, relatively healthy hair. I also noticed that using this conditioner makes my hair look oilier with less time in between washes. It may be that this formula just doesn&#x27;t work well with the type of hair I have, since others have had great success with it. Overall, this is still a good product, but not a GREAT product like many others offered by the organix brand.</li>
            <li> This really makes my hair very soft and moisturized. I&#x27;ve used it for co-washes without mixing in oils and it&#x27;s great for a nice deep condition.</li>
            <li> Actually, I use this product on my Havanese show dog coat. The Havanese coat is extremely fine and delicate. It breaks easily. This product adds moisture and shine, and protects the hair for a beautiful, healthy show shine and less breakage.</li>
