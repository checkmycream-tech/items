            <li> The other set was different but not ProGlide.</li>
            <li> 2 of the 16 blades were not enclosed in any packaging (other than what they were shipped in).</li>
            <li> The 2 blades were in the plastic container which typically houses 4 of the blades.</li>
            <li> The problem is 3 of the 4 sets of blades (4 x 4 blades) are plain Fusion blades, not ProGlide which I believed I was buying.</li>
            <li> Not sure if they are Gillette or not.</li>
            <li> Too expensive, and worse quality than dollar shave or similar services</li>
            <li> Not very happy at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; - not good quality blades.  </li>
            <li> (14) pack and 2 random razors.</li>
            <li> These blades are dangerous and will cut your face to pieces.</li>
            <li> So 2 of the 16 I have purchased are worthless to me and have gone into the trash.</li>

            <li> Buyer Beware these things are not the real deal.  My face feels like I&#x27;m shaving with a butter knife and pulls every hair.  Not very happy at all.  Stick to the real deal and pay up as I was getting two months sometimes out of the real blades.</li>
            <li> 2 of the 16 blades were not enclosed in any packaging (other than what they were shipped in). The 2 blades were in the plastic container which typically houses 4 of the blades. I received a 14 pack of blades enclosed in the proper packaging and 2 blades not in any packaging. I have no idea who has touched these blades or if anything has come in contact with these blades. So 2 of the 16 I have purchased are worthless to me and have gone into the trash. That equals to me losing $7.50 from this order. The pictures provided are misleading, the picture shows 2 (8) packs of the razors, I received 1 (14) pack and 2 random razors.</li>
            <li> No problems at all with this seller or the product</li>
            <li> This is a really good deal. I am very pleased. Not sure if they are Gillette or not. A rose is a rose is a rose...</li>
            <li> Good seller.I really recommend</li>
            <li> I love the power fusion razor but always cringe at the price of replacement blades.  Seems like such a scam that they charge so much.  So I figured I&#x27;d give these a try and I am very please, I hadn&#x27;t noticed a difference between these and what I buy in the store yet I saved a ton of money</li>
            <li> These appear to be genuine Gillette blades.  The price has gone up substantially (50%+) since I bought them though.  It was a really good deal at my price.</li>
            <li> Received the package with some actual Gillette blades. The problem is 3 of the 4 sets of blades (4 x 4 blades) are plain Fusion blades, not ProGlide which I believed I was buying. The other set was different but not ProGlide. One could try to interpret the advertised product as ProGlide plus Fusion in a package, but the product description implies that it fits both razor handles. This product turns up in a search for ProGlide.</li>
            <li> Legit refills, have lubrication strip, all blades, and the 1 precision trimmer. I was hesistant at first reading the other reviews but 5 * all the way!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; - not good quality blades.  Next time I&#x27;ll be more careful ordering them.</li>
            <li> delivered as described. 12  fusion &amp; 4 proglide.</li>
            <li> These are not generic!  They are the actual pro glide blades!  How sweet is that?!  Awesome price on the real deal!</li>
            <li> These blades are dangerous and will cut your face to pieces.</li>
            <li> A great price. This is the second time I have ordered these.</li>
            <li> These are the real Gillette Fusion blades, not generic in two 8 packs.  They look fine and seem to be as advertised except OEM instead of generic which is nice.</li>
            <li> Great buy. Bulk packaging but I received genuine Gillette brand blades.</li>
            <li> Too expensive, and worse quality than dollar shave or similar services</li>
            <li> What arrived was retail packets of original Gillette blades, so there;s certainly nothing to complain about. Works just like you think it would.</li>
            <li> Great blades works just as good as the name brand in stores for a fraction of the cost!</li>
            <li> I bought these after reading the reviews saying they were genuine Gillette proglide fusion blades, and they look real and so does the packaging but the new blade I put one was duller than the old ( real and from a real store) one I removed.  Also the greenish\\&quot; lubricating\\&quot; string wore off after 2 shaves and never seemed very slick like the genuine blades do.  I wonder if these are just really good fakes. And I also see the price is now almost what they cost at Costco ($42 here in San Diego,CA). I think I&#x27;ll stick to buying mine at Costco.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Added on 9/11/2014&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe some of you guys giving these blade 4-5 stars just because they look real, they are so dull compared to the real Gillette blades.  Wake up and feel the blades pulling on your beard.</li>
            <li> If these are knock-off, they&#x27;re the best knock-off I&#x27;ve every experienced for any product. Including the packaging.</li>
