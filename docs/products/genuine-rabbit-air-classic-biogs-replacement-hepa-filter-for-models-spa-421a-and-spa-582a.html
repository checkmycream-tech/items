            <li>but he can buy his own, this ones mine!</li>
            <li>The Rabbit Air does a good job of filtering the air in my house.  </li>
            <li>Good filter but inaccurate description.</li>
            <li>Does a good job.</li>
            <li>this is a good one.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my Rabbit.  </li>
            <li>As another reviewer mentioned, it would be nice to have this bundled with the charcoal filter to save some money.</li>
            <li>If you are purchasing this it is because you own the unit.  </li>
            <li>It does not do a better job in air filtration, but good at deodorant in my perception.</li>
            <li>It seems like this would be one of those pass/fail kind of things</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of like buying a knife.</li>
            <li>Works great for those of you non-smokers who are living with someone who does smoke, or if you smoke and want to clean the air in your space.</li>
            <li>Rabbit Air is by far the best air purifier I&#x27;ve come across for the money.</li>
            <li>but they quickly sent the correct parts back, never had anything but great customer service from Rabbit Air and excellent breathing from the machine!  </li>
            <li>It works beautifully and is very well made.  </li>
            <li>works great hope it lasts as long as the one it replacing great filter sysyem yhe rabbit air</li>
            <li>I have to say I love everything about Rabbit Air, except for the shipping.</li>
            <li>This is another product that I read many reviews on Amazon before I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing the amount of hair that&#x27;s on the pre-filter when I clean it.</li>
            <li>Best of all, the Rabbitair gets the air in my apartment noticably cleaner faster than any of the other units I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure it could clean the air out there</li>
            <li>The documentation says the HEPA filter is good for about 2 years, and mine was more like 16 months old.  </li>
            <li>The filter caught a lot of the fine dust.</li>
            <li>The filter lasts six months instead of the stated year because it is dealing with a lot of fine Cockatoo dust.</li>
            <li>The filter works fine</li>
            <li>The filter seems to work fine.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything fit fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how much dirt this filter catches in one year.  </li>
            <li>They truly make their money selling them, rather than the filter unit they fit in.</li>
            <li>I have an Umbrella Cockatoo and it cleans the air of the white dust that the Cockatoo produces in great amounts.  </li>
            <li>I vac these when it&#x27;s time to clean the charcoal filter</li>
            <li>Just keep your filters clean.</li>
            <li>or you just want to breathe clean air.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this along with the Charcoal filter for my Rabbit Clean Air</li>
            <li>Very effective and lasts  a long time.</li>
            <li>If I had it to do again, I might have tried another brand with more reasonably priced replacement filters.</li>
            <li>Good solid reliable business.</li>
            <li>Not a bad price for a HEPA filter.</li>
            <li>So if you liked the original you will definitely like this one.</li>
            <li>That means it is the exact replacement for the one that originally came with the equipment.</li>
            <li>This is a replacement part exactly like original.</li>
            <li>This filter goes with my Rabbit Air air filter system which is possibly the best thing on earth if you have allergies, a dog or are allergic to dust or live near a freeway.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>The original filter lasted much longer than predicted.</li>
            <li>I bought the unit years ago and me being cheap did not want to spend the high cost&lt;br /&gt;of replacement filters.</li>
            <li>This air filter , along with the 2 other washable types  of filters, catches most if not all airborne allergens and dust, to give clean freash smelling air in any room!  </li>
            <li>I had been cleaning the old filter with a vacuum and thought I had been doing a good job.</li>
            <li>This is a little pricey ($50) but it doesn&#x27;t need to be replaced often, and does seem to do a good job of removing odors, allergens, etc.</li>
            <li>I purchased it to clean the air from new carpeting and paint fumes.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time changing the filters since I bought the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>They works pretty well and the volume of dust and dirt in my house reduces 2 or something.</li>
            <li>Both were packaged well, arrived quickly, and were the same quality as the original filters that came with my Rabbit Air air cleaner.</li>
            <li>did, however, vacuum the filter every month or so with a good HEPA rated vacuum.  </li>
            <li>New one woks as good as the previous one.</li>
            <li>If you have this air filter, I&#x27;m not aware of other HEPA filters that fit the unit, so you&#x27;re kind of stuck, but luckily it does the job</li>
            <li>I purchased the Rabbit Air BioGS from Amazon and also the replacement HEPA filters which last a long time by vaccuming the filter when the read light comes on and have been completely satisfied with it.  </li>
            <li>When I opened up the new one, and then opened up the Rabbit Air, I knew immediately that was the right thing to do.  </li>
            <li>item was nicely packaged &amp; shipped in average amount of time !</li>
            <li>The new filter was so clean, though, that it made the old one look like a dingy</li>
            <li>The downside is the overly-expensive replacement filters that are only available from Rabbit Air.  </li>
            <li>These filters really seem to work.  </li>
            <li>It works very well at removing oders</li>
            <li>this filter seems to work very well</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really have a choice on which filter to buy though.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Thanks.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It is a filter, it lasts a long time, they ship it free.</li>
            <li>Should be able to get the cost down.</li>
            <li>My ashtma has definitly improved and almost like I don&#x27;t live with smokers at all anymore!  </li>
            <li>Love my rabbit air, quiet , really quiet.</li>
            <li>Its nice to see a white filter again, when I pulled the old out it was so grey</li>
            <li>I have the air purifier set to high all the time all year</li>
            <li>I highly recommend replacing this filter as often as you can afford to do it.</li>
            <li>Works as it should, but the price was high when I purchased it.  </li>
            <li>This product has been very useful in helping my son live with his two Old English Shepherd.</li>
            <li>It tells you how clean your air is and is quiet and relatively maintenance free (just vacuum the hepa filter and rinse the charcoal one every couple of months or so &amp; replace about every 18 months).  </li>
            <li>, I ordered a new filter.  </li>
            <li>After over two years I &amp;#34;bucked-up&amp;#34; and replaced my old filter with a new one, but frankly haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference other than the change filter light not coming on as frequently.</li>
            <li>I extended the life of the original filter by carefully vacuuming the pre-filter fabric mesh frequently, which would allow me to reset the filter indicator and airflow was restored.  </li>
            <li>I put in the new filter, and threw the old one away.  </li>
            <li>Well the filter was filled with black soot after 8 years.</li>
            <li>This product is energy efficient and I am only replacing the filter for the very first time a year later.</li>
            <li>The new filter had an immediate positive effect in our master bedroom in the first few days.  </li>
            <li>the old one was so clogged that the fans were probably sucking air around the edges of the clogged filter, which caused everything to rattle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The old filter is noticeably heavier.  </li>
            <li>Filter is quiet and works very well.</li>
            <li>This item was a direct OEM replacement to the filter that came with my unit.  </li>
            <li>I guess as far as HEPA filters go</li>
            <li>Since old filters work for 1 year already, I decided to replace them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend changing and proper mainterence</li>
            <li>The new filter was like the picture, a creamy white.  </li>
            <li>Interesting how this filter is supposed to last at least a year</li>
            <li>Proper filter changes every few years and breath clean air.</li>
            <li>The dirt is visible on the old filter, it actually looks brow in color.  </li>
            <li>I replaced a similar filter on our 4 year old Rabbit Air BioGS air purifier.  </li>
            <li>I also vacuum all 3 filters about twice a week to clear the debris.</li>
            <li>does a fine job, with much less cost (slight nosier).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good but very expensive and they never have a sale or coupon for them.  </li>
            <li>The fan actually sounds like it is running at a higher speed since it&#x27;s not working so hard to pass air through all the dirt on the old filter.  </li>

            <li> The fan actually sounds like it is running at a higher speed since it&#x27;s not working so hard to pass air through all the dirt on the old filter.  </li>

            <li> But, I had noticed that lately, every time it kicked into \\&quot;high gear\\&quot;, the entire unit was making rattling noises.  </li>
            <li> I ordered for the wrong model about 2 years before and the company was great, I did have to pay shipping to send the wrong parts back</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I balked at spending so much for the HEPA filter, and I am still not thrilled about the cost, but there is no doubt it needed to be done.</li>
            <li> I should have changed them a long time ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and will never wait that long again.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> its a must have on had if you take your filtering serious</li>
            <li> The Rabbit Air does a good job of filtering the air in my house.  The downside is the overly-expensive replacement filters that are only available from Rabbit Air.  If I had it to do again, I might have tried another brand with more reasonably priced replacement filters.</li>
            <li> Great Price for replacement</li>
            <li> Its nice to see a white filter again, when I pulled the old out it was so grey I knew it was past due, it has been almost two years and I had washed it the past few times due to low funds, yes THAT low.  No problems with shipping or the Rabbit.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years now and this is my second filter replcement.  I ordered for the wrong model about 2 years before and the company was great, I did have to pay shipping to send the wrong parts back but they quickly sent the correct parts back, never had anything but great customer service from Rabbit Air and excellent breathing from the machine!  My ashtma has definitly improved and almost like I don&#x27;t live with smokers at all anymore!  My little breathing machine cleans my air for me and my dad keeps trying to talk it out of my room and into the living room, I&#x27;m sure it could clean the air out there but he can buy his own, this ones mine!</li>
            <li> That means it is the exact replacement for the one that originally came with the equipment. So if you liked the original you will definitely like this one. Not much else you can say. I think this Rabbit Air unit is excellent. The filter is a little expensive but it lasts for at least 18 months.</li>
            <li> I have had the air purifier for over three years and after cleaning it noticed the hepa filter was dirty. After replacing the hepa filter there was a big difference. The difference was the air smelled cleaner and allergies improved greatly.</li>
            <li> This was my first time changing the filters since I bought the [[ASIN:B000LDWJ6O Rabbit Air BioGS (model 421A - 600 sq. ft.) Ultra-Quiet Air Purifier]] about two years ago. I should have changed them a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I balked at spending so much for the HEPA filter, and I am still not thrilled about the cost, but there is no doubt it needed to be done. I had been cleaning the old filter with a vacuum and thought I had been doing a good job. The new filter was so clean, though, that it made the old one look like a dingy mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything fit fine. The packaging was great. And I have no complaints about the product. As another reviewer mentioned, it would be nice to have this bundled with the charcoal filter to save some money.</li>
            <li> If you are purchasing this it is because you own the unit.  Great Unit and this is a really great price for the replacement filters.  Please note they last three years, you just have to vacuum them, I replaced it thinking it was time to throw out because the alarm came on, then I read the manual...</li>
            <li> It was just what I needed to get my rabbit air back in working order.  The original filter lasted much longer than predicted.</li>
            <li> We have three Rabbit Air BioGS through out the house since we have two dogs.  They work great!!  Guests come into our house and tell me that they cannot \\&quot;smell dog\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The documentation says the HEPA filter is good for about 2 years, and mine was more like 16 months old.  But, I had noticed that lately, every time it kicked into \\&quot;high gear\\&quot;, the entire unit was making rattling noises.  Cleaning did not help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a hunch, I ordered a new filter.  When I opened up the new one, and then opened up the Rabbit Air, I knew immediately that was the right thing to do.  See, the old filter had slowly changed color as it aged, to the point where it was sort of a brownish orange color.  The new filter was like the picture, a creamy white.  I put in the new filter, and threw the old one away.  Later, the unit kicked on and the rattles were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes sense now... the old one was so clogged that the fans were probably sucking air around the edges of the clogged filter, which caused everything to rattle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it seems that your ears may be the best determinate for deciding when to replace the HEPA filter.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my Rabbit.  I had severe coughing episodes before I decided to give it a try.  It has helped me with that problem, and I have recommended it to a friend.</li>
            <li> Accidently ripped my HEPA filter and ordered the replacement.  It works like a charm with no issues.</li>
            <li> Once a year a replace this filter.  Every two years I replace the charcoal filter.  I have the air purifier set to high all the time all year so you may not need to replace your filters as often.  It&#x27;s amazing how much dirt this filter catches in one year.  The old filter is noticeably heavier.  The dirt is visible on the old filter, it actually looks brow in color.  When you install this filter you can tell from the start that it&#x27;s working.  The fan actually sounds like it is running at a higher speed since it&#x27;s not working so hard to pass air through all the dirt on the old filter.  I highly recommend replacing this filter as often as you can afford to do it.</li>
            <li> Rabbit Air always sells reliable products and replacement filters. I purchased both a replacement HEPA filter and a carbon filter. Both were packaged well, arrived quickly, and were the same quality as the original filters that came with my Rabbit Air air cleaner. Good solid reliable business.</li>
            <li> Ordered extras with an SPA-582A,&lt;br /&gt;glad that they come sealed in plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Wish Amazon offered bundles of HEPA + carbon for these&lt;br /&gt;as is done for the SPA-700A &amp; SPA-780A..</li>
            <li> I bought the unit years ago and me being cheap did not want to spend the high cost&lt;br /&gt;of replacement filters. Well the filter was filled with black soot after 8 years. I bought 2 of&lt;br /&gt;these and will never wait that long again. A great unit to owm</li>
            <li> Interesting how this filter is supposed to last at least a year but my rabbit air which is left on low 24/7 just shut itself off after 8 months, because of this filter became so clogged up. I have 2 cats in a one-bedroom apartment. For the filter to expire so quickly is a bit disappointment when the price of this filter is 45 dollars. Good filter but inaccurate description.</li>
            <li> Works as it should, but the price was high when I purchased it.  No lower&lt;br /&gt;price than Amazon though, I checked all over the web.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make these go a bit further I vac these when it&#x27;s time to clean the charcoal filter&lt;br /&gt;and I also added a pre-filter which doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the function.</li>
            <li> Only one filter fits so you have to buy it somewhere.  Replacement filter cartridges are all overpriced.  They truly make their money selling them, rather than the filter unit they fit in.</li>
            <li> We had this little over a year, and needed the third filter already. We leave it in the bedroom (about 250sqf) on low, and on for 80% of the time. We have one cat in this room. it is quite and did a great job. When needed we take it to the dining room for couple hours to get rid of the food smell if needed.  However, we have another Air Purifier from Costco that does not need filter replacement does a fine job, with much less cost (slight nosier). It does not do a better job in air filtration, but good at deodorant in my perception. At about $100/year, I may think again.</li>
            <li> Filter is quiet and works very well. We use it in our child&#x27;s room and it has done wonders for his allergies. Normally pollen season is a tough time for him.</li>
            <li> This item was a direct OEM replacement to the filter that came with my unit.  There was NO discrepancies between this one and the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from the obvious shipping materials (which were ample):  The packaging for this product is minimal: only a purple bag around it.  No pointless extra box or other materials you just end up throwing away.  The purple bag is \\&quot;PE rated for recycling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last filter lasted 3 years, which is 18 months longer than suggested.  How I knew it was time to change out the filter was that the unit began to suck air around the filter instead of through it.  I would recommend NOT going quite this long, maybe 24 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did, however, vacuum the filter every month or so with a good HEPA rated vacuum.  This will prolong the life of your filter to 24 months, depending on your environment.</li>
            <li> This filter goes with my Rabbit Air air filter system which is possibly the best thing on earth if you have allergies, a dog or are allergic to dust or live near a freeway. For me it&#x27;s all of the above. I have to dust far less, I can breath without being constantly stuffed up and before I owned this I couldn&#x27;t breath at all at night which made it extremely difficult to sleep.  This product is energy efficient and I am only replacing the filter for the very first time a year later. I have to say I love everything about Rabbit Air, except for the shipping.</li>
            <li> I have asthma and allergies and an air cleaner for me is a must. Even though my apartment building is a non-smoking building, some of the tenants smoke and don&#x27;t always obey the rules. But almost everything else that has an odor or a presence in the air can choke me. This cleaner works well for the price of the unit. The filters need to be changed at least every six months, but they are pretty pricey - if they were not so expensive I&#x27;d change them every three months.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement part exactly like original. Didn&#x27;t realize how poorly the old one was performing until we replaced it.</li>
            <li> Rabbit Air is by far the best air purifier I&#x27;ve come across for the money. The filters don&#x27;t have to be changed but every one and a half to two years which is a plus as well. We have two in our home and two dachshunds as well. It&#x27;s amazing the amount of hair that&#x27;s on the pre-filter when I clean it.</li>
            <li> Love my rabbit air, quiet , really quiet. Does a good job. Just keep your filters clean. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had other types of air cleaners - Ionic Breeze, etc. - but Rabbitair is the best.  It tells you how clean your air is and is quiet and relatively maintenance free (just vacuum the hepa filter and rinse the charcoal one every couple of months or so &amp; replace about every 18 months).  The filters are a bit expensive, but they only need to be replaced about every 18 months.  Best of all, the Rabbitair gets the air in my apartment noticably cleaner faster than any of the other units I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This fits the Rabbit Air BioGS SPA-421AS perfectly given it is a factory replacement.  I extended the life of the original filter by carefully vacuuming the pre-filter fabric mesh frequently, which would allow me to reset the filter indicator and airflow was restored.  After 5 years of running nightly it was time to replace the filter.  We had some renovation done in the house that included some low-VOC sealant/adhesive and while it was not as bad as regular (high VOC) off-gassing, there was still a noticeable smell.  We replaced both the charcoal filter and the HEPA filter and the odors disappeared in the room with the filter and the hallway outside.  The effectiveness is self-evident.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Rabbit Air BioGS from Amazon and also the replacement HEPA filters which last a long time by vaccuming the filter when the read light comes on and have been completely satisfied with it.  I would recommend it to all with airborne allergies or you just want to breathe clean air.  I purchased it to clean the air from new carpeting and paint fumes.  It works beautifully and is very well made.  This is another product that I read many reviews on Amazon before I purchased it.  I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> price is a little high, but they seem to do the job. was hopping the price would come down but it has stayed about the same for over 3 years.</li>
            <li> These filters really seem to work.  I can tell when mine needs to be replaced as the color changes.  We changed ours a bit early due to some construction.  The filter caught a lot of the fine dust.</li>
            <li> I have had this air cleaner for four years and it still does a great job.  I have an Umbrella Cockatoo and it cleans the air of the white dust that the Cockatoo produces in great amounts.  The filter lasts six months instead of the stated year because it is dealing with a lot of fine Cockatoo dust.</li>
            <li> Have used a rabbit air for several years and it keeps dust, dander, and allergens out of the air. Works great for those of you non-smokers who are living with someone who does smoke, or if you smoke and want to clean the air in your space.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but very expensive and they never have a sale or coupon for them.  Besure to vacuum the prefilter and this part regularly to extend it&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the Charcoal filter for my Rabbit Clean Air Machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This item was nicely packaged &amp; shipped in average amount of time !</li>
            <li> Filter arrived on time.  We have been using our Rabbit Air for years and are happy with its performance and the filters.</li>
            <li> Item as described and arrived on time.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> It works very well at removing oders</li>
            <li> This has been faithful for a year and requires so little maintenance.  Vacuuming the filter is all I have to do</li>
            <li> I have really bad allergies and I try to change the filter of my air cleaner a lot. this filter seems to work very well and I normally have less issues after replacing or cleaning.</li>
            <li> works well but WAY overpriced.</li>
            <li> Very effective and lasts  a long time. My prior filter lasted five years (I vacuum out the filter every two weeks).</li>
            <li> Rabbit Air claims you can change it every 1- 1/12 years, but I change my every 3-5 months it seems.....if the &#x27;white/yellow&#x27; filtration combs turn black and appear really dirty after 3-5 months, I buy a new one. I also vacuum all 3 filters about twice a week to clear the debris. I don&#x27;t have pets, but if you have pets, I&#x27;d recommend vacuuming this every 1-2 days to keep it working at peak performance.</li>
            <li> Works great as always. Proper filter changes every few years and breath clean air. I highly recommend changing and proper mainterence</li>
            <li> Great filter.  Lasts about one year if you run it 24 hours a day like us.  We have 2 rabbit airs, one in the living room and one in the bedroom.  They are great!</li>
            <li> Not a bad price for a HEPA filter. When I popped this into my air purifier there was a noticeable difference in my allergy symptoms. Don&#x27;t really have a choice on which filter to buy though.</li>
            <li> Purchased the replacement filter for my Rabbit Air BioGs but discoverd after throughly cleaning the existing one that at this time haven&#x27;t had to use the replacement filter.  If you take an airhose and blow air through the filter it extends the life of the filter.</li>
            <li> I guess as far as HEPA filters go this is a good one.  I frequently vacuum this filter in an attempt to extend it&#x27;s life, being they are quite expensive.  After over two years I &amp;#34;bucked-up&amp;#34; and replaced my old filter with a new one, but frankly haven&#x27;t noticed much of a difference other than the change filter light not coming on as frequently. (of course THEY  say it&#x27;s less of a strain on the fan motor, but since these do not come with tachometers I guess I&#x27;ll just have to trust them.</li>
            <li> Have had the Rabbit Hepa SPA 421 for a few years and find that it seems to take a lot of stuff out of the air in our condo.  The filter works fine and I probably don&#x27;t replace it as often as I should.</li>
            <li> This air filter , along with the 2 other washable types  of filters, catches most if not all airborne allergens and dust, to give clean freash smelling air in any room!  THE Rabbit  has a half a dozen speed settings and is whisper quiet!</li>
            <li> I mean, hey, it&#x27;s a filter, it works well. It seems like this would be one of those pass/fail kind of things, I don&#x27;t know what I can say negatively about it. It is a filter, it lasts a long time, they ship it free. It&#x27;s kind of like buying a knife.</li>
            <li> Rabbit Air is ALWAYS so pronpt, reliable, dependable.  They have superior products and I&#x27;ve had my Rabbit Air for years!</li>
            <li> The filter seems to work fine.  My problem with it is the cost.  Should be able to get the cost down.</li>
            <li> I replaced a similar filter on our 4 year old Rabbit Air BioGS air purifier.  The new filter had an immediate positive effect in our master bedroom in the first few days.  There was significantly less dust accumulating on the bedroom furniture.</li>
            <li> This is a little pricey ($50) but it doesn&#x27;t need to be replaced often, and does seem to do a good job of removing odors, allergens, etc. from the air.  If you have this air filter, I&#x27;m not aware of other HEPA filters that fit the unit, so you&#x27;re kind of stuck, but luckily it does the job well.</li>
            <li> This product has been very useful in helping my son live with his two Old English Shepherd. Thanks, Thanks.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> works great hope it lasts as long as the one it replacing great filter sysyem yhe rabbit air yes sir</li>
            <li> Works great and lasts over a year or longer so no complaints.</li>
            <li> These filters work fantastically.  Being a smoker, I need a good air cleaner and Rabbit is the best!</li>
            <li> Rabbit Air has improved my sleep. Get one for you bedroom also.</li>
            <li> I have 2 Rabbit BoiGS filters in my apartments for a year now. They works pretty well and the volume of dust and dirt in my house reduces 2 or something. Since old filters work for 1 year already, I decided to replace them. New one woks as good as the previous one.</li>
