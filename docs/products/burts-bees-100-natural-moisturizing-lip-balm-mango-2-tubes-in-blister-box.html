            <li>It does not clump and the mango scent is nice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve come to appreciate bananna boat, which doesn&#x27;t melt in a warm climate.</li>
            <li>I think there may be some kind of drying agent in the product.</li>
            <li>The original is great in my book.</li>
            <li>It also all natural, the best part about it.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and leaves your lips feeling soft and hydrated.  </li>

            <li>I love this stuff and havent found anything better.</li>
            <li>I love burts bees and mangoes</li>
            <li>This is my favorite product.  </li>
            <li>My favorite BB lip balm.</li>
            <li>I love that it feels buttery and not sticky or waxy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I can say that it goes on nice and smooth and it does condition my lips</li>
            <li>and I love the texture of it --</li>
            <li>The mango-scent is okay</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>The EOS ones are so much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li>My friend recommended the original version, and I tried it - it&#x27;s about 400 times better than the formula of this!</li>
            <li>This Mango Butter is our favorite Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.  </li>
            <li>I love everything about this variety of lip balm.</li>
            <li>Of all of the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I was quite pleased when I saw it is now offered on Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program...</li>
            <li>I tried so many things including Vaseline, C.O. Bigelow, organic lip balms, homemade lip balms from the farmers market, Cerave, Clinique, etc.</li>
            <li>(The Face Shop Lovely ME</li>
            <li>This is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I am in love with this chapstick</li>
            <li>and I love how silky it is on my lips.</li>
            <li>It is much better than lip smackers (which is chalky, but great flavored), but it is the same quality to me as Chap Stick, and Blistex, and not as good as Softlips.</li>
            <li>and she loves it. :)</li>
            <li>One of my favorite burt&#x27;s bees balm yet.  </li>
            <li>I can say that it goes on nice and smooth and it does condition my lips well.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip balm of all Burt&#x27;s Bees balms.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind reapplying all day, it does smell lovely.</li>
            <li>This one I am in LOVE with.</li>
            <li>The only in best lip balm I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product since more than 2 years.</li>
            <li>I ordered these and was very excited, but when I used the balm the excitement faded.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed quickly and keeps your lips looking and feeling great.  </li>
            <li>the price is pretty good as well.</li>
            <li>Original Burt&#x27;s !</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not a big fan of this brand which is surprising considering all the good reviews I read.</li>
            <li>Very sweet mango flavor.</li>
            <li>Healthy ingredients, smells fabulous, no tint and no peppermint oil.  </li>
            <li>This is really affordable and so good for my chapped lips.</li>
            <li>Best lip balm for dry lips!!  </li>
            <li>The smell is not too strong and the balm is not sticky or oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so smooth.</li>
            <li>Hydrates lips and leaves them feeling smooth and plump.</li>
            <li>Smooth and stays moist for awhile.</li>
            <li>It smells and tastes sooo good and always leaves my lips feeling insanely soft.</li>
            <li>Feels good and like the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet mango smell and a light taste.</li>
            <li>Guess the Kokum butter is not that great for long term relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another great thing is how few times I use it in the course of a day; it&#x27;s pretty long-lasting and as the texture isn&#x27;t waxy or too greasy, I&#x27;m not compelled to apply more and more like a maniac.</li>
            <li>I love the Subscribe and Save option because it is much cheaper than any store in town.  </li>
            <li>product really hydrates my lips, and I just love the taste of mango.  </li>
            <li>The deal for two of them is fair enough eith &amp;</li>
            <li>It also has good lasting power so no need to keep reapplying.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something that was natural, smelled nice, and didn&#x27;t leave that Chapstick-like residue on my lips.</li>
            <li>It was good for about ten minutes, if even that, then my lips started itching again.</li>
            <li>This is a good lip balm but it is possible to have an allergic reaction to it.  </li>
            <li>The smell is good but the ingredients actually help to protect my lips from looking like sharkskin during winter.  </li>
            <li>I have super chapped lips throughout the year.</li>
            <li>I put it on and thought it was just super.</li>
            <li>Now they are smooth and pretty looking again.</li>
            <li>I love trying new natual lip balms.</li>
            <li>Also it&#x27;s very gentle &amp; natural so great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just oily enough to keep your lips smooth and it smells lovely.</li>
            <li>Lots of balms make my lips feel dried out on the inside, but this leaves my lips soft and hydrated and smells great too!</li>
            <li>But these are, BY FAR, my favorite lip balm.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>the closest to natural of anything you can use, the better.</li>
            <li>I would give this product a 4 or 5 if it was a more reasonable price compared to it&#x27;s competition, but it isn&#x27;t well priced either online or in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest it to people, mainly people who prefer organic items or more natural items.</li>
            <li>so well after 1 application my lips will stop burning &amp; the skin will soften pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Two is just right, with a wife.</li>
            <li>so I signed up right away.  </li>
            <li>It GLIDES on, has a light and lovely taste and &amp;#34;perfume,&amp;#34; plus it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>They were delivered quickly, and I love the double pack option!</li>
            <li>This product goes on smooth, feels good, stays on for a decent length of time and just plain ole works for me.  </li>
            <li>My first observation after using this was that it goes on more smoothly than other lip balms.</li>
            <li>I like it so much!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend keeping them in the car -- they melt into funny shapes after the heat.  </li>
            <li>First time purchasing anything from Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>Burts Bees lip balm never fails.</li>
            <li>Goes on clear and creamy, not greasy, velvety smooth.</li>
            <li>have tried probably most of the lip balms on the market, but I always come back to Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very content with my purchase!</li>
            <li>It wouldn&#x27;t be my first suggestion to people though, softlips would be.</li>
            <li>This lip balm goes on smooth and keeps my lips moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>When I put this lip balm on my lips, my lips feel so soft and looks so smooth.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had a pretty severe winter in the north east this year and the liberal use of Burts bee mango butter lip balm has kept my lips moist and supple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm (various flavors) for many years.</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of other Burt&#x27;s Bees balms, and I&#x27;ve tried so many organic products and inorganic products that I feel like my opinion is stemming from a full spectrum background.  </li>
            <li>This is so different than burt&#x27;s bees original lip balm, the original is much waxier.</li>
            <li>It not only smells, tastes good, but it actually works- just in a couple weeks my lips were healing!</li>
            <li>I buy it pretty much all the time because I tend to lose them....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as the coconut of vit E version, not as red tinted as the cranberry or pomegranate, but great moisturization for my &amp;#34;every day and all day&amp;#34; chapstick (I live in a really dry climate and would die without it!)</li>
            <li>This is the only chapstick I&#x27;ll actually use because, unlike most others IT WORKS!  </li>
            <li>but the smell reminds me of dog food, very moisturizing though.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very tasty.  </li>
            <li>I have a real problem with chapped lips</li>
            <li>Add the fact that this is mostly natural and quite economical and I rate this at five stars.</li>
            <li>I live in the hot desert air, and my lips are always getting chapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I keep the original Burts and my caramex around and go back and forth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to reapply as often as I do with other chapsticks (including other Burt&#x27;s Bees variants), glides on evenly, and tastes great.</li>
            <li>It lasts as long as the peppermint kind in the yellow tube.</li>
            <li>I prefer it to the various lip balm sticks on the market because it lasts longer and is completely satisfactory in terms of keeping my lips moist and free from chapping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few, but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>When I glop a lot of it on my lips, not because it IS gloppy, more because I have a heavy hand</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even more reassuring knowing there aren&#x27;t any harsh chemicals in the chapstick.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m allergic to pretty much all lipsticks, including the &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; ones, and this is the only stuff that I can use.  </li>
            <li>It gets the job done, it feels good, and it isn&#x27;t flavored poorly.</li>
            <li>Takes the dry skin right off of you lips.</li>
            <li>not as soft as I prefer balms to be</li>
            <li>soft lips.</li>
            <li>I think it was either allergies or the horrid winter air in early 2014.</li>
            <li>After a month of using this product, I developed severely chapped, almost blistered lips and upset digestion that went away a week after discontinuing use.  </li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to poison ivy, like me, then perhaps use this product sparingly.  </li>
            <li>so far you don&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li>Using this lip balm first goes a long way in preventing this.</li>
            <li>Lastly, it is 100% natural (though not vegan due to the lanolin) which is important since we do ingest a a bit of lip balm each time we use it.</li>
            <li>I often find they are sold out on the Burts Bees Website, but they were available here for the same or less than the Burts Bees Site.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used all of them from cheap to the super expensive.  </li>
            <li>: The flavor doesn&#x27;t last very long after opening for the first time, and there is no SPF.</li>
            <li>I went back to this asap and its all back to normal.</li>
            <li>Seems pricier than other brands, but lasts much longer.  </li>
            <li>and I just use this a few times per day and it really helps lock in the moisture!</li>
            <li>Although a little on the expensive side for chapstick, I love how easily it glides on and the slight mango smell.</li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of a subtle and natural mango scent with no gross sweetness or aftertaste.</li>

            <li> Work lovely on my lips!</li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant scent and last a good amount of time once applied!</li>
            <li> It goes on the smoothest and has an amazing scent.</li>
            <li> Amazing as always</li>
            <li> Nice keep repeating reapplying</li>
            <li> It glides on my lips nicely and stays with me even after I&#x27;ve had a sip of a beverage.</li>
            <li> It does not clump and the mango scent is nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve come to appreciate bananna boat, which doesn&#x27;t melt in a warm climate.</li>
            <li> I think there may be some kind of drying agent in the product.</li>
            <li> The original is great in my book.</li>
            <li> It also all natural, the best part about it.</li>
            <li> It smells wonderful and leaves your lips feeling soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my lips feeling soft and wonderful.</li>
            <li> very soothing and smell good!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and havent found anything better.</li>
            <li> I love burts bees and mangoes</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product.  </li>
            <li> My favorite BB lip balm.</li>
            <li> I love that it feels buttery and not sticky or waxy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> I can say that it goes on nice and smooth and it does condition my lips</li>
            <li> and I love the texture of it --</li>
            <li> The mango-scent is okay</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li> The EOS ones are so much better in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended the original version, and I tried it - it&#x27;s about 400 times better than the formula of this!</li>
            <li> This Mango Butter is our favorite Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.  </li>
            <li> I love everything about this variety of lip balm.</li>
            <li> Of all of the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I was quite pleased when I saw it is now offered on Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program...</li>
            <li> I tried so many things including Vaseline, C.O. Bigelow, organic lip balms, homemade lip balms from the farmers market, Cerave, Clinique, etc.</li>
            <li> (The Face Shop Lovely ME</li>
            <li> This is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I am in love with this chapstick</li>
            <li> and I love how silky it is on my lips.</li>
            <li> It is much better than lip smackers (which is chalky, but great flavored), but it is the same quality to me as Chap Stick, and Blistex, and not as good as Softlips.</li>
            <li> and she loves it. :)</li>
            <li> One of my favorite burt&#x27;s bees balm yet.  </li>
            <li> I can say that it goes on nice and smooth and it does condition my lips well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm of all Burt&#x27;s Bees balms.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind reapplying all day, it does smell lovely.</li>
            <li> This one I am in LOVE with.</li>
            <li> The only in best lip balm I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since more than 2 years.</li>
            <li> I ordered these and was very excited, but when I used the balm the excitement faded.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed quickly and keeps your lips looking and feeling great.  </li>
            <li> the price is pretty good as well.</li>
            <li> Original Burt&#x27;s !</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not a big fan of this brand which is surprising considering all the good reviews I read.</li>
            <li> Very sweet mango flavor.</li>
            <li> Healthy ingredients, smells fabulous, no tint and no peppermint oil.  </li>
            <li> This is really affordable and so good for my chapped lips.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm for dry lips!!  </li>
            <li> The smell is not too strong and the balm is not sticky or oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so smooth.</li>
            <li> Hydrates lips and leaves them feeling smooth and plump.</li>
            <li> Smooth and stays moist for awhile.</li>
            <li> It smells and tastes sooo good and always leaves my lips feeling insanely soft.</li>
            <li> Feels good and like the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It has a sweet mango smell and a light taste.</li>
            <li> Guess the Kokum butter is not that great for long term relief.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another great thing is how few times I use it in the course of a day; it&#x27;s pretty long-lasting and as the texture isn&#x27;t waxy or too greasy, I&#x27;m not compelled to apply more and more like a maniac.</li>
            <li> I love the Subscribe and Save option because it is much cheaper than any store in town.  </li>
            <li> product really hydrates my lips, and I just love the taste of mango.  </li>
            <li> The deal for two of them is fair enough eith &amp;</li>
            <li> It also has good lasting power so no need to keep reapplying.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something that was natural, smelled nice, and didn&#x27;t leave that Chapstick-like residue on my lips.</li>
            <li> It was good for about ten minutes, if even that, then my lips started itching again.</li>
            <li> This is a good lip balm but it is possible to have an allergic reaction to it.  </li>
            <li> The smell is good but the ingredients actually help to protect my lips from looking like sharkskin during winter.  </li>
            <li> I have super chapped lips throughout the year.</li>
            <li> I put it on and thought it was just super.</li>
            <li> Now they are smooth and pretty looking again.</li>
            <li> I love trying new natual lip balms.</li>
            <li> Also it&#x27;s very gentle &amp; natural so great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just oily enough to keep your lips smooth and it smells lovely.</li>
            <li> Lots of balms make my lips feel dried out on the inside, but this leaves my lips soft and hydrated and smells great too!</li>
            <li> But these are, BY FAR, my favorite lip balm.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> the closest to natural of anything you can use, the better.</li>
            <li> I would give this product a 4 or 5 if it was a more reasonable price compared to it&#x27;s competition, but it isn&#x27;t well priced either online or in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest it to people, mainly people who prefer organic items or more natural items.</li>
            <li> so well after 1 application my lips will stop burning &amp; the skin will soften pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Two is just right, with a wife.</li>
            <li> so I signed up right away.  </li>
            <li> It GLIDES on, has a light and lovely taste and &amp;#34;perfume,&amp;#34; plus it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> They were delivered quickly, and I love the double pack option!</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth, feels good, stays on for a decent length of time and just plain ole works for me.  </li>
            <li> My first observation after using this was that it goes on more smoothly than other lip balms.</li>
            <li> I like it so much!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend keeping them in the car -- they melt into funny shapes after the heat.  </li>
            <li> First time purchasing anything from Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> Burts Bees lip balm never fails.</li>
            <li> Goes on clear and creamy, not greasy, velvety smooth.</li>
            <li> have tried probably most of the lip balms on the market, but I always come back to Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very content with my purchase!</li>
            <li> It wouldn&#x27;t be my first suggestion to people though, softlips would be.</li>
            <li> This lip balm goes on smooth and keeps my lips moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> When I put this lip balm on my lips, my lips feel so soft and looks so smooth.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had a pretty severe winter in the north east this year and the liberal use of Burts bee mango butter lip balm has kept my lips moist and supple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm (various flavors) for many years.</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of other Burt&#x27;s Bees balms, and I&#x27;ve tried so many organic products and inorganic products that I feel like my opinion is stemming from a full spectrum background.  </li>
            <li> This is so different than burt&#x27;s bees original lip balm, the original is much waxier.</li>
            <li> It not only smells, tastes good, but it actually works- just in a couple weeks my lips were healing!</li>
            <li> I buy it pretty much all the time because I tend to lose them....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as the coconut of vit E version, not as red tinted as the cranberry or pomegranate, but great moisturization for my &amp;#34;every day and all day&amp;#34; chapstick (I live in a really dry climate and would die without it!)</li>
            <li> This is the only chapstick I&#x27;ll actually use because, unlike most others IT WORKS!  </li>
            <li> but the smell reminds me of dog food, very moisturizing though.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Very tasty.  </li>
            <li> I have a real problem with chapped lips</li>
            <li> Add the fact that this is mostly natural and quite economical and I rate this at five stars.</li>
            <li> I live in the hot desert air, and my lips are always getting chapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I keep the original Burts and my caramex around and go back and forth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to reapply as often as I do with other chapsticks (including other Burt&#x27;s Bees variants), glides on evenly, and tastes great.</li>
            <li> It lasts as long as the peppermint kind in the yellow tube.</li>
            <li> I prefer it to the various lip balm sticks on the market because it lasts longer and is completely satisfactory in terms of keeping my lips moist and free from chapping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few, but this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> When I glop a lot of it on my lips, not because it IS gloppy, more because I have a heavy hand</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even more reassuring knowing there aren&#x27;t any harsh chemicals in the chapstick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to pretty much all lipsticks, including the &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; ones, and this is the only stuff that I can use.  </li>
            <li> It gets the job done, it feels good, and it isn&#x27;t flavored poorly.</li>
            <li> Takes the dry skin right off of you lips.</li>
            <li> not as soft as I prefer balms to be</li>
            <li> soft lips.</li>
            <li> I think it was either allergies or the horrid winter air in early 2014.</li>
            <li> After a month of using this product, I developed severely chapped, almost blistered lips and upset digestion that went away a week after discontinuing use.  </li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to poison ivy, like me, then perhaps use this product sparingly.  </li>
            <li> so far you don&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> Using this lip balm first goes a long way in preventing this.</li>
            <li> Lastly, it is 100% natural (though not vegan due to the lanolin) which is important since we do ingest a a bit of lip balm each time we use it.</li>
            <li> I often find they are sold out on the Burts Bees Website, but they were available here for the same or less than the Burts Bees Site.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used all of them from cheap to the super expensive.  </li>
            <li> : The flavor doesn&#x27;t last very long after opening for the first time, and there is no SPF.</li>
            <li> I went back to this asap and its all back to normal.</li>
            <li> Seems pricier than other brands, but lasts much longer.  </li>
            <li> and I just use this a few times per day and it really helps lock in the moisture!</li>
            <li> Although a little on the expensive side for chapstick, I love how easily it glides on and the slight mango smell.</li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of a subtle and natural mango scent with no gross sweetness or aftertaste.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels very thin and greasy and made my lips chap even more than before I applied it.</li>
            <li> If you have used some of the long lasting lipsticks you will notice that despite adding an outer moistening coat your lips will dry and get chapped sometimes.</li>
            <li> get really dry lips, so I keep a couple of these stashed around the house.  </li>
            <li> This did nothing for my dry lips.</li>
            <li> It works well in winters for dry lips.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel that it really creates long term softness, but it is good for cold days or when healing from a cold or sickness.</li>
            <li> I have used just about every single chapstick out there.</li>
            <li> I just prefer to support small business when it comes to natural products not Clorox.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have very dry lips</li>
            <li> They also have no sun screen, so I wear other balms that provide SPF when I work out in the yard.  </li>
            <li> I prefer using Burt&#x27;s Bees over any other lip balm.</li>
            <li> Its little expensive compared to other brands but its worth it.</li>
            <li> you need some serious chap lip help, look no further.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s slightly cheaper there.  </li>
            <li> The balm never really absorbed and I would end up with the taste in my mouth (which admittedly is not as harsh as chapstick or carmex on the plus side).</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t everyone like to get a little lip balm?</li>
            <li> No better than any other lip balm I have tried.</li>
            <li> I purchased a small tin of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm in a department store that included this mango butter lip balm along with four other scents.</li>
            <li> When I bought this, I was going through a weird phase where my lips, especially the edges and the surrounding skin on the chin, were very dry, flaky, and itchy.</li>
            <li> Knocked off a star for the missing lip balm.</li>
            <li> I usually use chapstick or carmex, but I&#x27;ve been trying to transition to products with fewer chemicals in them.</li>
            <li> my lips aren&#x27;t cracked and peeling like they&#x27;d usually be.</li>
            <li> Since this product works so well for me, I will give it as a small gift too and the recipients are usually tickled.  </li>
            <li> It is not as thick and heavy as Chapstick but not as gooey as lip gloss.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately this lip balm seemed to dry my lips soon after I applied it on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would like SPF 15 at least, for wearing when I&#x27;m going outdoors.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I think this made it worse.</li>
            <li> **addicted</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the lip balm.</li>
            <li> I have horrible, dry, cracking lips in the winter time-</li>
            <li> then you realize how bad artificial crap is bad for the human body.</li>
            <li> Yummy balm, keeps the lips moist and protected from the cold.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It soothes, moisturizes and keeps my lips from drying effects in wind and cold day.</li>
            <li> Also the price wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I have used Burt&#x27; s Bees for close to twenty years and I am seldom disappointed.</li>

            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and doesn&#x27;t make my lips peel.</li>
            <li> Very sweet mango flavor. Two is just right, with a wife.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite product.  I love the Subscribe and Save option because it is much cheaper than any store in town.  This leaves my lips feel soft and smooth without any weird tastes.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s so smooth.</li>
            <li> not as soft as I prefer balms to be</li>
            <li> I have super chapped lips throughout the year. This is really affordable and so good for my chapped lips. I like it so much!</li>
            <li> I always love Burt&#x27;s Bees!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just oily enough to keep your lips smooth and it smells lovely. It also all natural, the best part about it.</li>
            <li> My favorite BB lip balm. I like the peppermint balm, but this feels smoother, almost buttery. It has a sweet mango smell and a light taste. I love that it feels buttery and not sticky or waxy.  It lasts as long as the peppermint kind in the yellow tube.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm I&#x27;ve used. Lots of balms make my lips feel dried out on the inside, but this leaves my lips soft and hydrated and smells great too!</li>
            <li> Best lip balm for winter time, it soothes &amp; heals chapped lips with the mango butter so well after 1 application my lips will stop burning &amp; the skin will soften pretty quickly. Also it&#x27;s very gentle &amp; natural so great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. I usually use chapstick or carmex, but I&#x27;ve been trying to transition to products with fewer chemicals in them. I ordered these and was very excited, but when I used the balm the excitement faded. For me, they didn&#x27;t moisturize my lips. The balm never really absorbed and I would end up with the taste in my mouth (which admittedly is not as harsh as chapstick or carmex on the plus side). I played around with the amount I applied, but it didn&#x27;t help, so I&#x27;ll pass.</li>
            <li> I prefer it to the various lip balm sticks on the market because it lasts longer and is completely satisfactory in terms of keeping my lips moist and free from chapping.</li>
            <li> Keeping my lips moisturized this winter.</li>
            <li> I am definitely a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms and never tried this one until now. I can say that it goes on nice and smooth and it does condition my lips well，my friend has the same feeling with me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few, but this is my favorite.  It GLIDES on, has a light and lovely taste and &amp;#34;perfume,&amp;#34; plus it lasts a long time.  When I glop a lot of it on my lips, not because it IS gloppy, more because I have a heavy hand and I love the texture of it -- I don&#x27;t mind if I get it over the edge of my lips.  It doesn&#x27;t cause bumps, pimples or blackheads and it makes the dryness around my lips feel good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get really dry lips, so I keep a couple of these stashed around the house.  I don&#x27;t recommend keeping them in the car -- they melt into funny shapes after the heat.  They also have no sun screen, so I wear other balms that provide SPF when I work out in the yard.  But these are, BY FAR, my favorite lip balm.  I often find they are sold out on the Burts Bees Website, but they were available here for the same or less than the Burts Bees Site.

The mango-scent is okay, I&#x27;m not a big fan of this brand which is surprising considering all the good reviews I read.</li>
            <li> burt&#x27;s bees is the best</li>
            <li> Burts Bees lip balm never fails. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm. HOWEVER I purchased this 2-pack and received only 1 lip balm. Knocked off a star for the missing lip balm.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the good reviews about this. It doesn&#x27;t last and in order for my lips to feel moisturized I have to layer it up, which ends up making my lips feel oily. The EOS ones are so much better in my opinion. My friend recommended the original version, and I tried it - it&#x27;s about 400 times better than the formula of this!</li>
            <li> Smells delicious, just like fresh mango. Goes on clear and creamy, not greasy, velvety smooth. Hydrates lips and leaves them feeling smooth and plump.</li>
            <li> burts bees is amazing! Love the mango chapstick!</li>
            <li> This is truly good stuff, I got the twin pack so my mom can try one out. I keep this on my nightstand and put it on before I go to sleep- in the morning my lips aren&#x27;t cracked and peeling like they&#x27;d usually be. It has just the right amount of a subtle and natural mango scent with no gross sweetness or aftertaste. Another great thing is how few times I use it in the course of a day; it&#x27;s pretty long-lasting and as the texture isn&#x27;t waxy or too greasy, I&#x27;m not compelled to apply more and more like a maniac. Lastly, it is 100% natural (though not vegan due to the lanolin) which is important since we do ingest a a bit of lip balm each time we use it.</li>
            <li> soft lips. check. great scent. check. win!</li>
            <li> I live in the hot desert air, and my lips are always getting chapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried probably most of the lip balms on the market, but I always come back to Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.&lt;br /&gt;The product really hydrates my lips, and I just love the taste of mango.  ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need some serious chap lip help, look no further.  This is the product.  The deal for two of them is fair enough eith &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; (or whatever you call it) at just about 5 bucks, delivered to your door.</li>
            <li> This Mango Butter is our favorite Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm.  It smells wonderful and leaves your lips feeling soft and hydrated.  We buy ours at Wal-Mart and always get the two pack, it&#x27;s slightly cheaper there.  I love that it has all natural ingredients.  I would recommend this lip balm.  Debi B.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand off and on for years so I know their history. There is nothing wrong with the lip balm. Does the job. I just prefer to support small business when it comes to natural products not Clorox. I bought this as a gift but ended up keeping it so I put it to use.</li>
            <li> I have used Burt&#x27; s Bees for close to twenty years and I am seldom disappointed. This lip balm is no exception. It glides on my lips nicely and stays with me even after I&#x27;ve had a sip of a beverage. It does not clump and the mango scent is nice.</li>
            <li> very soothing and smell good! Love it!</li>
            <li> I love everything about this variety of lip balm. It smells great, tastes wonderful and does a good job conditioning my lips. It also has good lasting power so no need to keep reapplying.</li>
            <li> Another favorite lip balm!  Healthy ingredients, smells fabulous, no tint and no peppermint oil.  I gave one to my Mom who is picky about her lip balm too and she LOVES it!  Great value in the two pack, too.</li>
            <li> Although a little on the expensive side for chapstick, I love how easily it glides on and the slight mango smell. It&#x27;s even more reassuring knowing there aren&#x27;t any harsh chemicals in the chapstick.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff, it&#x27;s the perfect mix of lip gloss and lip balm. It&#x27;s not sticky, not waxy, at the same time not too glossy. It leaves my lips feeling soft and wonderful. This is so different than burt&#x27;s bees original lip balm, the original is much waxier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to pretty much all lipsticks, including the &amp;#34;hypoallergenic&amp;#34; ones, and this is the only stuff that I can use.  Of all of the &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; this is my favorite. I buy it pretty much all the time because I tend to lose them....</li>
            <li> While I think this product is a bit pricey...it remains #1 for me.  I am not a fan of other Burt&#x27;s Bees balms, and I&#x27;ve tried so many organic products and inorganic products that I feel like my opinion is stemming from a full spectrum background.  The organic lip balms do work best for me.  This product goes on smooth, feels good, stays on for a decent length of time and just plain ole works for me.  I was quite pleased when I saw it is now offered on Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save program...so I signed up right away.  Since this product works so well for me, I will give it as a small gift too and the recipients are usually tickled.  Doesn&#x27;t everyone like to get a little lip balm?</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I purchased this to replace a Yes to Carrots lip balm that I keep on my nightstand for before bedtime application. I was looking for something that was natural, smelled nice, and didn&#x27;t leave that Chapstick-like residue on my lips. Very content with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Works well and tastes and smells great!</li>
            <li> When I bought this, I was going through a weird phase where my lips, especially the edges and the surrounding skin on the chin, were very dry, flaky, and itchy. I think it was either allergies or the horrid winter air in early 2014. I tried so many things including Vaseline, C.O. Bigelow, organic lip balms, homemade lip balms from the farmers market, Cerave, Clinique, etc. This did nothing for my dry lips. Sometimes I think this made it worse. It was good for about ten minutes, if even that, then my lips started itching again. I finally found something else that solved the problem immediately (The Face Shop Lovely ME:EX I&#x27;m Shea Butter Lip Care, if anyone&#x27;s wondering).</li>
            <li> No better than any other lip balm I have tried.</li>
            <li> If you want smooth.and silky without color, this works good. I wear it at night so my lips won&#x27;t be soo chapped.</li>
            <li> This the best lip balm ever in my opinion and I&#x27;ve used all of them from cheap to the super expensive.  This is my favorite.  It is not as thick and heavy as Chapstick but not as gooey as lip gloss.  It is absorbed quickly and keeps your lips looking and feeling great.  It&#x27;s just perfect for everyone and the mango smells and tastes yummy!  I have one in my desk at work and one in my purse at all times.  Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> These work great and the price is pretty good as well. The reason I&#x27;m giving it four stars is because the one I ordered did not come. I got the pomegranate one. The package did come on time and wasn&#x27;t damaged.</li>
            <li> smells just like mango...perfect !!!!</li>
            <li> It is what it is, my girls like it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this flavor of lip balm because it&#x27;s creamy, smells great and softens my lips every time I use it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for my lip.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this chapstick</li>
            <li> Melts in your pocket.  I&#x27;ve come to appreciate bananna boat, which doesn&#x27;t melt in a warm climate.</li>
            <li> Yummy balm, keeps the lips moist and protected from the cold. Safeway&#x27;s been out of stock so it&#x27;s thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> The mango butter is a lot easier to apply than the peppermint and I love how silky it is on my lips.</li>
            <li> I will admit this is a great chap stick. It gets the job done, it feels good, and it isn&#x27;t flavored poorly. It is much better than lip smackers (which is chalky, but great flavored), but it is the same quality to me as Chap Stick, and Blistex, and not as good as Softlips. I would give this product a 4 or 5 if it was a more reasonable price compared to it&#x27;s competition, but it isn&#x27;t well priced either online or in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would suggest it to people, mainly people who prefer organic items or more natural items. It wouldn&#x27;t be my first suggestion to people though, softlips would be.</li>
            <li> Original Burt&#x27;s ! Work lovely on my lips!</li>
            <li> Great lip balm for the price. I bought it for my girlfriend and she loves it. :)</li>
            <li> Great value! And smells good</li>
            <li> Very tasty.  It does a good job keeping your lips moisturized.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good lip balm.</li>
            <li> This Burts Bees is fruit flavor.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this and was not that all impressed. I put it on and thought it was just super. A few minutes later my lips were feeling very parched like I had never done a thing. Guess the Kokum butter is not that great for long term relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I keep the original Burts and my caramex around and go back and forth. The original is great in my book. I have bought several and keep one in the car, in the office, one in my messenger bag.</li>
            <li> This is a good lip balm but it is possible to have an allergic reaction to it.  Mango trees are in the same family as poison ivy, Anacardiaceae, and mango seed oil may contain the same irritant, urushiol.  After a month of using this product, I developed severely chapped, almost blistered lips and upset digestion that went away a week after discontinuing use.  If you are sensitive to poison ivy, like me, then perhaps use this product sparingly.  That being said, I still &amp;lt;3 Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!!  Best lip balm for dry lips!!  It&#x27;s very moisturizing!!  I&#x27;m NOT a Chapstick, Blistek, or Carmex fan &amp; I don&#x27;t care for Vaseline for lips.  I prefer Burt&#x27;s Bees &amp; I only purchase the Mango Butter one.  It&#x27;s heaper on here too!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite burt&#x27;s bees balm yet.  Very smooth and silky and smells... amazing!</li>
            <li> I am definitely a fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balms and never tried this one until now. I can say that it goes on nice and smooth and it does condition my lips well. I have a real problem with chapped lips and I just use this a few times per day and it really helps lock in the moisture!</li>
            <li> Attractive in quality and price!&lt;br /&gt;It soothes, moisturizes and keeps my lips from drying effects in wind and cold day.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm of all Burt&#x27;s Bees balms.  It goes on the smoothest and has an amazing scent.</li>
            <li> This lip balm is the best! It smells and tastes sooo good and always leaves my lips feeling insanely soft.</li>
            <li> I purchased a small tin of Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm in a department store that included this mango butter lip balm along with four other scents. I was impressed with all of them! This lip balm goes on smooth and keeps my lips moisturized and soft. I prefer using Burt&#x27;s Bees over any other lip balm. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Smooth and stays moist for awhile. Feels good and like the natural ingredients. Also the price wasn&#x27;t bad. I love trying new natual lip balms.</li>
            <li> The smell is not too strong and the balm is not sticky or oily. I don&#x27;t feel that it really creates long term softness, but it is good for cold days or when healing from a cold or sickness.</li>
            <li> Did not provide lasting moisture. I think there may be some kind of drying agent in the product. If you don&#x27;t mind reapplying all day, it does smell lovely. For long-lasting moisture and protection, I recommend the Burt&#x27;s Bees Honey Lip Balm.</li>
            <li> I have horrible, dry, cracking lips in the winter time- I have used just about every single chapstick out there. This one I am in LOVE with. It not only smells, tastes good, but it actually works- just in a couple weeks my lips were healing! Now they are smooth and pretty looking again. I use it every day just to continue the smoothness and you can tell its working each time I put it on!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have very dry lips and this is the only product I use on my lips to prevent it from drying out. When I put this lip balm on my lips, my lips feel so soft and looks so smooth. This lip balm nourishes and moisten my lips by keeping it protected. The mango butter flavor smells great and it is pack with vitamin E and A. The thing I love about this lip balm is it smells great and lock the moisture in my lips. If you want to say good bye to chap lips and hello to beautiful lips get this lip balm.</li>
            <li> This is the only chapstick I&#x27;ll actually use because, unlike most others IT WORKS!  The smell is good but the ingredients actually help to protect my lips from looking like sharkskin during winter.  I have bought this every year since coming to Boston</li>
            <li> best lip balm. I used another chapstick when this ran out but my lips were drying out in one day, so I went back to this asap and its all back to normal. then you realize how bad artificial crap is bad for the human body. the closest to natural of anything you can use, the better. so far you don&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff--it&#x27;s pleasant on the lips and smells really good.</li>
            <li> My first observation after using this was that it goes on more smoothly than other lip balms. If you have used some of the long lasting lipsticks you will notice that despite adding an outer moistening coat your lips will dry and get chapped sometimes. Using this lip balm first goes a long way in preventing this. We&#x27;ve had a pretty severe winter in the north east this year and the liberal use of Burts bee mango butter lip balm has kept my lips moist and supple. Add the fact that this is mostly natural and quite economical and I rate this at five stars.</li>
            <li> The only in best lip balm I have ever used. Takes the dry skin right off of you lips. Kisses</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm (various flavors) for many years. It has the quality I look for without ingredients I don&#x27;t want to put on my lips, such as petroleum jelly. Seems pricier than other brands, but lasts much longer.  like to keep several of these  at various locations in the house as well as in my tote bag, so I always have one close at hand. Would give 5 stars except for 2 things: The flavor doesn&#x27;t last very long after opening for the first time, and there is no SPF. Would like SPF 15 at least, for wearing when I&#x27;m going outdoors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good to meet my expectation. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the fan of Burt&#x27;s Bee. The mango smell is great. Definitely will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Amazing as always **addicted** to Burt&#x27;s bees wax!  I have al lthe flavors. It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as the coconut of vit E version, not as red tinted as the cranberry or pomegranate, but great moisturization for my &amp;#34;every day and all day&amp;#34; chapstick (I live in a really dry climate and would die without it!)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since more than 2 years. It works well in winters for dry lips. Keep them moisturized. Its little expensive compared to other brands but its worth it. Burt Bee&#x27;s you rock!</li>
