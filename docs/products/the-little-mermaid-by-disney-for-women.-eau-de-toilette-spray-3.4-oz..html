    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Granddaughter  loved  it!</li>
            <li>If I had paid the list price that is shown I would not be happy.</li>
            <li>It was still very nice</li>
            <li>Smells great and is good for a Disney character lover fan or kids just wanting to see their favorite princess!</li>
            <li>but I got one that has ariel in bright colors and a crown for the cap.</li>
            <li>and I felt she would have loved it.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is huge beautiful and glass.</li>
            <li>It was in a nice bottle and everything, but I think that might have ruined it for me.</li>
            <li>Since I make my own perfume I can tell the scent</li>
            <li>Its smells great and was very prompt.</li>
            <li>I, like some others, wish I read more about it.</li>
            <li>The top of the plastic wasn&#x27;t even glued anymore, as if someone had tried opening it.</li>
            <li>It looks more like something you buy a toddler and not the bottle pictured.</li>
            <li>i was still 4 i would love it,</li>
            <li>I love this scent and when I run out I know exactly where to go to, to get more for a great low price Amazon.</li>
            <li>I guess I have no choice but to keep it now, because Amazon&#x27;s policy is &amp;#34;Any item that is considered hazardous or capable of being flammable&amp;#34; canNOT be returned.</li>
            <li>(I got free shipping</li>
            <li>For this particular order, the LOOK of the bottle was more important</li>
            <li>Pretty packaging, light and airy scent, and a great gift idea for someone who loves Disney&#x27;s The Little Mermaid movie.</li>
            <li>For what I payed, it was not even worth it.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the $16 for it</li>
            <li>First of all, I did not receive what is pictured...</li>
            <li>First of all, when the package arrived in the mail, the bottom of the box was not even taped all the way.</li>
            <li>sadly im not.</li>
            <li>I really wish I had read the reviews first.</li>
            <li>The Little Mermaid is not the most popular princess right now, so to find Little Mermaid Cologne is really exciting.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box, I saw a nice looking little Ariel box wrapped in plastic...</li>
            <li>I was very upset</li>
            <li>I wish I could give a No Star review as I am very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend LOVES Disney and Ariel, so we were both very stunned by the lack of quality.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much</li>
            <li>I didnt know how much 3.4OZ was</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I disregarded that, and then opened the normal box the rest of the way.</li>
            <li>This was supposed to be a gift for an older girl not a 3 year old.</li>
            <li>The bottle I received was different and very much cartoony.</li>
            <li>Its not the same perfume I ordered the first time.</li>
            <li>I ordered it for my 17 year old daughter because the box and bottle are very classy looking</li>
            <li>I was really surprised, and it didn&#x27;t help that the box had already looked like it had been opened.</li>
            <li>Only reason for two stars is because it is for my 4 year old daughter</li>
            <li>Show an image &amp; send that image, if there is a chance of a different item bein delivered, it should clearly marked as such.</li>

            <li> Very charming and inviting smell, but I was disappointed about a few things.</li>
            <li> I have to hope I can give it to some little girl (currently I don&#x27;t have one in my life) because I won&#x27;t be giving it to my 17 year old.  </li>
            <li> However, the photo of the product looks like a classic, collectible piece that would be acceptable to give an adult female as a novelty gift.</li>
            <li> blue n looks like a little kid perfume.</li>
            <li> However, upon opening my package, I saw that there was a pink and purple bottle, with a plastic crown as the lid.</li>
            <li> the scent is very off-putting and not pleasant at all.. not worth buying .. bought it for my daughter and it makes us both gag</li>
            <li> The smell is passable but its not as fresh as i imagined it would be, still its nothing as bad as the bottle which has a sticker decal and a pink plastic</li>
            <li> i got a little mermaid perfume but the bottle and box looked nothing like this.</li>
            <li> i would return it but its still little mermaid and fits my girlfriend&#x27;s collection</li>
            <li> so I was expecting a little plastic bottle with little scent to it...</li>
            <li> The picture shows a pretty bottle and we received a plastic ugly bottle.</li>
            <li> What i got instead was cheesy perfume for little girls that smells like dish soap.</li>
            <li> I am not happy at all with this</li>
            <li> Another thing that was wrong, was the cap for the perfume was cracked.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I should have read the reviews before I ordered this item.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.  </li>
            <li> Ummmmm shouldn&#x27;t i be contacted and told that my package has a delay instead of sending the wrong thing.</li>
            <li> false advertising!</li>
            <li> My package was delivered in a timely manner, but my biggest disappointment was that the bottle shape &amp; style I recieved was not the bottle shape &amp; style depicted when I ordered.</li>
            <li> Badly labelled on amazon</li>
            <li> i am extremely disappointed and recommend not ordering this product.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed upon hearing this, and I will contact Amazon to try to work something out.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with that aspect.</li>
            <li> Very, very disappointed!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The picture shows a pretty bottle and we received a plastic ugly bottle. This was supposed to be a gift for an older girl not a 3 year old.</li>
            <li> The Little Mermaid is not the most popular princess right now, so to find Little Mermaid Cologne is really exciting. It was not overly priced either.</li>
            <li> Its not the same perfume I ordered the first time. I was very upset when I got it, it doesn&#x27;t even smell the same.</li>
            <li> This product would have received 5 stars if it actually looked like that. Its smells great and was very prompt. However, the photo of the product looks like a classic, collectible piece that would be acceptable to give an adult female as a novelty gift. However, upon opening my package, I saw that there was a pink and purple bottle, with a plastic crown as the lid. It looks tacky, and childlike.</li>
            <li> The bottle I received was different and very much cartoony. I would have preferred the one shown in the photo since i got it for someone who is 25. I purchased this thinking I was going to receive the same model in the picture but I got one that has ariel in bright colors and a crown for the cap. It was still very nice I just wish they would have placed that photo instead. I would have bought another bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is good for a Disney character lover fan or kids just wanting to see their favorite princess!</li>
            <li> i got a little mermaid perfume but the bottle and box looked nothing like this. i would return it but its still little mermaid and fits my girlfriend&#x27;s collection</li>
            <li> Not even close to the same item as pictured. I wish I could give a No Star review as I am very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Granddaughter  loved  it!</li>
            <li> I am not happy at all with this and here is why. First of all, I did not receive what is pictured...false advertising! What i got instead was cheesy perfume for little girls that smells like dish soap. For what I payed, it was not even worth it. I really wish I had read the reviews first. i am extremely disappointed and recommend not ordering this product.</li>
            <li> I, like some others, wish I read more about it. Definitely not what I thought I was getting.  Only reason for two stars is because it is for my 4 year old daughter and I know she will like it. Amazon definitely needs to change the picture to one of the actual product - a child&#x27;s play perfume. If I had paid the list price that is shown I would not be happy. Even at $12 I feel like I over paid.</li>
            <li> Very charming and inviting smell, but I was disappointed about a few things. First of all, when the package arrived in the mail, the bottom of the box was not even taped all the way. I would say about only 1/3 of it was taped. When I opened the box, I saw a nice looking little Ariel box wrapped in plastic...but there was a problem. The top of the plastic wasn&#x27;t even glued anymore, as if someone had tried opening it. I disregarded that, and then opened the normal box the rest of the way. What do ya know, it ended up looking like someone had already used some of the perfume. I was really surprised, and it didn&#x27;t help that the box had already looked like it had been opened. It was in a nice bottle and everything, but I think that might have ruined it for me. Another thing that was wrong, was the cap for the perfume was cracked. I guess I have no choice but to keep it now, because Amazon&#x27;s policy is &amp;#34;Any item that is considered hazardous or capable of being flammable&amp;#34; canNOT be returned. I was disappointed upon hearing this, and I will contact Amazon to try to work something out. My girlfriend LOVES Disney and Ariel, so we were both very stunned by the lack of quality.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I should have read the reviews before I ordered this item.  I ordered it for my 17 year old daughter because the box and bottle are very classy looking and I felt she would have loved it.  However I too got the child like box and bottle.  Not impressed at all.  From what I am reading I can&#x27;t return it so I have to hope I can give it to some little girl (currently I don&#x27;t have one in my life) because I won&#x27;t be giving it to my 17 year old.  Very, very disappointed!</li>
            <li> I got a different perfume all together, different bottle, different box and was told the one i bought wasnt at the warehouse. Ummmmm shouldn&#x27;t i be contacted and told that my package has a delay instead of sending the wrong thing. Badly labelled on amazon</li>
            <li> Pretty packaging, light and airy scent, and a great gift idea for someone who loves Disney&#x27;s The Little Mermaid movie.</li>
            <li> It looks more like something you buy a toddler and not the bottle pictured. The smell is passable but its not as fresh as i imagined it would be, still its nothing as bad as the bottle which has a sticker decal and a pink plastic i was still 4 i would love it, sadly im not.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even the bottle that&#x27;s advertised. It&#x27;s a completely different package and perfume, the one I got is blue n looks like a little kid perfume.</li>
            <li> My package was delivered in a timely manner, but my biggest disappointment was that the bottle shape &amp; style I recieved was not the bottle shape &amp; style depicted when I ordered. For this particular order, the LOOK of the bottle was more important then the smell of the contents. Very unhappy with that aspect. Show an image &amp; send that image, if there is a chance of a different item bein delivered, it should clearly marked as such.</li>
            <li> the scent is very off-putting and not pleasant at all.. not worth buying .. bought it for my daughter and it makes us both gag</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much I didnt know how much 3.4OZ was so I was expecting a little plastic bottle with little scent to it...boy did I get a shocker...The bottle is huge beautiful and glass. The perfume itself smells like Lavender mixed with red roses. Since I make my own perfume I can tell the scent but Ive never tried mixing those two together before. This is well worth the $16 for it (I got free shipping so I cant say anything about that) I love this scent and when I run out I know exactly where to go to, to get more for a great low price Amazon. Thanks</li>
            <li> I got some sort of children&#x27;s perfume that smells like a gasoline, and looks NOTHING like the pictured item. Wish I could get my money back..but I can&#x27;t, so just wanted to warn the masses.</li>
