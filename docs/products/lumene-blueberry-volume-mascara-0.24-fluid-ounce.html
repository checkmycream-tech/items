            <li>This is amazing</li>
            <li>and my eyes don&#x27;t burn or get flakes of mascara in them, which is amazing.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, works good!</li>
            <li>I have been using this brand for 4 years now, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>First off, this mascara is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Love this product....</li>
            <li>But it might be okay for someone else.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe such a great mascara is so affordable!  </li>
            <li>They love it but say it runs a bit.</li>
            <li>Sure like it . .</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK looking.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this product</li>
            <li>the brush separates and coats my lashes evenly and stays dry and perfect all day.</li>
            <li>Love the chemical free aspect.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff so much!!!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smudge easily and doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
            <li>Easy to remove without ending up under your eyes throughout the day.</li>
            <li>comes off easily when I shower .I</li>
            <li>It stays on all day and comes off relatively easy with water.</li>
            <li>It is easy to remove as well without pulling out lashes</li>
            <li>Works well on my fine, sparse lashes.</li>
            <li>I love this experience so much I quickly re-ordered to ensure I never need make a substitution.</li>
            <li>The brush is not as nice as the 100% pure.</li>
            <li>so this is important to me.</li>
            <li>It seperates the lashes beautifully with this cool plastic brush that has tiny comb-like bristles.</li>
            <li>I like it better than mascaras priced two or three times higher.</li>
            <li>Great mascara - makes my eyelashes look very long.</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are more natural.</li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend &amp; repurchase this mascara because it does its job very well, and makes your eyelashes look ridiculously good!</li>
            <li>certain mascaras make my eyes water, then  most of the mascara ends up under my eyes .</li>
            <li>It is a good mascara, but I will pay the extra $5.00 for 100% pure :)</li>
            <li>The bottle it comes in is so pretty, and the mascara wand is a unique comb style that makes avoiding clumpy eyelashes INCREDIBLY easy.</li>
            <li>This mascara is a dream come true.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick too.</li>
            <li>I love that this is a natural product, and it stays on all day without smudging!</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural !</li>
            <li>No clumping here, and as far as I&#x27;ve been able to research, Lumene does not test on animals.</li>
            <li>It makes my eyes look exotic yet natural.  </li>
            <li>Clumpy pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>ever seemed really right.  </li>
            <li>Am 64 years old and this, above all Department Store, and name brand cosmetic lines, provides gorgeous lashes.</li>
            <li>I love how it leaves my lashes moisturized and not dry.</li>
            <li>I rarely stick to buying the same mascara, always searching for something better.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Lumene + Amazon!</li>
            <li>And the icing on the cake is the fact that it only cost me six bucks. :)</li>
            <li>This is my first time using organic mascara.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only available online, never clumps, and lasts all day!</li>
            <li>The color is a rich black, and the formula is very smooth.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical when purchasing this, however I absolutely love this product, it makes my short lashes look great and accents my eyes, I do not have any flaking or smudging, it comes off easy enough when I wash it off with a mild eye make up remover</li>
            <li>Particularly with the price, I will be purchasing again and saving for gifts!</li>
            <li>you could even wear it two days straight if you really wanted</li>
            <li>To my surprise this works really well.  </li>
            <li>Finding one that does ALL of those things is VERY difficult.&lt;br /&gt;Previously using Tarte</li>
            <li>long lasting, good for sensitive eyes.  </li>
            <li>I normally use 100% pure</li>
            <li>It is crazy how good this mascara is and how easy it goes on and comes off.  </li>
            <li>Anyhow, though I loved that brand I had to get a different one which will does the same job and with the same quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s so much better for your eyelashes than all those other chemical-y mascaras!!</li>
            <li>Natural looking yet very defining and lengthening.  </li>
            <li>Mascara was always my most essential daily makeup product so finding one that replaced my former favorite (which apparently was ridden with chemicals) was a long road.  </li>
            <li>It does flake a little, but I can deal with it with such nice results.</li>
            <li>First one in my entire life!</li>
            <li>I have tried so many organic mascaras and regular mascara and have always made due as nothing</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this mascara based on the reviews, but it is not my favorite :(</li>
            <li>natural, no smudges,</li>
            <li>Which to me, makes sense because it&#x27;s fairly natural.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I bought one for my daughter and she feels absolutely the same way.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t love this mascara, it goes on thin and doesn&#x27;t really do anything for volume..</li>
            <li>I have short, blonde lashes and this makes them have so much length and very black :)</li>
            <li>A tip for those of us who live in the cold and snow for half the year, run tube under warm water for a minute so the mixture isn&#x27;t pasty.  :)</li>
            <li>Very dark black, which is ok if you&#x27;re into that.</li>
            <li>I live in Texas, and even with the heat or actual crying this mascara stays on very well.</li>
            <li>use three coats to get a more dramatic look for the evenings .</li>
            <li>Very nice mascara; makes my thin lashes fluffy and long.  </li>
            <li>Her eyelash game strong though, not gonna lie.</li>

            <li> Very nice mascara; makes my thin lashes fluffy and long.  </li>
            <li> Her eyelash game strong though, not gonna lie.</li>
            <li> and I really like the application brush which is stiff and allows you to get to the root of the lashes and doesn’t create clumps.  </li>
            <li> But it didn&#x27;t go on smoothly, was a bit thick for my taste, a little &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long eyelashes</li>
            <li> The mascara actually volumizes your eyelashes with a little added length.</li>
            <li> I add one drop of lavender essential oil and it goes one a little smoother, lasts longer and does not clump.  </li>
            <li> No flaking and minimal clumping.</li>
            <li> The only thing is, my eyelids would be itchy for a few days after wearing it!</li>
            <li> Mascara usually disappears off my greasy lashes by mid day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s organic!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little wet...</li>
            <li> The only issue I&#x27;ve had is that it is actually a little hard to remove -</li>
            <li> It doesn’t flake off, in fact it does take a little work to remove; but I prefer that to raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> It is very hard with short bristles.  </li>
            <li> A very average mascara that does little to enhance lashes beyond darkening them.</li>
            <li> I purchased Physician&#x27;s Formula brand before, and it smudged like I had been crying all day.</li>
            <li> This black mascara contains 100% organic blueberry!  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to remove?)</li>
            <li> The brush is too hard.</li>
            <li> so go slow in order to not flick it underneath your lashes.</li>
            <li> Goes on well but a bit thick for me.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find a quality mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump and that isn&#x27;t tested on animals.</li>
            <li> Very very hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I bought it because the drugstore brand I previously owned flaked like crazy and irritated my eyes.</li>
            <li> I also find that specks get in my eye throughout the day so that is irritating.</li>
            <li> Biggest issue is that it is very difficult to get off.  </li>
            <li> I hate it when my lashes stick together...</li>

            <li> I was a bit skeptical when purchasing this, however I absolutely love this product, it makes my short lashes look great and accents my eyes, I do not have any flaking or smudging, it comes off easy enough when I wash it off with a mild eye make up remover - I definitely will keep using this.</li>
            <li> Great mascara - makes my eyelashes look very long. Doesn&#x27;t smudge. The only issue I&#x27;ve had is that it is actually a little hard to remove - you could even wear it two days straight if you really wanted (so maybe it&#x27;s a good thing it&#x27;s hard to remove?) - Kerry</li>
            <li> To my surprise this works really well.  I&#x27;m trying to get away from all the chemicals in cosmetics &amp; this one I will purchase again 😀</li>
            <li> Wonderful mascara. It lengthens, thickens, does NOT flake, does not irritate or burn after wearing for several hours and stays on until I remove it with a make up remover. Finding one that does ALL of those things is VERY difficult.&lt;br /&gt;Previously using Tarte but, as one reviewer said, it too caused me to get a stye. First one in my entire life! Anyhow, though I loved that brand I had to get a different one which will does the same job and with the same quality. Lumene comes to the rescue. Very pleased with it. The shipping was quick too. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> A truly great mascara. And I&#x27;m picky! It&#x27;s organic!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little wet...so go slow in order to not flick it underneath your lashes.</li>
            <li> every woman in the world who uses makeup has their favorites, this is one of mine! natural, no smudges, no clumping.....no kidding! long lasting, good for sensitive eyes.  I have been using this brand for 4 years now, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> This works great and stays on well.  My only suggestion for improvement would be to the brush.  It is very hard with short bristles.  I feel a different brush would only enhance the product.</li>
            <li> Very nice mascara; makes my thin lashes fluffy and long.  It does flake a little, but I can deal with it with such nice results.</li>
            <li> Goes on well but a bit thick for me.  Stays on and takes a bit of doing to get off even with oil.</li>
            <li> I love this experience so much I quickly re-ordered to ensure I never need make a substitution. Am 64 years old and this, above all Department Store, and name brand cosmetic lines, provides gorgeous lashes. You can imagine my delight. Thanks, Lumene + Amazon!</li>
            <li> Everything about this mascara is absolutely perfect. The bottle it comes in is so pretty, and the mascara wand is a unique comb style that makes avoiding clumpy eyelashes INCREDIBLY easy. The color is a rich black, and the formula is very smooth. Plus, it&#x27;s so much better for your eyelashes than all those other chemical-y mascaras!! And the icing on the cake is the fact that it only cost me six bucks. :)</li>
            <li> Excellent mascara-- much better than anticipated!! Didn&#x27;t have any problems with clumping and was amazed that it went all day without&lt;br /&gt;me having to reapply a second coat! Will definitely buy again! Very pleased!!</li>
            <li> I really liked it...made eyelashes pop with no clumping! The only thing is, my eyelids would be itchy for a few days after wearing it! Bummer! 😒</li>
            <li> Excellent mascara. I love how it leaves my lashes moisturized and not dry.</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients are more natural. I purchased Physician&#x27;s Formula brand before, and it smudged like I had been crying all day. I live in Texas, and even with the heat or actual crying this mascara stays on very well. Particularly with the price, I will be purchasing again and saving for gifts!</li>
            <li> Best mascara without parabens I have found. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This is the only mascara I use. It&#x27;s very hard to find a quality mascara that doesn&#x27;t clump and that isn&#x27;t tested on animals. No clumping here, and as far as I&#x27;ve been able to research, Lumene does not test on animals.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this mascara based on the reviews, but it is not my favorite :( I decided to try it because I typically only use organic products and this has organic blueberry. I normally use 100% pure and I love it! It is $15 instead of $10, so that is why I tried it. I wash my face with an oil cleanser and the mascara smeared all over my face. The brush is not as nice as the 100% pure. It is a good mascara, but I will pay the extra $5.00 for 100% pure :)</li>
            <li> Very good mascara. Doesn&#x27;t smudge easily and doesn&#x27;t clump. I hate it when my lashes stick together... drives me nuts and this stuff doesn&#x27;t stick.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;m happy with the way it coats the lashes without being too clumpy. Easy to remove without ending up under your eyes throughout the day.</li>
            <li> certain mascaras make my eyes water, then  most of the mascara ends up under my eyes . this mascara doesn&#x27;t clump or smear ( or make my eyes water) .It comes off easily when I shower .I use three coats to get a more dramatic look for the evenings .</li>
            <li> Very very hard to remove. Good mascara. Clumpy pretty quickly. I am not impressed enough to buy again, physicians formula is better</li>
            <li> This black mascara contains 100% organic blueberry!  Prefer this mascara than the waterproof version because it comes off easier.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, works good!</li>
            <li> Great mascara! I love that this is a natural product, and it stays on all day without smudging!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much!!! I rarely stick to buying the same mascara, always searching for something better. This is amazing and I&#x27;ve been buying for some time now! I have short, blonde lashes and this makes them have so much length and very black :)</li>
            <li> Mascara doesn&#x27;t clump, separates lashes.</li>
            <li> The very best “non-toxic” mascara!  I began looking everything up on EWG’s website a couple years ago.  Mascara was always my most essential daily makeup product so finding one that replaced my former favorite (which apparently was ridden with chemicals) was a long road.  This one is great because it builds well for a fuller affect if that’s desired and I really like the application brush which is stiff and allows you to get to the root of the lashes and doesn’t create clumps.  It doesn’t flake off, in fact it does take a little work to remove; but I prefer that to raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> A very average mascara that does little to enhance lashes beyond darkening them.</li>
            <li> First off, this mascara is AMAZING! It seperates the lashes beautifully with this cool plastic brush that has tiny comb-like bristles. The mascara actually volumizes your eyelashes with a little added length. And the best part is it doesn&#x27;t clump or flake! So no raccoon eyes or spider leg lashes. It stays on all day and comes off relatively easy with water. I definitely would recommend &amp; repurchase this mascara because it does its job very well, and makes your eyelashes look ridiculously good!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love this mascara, it goes on thin and doesn&#x27;t really do anything for volume.. It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s organic, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this product....the brush separates and coats my lashes evenly and stays dry and perfect all day.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me. i was allergic. But it might be okay for someone else.</li>
            <li> Best &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; mascara I have found.  Looks great on.  Wears well.  No clumps.  Natural looking yet very defining and lengthening.  Rated well by EWG.  I can&#x27;t believe such a great mascara is so affordable!  Do not hesitate to try this mascara.  I like it better than mascaras priced two or three times higher.</li>
            <li> The brush is too hard.</li>
            <li> I add one drop of lavender essential oil and it goes one a little smoother, lasts longer and does not clump.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Bought this for a friend. They love it but say it runs a bit. Which to me, makes sense because it&#x27;s fairly natural. Her eyelash game strong though, not gonna lie.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara ! It makes my lashes look awesome. It doesn&#x27;t flake off,  I love that it is all natural !</li>
            <li> Sure like it . . goes on well, need only two coats, does not smear or flake even overnight if I forget to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It makes my eyes look exotic yet natural.  There is no clumping and the color makes my eyes pop out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK looking.  Biggest issue is that it is very difficult to get off.  I wash with oil and I have to go over my eyes a second time.  I think I have it all off but find, in the morning, that it is still there!  Yuck.  I also find that specks get in my eye throughout the day so that is irritating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely thrilled with this mascara! I bought it because the drugstore brand I previously owned flaked like crazy and irritated my eyes. This mascara is a dream come true. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using organic mascara.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I have very short stubby eye lashes so the one thing I would change if I could would be the applicator.  The applicator doesn&#x27;t have a lot of bristles.  But I will probably buy it again anyway.</li>
            <li> No clumps and my lashes seem to like this mascara. I will keep this mascara in my makeup arsenal. It is easy to remove as well without pulling out lashes</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mascara! It&#x27;s only available online, never clumps, and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> Most amazing mascara ever!!  I have tried so many organic mascaras and regular mascara and have always made due as nothing ever seemed really right.  Until this mascara.  It is awesome!  I bought one for my daughter and she feels absolutely the same way.  It is crazy how good this mascara is and how easy it goes on and comes off.  No smearing or dripping when eyes tear up ( I wear contacts) so this is important to me. Not waterproof but excellent quality.  Love love love this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works well on my fine, sparse lashes. Lengthens and separates great.  No flaking and minimal clumping. Mascara usually disappears off my greasy lashes by mid day this mascara will still be on my lashes the next morning if I don&#x27;t remove it at night!   Love the chemical free aspect. ** update** since starting use of this product 6 weeks or so, my lashes are growing longer and thicker!</li>
            <li> Very dark black, which is ok if you&#x27;re into that. But it didn&#x27;t go on smoothly, was a bit thick for my taste, a little &amp;#34;spidery&amp;#34;. Plus it flaked off throughout the day and gave me the under-eye speckles. Not a fan, back to my Ecco Bella.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff! I don&#x27;t even have to apply more than one layer! I have naturally long eyelashes so this mascara only compliments them! I have been wearing it for about a week now and my eyes don&#x27;t burn or get flakes of mascara in them, which is amazing. A tip for those of us who live in the cold and snow for half the year, run tube under warm water for a minute so the mixture isn&#x27;t pasty.  :)</li>
