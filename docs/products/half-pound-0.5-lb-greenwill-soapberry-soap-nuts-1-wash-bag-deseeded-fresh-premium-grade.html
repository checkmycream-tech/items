            <li>Unfortunately, I did not receive the FREE Wash Bag, , however Greenwill customer service was excellent and offered prompt correction of the oversight without my even asking.  </li>
            <li>The clothes came out fresh smelling immediately(not perfumey, but fresh) and the wool balls made everything come out of the dryer softer.</li>
            <li>For $4 this is TOTALLY worth the try.to chemically laden detergents.</li>
            <li>For $4 this is TOTALLY worth the try.</li>
            <li>I have used the fresh berry before and they do create bubbles and slippery soapy liquid but not this one.</li>
            <li>My family didn&#x27;t notice right away, until they put on their clothes.</li>
            <li>I added exactly nothing to the machine except of soap nuts, used temperature of 80.</li>
            <li>I use 10 berries because most of my loads are on the larger side.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and did NOT tell my family for the first week.</li>
            <li>I also only use the soap berries for my shampoo now, if you haven&#x27;t tried it please do (you will love the results).</li>
            <li>Super soft clothes and no scent.  </li>
            <li>We will definitely be incorporating more natural products into our lives that have been around for thousands of years!</li>
            <li>Some are in larger pieces, but they work just fine.</li>
            <li>Cleans the clothes very well and according to the pamphlet that came with them, there are</li>

            <li>My girls kept commenting on how fresh and soft their clothes felt.</li>
            <li>I am really digging these soapberries for washing clothes and my hair.</li>
            <li>I did like that the Muslim bag was thick and a good width.</li>
            <li>But laundry costs have been cut down to the most minimum that it has ever been for my family.</li>
            <li>I sincerely didn&#x27;t expect much especially from the dress with old yellow spots.</li>
            <li>We received these Soapberries recently and have used them for cleaning dishes (everything came out sparkling and fresh), washing laundry</li>
            <li>Now, I am also going to add that I still have to treat stains, and periodically still use bleach for more heavily soiled towels/bath rugs.</li>
            <li>Some companies give you a hardened berry with the seed which makes it harder to use and yields less of the good stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m finding new uses for them all the time.</li>
            <li>Can you imagine my surprise when all the dirt and fat was gone completely after 1 wash in the front load washing machine!</li>

            <li>Everyone was surprised but like the change.</li>
            <li>I have also turned some of my daughters friends onto soap berries in order for them to save money on a young person&#x27;s budget.</li>
            <li>So far as a hand wash</li>
            <li>I place 2-3 soapberries in an empty bottle from shampoo and add warm water everyday.</li>

            <li>Clothes was left soft, with no smell.</li>
            <li>I love that I am eliminating chemicals from my laundry, reducing waste (I compost my used up berries), and it  costs me less per load than if I were buying laundry detergent!</li>

            <li> OK....I gave &#x27;em a try.  They don&#x27;t make suds and they smell really bad.  A waste of money if you ask me.</li>
            <li> I have heard heaps of positive and negative reviews of soap nuts before trying them myself. Being rather skeptical I still decided to give it a try once I saw this. Delivery was very quick. I couldn&#x27;t wait to test the same evening and washed my bed linen (just got some fat spots from dogs bringing their food - yak), a silk night gown and a white and black dress with old yellow spots from last year. I sincerely didn&#x27;t expect much especially from the dress with old yellow spots. Can you imagine my surprise when all the dirt and fat was gone completely after 1 wash in the front load washing machine! Yellow spots disappeared completely! I added exactly nothing to the machine except of soap nuts, used temperature of 80. Used around 5-6 nuts. Clothes was left soft, with no smell. Perfect!  Now I&#x27;m on my way to start doing my own shampoo from soap nuts, exciting!</li>
            <li> We received these Soapberries recently and have used them for cleaning dishes (everything came out sparkling and fresh), washing laundry (everything was perfectly soft, smelled fresh, and was clean!), bathe and wash hair (feels great to get away from chemical soaked hygiene products). It has worked in every test we have put it through so far. Even my wife&#x27;s wedding set came out extremely shiny and clean when we soaked it in this liquid. We will definitely be incorporating more natural products into our lives that have been around for thousands of years!</li>
            <li> The soap berries are good. Some are in larger pieces, but they work just fine. The only problem is they are just packaged in a zip lock bag. The bag opened in transit and spilled all over the box.</li>
            <li> I have been having good luck with these berries.  I put them in our building&#x27;s HE washer and they have now lasted for 4 loads and counting.  They even (accidentally) went through the dryer a couple times and still work, although I try to not do that to extend their lifespan.  I found the bag opens itself and they fall out if I don&#x27;t pull it tight *and* tie it shut.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with these soap nuts.  Cleans the clothes very well and according to the pamphlet that came with them, there are other suggested uses for them, too.  Cant wait to try them out!  All of the product came well protected and packaged, and in a timely manner. Very pleased.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I honestly have nothing to compare it to as this is the first time I have ordered soapberries. I believe they work great but have nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li> Love these!!  Super soft clothes and no scent.  Why did I not know about these sooner??</li>
            <li> Really excited about this offer and the chance to  try  soap berries for the first time.  Unfortunately, I did not receive the FREE Wash Bag, , however Greenwill customer service was excellent and offered prompt correction of the oversight without my even asking.  Looking forward to trying the berries and I&#x27;m sure I will be back for more when needed.</li>
            <li> Packaging, very unimpressed with a ziplock bag with little holes in it. Instructions doesn&#x27;t mention that the pods can be used until they turn a light brown like I have read doing research on soapberries. I did like that the Muslim bag was thick and a good width. The one I had was very thin and narrow in comparison that I bought at a local Heath food market for back up.</li>
            <li> I use it for laundry an it cleans my clothes very well. The soapberries will definitely last a long time.</li>
            <li> Ok. I wasn&#x27;t sure about these and bought them to try them. I&#x27;ve been looking into making my own detergent but I really wasn&#x27;t looking forward to the time it would take to do that. I did some research, came across soap berries as an option and determined that Greenwill is one of the better companies from which to buy soap berries. I also bought wool balls for the dryer and used these in combination. also,,,DO NOT WORRY ABOUT getting NO SUDS! Suds are overrated!! (and are a result of a chemical reaction in commercial soaps to make those detergents more appealing)  Anyway, I have been using the soap berries for over a month now! I&#x27;m not even through , my first bag! Now, I have a family of 10 and do a number of loads through the week. I replace the berries once a week and that seems to work out well. I use 10 berries because most of my loads are on the larger side. (directions call for 6) I followed the directions and did NOT tell my family for the first week. These were the results: I noticed a difference after the FIRST load! The clothes came out fresh smelling immediately(not perfumey, but fresh) and the wool balls made everything come out of the dryer softer. My family didn&#x27;t notice right away, until they put on their clothes. My girls kept commenting on how fresh and soft their clothes felt. My boys told me that their jeans felt softer. My husband finally asked me what I changed and that is when I revealed to everyone that I switched things up. Everyone was surprised but like the change. Now, I am also going to add that I still have to treat stains, and periodically still use bleach for more heavily soiled towels/bath rugs. But laundry costs have been cut down to the most minimum that it has ever been for my family. I wish that I had found these sooner! I have also turned some of my daughters friends onto soap berries in order for them to save money on a young person&#x27;s budget. They too have told me they like the change. And this truly is a GREAT natural alternative to chemically laden detergents. I have bought more berries and I am now going to try this as a soap and shampoo. I will try to update once we find out how it works. For $4 this is TOTALLY worth the try.to chemically laden detergents.

            <li> Great for those who want to avoid lye and harsh chemicals, but my clothes still smelled dirty.</li>
            <li> These soap berries from Greenwill are the only ones I will use. I have tried some other company&#x27;s berries or soap nuts and they don&#x27;t compare in quality. Greenwill soap berries make so much more soap than any of the others, and they are seedless. Some companies give you a hardened berry with the seed which makes it harder to use and yields less of the good stuff. I love to boil them and put the liquid into a bath &amp; body works foaming soap container. The soap berry solution FOAMS up just like the chemical laden bath &amp; body works stuff and works even better, leaving my skin soft and fresh and clean!!! I also only use the soap berries for my shampoo now, if you haven&#x27;t tried it please do (you will love the results).</li>
            <li> I rave about my soapberries anytime the subject of laundry comes up. I had a skirt with a grease stain on it. I washed it twice in detergent, and both times that dark spot was still there when it came out. Once my soapberries arrived, I washed my skirt again, along with my next load of dirty laundry, and the stain was finally gone! I only use the soapberries now, except in odd cases when I&#x27;m washing something that I wouldn&#x27;t want to get on my precious soapberries or their bag. My laundry always comes put smelling clean and fresh. I love that I am eliminating chemicals from my laundry, reducing waste (I compost my used up berries), and it  costs me less per load than if I were buying laundry detergent! I estimate it should last at least 60 loads (If 1 bag is over 60 berries, and a bag of 5-6 berries last about 5 loads, that translates to about 13cents per load). I bought this bag of soapberries last October, is not even halfway through yet. We are 2 adults, washing laundry throughout the week.</li>
            <li> I had previously posted a negative review for the soapberries I had recieved beccause of what appeared to be sloppy packaging, lack of instructions, etc....  The company contacted me immediately to remedy my complaint.  I have tried the soapberries only in a limited fashion so far, (I simmered them in distilled water for 20 minutes in their muslin bag), and stored the soapberry-infused water for hand, face and hair washing.  So far as a hand wash it works great!  leaves the skin soft and is an effective soil remover.  I look forward to experimenting with other applications.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I&#x27;m not using this right but I don&#x27;t get why everyone giving this 5 star. I don&#x27;t get any soap out of it. No foam, no bubbles. I even tried soaking it overnight.. still no results. I have used the fresh berry before and they do create bubbles and slippery soapy liquid but not this one.</li>
            <li> I am really digging these soapberries for washing clothes and my hair. I&#x27;m finding new uses for them all the time. I place 2-3 soapberries in an empty bottle from shampoo and add warm water everyday. Just shake until sudsy and use in your hair! Easy and environmentally sound.</li>
            <li> these are a bit of work to use but they work! especially for those with chemical sensativities</li>
