            <li>best mascara ever!!  </li>
            <li>However with that being said this is the best I have used.</li>
            <li>This mascara lengthens and curls my lashes wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>I use a gel mascara that is wonderful.</li>
            <li>I never have to reapply it, it stays perfectly until I take it off at night.</li>
            <li>This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve even used.</li>
            <li>Great mascara and applicator!</li>
            <li>Elongates and fulls my eyelashes beautifully!</li>
            <li>One of the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
            <li>This is the best mascara in the world.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m in excellent company.  </li>
            <li>The brush is a very good quality.</li>
            <li>The mascara seems like good quality too!</li>
            <li>Really nice -- excellent brush --separates and maxximizes!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t flake and looks great all day.</li>
            <li>This is a great mascara</li>
            <li>Very nice mascara, I just needed a waterproof one.</li>
            <li>I do not want to pay this kind of money for raccoon eyes!  </li>
            <li>So that plus this brush/wand whatever you wanna call it, my eyelashes have never looked so good.</li>
            <li>I have loved every product that I&#x27;ve tried from the MAKE UP FOR EVER line of cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>It did give my lashes volume, but the work involved plus the $24 price doesn&#x27;t make this a good purchase.</li>
            <li>and I think I got this product at a fair price and it lasted quite a while</li>
            <li>I think the brush is the most important and this is the best brush I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Awesome and Gentle mascara!</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best mascara I have ever found!  </li>
            <li>I was happy to have another high-end mascara in my collection, but there was nothing about this that made me go &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; and want to run out and buy the full size products.</li>
            <li>The mascara is ok, but the brush is the best I&#x27;ve tried by far.</li>
            <li>I want to like this mascara - it looks great when it is first applied, but it runs almost immediately</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>I have used many mascara&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I got a sample of this from Sephora a while ago for my birthday, but I never used it because I have another mascara that I love.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this brush.</li>
            <li>and I love the type of brush they used for it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite mascara of any that I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>:) I am completely satisfied with my product.</li>
            <li>Love this mascara, not clumpy, easy to apply</li>
            <li>and you do get free shipping ordering online if you spend more than fifty dollars.  </li>
            <li>For $24 there are a lot of mascaras out there with really good brushes that separate lashes and good mascaras that don&#x27;t dry up.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s tubes are easily removed and it does not run.  </li>
            <li>The brush does need to be de-clumped at the tip, I find that true for most mascara whether they are waterproof or not.  </li>
            <li>I originally tried it as a free birthday sample from sephora.</li>
            <li>The issue with Blinc is that neither the original nor the Amplified version lengthen</li>
            <li>My lashes naturally go straight down, so curling them is a must; this mascara successfully UNCURLED my lashes!!</li>
            <li>It is much better than most drug store mascaras wands, because it is made of actual hairs rather than plastic.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smudge and makes bold eyelashes</li>
            <li>Item was accurately described and exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>I will never understand why this product has such good reviews; I absolutely will never spend my money on this product.</li>
            <li>Received a free sample size of this mascara from Sephora and instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li>This is the best mascara ever I wear false lashes and on the day&#x27;s</li>
            <li>So, maybe those who wrote the very positive reviews didn&#x27;t have this problem, but I noticed it every time I wore it.  </li>
            <li>It is SO hard to find good mascara even if you decide to bite the bullet and take out a second mortgage to put up for a good tube.</li>
            <li>However the mini sample version lasted MUCH longer than the full size I bought here.</li>
            <li>The shape of the brush really helps get those outer lashes and the mascara goes on smooth and really defines the lashes and lengthens.</li>
            <li>A lovely, young, delicious woman at Sephora invited me to try this mascara - offering me a free sample as I purchased my usual Clinique wand of black wonder.  </li>
            <li>The first week I wore it - I got compliments.  </li>
            <li>So I have been using MUFE first and then adding the Blinc</li>
            <li>but I find most mascaras are pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>The price tag is high, but the product is worth it.</li>
            <li>I have seen this product at a much lower price</li>
            <li>This mascara plumps up the volume of my lashes, and also makes them appear much longer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on evenly, gives both volume and length to my short light eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t flake or smear like most other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My problem, and it is not limited to this particular mascara, is that I do get raccoon eyes within a couple of hours, as this happens with most that I have tried, I did not expect it to be any different.  </li>
            <li>Great mascara, leaves your lashes looking dark, full, and dramatic</li>
            <li>out comes my old Cover Girl standby!</li>
            <li>The narrow tip on this brush is brilliant for getting to the small inner lashes without getting it all over your eye lid.  </li>
            <li>My lashes feel soft even after applying.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly, and it has not dried out, even though I have had it for a few months.</li>
            <li>The brush is a bit tricky to maneuver and the formula is a bit thick and goopy, but if you take the extra time to apply this slowly, you&#x27;ll be very happy with the way your eyes turn out.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon and am a prime member, but I do price check because while they are usually cheaper or the same price, make-up and skin care are often the exception.</li>
            <li>The mascara itself was on the dry side and dried up in the bottle pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if they were misleading about the actual amount in the bottle or if it is just very fast to dry out...</li>
            <li>All in all, it works very well but doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should.</li>
            <li>I want to love this mascara because it gives my lashes the dramatic sweep that I like, but I put it on in the morning</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I want to love this mascara because it gives my lashes the dramatic sweep that I like, but I put it on in the morning</li>
            <li> I also like that it is small on one end and large on the other, because you can use the skinny side for your lower lashes if that is the look you&#x27;re going for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> only down side to the hair wand is that the wetness of the mascara is that it takes a while to dry, and leaves a lot above and below my eyes as soon as I blink or try to use the eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> Which really disappointed me because if I&#x27;m going to spend $30 on mascara better last as long or longer than a drugstore brand.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my other mascara, so I decided to give this a shot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to wipe away the excess more than once while doing my routine, which was annoying and felt like I was wasting</li>
            <li> It is almost like they try very hard to give you a not-dry formula that it causes the opposite problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and it hasn&#x27;t clumped yet.</li>
            <li> and when I glance at myself in the mirror during the day I have black smudges under my eyes!  </li>
            <li> and it was wonderfully thick on my lashes and DARK.</li>
            <li> I have short and thin lashes and this mascara makes them look thick and longer without the clumping.  </li>
            <li> lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t melt down my face!!</li>
            <li> and it adds very little volume.  </li>
            <li> This brush stands out due to shape - a very exaggerated cone.</li>
            <li> The tip of the brush gets especially messy with lots of product on it.</li>
            <li> It gives my lashes crazy volume and length without looking heavy or clumpy.</li>
            <li> it looks like I&#x27;m wearing false one&#x27;s</li>
            <li> which  is just too exaggerated for me.</li>
            <li> This brush is difficult to use and get separated lashes.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in the thickness of this mascara.</li>

            <li> This mascara did what basically every mascara  does - lengthen and darken. Others may disagree but I find most mascaras are pretty much the same. What differs is the brush. This brush stands out due to shape - a very exaggerated cone. I just couldn&#x27;t use it. On either eye with either hand I still got gobs of mascara on my lashes rather than even application. The tip of the brush gets especially messy with lots of product on it. After 30 years of wearing mascara I don&#x27;t need practice.it&#x27;s the brush  which  is just too exaggerated for me.</li>
            <li> Really nice -- excellent brush --separates and maxximizes!</li>
            <li> Very nice mascara, I just needed a waterproof one.</li>
            <li> Love it. Doesn&#x27;t flake or smear like most other mascaras I&#x27;ve tried. My lashes feel soft even after applying. No stiffness.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara.  I have short and thin lashes and this mascara makes them look thick and longer without the clumping.  I have stocked up so I don&#x27;t run out.  I have seen this product at a much lower price so I will shop around.</li>
            <li> best mascara ever!!  lasts all day and doesn&#x27;t melt down my face!!</li>
            <li> I have used many mascara&#x27;s.  My lashes on my left eye are Sporadic so I always have problems with my left lashes.  However with that being said this is the best I have used. I have read some reviews where people do not like the end of the brush because it is so pointed but for me it works.  Helps me separate the lashes.  The first week I wore it - I got compliments.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this from Sephora a while ago for my birthday, but I never used it because I have another mascara that I love. I ran out of my other mascara, so I decided to give this a shot. My lashes naturally go straight down, so curling them is a must; this mascara successfully UNCURLED my lashes!! I&#x27;ve never even seen that before!!! Not only that, but then it clumped together, so I had downward facing spider legs all day today. I will never understand why this product has such good reviews; I absolutely will never spend my money on this product.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best mascara I have ever found!  It never smudges and it doesn&#x27;t make my eyes burn!</li>
            <li> This mascara lengthens and curls my lashes wonderfully.  The brush does need to be de-clumped at the tip, I find that true for most mascara whether they are waterproof or not.  The narrow tip on this brush is brilliant for getting to the small inner lashes without getting it all over your eye lid.  My problem, and it is not limited to this particular mascara, is that I do get raccoon eyes within a couple of hours, as this happens with most that I have tried, I did not expect it to be any different.  The exception tp raccoon eye for me has been Blinc Kiss Me mascara, it&#x27;s tubes are easily removed and it does not run.  The issue with Blinc is that neither the original nor the Amplified version lengthen and it adds very little volume.  So I have been using MUFE first and then adding the Blinc and that is working like a charm.  I got this a sample size of this mascara from Sephora as a Birthday gift and when I am out I will try the waterproof version and see if that helps.  BTW, this item sells for twenty-four dollars at Sephora so you may want to purchase it there and you do get free shipping ordering online if you spend more than fifty dollars.  I love Amazon and am a prime member, but I do price check because while they are usually cheaper or the same price, make-up and skin care are often the exception.</li>
            <li> Sephora gave me a sample of this for my bday. I absolutely LOVE this brush. The mascara is ok, but the brush is the best I&#x27;ve tried by far. If you use the eyelash comb, mascara won&#x27;t clump. I never have that problem but when I was a teen I did. I use a gel mascara that is wonderful. So that plus this brush/wand whatever you wanna call it, my eyelashes have never looked so good.</li>
            <li> The brush is a bit tricky to maneuver and the formula is a bit thick and goopy, but if you take the extra time to apply this slowly, you&#x27;ll be very happy with the way your eyes turn out. This mascara plumps up the volume of my lashes, and also makes them appear much longer. It doesn&#x27;t flake and looks great all day.</li>
            <li> I have loved every product that I&#x27;ve tried from the MAKE UP FOR EVER line of cosmetics.  This is a great mascara and I love the type of brush they used for it.</li>
            <li> Love this mascara, not clumpy, easy to apply</li>
            <li> I got this as a sample from Sephora for my B-day. I think the brush is the most important and this is the best brush I have ever used! The mascara seems like good quality too! I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks now and it hasn&#x27;t clumped yet. Yes the tip does come out with extra product on it but what mascara doesn&#x27;t. The shape of the brush really helps get those outer lashes and the mascara goes on smooth and really defines the lashes and lengthens. In fact, I haven&#x27;t had to use my curler either!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite mascara of any that I have ever tried. It doesn&#x27;t clump, goes on evenly, gives both volume and length to my short light eyelashes. I never have to reapply it, it stays perfectly until I take it off at night. The price tag is high, but the product is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara I&#x27;ve even used. It gives my lashes crazy volume and length without looking heavy or clumpy. I originally tried it as a free birthday sample from sephora. However the mini sample version lasted MUCH longer than the full size I bought here. Which really disappointed me because if I&#x27;m going to spend $30 on mascara better last as long or longer than a drugstore brand. I don&#x27;t know if they were misleading about the actual amount in the bottle or if it is just very fast to dry out... All in all, it works very well but doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should.</li>
            <li> There are no clumps, and it does not flake throughout the day. It glides on smoothly, and it has not dried out, even though I have had it for a few months. The brush is a very good quality. It is much better than most drug store mascaras wands, because it is made of actual hairs rather than plastic. I also like that it is small on one end and large on the other, because you can use the skinny side for your lower lashes if that is the look you&#x27;re going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side to the hair wand is that the wetness of the mascara is that it takes a while to dry, and leaves a lot above and below my eyes as soon as I blink or try to use the eyelash curler. It is almost like they try very hard to give you a not-dry formula that it causes the opposite problem. I&#x27;ve had to wipe away the excess more than once while doing my routine, which was annoying and felt like I was wasting product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only giving it a 4 instead of a 5 because for the price of $45, I would want a mascara that gives me something that I cannot find in a $10 drug store mascara. I got a sample of this from Sephora. I was happy to have another high-end mascara in my collection, but there was nothing about this that made me go &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; and want to run out and buy the full size products.</li>
            <li> Awesome and Gentle mascara!</li>
            <li> It does lengthen my lashes dramatically, but it flakes onto my face!  I want to love this mascara because it gives my lashes the dramatic sweep that I like, but I put it on in the morning and when I glance at myself in the mirror during the day I have black smudges under my eyes!  I do not want to pay this kind of money for raccoon eyes!  So, maybe those who wrote the very positive reviews didn&#x27;t have this problem, but I noticed it every time I wore it.  So, into the drawer it goes and out comes my old Cover Girl standby!</li>
            <li> Great mascara and applicator! My daughter actually stole mine so I had to order another!</li>
            <li> Received a free sample size of this mascara from Sephora and instantly fell in love. Elongates and fulls my eyelashes beautifully! Will def repurchase again!</li>
            <li> Item was accurately described and exactly what I needed.  Thx!</li>
            <li> This brush is difficult to use and get separated lashes. The mascara itself was on the dry side and dried up in the bottle pretty quickly. It did give my lashes volume, but the work involved plus the $24 price doesn&#x27;t make this a good purchase. For $24 there are a lot of mascaras out there with really good brushes that separate lashes and good mascaras that don&#x27;t dry up. I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Great mascara, leaves your lashes looking dark, full, and dramatic</li>
            <li> Delivery was not a problem and I think I got this product at a fair price and it lasted quite a while :) I am completely satisfied with my product.</li>
            <li> This is the best mascara ever I wear false lashes and on the day&#x27;s I don&#x27;t I use the mascara,  it looks like I&#x27;m wearing false one&#x27;s this is a must have...</li>
            <li> I want to like this mascara - it looks great when it is first applied, but it runs almost immediately and I have to keep wiping the smudges from under my eyes.  I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the thickness of this mascara. I had a sample I received from a purchase of foundation at S*ph0ra and it was wonderfully thick on my lashes and DARK. This tube seems weaker. Sadness. It is SO hard to find good mascara even if you decide to bite the bullet and take out a second mortgage to put up for a good tube.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smudge and makes bold eyelashes</li>
            <li> One of the best mascara I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
            <li> A lovely, young, delicious woman at Sephora invited me to try this mascara - offering me a free sample as I purchased my usual Clinique wand of black wonder.  If I could meet her again - I&#x27;d kiss her.  This is the best mascara in the world.  Dr. Phil&#x27;s wife Robin endorses it too - - so I&#x27;m in excellent company.  One, two strokes - and I&#x27;m Sophia Loren all over again.  Grab this, girls.  You won&#x27;t be sorry.  Instead - you&#x27;ll be hooked.</li>
