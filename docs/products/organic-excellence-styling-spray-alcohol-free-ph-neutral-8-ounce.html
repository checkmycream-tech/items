            <li>, that&#x27;s how well it works LoL!</li>
            <li>Great job!</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>This is still a great product.  </li>
            <li>I honestly cannot compare it to mainstream hair spray brands because it has been years (decades even) since I&#x27;ve used them, but this is the best chemical-free hair spray I have found.</li>
            <li>Great styling spray.  </li>
            <li>Great styling spray</li>
            <li>This product smells great.</li>
            <li>It is just as good as any hair spray I have tried without the chemicals.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>Great product, mild, non-irritating scent and ingredients.</li>
            <li>I really love this hair spray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just thankful that I&#x27;ve found a product that is actually healthy for my hair and isn&#x27;t spraying toxic chemicals onto my head every time I use it.</li>
            <li>I also use the shampoo and love that.&lt;br /&gt;Kinda</li>
            <li>So glad I did.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>It smells wonderful and my hair stays set all day long, no complaints here!  </li>
            <li>I used to love this stuff but the last batch smelled fishy when sprayed-NOT GOOD!</li>
            <li>I think this is a great natural hair spray.</li>
            <li>Natural ingredients, great hold.</li>
            <li>It holds super well with a nice light fragrance of mint.  </li>
            <li>I switched to this product because my hair was just so full of static</li>
            <li>This product I would consider a light to medium hold spray.</li>
            <li>If they change the smell back I would keep buying it as it is a great working product.</li>
            <li>Medium hold without a lot of chemicals, not greasy and light.  </li>
            <li>This is an AMAZING natural spray.</li>
            <li>Overall this does a good job.</li>
            <li>and it was kind of stiff...not natural looking.</li>
            <li>I also use in on my 7-year-old daughter&#x27;s hair and can use it with full confidence knowing that she isn&#x27;t being harmed by our hair products.</li>
            <li>I think I found a great alternative to all other hairsprays on the market.</li>
            <li>but I do have to say that the hold is super duper.</li>
            <li>It has mild minty scent that disappears quickly and doesn’t interfere with perfume and won’t give you headache.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how well it would hold something like that, but for everyday use it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and clean and holds his hair very well.</li>
            <li>This one does a great job for my hard to hold style</li>
            <li>The first time you spray it on it has a minty odor</li>
            <li>If I would have done some simple researching, I could have found a product like this, which is FABULOUS!  </li>
            <li>This works just as good, if not better than the harmful hairsprays I&#x27;ve been using.  </li>
            <li>to very sticky to manage through my hair</li>
            <li>but  I still give a spray with my &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; hair spray when I leave the house to really set style.</li>
            <li>It holds very well</li>
            <li>I have chin length straight hair</li>
            <li>A tip, don&#x60;t put too much.</li>
            <li>Held my style in place and the scent was subtle and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe I have been using chemical filled hairsprays for as long as I have.  </li>
            <li>and when I use the product on my wet hair and then blow dry it, my hair looks shiny and smooth and it curls under easily with my brush.</li>
            <li>If I am lucky enough to get it to spray, I will get one or two sprays then it shoots out in a fire hose type stream.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I like a natural, casual style and found that if I spray lightly and then immediately tousle my hair slightly before it dries completely, it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>First time I ordered this product I only purchased one to try it out.....</li>
            <li>unless, heaven forbid, I become sensitive to it, too.  </li>
            <li>and I prefer to use natural products, so gave this product a try.  </li>
            <li>This said this is the only hair spray I have found that is really non toxic and works well.</li>
            <li>I got this for my two year old because it was organic</li>
            <li>I have developed sensitivities to many chemical-based products over the last few months/years.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well both as a pre-curling iron solution on dry hair and as a hairspray.  </li>
            <li>My husband developed asthma and I had to stop using regular hair spray</li>

            <li> My hair still has movement and is soft, but the little wispy hairs around my face stay put.</li>
            <li> And I love it because it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals that make traditional hairspray bad for you.</li>
            <li> It does have a bit of an odor when wet, but once it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> I use it as a styling product to spray on my wet hair before blow drying and then as a hairspray once my hair is dry and styled.  </li>
            <li> Great hold and doesn&#x60;t make your hair disgusting.</li>
            <li> He sprays this on wet hair and it keeps it in place while his hair dries....</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a hairspray replacement, you may not care for it as it just made my hair look wet</li>
            <li> I was a little confused at first, thought it was hair spray, but it turns out you can use it while your hair is wet for body and control, then spray after you dry and style.. Makes no sense, but the stuff works</li>
            <li> One problem I&#x27;ve had with other products is that when it dries it flakes and looks like dandruff, but with Organic Excellence I don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well as a styling product.</li>
            <li> I find it a little stiff if you simply spray on after styling.  </li>
            <li> Forget it, this product is not worth it.  </li>
            <li> I usually wear my hair down and use hair spray daily to tame fly-aways and keep hair where I want it.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and medium length.</li>
            <li> expensive</li>
            <li> I have two bottles of the product that are worthless.  </li>
            <li> because the packaging is awful.</li>

            <li> to very sticky to manage through my hair</li>
            <li> Overall this does a good job. My husband developed asthma and I had to stop using regular hair spray so I tried about 5 different brands. This one does a great job for my hard to hold style but  I still give a spray with my &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; hair spray when I leave the house to really set style.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great natural hair spray. It is just as good as any hair spray I have tried without the chemicals. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am revising my review of this product and downgrading it.  This is still a great product.  It holds super well with a nice light fragrance of mint.  I switched to this product because my hair was just so full of static and I was looking for a solution.  Problem solved.  It holds very well and my hair doesnt appear to have been sprayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the problem is the spray bottle.  I have two bottles of the product that are worthless.  They will not pump.  If I am lucky enough to get it to spray, I will get one or two sprays then it shoots out in a fire hose type stream.  Forget it, this product is not worth it.  I will be looking for something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they fix this problem it will definitely be a 5-star product. Until then, sayonara.</li>
            <li> I have developed sensitivities to many chemical-based products over the last few months/years.  I used to use Redken HotSets as a pre-curling iron spray, but can no longer use it.  This product works very well both as a pre-curling iron solution on dry hair and as a hairspray.  I will continue to use it, unless, heaven forbid, I become sensitive to it, too.  Unlike others, I&#x27;ve had no problem with the sprayer become sticky.  If I do, I will move the product into a different spray bottle in order to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I really love this hair spray. I honestly cannot compare it to mainstream hair spray brands because it has been years (decades even) since I&#x27;ve used them, but this is the best chemical-free hair spray I have found. My hair is very thick and medium length. I usually wear my hair down and use hair spray daily to tame fly-aways and keep hair where I want it. This product I would consider a light to medium hold spray. I don&#x27;t do up-dos in my hair so I don&#x27;t know how well it would hold something like that, but for everyday use it&#x27;s great. My hair still has movement and is soft, but the little wispy hairs around my face stay put. One problem I&#x27;ve had with other products is that when it dries it flakes and looks like dandruff, but with Organic Excellence I don&#x27;t have that problem. It does have a bit of an odor when wet, but once it&#x27;s dry I don&#x27;t smell it anymore -- and it is definitely not a fragrance odor.</li>
            <li> Our son LOVES this product. And I love it because it doesn&#x27;t have all the chemicals that make traditional hairspray bad for you. He sprays this on wet hair and it keeps it in place while his hair dries....but I do have to say that the hold is super duper. It doesn&#x27;t move. So if your looking for flexibility, this is not it. He has even gone to bed and woke up the next day with his hair still in place, that&#x27;s how well it works LoL!</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well as a styling product. It doesn&#x27;t work so well for me as a hairspray but, the stying aspect works so well that I will continue to buy it. I have chin length straight hair and when I use the product on my wet hair and then blow dry it, my hair looks shiny and smooth and it curls under easily with my brush. If you&#x27;re looking for a hairspray replacement, you may not care for it as it just made my hair look wet and it was kind of stiff...not natural looking. I&#x27;m just thankful that I&#x27;ve found a product that is actually healthy for my hair and isn&#x27;t spraying toxic chemicals onto my head every time I use it. I also use in on my 7-year-old daughter&#x27;s hair and can use it with full confidence knowing that she isn&#x27;t being harmed by our hair products.</li>
            <li> I used to love this stuff but the last batch smelled fishy when sprayed-NOT GOOD! If they change the smell back I would keep buying it as it is a great working product. I also use the shampoo and love that.&lt;br /&gt;Kinda expensive but it&#x27;s organic so I deal with it!</li>
            <li> Great styling spray.  Natural ingredients, great hold.</li>
            <li> First time I ordered this product I only purchased one to try it out.....going back a second time I purchased three.  The first time you spray it on it has a minty odor but it dissipates in seconds.  Great styling spray and I will continue on purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Alcohol discolors my skin and I prefer to use natural products, so gave this product a try.  Love it!  I use it as a styling product to spray on my wet hair before blow drying and then as a hairspray once my hair is dry and styled.  I find it a little stiff if you simply spray on after styling.  I like a natural, casual style and found that if I spray lightly and then immediately tousle my hair slightly before it dries completely, it works perfectly.  No helmet hair.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I have been using chemical filled hairsprays for as long as I have.  If I would have done some simple researching, I could have found a product like this, which is FABULOUS!  I will NEVER buy another hair spray.  This works just as good, if not better than the harmful hairsprays I&#x27;ve been using.  It smells wonderful and my hair stays set all day long, no complaints here!  I am a forever customer, thank you for this product!!</li>
            <li> Medium hold without a lot of chemicals, not greasy and light.  It has mild minty scent that disappears quickly and doesn’t interfere with perfume and won’t give you headache.  I think I found a great alternative to all other hairsprays on the market.</li>
            <li> I have an allegy to alcohol based products and was looking for a product that hold my hair in place.  After searching online I decided I would give this producf a shot.  So glad I did.  Held my style in place and the scent was subtle and pleasant.  Great job!</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING natural spray. Great hold and doesn&#x60;t make your hair disgusting. You can just brush it off and no rush to wash your hair the next day. A tip, don&#x60;t put too much. Also A HUUUUGE PLUS, after using it my hair doesn&#x60;t break like after chemical sprays.</li>
            <li> Great product, mild, non-irritating scent and ingredients.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT! Why 3 stars? because the packaging is awful. The pump never works ( on 4 bottles ordered one after another) and the liquid needs to be transferred into another bottle with pump. This said this is the only hair spray I have found that is really non toxic and works well. Please improve the packaging!</li>
            <li> I was a little confused at first, thought it was hair spray, but it turns out you can use it while your hair is wet for body and control, then spray after you dry and style.. Makes no sense, but the stuff works</li>
            <li> I got this for my two year old because it was organic and I love it.  It smells fresh and clean and holds his hair very well.</li>
            <li> This product smells great. It also maintains my hairstyle throughout the day even when the air is humid. I would recommend this hairspray to all of my friends.</li>
