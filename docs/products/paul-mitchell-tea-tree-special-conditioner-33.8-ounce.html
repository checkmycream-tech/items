            <li>the pump is nice.</li>

            <li>Smells very good and leaves hair feeling very soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Surely didn&#x27;t condition it.</li>

            <li>Love the Tea Tree products.  </li>

            <li>Wish it had a better smell.</li>
            <li>About the Delivery: When the product arrived, it was in a box more than 4x</li>
            <li>the Product: To top it all off, the pump doesn&#x27;t even work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.</li>
            <li>love this series for hair care system</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>Also although the peppermint is refreshing and almost magical on your scalp, but the tea tree (or something else in this) has a smell like urine.</li>
            <li>it does not tingle hear as paul mitchell tea tree shapoo does, shampoo is better product</li>
            <li>so bummed because I love the tea tree shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s an excellent product, would recommend!</li>
            <li>I had to use a lot to be able to pull a comb though my hair.</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell, you sure know how to make a man purr.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and the aroma it instills you with.  </li>
            <li>It is the most tangled it has ever been.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I tell her to rinse it out better</li>
            <li>Most conditioners leave a film on your skin and will cause acne.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I get more compliments on how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li>It definitely works the best if used with the Tea Tree Special Shampoo.</li>
            <li>After 5-10 minutes, rinse it out for more smooth and managable hair.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice hair conditioner to make your hair soft and shining&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Revitalizes the scalp and makes hair feel clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>Both the shampoo and the conditioner have a strong minty smell to it.  </li>
            <li>I would suggest this to anyone that is looking for a strong conditioner that will make your scalp tingle.</li>
            <li>Love being able to get this very large size.</li>
            <li>I do love the cool minty feeling though.</li>
            <li>Product was fine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge bottle which helps and</li>
            <li>Smooth transaction, product as described.</li>
            <li>Since I did not want to bring huge bottles of shampoo and conditioner along, I bought some 6 ounce squeeze bottles and filled them with shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>By mistake, I filled both bottle with conditioner.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is not only great, but it makes your hair smell like Christmas</li>
            <li>This conditioner left my hair feeling clean and looking amazing!</li>
            <li>Great items and would recommend to anyone who has dry and itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li>Tingles when you put it on, and gives you a clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of tea tree products over the years, but have settled on Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Special products.  </li>
            <li>After washing my hair and rinsing out the shampoo, I apply the Tea Tree Special Conditioner and let it sit for the remainder of my shower.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair full of body and</li>
            <li>My husband also uses this and absolutely fell in love with the feel of this.</li>
            <li>Honestly it took my hair some time to get soft while using it</li>
            <li>This Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Conditioner, 33.8 Ounce leaves my scalp tingling and my thin fly away hair more easily managed.</li>
            <li>Came really quick.</li>
            <li>It is super sticky and not at all what I wanted.</li>
            <li>The REAL Tea Tree has a smooth, soothing scent and is lighter in color.</li>
            <li>The product has an amazing smell and will last in your hair, until you drown your hair in oils to quench its thirst.</li>
            <li>I tested it to see if it was even worth it after all of this, and the answer is no.</li>
            <li>Keeps longer hair untangled and fresh.</li>
            <li>This merchant also shipped VERY fast.</li>
            <li>It was the first time ever</li>
            <li>I have an itchy scalp and this product helps so much without harming the condition of my hair!</li>
            <li>both of us have very different hair, but really love it.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner, it&#x27;s one of the only ones my hair doesn&#x27;t get used to after a bottle.</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair and rarely can use conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have used this in the past and it has a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I learned about it from a friend for people with dandruff problems or other health related problems affecting their hair.</li>
            <li>And if you like the scent, I strongly suggest buying to shampoo by the same company.</li>
            <li>Large bottle.</li>
            <li>the product is great but the shipment came damaged because it was in a weak box for the weight of the product (4).  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>We find that if you use just this conditioner once a week, it really gives your scalp the rejuvenation it needs.</li>
            <li>As a guy, I don&#x27;t give my hair much thought.  </li>
            <li>very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks for selling this item.</li>
            <li>Had to really use spray in conditioner to comb out my hair &amp; a lot of oil  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t condition my hair very well.</li>
            <li>As someone with very oily hair, I can say that this has been a lifesaver.</li>
            <li>just as described, fast shipping AAA+++</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The winter really dries out my scalp and makes it itchy</li>
            <li>They work together very well.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t as good as my normal batch, didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as it normally does :/  </li>
            <li>Decent for shaving though.</li>
            <li>I believe this speaks to the high quality of this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>but now it makes my hair so soft even though it&#x27;s really damaged by straightening it every day :x</li>
            <li>normally I just use a dab of oil before comb out</li>
            <li>I absolutely love green tea conditioners and shampoos.</li>
            <li>It DOES smell incredibly good, but my hair is so left frizzy with the ends undone (I have fine, straight hair) that the smell just isn&#x27;t worth it. :(</li>
            <li>I like to use the conditioner independently from the shampoo, because the eucalyptus oil in the shampoo is pretty strong and makes my scalp tingle a little too much.</li>
            <li>Just today I was at a haircut and decided to purchase a new bottle since it was on sale.</li>
            <li>I am a natural hair woman and this conditioner really detangles my hair and leaves it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Makes hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>When you apply, you feel very fresh and invigorating feeling to your scalp, but this one has a same scent but the feeling is different.  </li>
            <li>, I share the following funny story.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft, shiny and conditioned!</li>
            <li>Note, this is the original recipe of Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Conditioner.... not to be confused with new versions that have microbeads.</li>
            <li>It was in a plastic bags, but still was a huge mess and lost product.</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves your hair feeling more like it was conditioned with a volumizing condition, read: dryer and hard to get a brush through.</li>
            <li>I use this exclusively on my beard, once a day to keep things soft.  </li>
            <li>I had to order this size (saves u money if u buy frequently)</li>
            <li>I just remember the old smell wrong.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My hair isn&#x27;t soft.</li>
            <li>I finally realized it wasn&#x27;t the same as my other conditioner, so I read the bottle more clearly.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s even better is that a little goes a long way with the quality product from Paul Mitchell.  </li>
            <li>I did not realize this mistake until after a few weeks when I went to my stylist for a haircut, she asked me why my hair was so soft and full, I asked her what she meant.  </li>
            <li>Plus, the top was open, so I opened up the box to find a giant mess.</li>
            <li>It is definitely not the real PM Tea Tree, so I would not buy this product off of Amazon (especially since PM states that they only sell to authorized retailers/salons).</li>
            <li>I can barely rip a brush through my hair after using this for a week.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and have problems with dry scalp, but with the Paul Mitchell conditioner and a little leave in conditioner, my hair is mostly free from flakes.</li>
            <li>But when I first got this bottle I thought, &amp;#34;hmm, this smells different.&amp;#34; It had a slightly stronger, and harsher smell compared to what I had before.</li>
            <li>I purchased for myself and expected it to be a decent conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Works great on thick or thin hair, male or female.</li>

            <li> This Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Conditioner, 33.8 Ounce leaves my scalp tingling and my thin fly away hair more easily managed.</li>
            <li> Came really quick.</li>
            <li> It is super sticky and not at all what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The REAL Tea Tree has a smooth, soothing scent and is lighter in color.</li>
            <li> The product has an amazing smell and will last in your hair, until you drown your hair in oils to quench its thirst.</li>
            <li> I tested it to see if it was even worth it after all of this, and the answer is no.</li>
            <li> Keeps longer hair untangled and fresh.</li>
            <li> This merchant also shipped VERY fast.</li>
            <li> It was the first time ever</li>
            <li> I have an itchy scalp and this product helps so much without harming the condition of my hair!</li>
            <li> both of us have very different hair, but really love it.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner, it&#x27;s one of the only ones my hair doesn&#x27;t get used to after a bottle.</li>
            <li> I have very oily hair and rarely can use conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and it has a nice clean scent.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I learned about it from a friend for people with dandruff problems or other health related problems affecting their hair.</li>
            <li> And if you like the scent, I strongly suggest buying to shampoo by the same company.</li>
            <li> Large bottle.</li>
            <li> the product is great but the shipment came damaged because it was in a weak box for the weight of the product (4).  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> We find that if you use just this conditioner once a week, it really gives your scalp the rejuvenation it needs.</li>
            <li> As a guy, I don&#x27;t give my hair much thought.  </li>
            <li> very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks for selling this item.</li>
            <li> Had to really use spray in conditioner to comb out my hair &amp; a lot of oil  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t condition my hair very well.</li>
            <li> As someone with very oily hair, I can say that this has been a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> just as described, fast shipping AAA+++</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> The winter really dries out my scalp and makes it itchy</li>
            <li> They work together very well.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as good as my normal batch, didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as it normally does :/  </li>
            <li> Decent for shaving though.</li>
            <li> I believe this speaks to the high quality of this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> but now it makes my hair so soft even though it&#x27;s really damaged by straightening it every day :x</li>
            <li> normally I just use a dab of oil before comb out</li>
            <li> I absolutely love green tea conditioners and shampoos.</li>
            <li> It DOES smell incredibly good, but my hair is so left frizzy with the ends undone (I have fine, straight hair) that the smell just isn&#x27;t worth it. :(</li>
            <li> I like to use the conditioner independently from the shampoo, because the eucalyptus oil in the shampoo is pretty strong and makes my scalp tingle a little too much.</li>
            <li> Just today I was at a haircut and decided to purchase a new bottle since it was on sale.</li>
            <li> I am a natural hair woman and this conditioner really detangles my hair and leaves it soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Makes hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> When you apply, you feel very fresh and invigorating feeling to your scalp, but this one has a same scent but the feeling is different.  </li>
            <li> , I share the following funny story.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft, shiny and conditioned!</li>
            <li> Note, this is the original recipe of Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Conditioner.... not to be confused with new versions that have microbeads.</li>
            <li> It was in a plastic bags, but still was a huge mess and lost product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves your hair feeling more like it was conditioned with a volumizing condition, read: dryer and hard to get a brush through.</li>
            <li> I use this exclusively on my beard, once a day to keep things soft.  </li>
            <li> I had to order this size (saves u money if u buy frequently)</li>
            <li> I just remember the old smell wrong.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t soft.</li>
            <li> I finally realized it wasn&#x27;t the same as my other conditioner, so I read the bottle more clearly.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even better is that a little goes a long way with the quality product from Paul Mitchell.  </li>
            <li> I did not realize this mistake until after a few weeks when I went to my stylist for a haircut, she asked me why my hair was so soft and full, I asked her what she meant.  </li>
            <li> Plus, the top was open, so I opened up the box to find a giant mess.</li>
            <li> It is definitely not the real PM Tea Tree, so I would not buy this product off of Amazon (especially since PM states that they only sell to authorized retailers/salons).</li>
            <li> I can barely rip a brush through my hair after using this for a week.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and have problems with dry scalp, but with the Paul Mitchell conditioner and a little leave in conditioner, my hair is mostly free from flakes.</li>
            <li> But when I first got this bottle I thought, &amp;#34;hmm, this smells different.&amp;#34; It had a slightly stronger, and harsher smell compared to what I had before.</li>
            <li> I purchased for myself and expected it to be a decent conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Works great on thick or thin hair, male or female.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way too, and the product is very versatile as it is outlined on the packaging.</li>
            <li> and it is clearly not the same conditioner.</li>
            <li> I get really dry static-like hair, especially in the winter, so I bought this bottle thinking it&#x27;d be my savior.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell is a little chemically for my taste in the first place, and this conditioner just plain fried me out.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that I bought a 2 pack in the salon so now coming to Amazon because I have half a bottle of shampoo left and no conditioner.</li>
            <li> If you have dandruff or dry, damaged hair...</li>
            <li> Using this product made my hair texture really dry.</li>
            <li> I have a dry scalp so this is a product I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am also an athlete and bike a lot outdoors in the summer, this tends to dry out my highlighted hair and make it have a strawlike texture, this product when used every time I wash my hair, alleviates this problem.</li>
            <li> I was previously using a clarifying shampoo and conditioner daily just to keep away the oil which was killing my hair.</li>
            <li> Bad Packaging, a tiny box is used to fit the product.</li>
            <li> I was asked to work at a church camp as a counselor a few years back.  </li>
            <li> A bottle lasts me roughly a year.</li>
            <li> So if for the rest of the day, my hair gets wet, it smells like someone peed on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just spent $22 on conditioner that isn&#x27;t conditioner.</li>
            <li> I had been introduced to this product a few years back</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have stated, this leaves my hair very dry.</li>
            <li> it will be very difficult to use this huge liter bottle without a pump.</li>
            <li> (The other couple of times in the week, you use shampoo and conditioner.)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t build up like other conditioners.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Paul Mitchell tea tree products for years, due to a sebaceous gland issue.  </li>
            <li> Use it twice a week and killed my dry scalp issues.</li>
            <li> Not bad, not awesome, just ordinary.</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive, but it works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Not worth any stars the item arrived today and broke dame day</li>
            <li> With its minty scent, it softens your hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Replacement for previously used product that works well</li>
            <li> If it is different,.. I guess it is not good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ve been putting in my hair these past few months, but I&#x27;m a little disturbed to think that it wasn&#x27;t actually conditioner.</li>
            <li> I use the combo (both shampoo and conditioner) and have not had dried out frizzy split ends or oily hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know this for a few days.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend often steals a few pumps when I am not looking.</li>
            <li> I have long,thick hair, and had to use a ton of this product to detangle, and it made my hair feel dry, not a good moisturizing conditioner at all, im</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;whatever-it-is&amp;#34; stuff is very green and a bit harsh to the nose.</li>
            <li> Didi not love the scent of this.</li>
            <li> When I got the new bottle home I opened it and smelled it, and immediately realized that what I had bought on Amazon was a bad knock off.</li>
            <li> Hard to find elsewhere.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this along with the shampoo in this house for at least three years.</li>
            <li> not nearly as nice a product as Revon Men</li>
            <li> and it did not have the same unpleasant smell as this, and it seemed to leave my hair softer.</li>
            <li> Dead wrong.</li>
            <li> Not a great moisturizing conditioner--disappointed.</li>
            <li> I gave 3 stars instead of 5 because of the pump dispenser being broken-</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst one I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Smooth transaction, product as described.</li>
            <li> great stuff hair soo damn healthy</li>
            <li> Bad Packaging, a tiny box is used to fit the product. Also, not enough air cushions to absorb the shock (just one tiny air cushion. Inner contents leaked. Damaged.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t as good as my normal batch, didn&#x27;t leave my hair as soft as it normally does :/  It was packed great though!</li>
            <li> I use this exclusively on my beard, once a day to keep things soft.  No rug burn for my lady....</li>
            <li> I have scalp psoriasis and this stuff is so amazing I had to order this size (saves u money if u buy frequently)</li>
            <li> Didi not love the scent of this. Very strong tea tree smell</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist and I do not like this product at all. I purchased for myself and expected it to be a decent conditioner.  It was the first time ever I couldn&#x27;t get a comb thru my hair afterward. It made mats in my hair and it was dryer than ever. Surely didn&#x27;t condition it. It&#x27;s the worst one I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Ways the perfect product for my hair. I have very curly hair and this helps as a leave-in with flyaway and frizz!</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner that I have found for anyone with scalp problems.  We find that if you use just this conditioner once a week, it really gives your scalp the rejuvenation it needs. (The other couple of times in the week, you use shampoo and conditioner.)</li>
            <li> As a guy, I don&#x27;t give my hair much thought.  An ex-girlfriend convinced me that I was better off using quality shampoo and conditioner on my hair.  After trying several different shampoos and conditioners, I began using Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Conditioner.  What a great product!  It leaves your hair full of body and very shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As testament to how good it is, I share the following funny story.  I was asked to work at a church camp as a counselor a few years back.  Since I did not want to bring huge bottles of shampoo and conditioner along, I bought some 6 ounce squeeze bottles and filled them with shampoo and conditioner.  By mistake, I filled both bottle with conditioner.  Yikes!  I did not realize this mistake until after a few weeks when I went to my stylist for a haircut, she asked me why my hair was so soft and full, I asked her what she meant.  When I told her about the bottles, she asked me to bring them by her shop.  When she looked at them, she said, &amp;#34;These are both conditioner!&amp;#34;  She went on to say that she could not believe that my hair wasn&#x27;t a greasy mess...or something to that effect.  I believe this speaks to the high quality of this conditioner.  A bottle lasts me roughly a year.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair and love this product! My hair and scalp feel so good and I can go an extra day between washes. I have lots of very fine hair.</li>
            <li> Love the Tea Tree products.  Great items and would recommend to anyone who has dry and itchy scalp.  Thanks for selling this item.</li>
            <li> Hubby and son both love it.</li>
            <li> Came really quick. However it doesn&#x27;t seem to do my hair well. Had to really use spray in conditioner to comb out my hair &amp; a lot of oil  normally I just use a dab of oil before comb out</li>
            <li> Made my hair fall out .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t condition my hair very well. I do love the cool minty feeling though. Makes me feel refreshed and smells great.</li>
            <li> Makes hair very soft.  Wish it had a better smell.</li>
            <li> This is what was used on me in my salon but it arrived opened/not sealed which is why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> About the Delivery: When the product arrived, it was in a box more than 4x the size of the product itself. When I opened the box, the bottle was slightly open and conditioner was splattered everywhere. When I looked at the bottle&#x27;s pump, there was a piece of tape around it, indicating that this product had been opened before.&lt;br /&gt;About the Product: To top it all off, the pump doesn&#x27;t even work. In order to use the conditioner, I have to unscrew the pump and pour the conditioner into my hand. I tested it to see if it was even worth it after all of this, and the answer is no. It&#x27;s just ok. Not bad, not awesome, just ordinary.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years.  Nice smell, with some anti-fungal properties.  I switch off between this and Pert Plus, just to prevent any buildup of anything.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice hair conditioner to make your hair soft and shining&lt;br /&gt;I love this series for hair care system</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner my son will use!</li>
            <li> Great price! This is all my husband will use and we use it to detangle my 5yr olds hair as well!</li>
            <li> Keeps longer hair untangled and fresh. A little goes a long way too, and the product is very versatile as it is outlined on the packaging.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner! I have an itchy scalp and this product helps so much without harming the condition of my hair!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard some people on here say that this dries out their hair. As someone with very oily hair, I can say that this has been a lifesaver. I was previously using a clarifying shampoo and conditioner daily just to keep away the oil which was killing my hair. At the recommendation of the salon, I decided to give this a try. I use the combo (both shampoo and conditioner) and have not had dried out frizzy split ends or oily hair. It&#x27;s been perfect. My husband also uses this and absolutely fell in love with the feel of this. both of us have very different hair, but really love it. The only thing is that I bought a 2 pack in the salon so now coming to Amazon because I have half a bottle of shampoo left and no conditioner.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner. Smells very good and leaves hair feeling very soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I used to use this item before and I know the feeling when you use it.  When you apply, you feel very fresh and invigorating feeling to your scalp, but this one has a same scent but the feeling is different.  I am just planning to buy same product from CVS and compare them.  If it is different,.. I guess it is not good.</li>
            <li> I actually found I prefer the generic alternative. As other reviewers have stated, this leaves my hair very dry. Also although the peppermint is refreshing and almost magical on your scalp, but the tea tree (or something else in this) has a smell like urine. So if for the rest of the day, my hair gets wet, it smells like someone peed on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough, I&#x27;ve tried this from the local salon and it did not have the same unpleasant smell as this, and it seemed to leave my hair softer.</li>
            <li> it does not tingle hear as paul mitchell tea tree shapoo does, shampoo is better product</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT, TEA TREE SMELL IS STRONG, WORKS WELL</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even better is that a little goes a long way with the quality product from Paul Mitchell.  Goes well with hand lotion, shampoo, and shave gel.</li>
            <li> The conditioner showed up and it is a leave in moisturizer.  I didn&#x27;t know this for a few days. I finally realized it wasn&#x27;t the same as my other conditioner, so I read the bottle more clearly.  Total bummer.  Just spent $22 on conditioner that isn&#x27;t conditioner.</li>
            <li> What a terrific deal!  This was a great price for this amount. I&#x27;ve never ordered shampoo/conditioner from Amazon, but I will be from now on!  No complaints!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this along with the shampoo in this house for at least three years. Enough said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been highlighting and dying my hair for about 12 years now.... If you have dandruff or dry, damaged hair... this is the product for you. Works great on thick or thin hair, male or female. My boyfriend often steals a few pumps when I am not looking. Note, this is the original recipe of Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Conditioner.... not to be confused with new versions that have microbeads. I like to use the conditioner independently from the shampoo, because the eucalyptus oil in the shampoo is pretty strong and makes my scalp tingle a little too much. Use it twice a week and killed my dry scalp issues. Left my hair moisturized without being oily (like argon oil products). Would definitely recommend to a friend. This merchant also shipped VERY fast.</li>
            <li> I bought this several months back and have been using it for a while, though (thankfully) not regularly. I have used Paul Mitchell Tea Tree products for over 10 years, and have loved them. They&#x27;ve been great for my hair and scalp, and smell great. But when I first got this bottle I thought, &amp;#34;hmm, this smells different.&amp;#34; It had a slightly stronger, and harsher smell compared to what I had before. &amp;#34;Oh well,&amp;#34; I thought, &amp;#34;maybe I just remember the old smell wrong.&amp;#34; Um, nope. Just today I was at a haircut and decided to purchase a new bottle since it was on sale. When I got the new bottle home I opened it and smelled it, and immediately realized that what I had bought on Amazon was a bad knock off. The REAL Tea Tree has a smooth, soothing scent and is lighter in color. This &amp;#34;whatever-it-is&amp;#34; stuff is very green and a bit harsh to the nose. It is definitely not the real PM Tea Tree, so I would not buy this product off of Amazon (especially since PM states that they only sell to authorized retailers/salons). I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ve been putting in my hair these past few months, but I&#x27;m a little disturbed to think that it wasn&#x27;t actually conditioner. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I have long,thick hair, and had to use a ton of this product to detangle, and it made my hair feel dry, not a good moisturizing conditioner at all, im so bummed because I love the tea tree shampoo.</li>
            <li> just as described, fast shipping AAA+++</li>
            <li> Love being able to get this very large size. Hard to find elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and at a great price. Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> the product is great but the shipment came damaged because it was in a weak box for the weight of the product (4).  Thank goodness they were encased in plastic bags so I could scoop out the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am a natural hair woman and this conditioner really detangles my hair and leaves it soft and manageable. I would recomend this product to every one I know.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner.  Tingles when you put it on, and gives you a clean feeling.  Doesn&#x27;t build up like other conditioners.  The shampoo is great too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of tea tree products over the years, but have settled on Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Tea Tree Special products.  Both the shampoo and the conditioner have a strong minty smell to it.  I have curly hair and have problems with dry scalp, but with the Paul Mitchell conditioner and a little leave in conditioner, my hair is mostly free from flakes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive, but it works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Not a great moisturizing conditioner--disappointed. Decent for shaving though.</li>
            <li> Instead of receiving this conditioner, I got one that was for hair and body and was a leave-in conditioner/lotion. It is super sticky and not at all what I wanted. Plus, the top was open, so I opened up the box to find a giant mess. :-( Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Product was fine but it was not packed well and leaked out of the bottle</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves your hair feeling more like it was conditioned with a volumizing condition, read: dryer and hard to get a brush through. I can barely rip a brush through my hair after using this for a week. It DOES smell incredibly good, but my hair is so left frizzy with the ends undone (I have fine, straight hair) that the smell just isn&#x27;t worth it. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m spoiled. I can&#x27;t use anything else. This stuff is not only great, but it makes your hair smell like Christmas</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner, it&#x27;s one of the only ones my hair doesn&#x27;t get used to after a bottle. Honestly it took my hair some time to get soft while using it but now it makes my hair so soft even though it&#x27;s really damaged by straightening it every day :x</li>
            <li> I really liked it. I will buy it again as soon as I run out. It&#x27;s a huge bottle which helps and the pump is nice.</li>
            <li> This Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Conditioner, 33.8 Ounce leaves my scalp tingling and my thin fly away hair more easily managed. After washing my hair and rinsing out the shampoo, I apply the Tea Tree Special Conditioner and let it sit for the remainder of my shower. I can feel it start working within minutes of its application. That tingle feels so good. After 5-10 minutes, rinse it out for more smooth and managable hair. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please rate this review if you found it helpful.</li>
            <li> It definitely works the best if used with the Tea Tree Special Shampoo. It&#x27;s a leave in conditioner, so I use it after taking a shower along with the Tea Tree Shaping Cream.  Overall, it&#x27;s an excellent product, would recommend!</li>
            <li> Using this product made my hair texture really dry. I had to use a lot to be able to pull a comb though my hair.</li>
            <li> This product makes me all tingly.  I haven&#x27;t felt this great since Nam.  Thanks Paul Mitchell, you sure know how to make a man purr.</li>
            <li> I received the tea tree conditioner today, smells nice, worked great. I gave 3 stars instead of 5 because of the pump dispenser being broken- it will be very difficult to use this huge liter bottle without a pump.</li>
            <li> I had been introduced to this product a few years back and it is a great conditioner. I would suggest this to anyone that is looking for a strong conditioner that will make your scalp tingle.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell is a little chemically for my taste in the first place, and this conditioner just plain fried me out. I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great price and great product.  I have been using Paul Mitchell tea tree products for years, due to a sebaceous gland issue.  I love this product, and the aroma it instills you with.  Nothing is quite like it.</li>
            <li> I love tea tree oil and thought this would be great for me hair....it doesn&#x27;t work at all. My hair isn&#x27;t soft. It is the most tangled it has ever been. I will never buy Paul Mitchell products again</li>
            <li> I was bummed! I get really dry static-like hair, especially in the winter, so I bought this bottle thinking it&#x27;d be my savior. Dead wrong. This will make your hair feel smoother and softer.....but seriously, totally drier. The product has an amazing smell and will last in your hair, until you drown your hair in oils to quench its thirst.</li>
            <li> Correct product and arrived early.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a counterfeit product. When i opened it, i noticed the consistency and smell was off and took it to my friend&#x27;s salon. She compared it side by side to this one and it is clearly not the same conditioner. It is thicker and smells much different. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> not nearly as nice a product as Revon Men.. I wish they still marketed it</li>
            <li> Not worth any stars the item arrived today and broke dame day</li>
            <li> The best conditioner for colored or non colored hair.  Revitalizes the scalp and makes hair feel clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is a wonderful conditioner. I have a dry scalp so this is a product I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  The winter really dries out my scalp and makes it itchy so I was told to get some tea tree products.  This stuff works great and leaves both my hair and scalp feeling wonderful.  Will definitely buy again and will be buying the shampoo to go with it.</li>
            <li> Good price ... Good product</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my stylist and I have been using it since. It is wonderful for processed hair. I am also an athlete and bike a lot outdoors in the summer, this tends to dry out my highlighted hair and make it have a strawlike texture, this product when used every time I wash my hair, alleviates this problem. It keeps my hair soft, shiny and conditioned!</li>
            <li> This stuff is one of my favorites. Between this and Paul Mitchell, my hair is very healthy...I absolutely love green tea conditioners and shampoos.</li>
            <li> Conditioner leaked in box. It was in a plastic bags, but still was a huge mess and lost product.</li>
            <li> Great product, but arrived all leaky in the box and package. Amazon was great to refund. I have used this in the past and it has a nice clean scent. Leaves my hair conditioned but not greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this as it keeps her from breaking out. I tell her to rinse it out better but she doesn&#x27;t believe me. Most conditioners leave a film on your skin and will cause acne. But the tea tree oil in this conditioner must have antiseptic properties to keep that from happening.</li>
            <li> I use it daily with the shampoo and no longer have a problem with an itchy scalp.It works well! Bravo!!</li>
            <li> Does a good job on my hair. Has a nice minty/eucalyptus smell to it. Large bottle. Available in many places so check around for the best prices. The shampoo isn&#x27;t as good as the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Replacement for previously used product that works well</li>
            <li> I tried this product one time over a friends house and I knew instantly I was going to continue to buy it. I have very oily hair and rarely can use conditioner. This conditioner left my hair feeling clean and looking amazing! I love this product. Can&#x27;t beat the price also!</li>
            <li> awesome conditioner, a must have to go along with the shampoo, as well as the leave in conditioner which is my favorite.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I learned about it from a friend for people with dandruff problems or other health related problems affecting their hair.</li>
            <li> I like the cooling sensation the Tea Tree and Peppermint essential oils produce on the scalp, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is one of the best out there. With its minty scent, it softens your hair without weighing it down. I get more compliments on how healthy my hair looks. And if you like the scent, I strongly suggest buying to shampoo by the same company. They work together very well.</li>
