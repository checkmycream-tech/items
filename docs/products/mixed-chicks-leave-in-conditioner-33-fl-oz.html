            <li>prefer OGX argan curl defining cream, but this works nicely too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the kind of hair that makes people ask me if I&#x27;ve had a perm (the curly perm, not the straightening perm).  </li>
            <li>Makes combing her hair out so much easier, and it dries into perfect ringlets.  </li>
            <li>This is the BEST product I have ever used on my very curly haired granddaughters.  </li>
            <li>it hair very full of shine, and for the first time I could honestly say my wavy/curly hair looked the best it ever has.</li>

            <li>It applies very easily, although depending on the length and thickness of your hair, you may find that you need to use a generous amount.</li>
            <li>She is biracial, and her curly hair tangles and dries out very easily.  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li>absolutely love it, i have wavy hair and with this product they look amazing.</li>

            <li>It makes my curls perfectly defined and soft.  </li>
            <li>This is the best conditioner for my weave so far.</li>

            <li>:)) I get compliments on it all the time and tell everyone about it.</li>
            <li>I have found that most products were either too greasy or so saturated with alcohol that it damaged her hair.</li>
            <li>In all the years of doing my daughters hair, I&#x27;ve never been able to just finger comb it...until now.</li>
            <li>Just put a dime sized amount or more in your hair after you shower and voila.</li>
            <li>just wish it worked more to my liking.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I use this product daily and it works great!!</li>
            <li>With the amount of conditioner in this bottle, I was able to fill up the conditioner bottle a couple of times before we ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I am hoping they help reduce the frizz more).</li>

            <li>It does an okay job of making my curls uniform, but the moisturizing part just doesn&#x27;t cut it for my hair.</li>
            <li>You will be glad you did and your going to remember this review and say \\&quot;hey I am glad I got this\\&quot;</li>
            <li>my curls form better...</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The results weren&#x27;t consistent and I couldn&#x27;t be confident that I would have a good hair day.</li>
            <li>has a really nice and clean smell.  </li>
            <li>I received it quickly and it came with free goodies inside!!</li>
            <li>As I said it works pretty good on my hair</li>
            <li>Our son plays competitive soccer and even after a 10 hour day I&#x27;m the field his hair still looks pretty dang good.</li>
            <li>soft, frizz-free, beautiful curls/</li>
            <li>Leave it soft, shinny, and with beautiful tamed curls</li>
            <li>I originally bought this product for $32 and now it&#x27;s almost $50!</li>
            <li>The way that works best for me is to apply it after I&#x27;ve taken a shower; using a microfiber towel I scrunch  most of the water out, then use a wide tooth comb to work out any tangles.</li>
            <li>it works great in my hair (which is naturally curly and all over the place like a lion&#x27;s mane) :)</li>
            <li>I gave this a try since I am always on the search for good product for my high maintenance curls, and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this product, so light</li>
            <li>MOST IMPORTANT STEP*</li>
            <li>MOST IMPORTANT STEP*</li>
            <li>Great product for my Loves who have beautifull curly, soft hair.</li>
            <li>Great product for natural hair.  </li>
            <li>It keeps my hair healthy, shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li>My wife is Brazilian, and she says this is the best hair conditioning lotion she has ever used, by a wide margin.  </li>
            <li>Great for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>If you are considering this product, I&#x27;m sure this is a familiar tale.  </li>
            <li>It is the best thing I have found for my curly hair, especially in the hot and humid south!</li>
            <li>I love my curls, not crazy about frizz!  </li>
            <li>I am so happy to see it in my local Target and grocery store, but the Amazon Prime makes it a better deal.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make your hair look oily and greasy.</li>
            <li>We can comb it so easily after using this product.</li>
            <li>But I do strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own :) Mixed Chicks magically tames the untamed!</li>
            <li>Recently started cocktailing it with DermOrganic&#x27;s Aragon Oil and love the leave in even more!!</li>
            <li>Hands down, the best product ever for curly hair!</li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>just fine</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but I have A LOT of hair.</li>
            <li>I would not recommend if you have fine hair...</li>
            <li>and I am super pleased.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product because I want to find the stuff that works and !</li>
            <li>Detangles black hair amazing doing great things.</li>
            <li>I cant speak for everyone but my sister has fine long beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>This leave in is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have found Mixed Chicks!  </li>
            <li>Some days my curls were fabulous, didn&#x27;t happen to often but did happen, and others they were easier to manage.  </li>
            <li>Since I do my wash and go only once a week, the 33 oz bottle lasts for about 4 or 5 months which I think is a great value.</li>
            <li>So I have tried a few products and I like this one the best.  </li>
            <li>If I use it straight out of the shower to scrunch in to curls, it dries nicely and keeps frizz at bay.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product we use it everyday</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried frizz free products, shining serums, all types of conditioners and shampoos.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many, many products for many years, to keep it from going wild after it dries.  </li>
            <li>If you have curly hair of any type or even wavy, this product works fantastic..</li>
            <li>She lives fit this stuff.</li>
            <li>This product makes my hair smooth out.</li>
            <li>i would have loved to be able to do when younger!</li>
            <li>It leaves my curls soft and defined, with good hold.  </li>
            <li>We use Mixed Chicks shampoo and it is very nice.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend because I love love this product.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product based on the reviews....</li>
            <li>So worth it!</li>
            <li>Although it&#x27;s on the pricier side I think it&#x27;s worth every cent !</li>
            <li>I love love love mixed chicks!!!</li>
            <li>When I use the Mixed Chicks leave-in conditioner my hair it is easy to comb, curls beautifully, and doesn&#x27;t frizz as much during the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super light weight and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky or with build up.</li>
            <li>I have been using Mixed Chicks for more than 5 years, and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>Used it and immediately liked it more than my last leave in (kinky curly).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of different products and this is by far the best for my hair.</li>
            <li>Mixed Chicks is bye far the best leave in for my transitioning hair.</li>
            <li>We have found that using a generous amount of this conditioner during her tubbie and brushing her curls out with The Wet Brush (check it out) minimizes the pain of de-tangling, and leaves her hair silky smooth and smelling great.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be a special staple in my hair care regimen, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing anymore</li>
            <li>It allows my curls to curl perfectly, but doesnt make my hair hard like gel.</li>
            <li>Leave my hair hard but holds style superbly.</li>
            <li>some afrocentric products like Wet n Wavy creme moist curl creme (really great product) thrown in to manage my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for using when you are wearing a ponytail or want the wet look.  </li>
            <li>I have curly hair that is manageable with a good conditioning product but mixed chicks eaves my hair feeling sticky and clumpy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So...this product must ONLY be good for you to toss it in your hair after washing it without any detangling and just leave it in....</li>
            <li>We have tried various leave in conditioners, but none have worked as good as this one.</li>
            <li>My mother told me that she applies it to near-dry hair as she is styling after she blow dries her hair, and it works like magic to hold her hair the way she wants to style.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Mixed chicks product were good not the packaging.</li>
            <li>Dream come true.  </li>
            <li>and I tried it recently and loved it for me because it added body to my hair while it was air drying</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product overall.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like \\&quot;I&#x27;ve got a mind of my own\\&quot; poker straight and can and will stick out all over the place, think \\&quot;chia pet\\&quot;....</li>
            <li>But I applied the Leave-in and really had the lose ring hair for most of the day.</li>
            <li>If you have curly hair this is a dream come true.  </li>
            <li>No frizz, nice curls, soft hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good ,, not bad product ,, but not marvelous or perfect same i read ,, my opinion it&#x27;s make your hear more curly if you have a curly  </li>
            <li>My daughter has super curly hair.</li>
            <li>This product has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>The ones at Target was in a smaller bottle for $20+ and this one on amazon costs more, but you get a lot more</li>
            <li>Nothing else has worked nearly as well at keeping my hair healthy and frizz free.</li>
            <li>I will definitely use up this bottle and keep it as my fall back while I find that perfect product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>I get out of the shower and just do a pat down with a towel on my hair, one pump squirt of this great product and then work it into the hair evenly.  </li>
            <li>The smell is really off and smells strongly of fragrance and alcohol.</li>
            <li>I just finished my first bottle and already ordered another one!</li>
            <li>My hair is straight and quite fine; this product probably would not work well on it.  </li>
            <li>This is right in the middle, and I am totally in love with it!  </li>
            <li>great leave in conditioner - does not weigh your hair down!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many products ranging in low to very high prices.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need to use a bunch of products in my hair to try to calm the frizziness.</li>
            <li>(Sleeping on a silk pillowcase also helps keep my hair calm.)  </li>
            <li>if you use it in conjunction with a tiny bit of keratin lotion the combination is amazing.</li>
            <li>Having a baby with a different curl type than my own made it a life saver.</li>
            <li>Spendy but worth it.</li>
            <li>In Conditioner is by far my favorite styling product.</li>
            <li>We go through the leave-in conditioner the fastest, so it was worth it to buy in the biggest sized offered.</li>
            <li>So far this product gives me the most slippage.</li>
            <li>Also I like the economical size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I am now looking for a more natural product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several leave in conditioners for my natural hair and this by far is the best.</li>
            <li>Seems much more natural way to handle curly hair.  </li>
            <li>lightweight, fresh and non-sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Item arrived earlier than expected and the product is awesome.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they even marked it up once Halle Berry endorsed it.</li>
            <li>I wont say that I will transition to only using this, because honestly I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>so it is worth it.</li>
            <li>worth the price</li>
            <li>but natural trying is better.</li>
            <li>leave-in conditioner works better than most of the other products that we&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is from Ethiopia love love it with the wet brush!</li>
            <li>Other than that mixed chicks is the best product I&#x27;ve ever bought for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Mixed Chicks products and this combined with the deep conditioner and shampoo make my hair feel amazing!</li>
            <li>I can comb right thru her hair.</li>
            <li>The price is right when you purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li>If that happens i just use my hands to scrunch the curls and it softens right up.</li>
            <li>the price is right...</li>
            <li>Also, the product arrived in good condition and exactly as described, however, the shipment was received three days after the expected shipment date given when I placed my order.</li>
            <li>I love how this product shapes my curls, makes my  naturally dry, curly hair, smooth, controlling frizz and manageable.  </li>
            <li>her hair naturally curls back up as it dries into some adorable, Shirley Temple ringlets. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably as good as something in the $15-20 but not up to MC manufacturing- selling standards, and not worth the $42...</li>
            <li>The price is a little more than I want to pay, but I haven&#x27;t found anything better, so I will continue to spend the money.</li>
            <li>The only thing I did find good about this product is that it leaves the hair feeling soft and almost weightless after it</li>
            <li>regardless which shampoo I use (I am more picky about conditioner than shampoo as most people are, and there are a few cheaper conditioners that work</li>
            <li>regardless which shampoo I use (I am more picky about conditioner than shampoo as most people are, and there are a few cheaper conditioners that work</li>
            <li>My hair was left into beautiful spiral curls and long flowing waves.</li>
            <li>My girls and I have thin Hair but very curly it works great !!!</li>
            <li>so much easier fresh out the shower or just damp in the morning for a fresh pony tail look</li>
            <li>Even better, her hair stays looking good for most of the day, which is something that most of the other products that we&#x27;ve tried usually fail to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hard to find, great to buy online.  </li>
            <li>My daughters are biracial and this is by far the best product I have found to tame their natural curls!</li>
            <li>Most importantly Mixed Chicks Leave-</li>
            <li>We would fight over her hair and end up with a final product that didn&#x27;t look much better than when we started.  </li>
            <li>We also love the shampoo and deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money for the whole set.  </li>
            <li>Expect to use another product to detangle first before applying it if you so desire.</li>
            <li>I was gifted with Mixed Chicks Leave-In-Conditioner 9 months ago</li>
            <li>Italian &amp; Lebanese), but this product is also aimed towards Mediterranean hair as well :-).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m about to buy the 33 ounce bottle which will probably last me years, just because I really do love it</li>
            <li>I love this product, only one that works for our family!  </li>
            <li>I love Mixed Chicks.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say it took care of frizz or made many Curls but definitely added body to my Hair..</li>
            <li>Glad I found the bigger bottle here on amazon.</li>
            <li>I use it exactly like the instructions says.  </li>
            <li>My hair is finally tangle free!  </li>
            <li>Mixed chicks works better than lotion or any gel Ive ever used.</li>
            <li>:) I am not a mixed chick, but my hair loves this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>A most have if you have mixed textured hair.</li>
            <li>Love mixed chicks.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery also!</li>
            <li>I fell in love with Mixed Chicks on a recommendation from a friend.  </li>
            <li>It really works well in the shower!  </li>
            <li>They were ok, but their curl-defining and conditioning abilities don&#x27;t compare at all to what Mixed Chicks Leave-in</li>
            <li>I had heard about Mixed Chicks products and I had read reviews both pro and con, but I watched the video of the 2 lovely ladies who created the product and I decided to jump in with both feet -</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t provide the hold I need to go dancing where I&#x27;m bound to sweat and the humidity is higher, but for every day use in the SF Bay area....</li>
            <li>I have curly/wavy indian hair and have tried many products or a combination of products but hadn&#x27;t found anything that just \\&quot;fit\\&quot; until trying Mixed Chicks Leave in Conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do for your hair</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more</li>
            <li>I have read that the MEN&#x27;S version is much better, so am giving that a try next.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t get the exact results my salon can from this, but it&#x27;s darn close.</li>
            <li>I love this mixed chicks conditioner.</li>
            <li>I am not technically a mixed chick, but love this product and what it does for my unruly, sometimes frizzy curls.  </li>
            <li>However, as I kept using it, it seemed that I needed to use a lot more to get the same results.</li>
            <li>Best stuff I have ever used on my mixed Indian and African American hair.</li>
            <li>but if you want strong hold, you have to use a little more.</li>
            <li>We absolutely love it and have tried many other products that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>It is not easy to find a good product for curly hair, but this did the trick.</li>
            <li>My friend recommended this product to me (who has gorgeous big Egyptian curly hair with tiny curls and has tried numerous hair products as you can imagine) that it works like magic.</li>
            <li>Great prize for such a big bottle, normally cost $50-60</li>
            <li>It is yellow cream colored and has mild and pleasant smell which does not clash with other fragrant bath products (i.e. body lotion, perfume, etc.).</li>
            <li>The next morning it is easy to comb through and nearly tangle free.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good enough that you don&#x27;t even have to use it daily</li>
            <li>This is unlike any product I have used in that it is not at all greasy and not particulary heavy, smells faintly (not much noticeable scent from this product, great!)</li>
            <li>Now im back on Mixed Chicks and this product is so good you do not need to use anything else.</li>
            <li>It is of lotion consistency, and the best part is that it keeps the shape of your curls without making them crunchy or oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply it to my hair after towel-drying my hair after morning workout and air dry it on my way to work.</li>
            <li>have not used any other products by Mixed Chicks (shampoo or conditioner) because I am happy with the results I get with their leave-in conditioner</li>
            <li>have not used any other products by Mixed Chicks (shampoo or conditioner) because I am happy with the results I get with their leave-in conditioner</li>
            <li>After about a month of using this product everyday my curls became more  defined and my hair was so soft  :-)</li>
            <li>and my hair ends up being a bit greasy, but now I separate my hair in to 4 sections after a shower and usually 1/2 - 1 pump is good for each section.  </li>
            <li>I dont leave my hair in its naturally curly state, I blow dry it and straighten it, but I still love the way this product makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li>and most conditioners do nothing, and leave-in conditioners harden my hair or dry and flake off.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, it does work well, and we ended up buying a second bottle of this stuff after we used up the first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I let it air dry without touching it.</li>
            <li>Works super well on naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>My curls are defined and not frizzy yet still super soft.</li>
            <li>I normally won&#x27;t pay this much for a bottle of conditioner, but I figured that if it worked well, then it might be worth it.  </li>
            <li>Buying the large dispenser at Amazon is the way to go....</li>
            <li>On certain occasions we do shampoo their hair, but not often.  </li>
            <li>this is an excellent product for my granddaugters hair, she is biracial and there are very few products like it, the leave in conditioner when her hair is wet</li>
            <li>This is the first line of products that I&#x27;ve used that follows the same system I developed myself after many years of trying all the products in the store.</li>
            <li>it makes my curly frizzy full head of thick hair very easy to handle..</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to find a good product without it drying my hair</li>
            <li>Simply the best for my little mixed chick&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li>The trick is, knowing how much to use.</li>
            <li>but I have very uncooperative hair....</li>
            <li>I shampooed my hair to remove the build up, and it helped, but shampoo is very drying for my hair and makes it frizz.</li>
            <li>really do like to avoid shampoos and cones</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re deciding how much to buy- a 10 ounce bottle has lasted me for 9 months</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what I will do if this was ever discontinued.</li>
            <li>She absolutely dreads brushing her hair.  </li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>She uses the sulfate free shampoo, deep conditioner and the leave-in conditioner faithfully.</li>
            <li>and it works really well.</li>
            <li>My mother and father have stick straight hair, and both my brothers have stick straight hair.</li>
            <li>However much to my surprise</li>
            <li>She patted my shoulder and said you didn&#x27;t do much to get your hair to look like that</li>
            <li>i lost so much hair in one wash</li>
            <li>thing I will point out is how the price has really gone up on this product on amazon.</li>
            <li>Price point now matches what is available in our local stores.</li>
            <li>I have perfected the application and really like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>and I am ready to go.  </li>
            <li>The leave in conditioner really helps &#x27;organize&#x27; my mop of curls</li>
            <li>It really helps to define our curls and defrizz the hair  in this humid weather.</li>
            <li>so I have very Mediterranean hair</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re latino, mixed all across the board with almost all colors and hair types available in our home.</li>

            <li>It scared me seeing so much hair coming out on my comb</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li>Well, they were telling the absolute truth.</li>
            <li>Have to say it really does work.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find the expiration date-batch code which is unusual for this product.</li>

            <li>It really works for me.</li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>Mixed chicks makes my very curly hair look healthy and feel natural.  </li>
            <li>Not a ton of either product, but enough to HOLD that wild thing on top of my head in place.</li>
            <li>Top pump on the top of the container was broken.</li>
            <li>MUST HAVE for anyone with natural curly hair!!!</li>
            <li>you have to make sure it mixes will with any other products you put in your hair with it.</li>
            <li>Love this product works extremely well.</li>
            <li>but once your hair is dry you can scrunch and run your fingers through your hair and your curls will be extremely soft! :)</li>
            <li>I love Mixed Chicks and would definitely be buying more in the near future.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair about shoulder length and it leaves my hair soft and shiny and washes out nicely leaving no build up!</li>
            <li>it looks great , also i put a little on my hair when it&#x27;s dry for my frizzies .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>well worth the price since no other products are needed.</li>
            <li>As I have aged I find my hair getting drier so after researching I have settled on the following magical formula for good looking hair everyday.  </li>
            <li>Most leave-in conditioners don&#x27;t provide any holding power, and most gels leave hair stiff and dry.</li>
            <li>So when we go to the local swimming pool (where there is no time for anything but washing the hair in some generic shampoo), the hair still looks good afterwards (despite not using the mixed chicks products there).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the full Mixed Chicks system for about six months now</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice any spectacular results, particularly compared to what we usually use - ORS olive leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Our curly hair ranges from loose curls to extremely tight curls, most if not all easily tangle;</li>
            <li>I am of Irish descent and have very fine, very curly hair that is prone to being dry.  </li>
            <li>This is the second time we purchased the Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner, and we love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super simple too.</li>
            <li>To fix that problem, I just filled up one of my old bottles of conditioner with Mixed Chicks; that worked quite well.  </li>
            <li>I quickly jumped back in the shower to rinse it out but the itching continued.</li>
            <li>I use to buy it only for Target since it was the only place I was able to find it.</li>
            <li>My nieces giggled because they thought an older lady was hitting on their uncle.</li>
            <li>My nieces giggled because they thought an older lady was hitting on their uncle.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments on my hair and mixed chicks is the only product I use on my hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it from amazon because it&#x27;s a lot more expensive in most stores.</li>
            <li>I am not mixed, I have many textures in my hair and mixed chicks worked on all of it.  </li>
            <li>it conditions your hair at the same time when I wash it out my hair is so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>, I have 3 girls and the two older girls</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it .</li>
            <li>so sometimes there is a little frizz, but she puts more leave-in cond.</li>
            <li>Now just because it did not work for me does not mean it will not work for you.  </li>
            <li>My hair is super fine and poker straight...but not Anglo-Saxon lay down flat poker straight.</li>
            <li>Works very well on curly hair, although doesn&#x27;t remove frizz completely.</li>
            <li>Nothing ever seemed to really make my hair shiny or feel soft.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants soft shiny hair...</li>
            <li>I have long flowing waves/spiral curls that look amazing, with minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have long flowing waves/spiral curls that look amazing, with minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My kids have soft curly hair and this really helps to define the curls.  </li>
            <li>It makes their hair look really curly and soft.  </li>
            <li>We have purchased this product before and by far it is much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s seriously worth the 19.25 for a 10 ounce bottle (that&#x27;s only $2.18 a month if you&#x27;re doing the math!)</li>
            <li>This will \\&quot;tame\\&quot; your hair and define the curls all day long while keeping your hair soft and flake free.</li>
            <li>have curly hair with different textures and they both use the mixed chicks and they love it As well as for my 15 month old</li>
            <li>sometimes even bigger hair is fun..</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s actually quite economical.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for something to tame your frizzes, define your curls, and keep your hair healthy, mixed chicks is DEFINITELY worth the buy.</li>
            <li>It smells light and gives the right amount of slick for a multitude of styles from wash and goes to braid outs.</li>
            <li>Great product, I have very long, thick, and curly hair.</li>
            <li>Second, it makes your curls super soft and defined.  </li>
            <li>You use only a nickel to quarter size amount of this stuff on wet hair and it spreads very easily and dries naturally.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, fine, frizzy hair and this helps with keeping it soft and naturally curled.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t to live without this product</li>
            <li>My daughter can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s half full still!</li>
            <li>The 2 Mixed Chicks ladies had much longer and much curlier/kinkier hair than I do</li>
            <li>I really like mixed chicks because when it dries my hair is not frizzy and the curls are really defined.</li>
            <li>The price here is better than anywhere else, but still a little too pricey!</li>
            <li>I am white with wavy hair, and it also works very well to define my curls a little more.</li>
            <li>Soft, defined, non-frizzy curls are no longer my dream, they are my reality!</li>
            <li>Hello to my natural curls and waves!  </li>
            <li>its by far!</li>
            <li>I would recommend getting a smaller bottle to try first</li>
            <li>This is something I will be ordering through Amazon consistently because a bottle this size costs me about $60 at the local hair store.</li>
            <li>After trying out the Trio sample package of the Mixed Chicks line (shampoo, deep conditioner, and leave-in conditioner) I fell in love with the last two items.</li>
            <li>I tried a sample of this product first, never hearing about mixed chicks products before.</li>
            <li>But there is a fine balance on how much you should use b/c there have been times where I&#x27;ve gone overboard</li>
            <li>Highly recommend worth every penny I spent</li>
            <li>By end of the day you do need to re wet and apply more if u have long hair.  </li>
            <li>T hen I apply about 2 quarter sized dollops through out my hair concentrating primarily on the mid section and the ends, scrunching as  I go, and then let it air dry.</li>
            <li>Daughter&#x27;s hair looks great out of the bath, the next morning it&#x27;s fairly dry but not too hard to comb</li>
            <li>this is probably the only leave-in conditioner i&#x27;ll ever use to get that fresh wet curly hair look, and I love that it lasts all day without my hair feeling greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li>Our son is mixed African American with a strong heritage of Indian in him</li>
            <li>I have super thick coarse naturally curly red hair which I have always thought of more as a curse than a blessing.</li>
            <li>Crunch hair with a used clean, old t shirt or a microfiber or shammy upside down.</li>
            <li>I really like Mixed Chicks professional look</li>
            <li>My natural hair is soft and springy,  the relaxed part is soft.  </li>
            <li>Finally gave in and bought the whole line of products.</li>
            <li>I am biracial with natural 3c curls that I loosen to a 3a/b-ish curl with a keratin treatment (once a month, 275 degrees to maintain the curl and avoid heat damage) for manageability and to remove frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Beware Celiacs or those sensitive to wheat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have naturally curly hair this product helps eliminate frizz.</li>
            <li>(I did not expect it since she does not have naturally curly hair), so I sent two 33oz bottles to her</li>
            <li>None of these gave me the soft, defined, non-frizzy curls I dreamed of.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and not dried out.</li>
            <li>and I get lots of compliments on my natural curls....</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, leaves my hair soft and curly, no frizzes.</li>
            <li>Somehow people without naturally curly hair think this will miraculously turn their hair naturally curly.</li>
            <li>and it makes my hair soft.  </li>
            <li>But this leave in conditioner makes it really soft.  </li>
            <li>I decide that for the summer, I would go natural.  </li>
            <li>I am white, not ethnic, but this is for anybody who wants to amplify their waves or curls.  </li>
            <li>Finally a product for girls with hair somewhere in between straight and nappy.  </li>
            <li>It controls frizz and leaves my hair curly and soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my natural curls pop.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave her hair greasy, but soft and well moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Bottom line, for anyone with wild ethnic hair that needs additional control, this stuff</li>
            <li>Bottom line, for anyone with wild ethnic hair that needs additional control, this stuff</li>
            <li>We have two mixed chicks at home, age 3 and 9, and this product is a real life saver.</li>
            <li>It is a curly look but looks and feels natural.</li>
            <li>Oh and don&#x27;t rinse your hair too much after the deep conditioner.</li>
            <li>I prefer soft, supple,  springy curls with movement.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and leave my hair soft without that over product crunch.&lt;br</li>
            <li>BTW my idea of a medium hold is no frizz, curls hold their shape even after a bit of primping but stays touchable soft</li>
            <li>makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>my 15yr old daughter has been using this product since a couple of years.</li>
            <li>not heavy on the curls</li>
            <li>They have products that work equally as well when you do want to wear your hair straight.  </li>
            <li>use this product for my 4B type hair when I want to go natural.</li>
            <li>I get hair compliments every day and my hair is soft.</li>
            <li>My daughter has soft cork screw curls</li>
            <li>My hair feels absolutely soft and manageable after I use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used amazon prime for several years although I don&#x27;t write as many reviews as I should because I heavily rely on customer reviews when I order products.</li>
            <li>After spending most of my adult life trying to tame my curls with a blow dryer and roller brush, I used Mixed Chicks after a recommendation from a friend.  </li>
            <li>The other mixed chick conditioner (wash-out), and the shampoo are also good, but if you had to rank the Mixed Chicks products, I would say that this is the best one (but still I would get the other ones as well).</li>
            <li>I just wash my hair, dry lightly, put this in and let my hair dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>This product is now the only curly hair product I will ever use(as a styler) , It is moisturizing ,long lasting and flake free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m multi-racial and my hair texture is just as varied; looking at a single strand the texture ranges from coarse, medium and fine (and not necessarily in that order).</li>
            <li>The hair was finally looking decent yet it was not shiny</li>
            <li>The reason why I&#x27;m writing this review is because I was stopped earlier this week by an older woman when I was out with my two nieces.</li>
            <li>The price was good (a few dollars cheaper than I usually pay).</li>
            <li>hair is very thick, very thirsty, tangles easily.</li>
            <li>My hair is a mixture of coarse and fine hair which creates a frizzy mess with humidity.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and when I use the right amount, it won&#x27;t leave my hair greasy like other curl cremes have done.  </li>
            <li>It was a collective amount of other products right along with the mix chick product to get the shine and vibrance and tangle frree freedom that came from three others along with mix chicks.</li>
            <li>I actually had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it to anyone with curly or mixed hair.</li>
            <li>I would only recommend this product if you wash your hair everyday (not 1-3 times a week like many people with ethnic mixed hair like me).</li>
            <li>I have fine to medium hair which made me worried when I ordered this product because EVERYTHING else I tried either left my hair heavy, greasy, sticky.</li>
            <li>When applied after wetting your hair it&#x27;ll keep it smooth and controlled, less fly aways and loose hairs sticking up all crazy like.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that it leaves my hair a little crunchy almost like a light hold gel.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, conditions her curly, chilly hair very well</li>
            <li>I used to switch curl products every few months with hugely varying results, until my salon used mixed chicks on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have very kinky dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>If you try to fool with them too much it will become frizzy and dry looking.</li>
            <li>I actually bought the whole line (shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner, &amp; leave in).</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t sing the praises of Mixed Chicks enough.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Our first bottle of Mixed Chicks lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li>It is very concentrated, so I actually pour it into a smaller bottle and mix it with water.</li>
            <li>I am African American and her dad is Indian, so her hair turned out to be really curly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a white, 100% Caucasian woman, I&#x27;ve always had blonde hair, straight like a stick.</li>
            <li>I have waited my whole life for a hair product that was neither for Caucasian or African American hair.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, it is not sticky, it is not heavy, and it has a light smell.  </li>
            <li>I happened on this conditioner in a small boutique mostly selling beauty products for African Americans.&lt;br /&gt;I am white</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey, but the last bottle lasted us 6 months, so it was definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>Soft bouncy curls that smell good, not like those weird smells of the mayonnaise and creams for African american hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few years now - originally purchased at a local beauty supply shop that is no longer in business so now ordering off Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is a little pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li>gave it a 4 star only because it does not completely tame my frizz,but I have not found a product yet that can get close to the results that I have had with this</li>
            <li>Long time user, this is the only product that will keep my curls nice and soft without the dried out crunchy feeling i get from all other curly hair products.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the Mixed Chicks shampoo and deep conditioner as well.</li>
            <li>I have tried countless hair products in all price ranges, from a low to very high end, for frizz control and styling, and nothing has worked as well as Mixed chicks leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I generally put it in my hair after the shower.</li>
            <li>If I put mixed chicks in my hair then braid my hair in 4 small sections, my curls are looser, longer, and nicer after I remove the braids and shake my hair free.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of products and Mixed Chicks leaves my hair controlled, yet soft.</li>
            <li>The crunch disappeared and I was left with hair so soft</li>
            <li>I went back to natural</li>
            <li>I use this on soaking wet hair in the shower, about 10 - 12 pumps for my whole head.</li>
            <li>initially but that seems to soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I am 8 months transitioning back to natural,  </li>
            <li>My ends are relaxed and my natural is growing in 4a and totally gray .</li>
            <li>Talking mostly to African americans going natural and you want pretty,soft curls.</li>
            <li>first time I used this product: After Shampoo &amp; Condition with Mizani products...&lt;br /&gt;I tried a Roller / Wet Set with this Mixed Chicks product with 20 minutes under a hooded ionic hair dryer (neutral air temp-</li>
            <li>so I look more &#x27;finished&#x27; rather than sloppy.  </li>
            <li>Apply in small sections, then quickly barely-rinse over it all to make it coat every strand together.</li>
            <li>I do not use any other products in my hair with this leave-in, though sometimes I will put a little deva curl anGEL on my edges and at the very ends of my curls for a little more hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>website).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have struggled for a long time to find a lightweight, non sticky, medium hold product that works all day long and smells at least moderately nice and the Mixed Chicks</li>
            <li>little expensive in the salon but a great value in this size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter has such frizzy hair and it really tones it down and makes it look naturally curly.</li>
            <li>(the morning after using ORS is much easier), 2 mornings later it&#x27;s even drier and harder to comb.  </li>
            <li>In Conditioner will not dry out your hair with extended use.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out her hair at all.</li>
            <li>You only need a little and the the large bottle lasts forever!</li>
            <li>I can manage my hair with my bare hands and a comb, or use a blow dryer and concentrator on the back of my head where I have 2 cowlicks that have proven untameable over the years  </li>
            <li>When I first used it, my hair got rather crunchy when it dried</li>
            <li>Depending on the type of curls it may be heavy or just right - but it works wonders for us, despite my daughters&#x27; hair has a different textures in the front and back (</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always hard to find hair products for super curly hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get what I expected or a product that warrants such a high price</li>
            <li>Mixed chicks is fantastic and really helps my tight, tight, tight (did I mention tight) curly hair look pretty.  </li>
            <li>Dry naturally or if time pressed</li>
            <li>Firstly, let me say: Both of my parents are mixed (Jamaican and Irish), and my hair is pin-straight when wet and curly when dry.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews gave it at least 5 starts but several reviewers stated that it made their hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;  and several other reviewers that didn&#x27;t care for it.  </li>
            <li>By far hands down my holy grail product for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>gives me ringlets that are either soft and loose or tighter depending on how the planets align that</li>
            <li>The curls are really tight to the point that I really don&#x27;t want to comb it when it drys.  </li>
            <li>For those of us that don&#x27;t have straight hair or extremely tight curls, this product gives body to your hair so it can be styled</li>
            <li>I use this with another leave-in and some oil when I want bigger, loose, soft curls.  </li>
            <li>, so I switched to a water soluble curl jelly (as I am) and leave in conditioner (knot today) with a few drops of pure argan oil.</li>
            <li>If you put TOO much of this it can get a little crunchy.</li>
            <li>Too little is not enough and too much</li>
            <li>but it was such a little amount for so much money</li>
            <li>It provides definition and left my hair feeling a little more thick</li>
            <li>The product worked really well the first day of use (I applied 3 quarter sized dollops to different sections of my shoulder length curls), but by the third day my hair felt tacky and dryish, like there was a waxy coating on the strands, weighed down and looked dull.</li>

            <li> They looked amazing in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Most leave-in conditioners I have used are good detanglers.</li>
            <li> Best product, so happy i finally found it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best for my and my daughter&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
            <li> My husband even comments on how nice my hair feels.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed and that is something coming from a guy who doesn&#x27;t really care about hair products.</li>
            <li> Nice, non-offensive smell.  </li>
            <li> Does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell...</li>
            <li> prefer OGX argan curl defining cream, but this works nicely too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the kind of hair that makes people ask me if I&#x27;ve had a perm (the curly perm, not the straightening perm).  </li>
            <li> Makes combing her hair out so much easier, and it dries into perfect ringlets.  </li>
            <li> This is the BEST product I have ever used on my very curly haired granddaughters.  </li>
            <li> it hair very full of shine, and for the first time I could honestly say my wavy/curly hair looked the best it ever has.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and makes combing &amp; styling easy..</li>
            <li> It applies very easily, although depending on the length and thickness of your hair, you may find that you need to use a generous amount.</li>
            <li> She is biracial, and her curly hair tangles and dries out very easily.  </li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li> absolutely love it, i have wavy hair and with this product they look amazing.</li>
            <li> This product works best on naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my curls perfectly defined and soft.  </li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner for my weave so far.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> Such a great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> Great product great for kids with mixed hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the product very easy to manage</li>
            <li> This was a great price for this much conditioner!</li>
            <li> First, it smells great.  </li>
            <li> (both are also great products, but so much $$$!).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff, strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> This seller did package the boddle very nicely and delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and super fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> This large size was a great deal</li>
            <li> I always buy the huge bottle just in case!</li>
            <li> and I noticed a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> but once I used the leave-in conditioner on my hair it left perfect defined curls.</li>
            <li> since mixedchicks, I LOVE IT</li>
            <li> :)) I get compliments on it all the time and tell everyone about it.</li>
            <li> I have found that most products were either too greasy or so saturated with alcohol that it damaged her hair.</li>
            <li> In all the years of doing my daughters hair, I&#x27;ve never been able to just finger comb it...until now.</li>
            <li> Just put a dime sized amount or more in your hair after you shower and voila.</li>
            <li> just wish it worked more to my liking.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and it works great!!</li>
            <li> With the amount of conditioner in this bottle, I was able to fill up the conditioner bottle a couple of times before we ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am hoping they help reduce the frizz more).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>

            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> She receives so many compliments on her curls and it is because of this product.  </li>

            <li> OK so here are my \\&quot;specs\\&quot; - - -  </li>
            <li> some more curly and some more curly</li>
            <li> I wish I could give more than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This leave in is ok but does not meet brand standards and would not pass as a legit performing product</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> I got the best braid out in 8 months using mixed chicks leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy like many gels do</li>
            <li> I love the convenience of the pump too.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> product.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a keeper. :)</li>
            <li> but nothing else on the market seems to be able to do quite what this product does...</li>
            <li> My hair salon recommended this to me and used it for many months.</li>
            <li> It moisturized my hair better than anything else I had used.</li>

            <li> and I absolutely love it and recommend</li>
            <li> LOVE.</li>
            <li> recommend looking up the Mixed Chicks video as they tell you the best ways to use the products.</li>
            <li> In those cases I just use water to redefine curls then add a bit more of the conditioner OR a bit of Herbal Essence Body Envy mousse.</li>
            <li> IMO this stuff smells ok</li>
            <li> but I would love love love it if it came in some delectable fruity fragrances &#x3D;</li>
            <li> Dedefine curls then add a bit more of the conditioner OR a bit of Herbal Essence Body Envy mousse.</li>
            <li> IMO this stuff smells ok</li>
            <li> My routine in the morning use to be (before this product) a multifaceted step process of many products.  </li>
            <li> This will define you curls better than anything else.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months with four girls using it</li>
            <li> Ordering from Amazon, you get more for your money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> I find it helps even more.</li>
            <li> and we have found this product to be perfect for her &#x27;white girl&#x27; curls.</li>
            <li> I get many compliments on my hair and my girlfriends cant believe it is so easy:&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does an okay job of making my curls uniform, but the moisturizing part just doesn&#x27;t cut it for my hair.</li>
            <li> You will be glad you did and your going to remember this review and say \\&quot;hey I am glad I got this\\&quot;</li>
            <li> my curls form better...</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> The results weren&#x27;t consistent and I couldn&#x27;t be confident that I would have a good hair day.</li>
            <li> has a really nice and clean smell.  </li>
            <li> I received it quickly and it came with free goodies inside!!</li>
            <li> As I said it works pretty good on my hair</li>
            <li> Our son plays competitive soccer and even after a 10 hour day I&#x27;m the field his hair still looks pretty dang good.</li>
            <li> soft, frizz-free, beautiful curls/</li>
            <li> Leave it soft, shinny, and with beautiful tamed curls</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product for $32 and now it&#x27;s almost $50!</li>
            <li> The way that works best for me is to apply it after I&#x27;ve taken a shower; using a microfiber towel I scrunch  most of the water out, then use a wide tooth comb to work out any tangles.</li>
            <li> it works great in my hair (which is naturally curly and all over the place like a lion&#x27;s mane) :)</li>
            <li> I gave this a try since I am always on the search for good product for my high maintenance curls, and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love this product, so light</li>
            <li> MOST IMPORTANT STEP*</li>
            <li> MOST IMPORTANT STEP*</li>
            <li> Great product for my Loves who have beautifull curly, soft hair.</li>
            <li> Great product for natural hair.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair healthy, shiny and frizz free.</li>
            <li> My wife is Brazilian, and she says this is the best hair conditioning lotion she has ever used, by a wide margin.  </li>
            <li> Great for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> If you are considering this product, I&#x27;m sure this is a familiar tale.  </li>
            <li> It is the best thing I have found for my curly hair, especially in the hot and humid south!</li>
            <li> I love my curls, not crazy about frizz!  </li>
            <li> I am so happy to see it in my local Target and grocery store, but the Amazon Prime makes it a better deal.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make your hair look oily and greasy.</li>
            <li> We can comb it so easily after using this product.</li>
            <li> But I do strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own :) Mixed Chicks magically tames the untamed!</li>
            <li> Recently started cocktailing it with DermOrganic&#x27;s Aragon Oil and love the leave in even more!!</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best product ever for curly hair!</li>
            <li> just fine</li>
            <li> just fine</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but I have A LOT of hair.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend if you have fine hair...</li>
            <li> and I am super pleased.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product because I want to find the stuff that works and !</li>
            <li> Detangles black hair amazing doing great things.</li>
            <li> I cant speak for everyone but my sister has fine long beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> This leave in is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to have found Mixed Chicks!  </li>
            <li> Some days my curls were fabulous, didn&#x27;t happen to often but did happen, and others they were easier to manage.  </li>
            <li> Since I do my wash and go only once a week, the 33 oz bottle lasts for about 4 or 5 months which I think is a great value.</li>
            <li> So I have tried a few products and I like this one the best.  </li>
            <li> If I use it straight out of the shower to scrunch in to curls, it dries nicely and keeps frizz at bay.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product we use it everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried frizz free products, shining serums, all types of conditioners and shampoos.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many, many products for many years, to keep it from going wild after it dries.  </li>
            <li> If you have curly hair of any type or even wavy, this product works fantastic..</li>
            <li> She lives fit this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair smooth out.</li>
            <li> i would have loved to be able to do when younger!</li>
            <li> It leaves my curls soft and defined, with good hold.  </li>
            <li> We use Mixed Chicks shampoo and it is very nice.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend because I love love this product.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product based on the reviews....</li>
            <li> So worth it!</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s on the pricier side I think it&#x27;s worth every cent !</li>
            <li> I love love love mixed chicks!!!</li>
            <li> When I use the Mixed Chicks leave-in conditioner my hair it is easy to comb, curls beautifully, and doesn&#x27;t frizz as much during the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super light weight and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky or with build up.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mixed Chicks for more than 5 years, and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> Used it and immediately liked it more than my last leave in (kinky curly).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of different products and this is by far the best for my hair.</li>
            <li> Mixed Chicks is bye far the best leave in for my transitioning hair.</li>
            <li> We have found that using a generous amount of this conditioner during her tubbie and brushing her curls out with The Wet Brush (check it out) minimizes the pain of de-tangling, and leaves her hair silky smooth and smelling great.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be a special staple in my hair care regimen, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing anymore</li>
            <li> It allows my curls to curl perfectly, but doesnt make my hair hard like gel.</li>
            <li> Leave my hair hard but holds style superbly.</li>
            <li> some afrocentric products like Wet n Wavy creme moist curl creme (really great product) thrown in to manage my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for using when you are wearing a ponytail or want the wet look.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair that is manageable with a good conditioning product but mixed chicks eaves my hair feeling sticky and clumpy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So...this product must ONLY be good for you to toss it in your hair after washing it without any detangling and just leave it in....</li>
            <li> We have tried various leave in conditioners, but none have worked as good as this one.</li>
            <li> My mother told me that she applies it to near-dry hair as she is styling after she blow dries her hair, and it works like magic to hold her hair the way she wants to style.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Mixed chicks product were good not the packaging.</li>
            <li> Dream come true.  </li>
            <li> and I tried it recently and loved it for me because it added body to my hair while it was air drying</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like \\&quot;I&#x27;ve got a mind of my own\\&quot; poker straight and can and will stick out all over the place, think \\&quot;chia pet\\&quot;....</li>
            <li> But I applied the Leave-in and really had the lose ring hair for most of the day.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair this is a dream come true.  </li>
            <li> No frizz, nice curls, soft hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good ,, not bad product ,, but not marvelous or perfect same i read ,, my opinion it&#x27;s make your hear more curly if you have a curly  </li>
            <li> My daughter has super curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> The ones at Target was in a smaller bottle for $20+ and this one on amazon costs more, but you get a lot more</li>
            <li> Nothing else has worked nearly as well at keeping my hair healthy and frizz free.</li>
            <li> I will definitely use up this bottle and keep it as my fall back while I find that perfect product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> I get out of the shower and just do a pat down with a towel on my hair, one pump squirt of this great product and then work it into the hair evenly.  </li>
            <li> The smell is really off and smells strongly of fragrance and alcohol.</li>
            <li> I just finished my first bottle and already ordered another one!</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and quite fine; this product probably would not work well on it.  </li>
            <li> This is right in the middle, and I am totally in love with it!  </li>
            <li> great leave in conditioner - does not weigh your hair down!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many many products ranging in low to very high prices.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need to use a bunch of products in my hair to try to calm the frizziness.</li>
            <li> (Sleeping on a silk pillowcase also helps keep my hair calm.)  </li>
            <li> if you use it in conjunction with a tiny bit of keratin lotion the combination is amazing.</li>
            <li> Having a baby with a different curl type than my own made it a life saver.</li>
            <li> Spendy but worth it.</li>
            <li> In Conditioner is by far my favorite styling product.</li>
            <li> We go through the leave-in conditioner the fastest, so it was worth it to buy in the biggest sized offered.</li>
            <li> So far this product gives me the most slippage.</li>
            <li> Also I like the economical size of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I am now looking for a more natural product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several leave in conditioners for my natural hair and this by far is the best.</li>
            <li> Seems much more natural way to handle curly hair.  </li>
            <li> lightweight, fresh and non-sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Item arrived earlier than expected and the product is awesome.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they even marked it up once Halle Berry endorsed it.</li>
            <li> I wont say that I will transition to only using this, because honestly I can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> so it is worth it.</li>
            <li> worth the price</li>
            <li> but natural trying is better.</li>
            <li> leave-in conditioner works better than most of the other products that we&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is from Ethiopia love love it with the wet brush!</li>
            <li> Other than that mixed chicks is the best product I&#x27;ve ever bought for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Mixed Chicks products and this combined with the deep conditioner and shampoo make my hair feel amazing!</li>
            <li> I can comb right thru her hair.</li>
            <li> The price is right when you purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> If that happens i just use my hands to scrunch the curls and it softens right up.</li>
            <li> the price is right...</li>
            <li> Also, the product arrived in good condition and exactly as described, however, the shipment was received three days after the expected shipment date given when I placed my order.</li>
            <li> I love how this product shapes my curls, makes my  naturally dry, curly hair, smooth, controlling frizz and manageable.  </li>
            <li> her hair naturally curls back up as it dries into some adorable, Shirley Temple ringlets. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably as good as something in the $15-20 but not up to MC manufacturing- selling standards, and not worth the $42...</li>
            <li> The price is a little more than I want to pay, but I haven&#x27;t found anything better, so I will continue to spend the money.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did find good about this product is that it leaves the hair feeling soft and almost weightless after it</li>
            <li> regardless which shampoo I use (I am more picky about conditioner than shampoo as most people are, and there are a few cheaper conditioners that work</li>
            <li> regardless which shampoo I use (I am more picky about conditioner than shampoo as most people are, and there are a few cheaper conditioners that work</li>
            <li> My hair was left into beautiful spiral curls and long flowing waves.</li>
            <li> My girls and I have thin Hair but very curly it works great !!!</li>
            <li> so much easier fresh out the shower or just damp in the morning for a fresh pony tail look</li>
            <li> Even better, her hair stays looking good for most of the day, which is something that most of the other products that we&#x27;ve tried usually fail to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to find, great to buy online.  </li>
            <li> My daughters are biracial and this is by far the best product I have found to tame their natural curls!</li>
            <li> Most importantly Mixed Chicks Leave-</li>
            <li> We would fight over her hair and end up with a final product that didn&#x27;t look much better than when we started.  </li>
            <li> We also love the shampoo and deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money for the whole set.  </li>
            <li> Expect to use another product to detangle first before applying it if you so desire.</li>
            <li> I was gifted with Mixed Chicks Leave-In-Conditioner 9 months ago</li>
            <li> Italian &amp; Lebanese), but this product is also aimed towards Mediterranean hair as well :-).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m about to buy the 33 ounce bottle which will probably last me years, just because I really do love it</li>
            <li> I love this product, only one that works for our family!  </li>
            <li> I love Mixed Chicks.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say it took care of frizz or made many Curls but definitely added body to my Hair..</li>
            <li> Glad I found the bigger bottle here on amazon.</li>
            <li> I use it exactly like the instructions says.  </li>
            <li> My hair is finally tangle free!  </li>
            <li> Mixed chicks works better than lotion or any gel Ive ever used.</li>
            <li> :) I am not a mixed chick, but my hair loves this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> A most have if you have mixed textured hair.</li>
            <li> Love mixed chicks.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery also!</li>
            <li> I fell in love with Mixed Chicks on a recommendation from a friend.  </li>
            <li> It really works well in the shower!  </li>
            <li> They were ok, but their curl-defining and conditioning abilities don&#x27;t compare at all to what Mixed Chicks Leave-in</li>
            <li> I had heard about Mixed Chicks products and I had read reviews both pro and con, but I watched the video of the 2 lovely ladies who created the product and I decided to jump in with both feet -</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t provide the hold I need to go dancing where I&#x27;m bound to sweat and the humidity is higher, but for every day use in the SF Bay area....</li>
            <li> I have curly/wavy indian hair and have tried many products or a combination of products but hadn&#x27;t found anything that just \\&quot;fit\\&quot; until trying Mixed Chicks Leave in Conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do for your hair</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more</li>
            <li> I have read that the MEN&#x27;S version is much better, so am giving that a try next.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t get the exact results my salon can from this, but it&#x27;s darn close.</li>
            <li> I love this mixed chicks conditioner.</li>
            <li> I am not technically a mixed chick, but love this product and what it does for my unruly, sometimes frizzy curls.  </li>
            <li> However, as I kept using it, it seemed that I needed to use a lot more to get the same results.</li>
            <li> Best stuff I have ever used on my mixed Indian and African American hair.</li>
            <li> but if you want strong hold, you have to use a little more.</li>
            <li> We absolutely love it and have tried many other products that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> It is not easy to find a good product for curly hair, but this did the trick.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product to me (who has gorgeous big Egyptian curly hair with tiny curls and has tried numerous hair products as you can imagine) that it works like magic.</li>
            <li> Great prize for such a big bottle, normally cost $50-60</li>
            <li> It is yellow cream colored and has mild and pleasant smell which does not clash with other fragrant bath products (i.e. body lotion, perfume, etc.).</li>
            <li> The next morning it is easy to comb through and nearly tangle free.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good enough that you don&#x27;t even have to use it daily</li>
            <li> This is unlike any product I have used in that it is not at all greasy and not particulary heavy, smells faintly (not much noticeable scent from this product, great!)</li>
            <li> Now im back on Mixed Chicks and this product is so good you do not need to use anything else.</li>
            <li> It is of lotion consistency, and the best part is that it keeps the shape of your curls without making them crunchy or oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply it to my hair after towel-drying my hair after morning workout and air dry it on my way to work.</li>
            <li> have not used any other products by Mixed Chicks (shampoo or conditioner) because I am happy with the results I get with their leave-in conditioner</li>
            <li> have not used any other products by Mixed Chicks (shampoo or conditioner) because I am happy with the results I get with their leave-in conditioner</li>
            <li> After about a month of using this product everyday my curls became more  defined and my hair was so soft  :-)</li>
            <li> and my hair ends up being a bit greasy, but now I separate my hair in to 4 sections after a shower and usually 1/2 - 1 pump is good for each section.  </li>
            <li> I dont leave my hair in its naturally curly state, I blow dry it and straighten it, but I still love the way this product makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li> and most conditioners do nothing, and leave-in conditioners harden my hair or dry and flake off.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, it does work well, and we ended up buying a second bottle of this stuff after we used up the first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I let it air dry without touching it.</li>
            <li> Works super well on naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> My curls are defined and not frizzy yet still super soft.</li>
            <li> I normally won&#x27;t pay this much for a bottle of conditioner, but I figured that if it worked well, then it might be worth it.  </li>
            <li> Buying the large dispenser at Amazon is the way to go....</li>
            <li> On certain occasions we do shampoo their hair, but not often.  </li>
            <li> this is an excellent product for my granddaugters hair, she is biracial and there are very few products like it, the leave in conditioner when her hair is wet</li>
            <li> This is the first line of products that I&#x27;ve used that follows the same system I developed myself after many years of trying all the products in the store.</li>
            <li> it makes my curly frizzy full head of thick hair very easy to handle..</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find a good product without it drying my hair</li>
            <li> Simply the best for my little mixed chick&#x27;s hair!</li>
            <li> The trick is, knowing how much to use.</li>
            <li> but I have very uncooperative hair....</li>
            <li> I shampooed my hair to remove the build up, and it helped, but shampoo is very drying for my hair and makes it frizz.</li>
            <li> really do like to avoid shampoos and cones</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re deciding how much to buy- a 10 ounce bottle has lasted me for 9 months</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what I will do if this was ever discontinued.</li>
            <li> She absolutely dreads brushing her hair.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> She uses the sulfate free shampoo, deep conditioner and the leave-in conditioner faithfully.</li>
            <li> and it works really well.</li>
            <li> My mother and father have stick straight hair, and both my brothers have stick straight hair.</li>
            <li> However much to my surprise</li>
            <li> She patted my shoulder and said you didn&#x27;t do much to get your hair to look like that</li>
            <li> i lost so much hair in one wash</li>
            <li> thing I will point out is how the price has really gone up on this product on amazon.</li>
            <li> Price point now matches what is available in our local stores.</li>
            <li> I have perfected the application and really like it a lot.  </li>
            <li> and I am ready to go.  </li>
            <li> The leave in conditioner really helps &#x27;organize&#x27; my mop of curls</li>
            <li> It really helps to define our curls and defrizz the hair  in this humid weather.</li>
            <li> so I have very Mediterranean hair</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re latino, mixed all across the board with almost all colors and hair types available in our home.</li>
            <li> this product it makes our hair very manageable.</li>
            <li> It scared me seeing so much hair coming out on my comb</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go.</li>
            <li> Well, they were telling the absolute truth.</li>
            <li> Have to say it really does work.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find the expiration date-batch code which is unusual for this product.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, frizzy  hair</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m ready to go.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly and frizzy hair that tends to puff up at the roots.  </li>
            <li> she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and all my life</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I gently detangle with my fingers as I am rinsing -</li>
            <li> haha)</li>
            <li> However this product works really well on my mom&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> It really works for me.</li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> Mixed chicks makes my very curly hair look healthy and feel natural.  </li>
            <li> Not a ton of either product, but enough to HOLD that wild thing on top of my head in place.</li>
            <li> Top pump on the top of the container was broken.</li>
            <li> MUST HAVE for anyone with natural curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> you have to make sure it mixes will with any other products you put in your hair with it.</li>
            <li> Love this product works extremely well.</li>
            <li> but once your hair is dry you can scrunch and run your fingers through your hair and your curls will be extremely soft! :)</li>
            <li> I love Mixed Chicks and would definitely be buying more in the near future.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair about shoulder length and it leaves my hair soft and shiny and washes out nicely leaving no build up!</li>
            <li> it looks great , also i put a little on my hair when it&#x27;s dry for my frizzies .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> well worth the price since no other products are needed.</li>
            <li> As I have aged I find my hair getting drier so after researching I have settled on the following magical formula for good looking hair everyday.  </li>
            <li> Most leave-in conditioners don&#x27;t provide any holding power, and most gels leave hair stiff and dry.</li>
            <li> So when we go to the local swimming pool (where there is no time for anything but washing the hair in some generic shampoo), the hair still looks good afterwards (despite not using the mixed chicks products there).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the full Mixed Chicks system for about six months now</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice any spectacular results, particularly compared to what we usually use - ORS olive leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Our curly hair ranges from loose curls to extremely tight curls, most if not all easily tangle;</li>
            <li> I am of Irish descent and have very fine, very curly hair that is prone to being dry.  </li>
            <li> This is the second time we purchased the Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner, and we love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super simple too.</li>
            <li> To fix that problem, I just filled up one of my old bottles of conditioner with Mixed Chicks; that worked quite well.  </li>
            <li> I quickly jumped back in the shower to rinse it out but the itching continued.</li>
            <li> I use to buy it only for Target since it was the only place I was able to find it.</li>
            <li> My nieces giggled because they thought an older lady was hitting on their uncle.</li>
            <li> My nieces giggled because they thought an older lady was hitting on their uncle.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on my hair and mixed chicks is the only product I use on my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it from amazon because it&#x27;s a lot more expensive in most stores.</li>
            <li> I am not mixed, I have many textures in my hair and mixed chicks worked on all of it.  </li>
            <li> it conditions your hair at the same time when I wash it out my hair is so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> , I have 3 girls and the two older girls</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it .</li>
            <li> so sometimes there is a little frizz, but she puts more leave-in cond.</li>
            <li> Now just because it did not work for me does not mean it will not work for you.  </li>
            <li> My hair is super fine and poker straight...but not Anglo-Saxon lay down flat poker straight.</li>
            <li> Works very well on curly hair, although doesn&#x27;t remove frizz completely.</li>
            <li> Nothing ever seemed to really make my hair shiny or feel soft.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants soft shiny hair...</li>
            <li> I have long flowing waves/spiral curls that look amazing, with minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have long flowing waves/spiral curls that look amazing, with minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My kids have soft curly hair and this really helps to define the curls.  </li>
            <li> It makes their hair look really curly and soft.  </li>
            <li> We have purchased this product before and by far it is much cheaper on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seriously worth the 19.25 for a 10 ounce bottle (that&#x27;s only $2.18 a month if you&#x27;re doing the math!)</li>
            <li> This will \\&quot;tame\\&quot; your hair and define the curls all day long while keeping your hair soft and flake free.</li>
            <li> have curly hair with different textures and they both use the mixed chicks and they love it As well as for my 15 month old</li>
            <li> sometimes even bigger hair is fun..</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s actually quite economical.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for something to tame your frizzes, define your curls, and keep your hair healthy, mixed chicks is DEFINITELY worth the buy.</li>
            <li> It smells light and gives the right amount of slick for a multitude of styles from wash and goes to braid outs.</li>
            <li> Great product, I have very long, thick, and curly hair.</li>
            <li> Second, it makes your curls super soft and defined.  </li>
            <li> You use only a nickel to quarter size amount of this stuff on wet hair and it spreads very easily and dries naturally.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, fine, frizzy hair and this helps with keeping it soft and naturally curled.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t to live without this product</li>
            <li> My daughter can&#x27;t live without this product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s half full still!</li>
            <li> The 2 Mixed Chicks ladies had much longer and much curlier/kinkier hair than I do</li>
            <li> I really like mixed chicks because when it dries my hair is not frizzy and the curls are really defined.</li>
            <li> The price here is better than anywhere else, but still a little too pricey!</li>
            <li> I am white with wavy hair, and it also works very well to define my curls a little more.</li>
            <li> Soft, defined, non-frizzy curls are no longer my dream, they are my reality!</li>
            <li> Hello to my natural curls and waves!  </li>
            <li> its by far!</li>
            <li> I would recommend getting a smaller bottle to try first</li>
            <li> This is something I will be ordering through Amazon consistently because a bottle this size costs me about $60 at the local hair store.</li>
            <li> After trying out the Trio sample package of the Mixed Chicks line (shampoo, deep conditioner, and leave-in conditioner) I fell in love with the last two items.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this product first, never hearing about mixed chicks products before.</li>
            <li> But there is a fine balance on how much you should use b/c there have been times where I&#x27;ve gone overboard</li>
            <li> Highly recommend worth every penny I spent</li>
            <li> By end of the day you do need to re wet and apply more if u have long hair.  </li>
            <li> T hen I apply about 2 quarter sized dollops through out my hair concentrating primarily on the mid section and the ends, scrunching as  I go, and then let it air dry.</li>
            <li> Daughter&#x27;s hair looks great out of the bath, the next morning it&#x27;s fairly dry but not too hard to comb</li>
            <li> this is probably the only leave-in conditioner i&#x27;ll ever use to get that fresh wet curly hair look, and I love that it lasts all day without my hair feeling greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> Our son is mixed African American with a strong heritage of Indian in him</li>
            <li> I have super thick coarse naturally curly red hair which I have always thought of more as a curse than a blessing.</li>
            <li> Crunch hair with a used clean, old t shirt or a microfiber or shammy upside down.</li>
            <li> I really like Mixed Chicks professional look</li>
            <li> My natural hair is soft and springy,  the relaxed part is soft.  </li>
            <li> Finally gave in and bought the whole line of products.</li>
            <li> I am biracial with natural 3c curls that I loosen to a 3a/b-ish curl with a keratin treatment (once a month, 275 degrees to maintain the curl and avoid heat damage) for manageability and to remove frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beware Celiacs or those sensitive to wheat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have naturally curly hair this product helps eliminate frizz.</li>
            <li> (I did not expect it since she does not have naturally curly hair), so I sent two 33oz bottles to her</li>
            <li> None of these gave me the soft, defined, non-frizzy curls I dreamed of.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and not dried out.</li>
            <li> and I get lots of compliments on my natural curls....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, leaves my hair soft and curly, no frizzes.</li>
            <li> Somehow people without naturally curly hair think this will miraculously turn their hair naturally curly.</li>
            <li> and it makes my hair soft.  </li>
            <li> But this leave in conditioner makes it really soft.  </li>
            <li> I decide that for the summer, I would go natural.  </li>
            <li> I am white, not ethnic, but this is for anybody who wants to amplify their waves or curls.  </li>
            <li> Finally a product for girls with hair somewhere in between straight and nappy.  </li>
            <li> It controls frizz and leaves my hair curly and soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my natural curls pop.  </li>
            <li> It does not leave her hair greasy, but soft and well moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line, for anyone with wild ethnic hair that needs additional control, this stuff</li>
            <li> Bottom line, for anyone with wild ethnic hair that needs additional control, this stuff</li>
            <li> We have two mixed chicks at home, age 3 and 9, and this product is a real life saver.</li>
            <li> It is a curly look but looks and feels natural.</li>
            <li> Oh and don&#x27;t rinse your hair too much after the deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I prefer soft, supple,  springy curls with movement.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and leave my hair soft without that over product crunch.&lt;br</li>
            <li> BTW my idea of a medium hold is no frizz, curls hold their shape even after a bit of primping but stays touchable soft</li>
            <li> makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> my 15yr old daughter has been using this product since a couple of years.</li>
            <li> not heavy on the curls</li>
            <li> They have products that work equally as well when you do want to wear your hair straight.  </li>
            <li> use this product for my 4B type hair when I want to go natural.</li>
            <li> I get hair compliments every day and my hair is soft.</li>
            <li> My daughter has soft cork screw curls</li>
            <li> My hair feels absolutely soft and manageable after I use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used amazon prime for several years although I don&#x27;t write as many reviews as I should because I heavily rely on customer reviews when I order products.</li>
            <li> After spending most of my adult life trying to tame my curls with a blow dryer and roller brush, I used Mixed Chicks after a recommendation from a friend.  </li>
            <li> The other mixed chick conditioner (wash-out), and the shampoo are also good, but if you had to rank the Mixed Chicks products, I would say that this is the best one (but still I would get the other ones as well).</li>
            <li> I just wash my hair, dry lightly, put this in and let my hair dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> This product is now the only curly hair product I will ever use(as a styler) , It is moisturizing ,long lasting and flake free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m multi-racial and my hair texture is just as varied; looking at a single strand the texture ranges from coarse, medium and fine (and not necessarily in that order).</li>
            <li> The hair was finally looking decent yet it was not shiny</li>
            <li> The reason why I&#x27;m writing this review is because I was stopped earlier this week by an older woman when I was out with my two nieces.</li>
            <li> The price was good (a few dollars cheaper than I usually pay).</li>
            <li> hair is very thick, very thirsty, tangles easily.</li>
            <li> My hair is a mixture of coarse and fine hair which creates a frizzy mess with humidity.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and when I use the right amount, it won&#x27;t leave my hair greasy like other curl cremes have done.  </li>
            <li> It was a collective amount of other products right along with the mix chick product to get the shine and vibrance and tangle frree freedom that came from three others along with mix chicks.</li>
            <li> I actually had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it to anyone with curly or mixed hair.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this product if you wash your hair everyday (not 1-3 times a week like many people with ethnic mixed hair like me).</li>
            <li> I have fine to medium hair which made me worried when I ordered this product because EVERYTHING else I tried either left my hair heavy, greasy, sticky.</li>
            <li> When applied after wetting your hair it&#x27;ll keep it smooth and controlled, less fly aways and loose hairs sticking up all crazy like.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it leaves my hair a little crunchy almost like a light hold gel.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, conditions her curly, chilly hair very well</li>
            <li> I used to switch curl products every few months with hugely varying results, until my salon used mixed chicks on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have very kinky dry frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> If you try to fool with them too much it will become frizzy and dry looking.</li>
            <li> I actually bought the whole line (shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner, &amp; leave in).</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t sing the praises of Mixed Chicks enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Our first bottle of Mixed Chicks lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is very concentrated, so I actually pour it into a smaller bottle and mix it with water.</li>
            <li> I am African American and her dad is Indian, so her hair turned out to be really curly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white, 100% Caucasian woman, I&#x27;ve always had blonde hair, straight like a stick.</li>
            <li> I have waited my whole life for a hair product that was neither for Caucasian or African American hair.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, it is not sticky, it is not heavy, and it has a light smell.  </li>
            <li> I happened on this conditioner in a small boutique mostly selling beauty products for African Americans.&lt;br /&gt;I am white</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but the last bottle lasted us 6 months, so it was definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Soft bouncy curls that smell good, not like those weird smells of the mayonnaise and creams for African american hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now - originally purchased at a local beauty supply shop that is no longer in business so now ordering off Amazon.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is a little pricey, but worth every penny.</li>
            <li> gave it a 4 star only because it does not completely tame my frizz,but I have not found a product yet that can get close to the results that I have had with this</li>
            <li> Long time user, this is the only product that will keep my curls nice and soft without the dried out crunchy feeling i get from all other curly hair products.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the Mixed Chicks shampoo and deep conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless hair products in all price ranges, from a low to very high end, for frizz control and styling, and nothing has worked as well as Mixed chicks leave-in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I generally put it in my hair after the shower.</li>
            <li> If I put mixed chicks in my hair then braid my hair in 4 small sections, my curls are looser, longer, and nicer after I remove the braids and shake my hair free.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products and Mixed Chicks leaves my hair controlled, yet soft.</li>
            <li> The crunch disappeared and I was left with hair so soft</li>
            <li> I went back to natural</li>
            <li> I use this on soaking wet hair in the shower, about 10 - 12 pumps for my whole head.</li>
            <li> initially but that seems to soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I am 8 months transitioning back to natural,  </li>
            <li> My ends are relaxed and my natural is growing in 4a and totally gray .</li>
            <li> Talking mostly to African americans going natural and you want pretty,soft curls.</li>
            <li> first time I used this product: After Shampoo &amp; Condition with Mizani products...&lt;br /&gt;I tried a Roller / Wet Set with this Mixed Chicks product with 20 minutes under a hooded ionic hair dryer (neutral air temp-</li>
            <li> so I look more &#x27;finished&#x27; rather than sloppy.  </li>
            <li> Apply in small sections, then quickly barely-rinse over it all to make it coat every strand together.</li>
            <li> I do not use any other products in my hair with this leave-in, though sometimes I will put a little deva curl anGEL on my edges and at the very ends of my curls for a little more hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> website).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have struggled for a long time to find a lightweight, non sticky, medium hold product that works all day long and smells at least moderately nice and the Mixed Chicks</li>
            <li> little expensive in the salon but a great value in this size.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter has such frizzy hair and it really tones it down and makes it look naturally curly.</li>
            <li> (the morning after using ORS is much easier), 2 mornings later it&#x27;s even drier and harder to comb.  </li>
            <li> In Conditioner will not dry out your hair with extended use.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out her hair at all.</li>
            <li> You only need a little and the the large bottle lasts forever!</li>
            <li> I can manage my hair with my bare hands and a comb, or use a blow dryer and concentrator on the back of my head where I have 2 cowlicks that have proven untameable over the years  </li>
            <li> When I first used it, my hair got rather crunchy when it dried</li>
            <li> Depending on the type of curls it may be heavy or just right - but it works wonders for us, despite my daughters&#x27; hair has a different textures in the front and back (</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always hard to find hair products for super curly hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get what I expected or a product that warrants such a high price</li>
            <li> Mixed chicks is fantastic and really helps my tight, tight, tight (did I mention tight) curly hair look pretty.  </li>
            <li> Dry naturally or if time pressed</li>
            <li> Firstly, let me say: Both of my parents are mixed (Jamaican and Irish), and my hair is pin-straight when wet and curly when dry.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews gave it at least 5 starts but several reviewers stated that it made their hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;  and several other reviewers that didn&#x27;t care for it.  </li>
            <li> By far hands down my holy grail product for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> gives me ringlets that are either soft and loose or tighter depending on how the planets align that</li>
            <li> The curls are really tight to the point that I really don&#x27;t want to comb it when it drys.  </li>
            <li> For those of us that don&#x27;t have straight hair or extremely tight curls, this product gives body to your hair so it can be styled</li>
            <li> I use this with another leave-in and some oil when I want bigger, loose, soft curls.  </li>
            <li> , so I switched to a water soluble curl jelly (as I am) and leave in conditioner (knot today) with a few drops of pure argan oil.</li>
            <li> If you put TOO much of this it can get a little crunchy.</li>
            <li> Too little is not enough and too much</li>
            <li> but it was such a little amount for so much money</li>
            <li> It provides definition and left my hair feeling a little more thick</li>
            <li> The product worked really well the first day of use (I applied 3 quarter sized dollops to different sections of my shoulder length curls), but by the third day my hair felt tacky and dryish, like there was a waxy coating on the strands, weighed down and looked dull.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s never stiff like it&#x27;s been with other products.</li>
            <li> next I let the hair AIR DRY for nearly 3 hours (and the product still wasn&#x27;t dry!</li>
            <li> Price is a little high.</li>
            <li> I have very long curly hair which is thin and fine.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth at least trying this product, especially if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> I prefer buying the larger size as it lasts such a long time.</li>
            <li> On day two, I put a small amount in a spray bottle filled with water and spray my hair to tame frizzies from sleeping.  </li>
            <li> Several people (usually with curly/wavy hair) have asked me what products I use to keep my curls lively since I have started using mixed chicks, a question I have never been asked before (probably because of the freezy hair!), and I recently sent this product to a friend of mine a gift when she asked me about hair</li>

            <li> Skeptical at first, I bought a small bottle from a drug store, and I have become a huge fan ever since.</li>
            <li> it also allowed me to finally grow it out to where i can wear it long and</li>
            <li> Long story short</li>
            <li> I have long curl type 3A- mixed spanish/white.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried mixing the leave in conditioner with a bit of water and spritzing it on to \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; after a long day but for some reason I don&#x27;t get the same type of hold that way.  </li>

            <li> So my hair texture is all over the place, from curly to wavy, to course, its also pretty thick.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to be of mixed ethnicity to use these products and if you&#x27;re unsure you want to dish out the money I highly recommend buying the sample trio to help you make up your mind, the pouches look small</li>
            <li> When the temperature is sub-zero I quickly blow dry my hair to avoid a frozen hair mess, usually after applying mixed chicks conditioner.</li>

            <li> Left my hair dry, crunchy, and with a residue on it that felt like greasy wax.  </li>
            <li> After applying it takes forever to dry into the hair, and once it does it becomes solid as a rock!</li>
            <li> It calms and relaxes her hair, leaving it far less tangled.  </li>

            <li> The product seems to adhere to my hair (without being greasy or heavy or \\&quot;gluey/sticky\\&quot; in the slightest) and somehow changes the very texture of my hair to where even in a steady breeze my hair gets blown about....and then settles back down with very little assistance from me.</li>

            <li> this stuff was much more expensive and only came in a small bottle at the boutique.  </li>

            <li> I ordered this product due to prior experience with it, but also for pricing.</li>
            <li> But other than that I definitely recommend it!</li>

            <li> With Mixed Chicks Leave In Conditioner, my curls are springy, shiny, soft, and last for at least 2 days without the frizz!</li>
            <li> I use a lot of it which makes my hair a bit stiff, but after a few hours, it softens up and my curls look very controlled.</li>
            <li> ; it is very moisturizing, but it is too heavy and my hair ended up looking too stiff.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for big, thick hair!</li>
            <li> This is my third 33oz bottle I am ordering now for myself (a bottle goes a long way, but I keep one at home and another in the gym locker, not to mention that I also carry a small tube for short trips and emergency fix).</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not the same performance hence not worth the price.</li>

            <li> I hope to have hair down my back soon but will not cry if it does not happen for another week or two.</li>
            <li> My hair is down to my shoulder blades, and yes I&#x27;m blonde.</li>
            <li> but I use it as a curl creme like you are supposed to do It helps the curls and at the same time keeps the frizz down.</li>
            <li> and i can finally wear it down, curly and without frizz.</li>
            <li> As I let my hair down, i use my fingers to untangle any further if needed.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> A little definitely goes a long way with the product as well.</li>
            <li> But the Mixed Chicks makes my hair curl in almost ringlets with much less frizz (I haven&#x27;t gotten the shampoo or conditioner</li>
            <li> I am a black women with mixed ancestory.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Only half of that was true.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although, this happens a lot with different conditions, I&#x27;ve learned to finger comb my hair out and the curls lot less</li>
            <li> I have tried using less, but it didn&#x27;t control the frizz well enough.  </li>
            <li> I get it for my kids, their half Afro and Asian.</li>
            <li> I could not live without it!  </li>
            <li> and this product just left it a mess.  </li>
            <li> I actually add a little S-Curl for a added moisture.  </li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on my little mixed chick&#x27;s curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the price is up there, so when finances are tight we can&#x27;t afford it, but when we have money, this is definitely a splurge that is worth making.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your hair has to be wet for it to be distributed evenly too, after you get it all over your hair, just leave it alone...</li>
            <li> I still switch up the leave-in-conditioner sometimes to change it up, but I always come back to this product after a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is not cheap but the bottle lasts almost a year (I have upper-back length hair and wash my hair 1-2 times daily).</li>
            <li> Some left my hair frizzy, some were heavy and greasy and some turned my hair so crunchy</li>
            <li> Every time I glanced in a mirror that day I expected to see the return of the frizz</li>
            <li> It gives enough definition without being heavy.</li>
            <li> For me, if I used it to often and or not on soaking wet hair it would leave flakes and frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>

            <li> She used to have so much trouble with frizz until a teacher told her about mixed chicks hair products.  </li>
            <li> Oh the money I&#x27;ve spent on my hair...</li>
            <li> Never again and a big waste of money on a jar of goop that can&#x27;t be used.</li>
            <li> Thankfully I had only bought a sample because I would be pissed if I wasted a lot of money on this.</li>
            <li> Will leave one if your hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> This product provides hold and curl definition as expected.</li>
            <li> I wrap my wet hair in an  mens tshirt.  </li>
            <li> I use it for deep conditioning and also mix with water for everyday leave in conditioning.</li>

            <li> This product works well with my thick, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Only thing that will define their curls w/o leaving their hair stiff or greasy.</li>
            <li> Nothing seems to tame it as well as mixed chicks.</li>
            <li> I makes sense about the hair type that was passed down to me, although it was a very long time ago.</li>
            <li> But it does work for that wet and wear due.</li>
            <li> I do have to say it doesn&#x27;t work well when my hair isn&#x27;t completely dry before I go to bed, if there&#x27;s a slight bit of moisture</li>
            <li> i have curly, thick, 5 inch long coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years and after searching long and hard and spending a small fortune on various hair products, I can finally say that I&#x27;ve found something that works for me!  </li>
            <li> At first, when I used other products as a base, I really didn&#x27;t like this.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair, not too tight but definitely not wavy, and I usually just use mousse</li>
            <li> Also you can&#x27;t mess with the curls once they are dry.</li>
            <li> The Mixed Chicks does leave my hair stiff after it dries, but if I turn my head upside down and shake it a bit, it helps break up the stiffness.</li>

            <li> I had to add other products for shine- Semi Di Lino Diamante...</li>
            <li> (I usually cowash daily and avoid shampoo).</li>
            <li> mousse, gel, silicone based products, other leave in conditioners...</li>
            <li> I recommend this conditioner to other family members and friends.</li>
            <li> only use Mixed Chicks when I wear my hair natural and it grows like crazy.</li>
            <li> My local store that I usually purchase it from sold out and told me that their shipment would not be in for two weeks</li>
            <li> The consistence is like any other wash out conditioner you&#x27;d use.  </li>
            <li> I refuse to use any other product on my hair.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t need any other products and have used this for three years.</li>
            <li> Before I discovered this conditioner, I&#x27;ve used other brands and none have come close to these results.</li>
            <li> I usually pay about $34 per bottle (I have bought this product twice in the last 6 months) and now it is $50!</li>
            <li> I brought the small one from target its the same</li>
            <li> unlike other products all you need is the shampoo and leave in.</li>
            <li> Not 4-5 like other product lines.</li>
            <li> I keep trying other products</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference from this product vs other products.</li>
            <li> Also a few pumps goes a long way</li>
            <li> (usually up in a bun last 3 days).</li>
            <li> I usually buy the smaller version at target for about 2/3 the price of this one.</li>
            <li> Put small amount of mixed chicks in, and spread evenly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have tried and tested tons of other products and none compare.  </li>
            <li> this leave in might dry a little crunchy</li>
            <li> It is fairly frustrating since it happened to all three bottles I have purchased, but I can live with it for now.</li>
            <li> And Yes - I mean Got2B Ultra Glued and Wet n Wavy at the same time.</li>
            <li> Once dry I pull the curls out so that they are not crunchy and stiff.</li>
            <li> I order from here because it&#x27;s much mire expensive at other stores.</li>
            <li> It is fairly frustrating since it happened to all three bottles I have purchased, but I can live with it for now.ways in rush before work with very little patience or time to blow dry my hair</li>

            <li> Unfortunately, the pump on the bottle ended up breaking before we used up the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li> Just a small amount goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> She said it was so unfair because she used to spend 1000&#x27;s of dollars getting her straight hair to look like mine.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that when I began using the product my hair seemed to be breaking off/falling out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use shampoo (unless my hair is truly dirty which is rare).</li>
            <li> I use everyday and have minimal build up.</li>
            <li> I gently fluff after drying, but never ever ever run your fingers, a comb or brush  through dried hair as that introduces frizz.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> just leave clumps of your hair weighted down.</li>
            <li> It did weigh my hair down</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because of the holiday season, but I won&#x27;t buy it again until the price goes down.</li>
            <li> It gives me hold without weighing my hair down or making it sticky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick and definitely creamy but not slippery like</li>
            <li> I do use it in conjunction with a few other products.</li>
            <li> , I use it every other day when I shampoo (should length medium/tight curls that if not combed every few days can lock up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> EXPECT to have very small white flakes if you mess with your hair once this product dries.</li>
            <li> I does make the hair slightly &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34;</li>

            <li> Made the little hair I have feel full.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It tends to get a little pricey at times, but Amazon still remains the cheapest source in which to purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> I put it on my hair after I wash it , with a little organic gel</li>
            <li> It does get a little crunchy</li>
            <li> You still want a little coating of it.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy the 33 oz because I was buying the little bottle in stores</li>
            <li> I mix it with a little Moroccan oil to combat the dryness.  </li>
            <li> No more blow dryer, no more dry frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> Thick, and very hard to even apply to natural hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and curly and this is the only product in my 39 years that tames it without chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the leave-in everyday just when I felt my hair needed help.  </li>
            <li> $50 wasted.</li>
            <li> When I smoothed this into my hair was waiting for the conditioner to make it heavy, and greasy.</li>
            <li> Without making feel heavy.</li>
            <li> and so that style stays during the day without harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel heavy</li>
            <li> You might save a few dollars online</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not cheap...</li>
            <li> i use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> It seems expensive, but a bottle lasts nearly a year</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and as anyone with curly hair knows it is impossible to find something that works consistently in my hair to maintain or style my curls.  </li>
            <li> I have not blow dried my (long and thick) hair in 6 months!  </li>
            <li> when I removed the rollers the hair was so stiff like it had gel in it.</li>
            <li> but it also makes my hair feel stiff.</li>
            <li> Doesnt make your hair stiff, but holds the curls together.</li>
            <li> I wonder if there will ever be a product that can truly tame her curls.</li>
            <li> and they said the product would define curls and tame the wildness...</li>
            <li> so her hair has thin individual strands but thick and curly over all.</li>
            <li> My daughter is mixed with Puerto Rican and Black and has crazy curls that become a frizzy mess without this product.  </li>
            <li> A lot of people think I&#x27;m Dominican because of my hair (medium length- about 4 inches past the shoulder).</li>
            <li> so that you look like Mel B/G (Scary Spice) back in the day...</li>
            <li> In my hair routine everyday!</li>
            <li> it was unbelievable.</li>
            <li> No more mousse or spray in gel, which leaves hair too crunchy.</li>
            <li> So I usually wash my hair in the afternoon.</li>
            <li> - so I have to have to maintain an orderly head of hair with a knowledgeable hair stylist and an assortment of hair care products - usually a mix and match process with some shampoos and conditioners from the caucasian aisle</li>

            <li> I usually put a leave in conditioner in my hair before using this though.</li>
            <li> It takes patience and because each person hair is different but a few tips...don&#x27;t be afraid to use alot of product...have water in the hair ....</li>
            <li> She said she loves it because it does not weigh her hair down nor leave sticky and unpleasant feel to her hands or hair after application.&lt;br /&gt;I am always in rush before work with very little patience or time to blow dry my hair</li>

            <li> I have curly hair that is manageable with a good conditioning product but mixed chicks eaves my hair feeling sticky and clumpy.</li>
            <li> This was a great price for this much conditioner! I have to use this for my daughter&#x27;s mixed curly hair. It makes her curls defined and helps keep them moisturized. We purchased this almost 7 months ago and with daily use (3-4 pumps) we still have about 1/4 of the bottle left!</li>
            <li> I love this product. This is the one product that has been a life saver for me and my curly hair journey.  I am so happy to see it in my local Target and grocery store, but the Amazon Prime makes it a better deal. If you are struggling with your curls you might want to pick up The Curly Girl Handbook too. Having a baby with a different curl type than my own made it a life saver.</li>
            <li> Simply the best for my little mixed chick&#x27;s hair! Finally gave in and bought the whole line of products. Spendy but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have very thick curly hair (3C) and have tried everything under the sun to moisturize, prevent frizz and define my curls. Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner is by far my favorite styling product. Most leave-in conditioners don&#x27;t provide any holding power, and most gels leave hair stiff and dry. Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner has found the perfect balance between hydrating and defining curly hair. The consistency is not too thick or thin, and the fragrance is not over powering. It applies very easily, although depending on the length and thickness of your hair, you may find that you need to use a generous amount. Most importantly Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner will not dry out your hair with extended use. I highly recommend the Mixed Chicks shampoo and deep conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> Best product for great hair!! Love it!!</li>
            <li> This is the second time we purchased the Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner, and we love it.  I am now embarrassed to look at pictures of my daughter&#x27;s hair from before we started using Mixed Chicks.  It used to be dry, frizzy, and a nightmare to comb.  We would fight over her hair and end up with a final product that didn&#x27;t look much better than when we started.  Now her hair has beautiful, ringlet curls, and she loves having her hair done.  It also works well on my infant daughter&#x27;s growing curls.  Try it and you&#x27;ll never look back to other non-Mixed Chicks products.  We also love the shampoo and deep conditioner.  Well worth the money for the whole set.  We go through the leave-in conditioner the fastest, so it was worth it to buy in the biggest sized offered.</li>
            <li> I gave this a try since I am always on the search for good product for my high maintenance curls, and I am so glad I did. I have long curly hair, not too tight but definitely not wavy, and I usually just use mousse but once I used the leave-in conditioner on my hair it left perfect defined curls. If you want really soft non-frizzy you use less but if you want strong hold, you have to use a little more. The trick is, knowing how much to use. Your hair has to be wet for it to be distributed evenly too, after you get it all over your hair, just leave it alone...don&#x27;t touch it during the drying process as this is what causes curly hair to frizz. I absolutely love this stuff, strongly recommend!</li>
            <li> I happened on this conditioner in a small boutique mostly selling beauty products for African Americans.&lt;br /&gt;I am white but I have very uncooperative hair....and most conditioners do nothing, and leave-in conditioners harden my hair or dry and flake off.  You use only a nickel to quarter size amount of this stuff on wet hair and it spreads very easily and dries naturally.  There is no frizz and the curls look smoothe and happy.  Buying the large dispenser at Amazon is the way to go....this stuff was much more expensive and only came in a small bottle at the boutique.  I recommend this product whole-heartedly.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try this product based on the reviews....and it is NOT AS GOOD AS THE REVIEWS...I&#x27;m mixed Caribbean - Cuban, Jamaican, and Puerto Rican...A lot of people think I&#x27;m Dominican because of my hair (medium length- about 4 inches past the shoulder). Based on my experience- This product is NOT a good detangler at all! Most leave-in conditioners I have used are good detanglers. Expect to use another product to detangle first before applying it if you so desire. EXPECT to have very small white flakes if you mess with your hair once this product dries. I would only recommend this product if you wash your hair everyday (not 1-3 times a week like many people with ethnic mixed hair like me). EXPECT YOUR HAIR TO LOOK DULL - you must add another product if you want shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used this product: After Shampoo &amp; Condition with Mizani products...&lt;br /&gt;I tried a Roller / Wet Set with this Mixed Chicks product with 20 minutes under a hooded ionic hair dryer (neutral air temp- NOT HOT)....when I removed the rollers the hair was so stiff like it had gel in it. It looked horrible so I had to spray water on my hair to soften it...then proceeded to detangle the hair AGAIN with a Mason Pearson detangling comb...next I let the hair AIR DRY for nearly 3 hours (and the product still wasn&#x27;t dry! I couldn&#x27;t believe it...) so I did a DOMINICAN BLOW OUT. The hair was finally looking decent yet it was not shiny and it only gained volume because of the brush I used. I had to add other products for shine- Semi Di Lino Diamante...because this product was not successful at moisturizing the hair. The only thing I did find good about this product is that it leaves the hair feeling soft and almost weightless after it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...this product must ONLY be good for you to toss it in your hair after washing it without any detangling and just leave it in....so that you look like Mel B/G (Scary Spice) back in the day...Because thats what my hair looked like when I used this Mixed Chicks Leave-in Conditioner and DIDN&#x27;T detangle the hair and just applied it and waited all day for the product to dry...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT.... I repeat DO NOT use this product if you plan on detangling, roller/wet setting, blow dry, wrapping, or doing a Dominican blow out.&lt;br /&gt;ONLY use this product as if it were mousse on wet hair and let it air dry all day long.xed Chicks Leave-in Conditioner and DIDN&#x27;T detangle the hair and just applied it and waited all day for the product to dry...    IN CONCLUSION:   DO NOT.... I repeat DO NOT use this product if you plan on detangling, roller/wet setting, blow dry, wrapping, or doing a Dominican blow out.  ONLY use this product as if it were mousse on wet hair and let it air dry all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for years; ever since I read an article where Tracie Ellis Ross talked about using this product. I have tried EVERYTHING on the market for my curly (mixed) hair and nothing NOTHING works like this stuff!!! Until mixedchicks I hated my hair, since mixedchicks, I LOVE IT :)) I get compliments on it all the time and tell everyone about it. All of my friends with curly hair are using it, too, now. MUST HAVE for anyone with natural curly hair!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has super curly hair. My husband is 1/2 African American and I&#x27;m white so her hair has thin individual strands but thick and curly over all. I have found that most products were either too greasy or so saturated with alcohol that it damaged her hair. This leave in is fantastic. I actually bought the whole line (shampoo, conditioner, deep conditioner, &amp; leave in). Loved them all. In all the years of doing my daughters hair, I&#x27;ve never been able to just finger comb it...until now. I really can&#x27;t sing the praises of Mixed Chicks enough.</li>
            <li> The frizzy hair products I have tried over a lifetime is ridiculious, all that money to find that there are only 2 or 3 that work, Mixed Chicks leave in conditioner is one of the 3, since finding this product several years ago, I cannot do without it. I use this before using either Arc Angel by Diva Curl or Ouidad products.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECCOMMMEND!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am biracial with natural 3c curls that I loosen to a 3a/b-ish curl with a keratin treatment (once a month, 275 degrees to maintain the curl and avoid heat damage) for manageability and to remove frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mixed chicks is great at smoothing hair and defining curl, at the price of causing a lot of build up. The product worked really well the first day of use (I applied 3 quarter sized dollops to different sections of my shoulder length curls), but by the third day my hair felt tacky and dryish, like there was a waxy coating on the strands, weighed down and looked dull. (I usually cowash daily and avoid shampoo). The curls were smoothed and frizzless, but my hair felt wrong and my dad causally mentioned it looked like &#x27;product overload&#x27;. I shampooed my hair to remove the build up, and it helped, but shampoo is very drying for my hair and makes it frizz. For the next week or so I was in a conundrum of needing shampoo to remove the mixed chicks and needing mixed chicks to combat the frizzy, dryness after the stripping shampoo. The results weren&#x27;t consistent and I couldn&#x27;t be confident that I would have a good hair day. I felt like I was battling my hair rather than nurturing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really do like to avoid shampoos and cones, so I switched to a water soluble curl jelly (as I am) and leave in conditioner (knot today) with a few drops of pure argan oil. I still keep the bottle under my sink, just in case my frizz goes crazy, and I love the name -- three stars.</li>
            <li> I was gifted with Mixed Chicks Leave-In-Conditioner 9 months ago and it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my hair. I don&#x27;t have mixed-curly hair but Mediterranean curly hair (Italian &amp; Lebanese), but this product is also aimed towards Mediterranean hair as well :-). It moisturizes my hair and gives me the best defined curls. It&#x27;s super simple too. Just put a dime sized amount or more in your hair after you shower and voila. I don&#x27;t always need hair product afterwards either.&lt;br /&gt;A couple months ago I hit that phase where my hair seemed to become immune to the product and started losing it&#x27;s definition (as happens with ANY product) so I decided to go with my regular grocery-store styling products/conditioner and I definitely noticed a difference(negative with the regular products). I still switch up the leave-in-conditioner sometimes to change it up, but I always come back to this product after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re deciding how much to buy- a 10 ounce bottle has lasted me for 9 months and I&#x27;m only now about to run out. I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day though since I don&#x27;t want to dry it out. It&#x27;s seriously worth the 19.25 for a 10 ounce bottle (that&#x27;s only $2.18 a month if you&#x27;re doing the math!) and I&#x27;m about to buy the 33 ounce bottle which will probably last me years, just because I really do love it so much!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for something to tame your frizzes, define your curls, and keep your hair healthy, mixed chicks is DEFINITELY worth the buy.</li>
            <li> my child has type 4A-4B hair and this product does not harm her hair. But, this is the reason for three stars, it is sticky and does not detangle. I really wanted to love this product because I want to find the stuff that works and !stick to it! No more searching, you know what I mean. I loved Carol&#x27;s Daughter leave-in conditioner, but they changed the look of their bottle which I just can&#x27;t get passed.I really like Mixed Chicks professional look just wish it worked more to my liking. We use Mixed Chicks shampoo and it is very nice. It does not dry out her hair at all.</li>
            <li> By far hands down my holy grail product for my natural hair. I really don&#x27;t know what I will do if this was ever discontinued. I always buy the huge bottle just in case!</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best product ever for curly hair! I have tried a lot of products and Mixed Chicks leaves my hair controlled, yet soft. Well conditioned,yet not greasy and at the same time tames my frizz. I love this product.</li>
            <li> Best leave in conditioner ..  can use it everyday without weighting down my hair.. doesn&#x27;t look  greasy ... try it . you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> So far this product gives me the most slippage. The price is a little more than I want to pay, but I haven&#x27;t found anything better, so I will continue to spend the money.</li>
            <li> Beware Celiacs or those sensitive to wheat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leave in hair product contains wheat and wheat protein (gluten).  It made my curls look great, but after using it for two weeks I had a severe reaction because I have celiac disease.  Please note that the shampoo and regular deep conditioner do NOT contain wheat, but this leave-in condition does, so if you can&#x27;t tolerate wheat or gluten -- do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> If you have naturally curly hair this product helps eliminate frizz. I love it! You only need a little and the the large bottle lasts forever!</li>
            <li> My husband has very thick and unruly curly hair. We have tried various leave in conditioners, but none have worked as good as this one. I love Mixed Chicks and would definitely be buying more in the near future.</li>
            <li> Mixed Chicks Leave In Conditioner is a staple In my hair routine everyday! I love this product and have been using this product for close to two years!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff.made my curls endless..will definitely buy again when price goes back down..</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and it works great!! I received it quickly and it came with free goodies inside!!</li>
            <li> I am an Asian woman with wavy/curly hair that goes out of control when exposed to a minimal degree of humidity. I have tried countless hair products in all price ranges, from a low to very high end, for frizz control and styling, and nothing has worked as well as Mixed chicks leave-in conditioner. My friend recommended this product to me (who has gorgeous big Egyptian curly hair with tiny curls and has tried numerous hair products as you can imagine) that it works like magic. Skeptical at first, I bought a small bottle from a drug store, and I have become a huge fan ever since. This is my third 33oz bottle I am ordering now for myself (a bottle goes a long way, but I keep one at home and another in the gym locker, not to mention that I also carry a small tube for short trips and emergency fix). My mother who perms her hair loved it when she tried mine (I did not expect it since she does not have naturally curly hair), so I sent two 33oz bottles to her place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used amazon prime for several years although I don&#x27;t write as many reviews as I should because I heavily rely on customer reviews when I order products. This product is not cheap but the bottle lasts almost a year (I have upper-back length hair and wash my hair 1-2 times daily). It is yellow cream colored and has mild and pleasant smell which does not clash with other fragrant bath products (i.e. body lotion, perfume, etc.). It is of lotion consistency, and the best part is that it keeps the shape of your curls without making them crunchy or oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply it to my hair after towel-drying my hair after morning workout and air dry it on my way to work. My mother told me that she applies it to near-dry hair as she is styling after she blow dries her hair, and it works like magic to hold her hair the way she wants to style. She said she loves it because it does not weigh her hair down nor leave sticky and unpleasant feel to her hands or hair after application.&lt;br /&gt;I am always in rush before work with very little patience or time to blow dry my hair so I have not tried it myself. When the temperature is sub-zero I quickly blow dry my hair to avoid a frozen hair mess, usually after applying mixed chicks conditioner. Several people (usually with curly/wavy hair) have asked me what products I use to keep my curls lively since I have started using mixed chicks, a question I have never been asked before (probably because of the freezy hair!), and I recently sent this product to a friend of mine a gift when she asked me about hair products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used any other products by Mixed Chicks (shampoo or conditioner) because I am happy with the results I get with their leave-in conditioner regardless which shampoo I use (I am more picky about conditioner than shampoo as most people are, and there are a few cheaper conditioners that work just fine so I have not felt the need to try deep conditioner by mixed chicks). But if I ever do I will post a review as well.&lt;br /&gt;For the skeptics with curly/wavy hair that often becomes a freeze ball, I recommend giving this product a try (perhaps the smaller one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have about the product is the pump. When there is about 20% left in the bottle, it is impossible to get it out of the pump, so I have to transfer the content to a new bottle I order from Amazon or to a travel bottle. It is fairly frustrating since it happened to all three bottles I have purchased, but I can live with it for now.ways in rush before work with very little patience or time to blow dry my hair so I have not tried it myself.

            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is VERY difficult to care for.  She absolutely dreads brushing her hair.  She is biracial, and her curly hair tangles and dries out very easily.  We had been looking for years to find the best product for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone recommended that we try out Mixed Chicks.  I normally won&#x27;t pay this much for a bottle of conditioner, but I figured that if it worked well, then it might be worth it.  Fortunately, it does work well, and we ended up buying a second bottle of this stuff after we used up the first bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leave-in conditioner works better than most of the other products that we&#x27;ve tried.  It leaves my little girl&#x27;s curls looking like... curls... and not just frizz.  Even better, her hair stays looking good for most of the day, which is something that most of the other products that we&#x27;ve tried usually fail to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first bottle of Mixed Chicks lasted a long time.  Unfortunately, the pump on the bottle ended up breaking before we used up the whole bottle.  To fix that problem, I just filled up one of my old bottles of conditioner with Mixed Chicks; that worked quite well.  With the amount of conditioner in this bottle, I was able to fill up the conditioner bottle a couple of times before we ran out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a product that we will buy again and again.  Unfortunately, the price is up there, so when finances are tight we can&#x27;t afford it, but when we have money, this is definitely a splurge that is worth making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT a product that I would use on my hair.  My hair is straight and quite fine; this product probably would not work well on it.  However, for dry, frizzy, hard to manage hair, it can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> The best conditioner for curly or wavy hair! My daughter has very curly hair. We have struggled for years with the frizz. Living in the South humidity is an issue. This product has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> I may not be a \\&quot;mixed chick\\&quot; but my hair seems to think I am! I&#x27;ve tried them all... mousse, gel, silicone based products, other leave in conditioners... you name it, I&#x27;ve tried it!  If you are considering this product, I&#x27;m sure this is a familiar tale.  All of those products had issues.  Some left my hair frizzy, some were heavy and greasy and some turned my hair so crunchy I feared my husband would be injured if he touched it!  None of these gave me the soft, defined, non-frizzy curls I dreamed of.  Mixed Chicks has changed that!!  When I first used it, my hair got rather crunchy when it dried so I thought \\&quot;here we go again\\&quot; but then I ran my fingers through it.  The crunch disappeared and I was left with hair so soft, I couldn&#x27;t believe it was mine!  Every time I glanced in a mirror that day I expected to see the return of the frizz but it never appeared!  I am so happy to have found Mixed Chicks!  Soft, defined, non-frizzy curls are no longer my dream, they are my reality!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for this product my entire life. I have super thick coarse naturally curly red hair which I have always thought of more as a curse than a blessing. But the Mixed Chicks makes my hair curl in almost ringlets with much less frizz (I haven&#x27;t gotten the shampoo or conditioner yet but I am hoping they help reduce the frizz more). I don&#x27;t know how I got along without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a member of the big curly hair club I would suggest getting some of this!</li>
            <li> The product is great for curly hair. I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s a must have for people with curly hair since it doesn&#x27;t damage the hair. It&#x27;s just GREAT!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair. I traditionally have used between 3-4 products to maintain curl &amp; minimize frizz. Now I just use this. Revolutionized my hair.</li>
            <li> shipping was turbo... very happy about that... This is a staple for my dtr&#x27;s hair.... lost without it.... great price !!</li>
            <li> Excellent price and super fast delivery.  I love this product, only one that works for our family!  I&#x27;ve tried many</li>
            <li> Only thing that works for my curly hair. Gives it great bounce and shine. No frizz and it&#x27;s nice and soft. I won&#x27;t use anything else on my hair!! Love it! So many people stop me on the streets to ask me what I use for my curly hair because it looks great! MIXED CHICKS BABY!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  ITS AMAZING WORKS ON ANY TYPE OF HAIR..MY HAIR IS WAVY AN IT DEFINES MY CURLS SOOOO WELL. VERY HAPPY I STARTED USING THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time in two separate shipments second package some of the product leaked and out of the three product none of the pumps worked . Mixed chicks product were good not the packaging.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent dispenser.  Also I like the economical size of the bottle.  I cannot wait to see how my curly hair would look in the humid summer days.</li>
            <li> This is the worse leave-in conditioner I have ever used.  I have long curly hair which frizzes and this product just left it a mess.  Too little is not enough and too much just leave clumps of your hair weighted down.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It leaves my hair feeling soft and not dried out. I recommend this conditioner to other family members and friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter who has crazy curly hair.  It worked alright.  I wonder if there will ever be a product that can truly tame her curls.</li>
            <li> been using mixed chicks for 4years...this is incredible !! I am white,, with curly red hair. and it works for me!! it makes my curly frizzy full head of thick hair very easy to handle..it also allowed me to finally grow it out to where i can wear it long and curly.!!!&lt;br /&gt;something i would have loved to be able to do when younger!</li>
            <li> This bottle lasts about 6 months. I use it on my 2 mixed daughters roughly twice a week. So worth it!</li>
            <li> After spending most of my adult life trying to tame my curls with a blow dryer and roller brush, I used Mixed Chicks after a recommendation from a friend.  No more blow dryer, no more dry frizzy hair.  Hello to my natural curls and waves!  My hair is much better for it and I get lots of compliments on my natural curls....</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is great for my hair and keeps my curls in tact and frizz free for up to 2 days. Don&#x27;t need the shampoo to go with it, but shampoo/conditioner works well too.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue, leaves my hair soft and curly, no frizzes. Conditions it too. My daughter uses it too. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> absolutely love it, i have wavy hair and with this product they look amazing. it&#x27;s easy to use and doesn&#x27;t make your hair look oily and greasy.</li>
            <li> Works very well on curly hair, although doesn&#x27;t remove frizz completely. I am now looking for a more natural product.</li>
            <li> My daughter has lots and lots of curls. This leave in conditioner is part or of daily hair routine. Actually it is our daily hair routine. I put this in and throw on a headband and she looks amazing rocking her curls!  Weekly I use the mixed Chicks shampoo and conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> I love Mixed Chicks. It gives enough definition without being heavy. It is the best thing I have found for my curly hair, especially in the hot and humid south!</li>
            <li> This product works best on naturally curly hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for course or kinky hair types. Somehow people without naturally curly hair think this will miraculously turn their hair naturally curly. My hair is very thick and curly and this is the only product in my 39 years that tames it without chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use Mixed Chicks when I wear my hair natural and it grows like crazy. Love it![[ASIN:B002XPVHZ2 Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner - 33 oz]]</li>
            <li> The Mixed Chicks Leave in Conditioner is an excellent product that I have used for years. My local store that I usually purchase it from sold out and told me that their shipment would not be in for two weeks so I decided to order it online myself. The price was good (a few dollars cheaper than I usually pay). Also, the product arrived in good condition and exactly as described, however, the shipment was received three days after the expected shipment date given when I placed my order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 years and it is the ONLY thing I use/put in my hair.  I don&#x27;t even use gel anymore.  It makes my curls perfectly defined and soft.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE..... this product!!!  I just wash my hair, dry lightly, put this in and let my hair dry naturally.  It&#x27;s a little thick and definitely creamy but not slippery like some leave-in&#x27;s can be. It isn&#x27;t so silky/slick that it loosen my curls.  The consistence is like any other wash out conditioner you&#x27;d use.  It holds/retains that perfect corkscrew curl look that I have.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product line.  It is the only line that keeps my curly-fuzzy hair under control, even in humid and rainy weather.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in hopes of having my curls in tacked without them feeling hard to the touch.  It did leave my hair dull but I didn&#x27;t care because I had curls rather than frizz.  It&#x27;s not to say that it eliminates frizz all the time.  Some days my curls were fabulous, didn&#x27;t happen to often but did happen, and others they were easier to manage.  It did weigh my hair down but that is what I needed. I used the shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in conditioner.  No extra products and I used as directed.  I didn&#x27;t use the leave-in everyday just when I felt my hair needed help.  For me, if I used it to often and or not on soaking wet hair it would leave flakes and frizz.&lt;br /&gt;Now after a while of using these products I one day had a reaction shortly after applying the leave in conditioner.  My scalp itched so bad it was unreal.  I quickly jumped back in the shower to rinse it out but the itching continued. Long story short I paid big to get my scalp back to its norm.</li>
            <li> Best product, so happy i finally found it. I was using Paul Mitchell wax works but it was such a little amount for so much money so I was on the hunt. Another mixed girl I know recommended this and I am super pleased. This is the only product I need to use. While my hair is wet I apply ALOT, so that every strand has some and then I shape the curls at the front of my head with my finger. I let it air dry without touching it. Once dry I pull the curls out so that they are not crunchy and stiff. Soft bouncy curls that smell good, not like those weird smells of the mayonnaise and creams for African american hair. The next day I wet my hair slightly, like damp and apply garnier fructic curl mousse and follow the same techninques of air dry, then pull out crunchy curls. Very happy with this product, the jumbo is worth the money</li>
            <li> Works wonderful in my mixed granddaughter&#x27;s hair. Makes it manageable and it stays for a couple of days. Geed product. Price is a little high.</li>
            <li> Great product for curly hair!!!!</li>
            <li> Ehhh... I don&#x27;t notice any spectacular results, particularly compared to what we usually use - ORS olive leave-in conditioner.  I&#x27;ve tried the Mixed Chicks Leave-In Conditioner twice now, patting excess moisture away and letting the rest air dry.  Daughter&#x27;s hair looks great out of the bath, the next morning it&#x27;s fairly dry but not too hard to comb (the morning after using ORS is much easier), 2 mornings later it&#x27;s even drier and harder to comb.  Her ethnicity is black/white, her hair is thin and curly.  I&#x27;ll probably sell the remainder and stick with what&#x27;s worked for her hair.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter. She used to have so much trouble with frizz until a teacher told her about mixed chicks hair products.  She uses the sulfate free shampoo, deep conditioner and the leave-in conditioner faithfully. Now her curls are shiny and well defined.  She goes to school in Pittsburgh so sometimes there is a little frizz, but she puts more leave-in cond. on her dry hair.  Definately can&#x27;t be without this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several leave in conditioners for my natural hair and this by far is the best. it evens beats out Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair milk.</li>
            <li> I am 1/2 African-American 1/4 Mexican &amp; 1/4 White. I have very kinky dry frizzy hair. After about a month of using this product everyday my curls became more  defined and my hair was so soft  :-) I loveeee this stuff it works wonders for me. I gave it a 4 star because it does leave my hair a little crunchy. A tiny bit though not like a gel or hairspray.</li>
            <li> This product works well on my hair as well as my 2 daughters&#x27; hair. We all have different types of hair and it conditions and detangles well! I put some in a spray bottle with some water for the girls. I generally put it in my hair after the shower. I love it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! I refuse to use any other product on my hair. Perfect for those with &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34; hair (coarse and curly).</li>
            <li> We have mixed ethnicity daughters, and have been using the Mixed Chicks product line for over 5 years.  We absolutely love it and have tried many other products that didn&#x27;t work nearly as well.  I regularly get complimented on my daughters&#x27; hair in public.  I am white with wavy hair, and it also works very well to define my curls a little more.</li>
            <li> I have used it once and have not seen the results yet. I hope to have hair down my back soon but will not cry if it does not happen for another week or two.</li>
            <li> I have been using Mixed Chicks Leave in for about 6 years now.  I Love love LOVE this product!  Just a small amount goes a long ways.  Recently started cocktailing it with DermOrganic&#x27;s Aragon Oil and love the leave in even more!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best for my and my daughter&#x27;s curly hair. We don&#x27;t need any other products and have used this for three years. We just wash with wen and then put this in section by section. At first, when I used other products as a base, I really didn&#x27;t like this. Then, I thought to use it just how I put it in my daughter&#x27;s hair. I apply it generously and comb through with my fingers. Air dry, then style. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer and well worth the price since no other products are needed.</li>
            <li> I have used mixed chicks lv.-in twice.it dries hard. I added water to some in a spray bottle. That worked better but still dries hard.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say it took care of frizz or made many Curls but definitely added body to my Hair..</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I finally found something that works on my wavy/curly hair.  This large size was a great deal</li>
            <li> This product is the only one that works for my daughters hair. I&#x27;ve used it too! It&#x27;s super light weight and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky or with build up. Glad I found the bigger bottle here on amazon. I use to buy it only for Target since it was the only place I was able to find it. This is at a perfect price too. The ones at Target was in a smaller bottle for $20+ and this one on amazon costs more, but you get a lot more product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the pump too! It makes it easier when I&#x27;ve got my hands full with clips and combs! :D</li>
            <li> Dream come true.  I use it for myself and my daughter.  She inherited my thick, curly hair and this keeps her frizz under control and defines her curls.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it, it smells good. Nuff said.</li>
            <li> I but this product because I heard that it was good for my type of hair. But I don&#x27;t see the difference.  $50 wasted.</li>
            <li> I read others reviews before I bought this leave-in conditioner.  Most of the reviews gave it at least 5 starts but several reviewers stated that it made their hair &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34;  and several other reviewers that didn&#x27;t care for it.  But for me, and the magic words are &amp;#34;for me&amp;#34; it worked wonderful.  There is no crunchy feeling at all and it makes my hair soft.  I use it exactly like the instructions says.  Works good.  I went back to natural so I do not have a perm in it.  The curls are really tight to the point that I really don&#x27;t want to comb it when it drys.  But this leave in conditioner makes it really soft.  As I said it works pretty good on my hair</li>
            <li> Long time user, this is the only product that will keep my curls nice and soft without the dried out crunchy feeling i get from all other curly hair products.</li>
            <li> love this stuff!!  I could not live without it!  My hair is finally tangle free!  Thank you Mixed chicks!!  I recommend this conditioner to anyone who has curly hair.</li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian woman with thick, dry, curly hair. I&#x27;ve tried many many products ranging in low to very high prices. Nothing ever seemed to really make my hair shiny or feel soft.....until mixed chicks leave-in-conditioner! I read about this in a magazine and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. While I didn&#x27;t want to get stuck spending another 20 dollars on a 10oz bottle of something I may hate I figured what&#x27;s one more risk?! I&#x27;m SO glad I sucked it up and bought a bottle. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now and my hair is softer and shinier than it&#x27;s EVER been! My husband even comments on how nice my hair feels. I don&#x27;t have to buy expensive shampoo and conditioners anymore and I don&#x27;t need to use a bunch of products in my hair to try to calm the frizziness. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone who wants soft shiny hair...it&#x27;s worth at least trying this product, especially if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product, so light and it works wonders on my curls &amp;#60;3 A little definitely goes a long way with the product as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent leave-in coditioner</li>
            <li> Mixed chicks works better than lotion or any gel Ive ever used. It allows my curls to curl perfectly, but doesnt make my hair hard like gel. If I put mixed chicks in my hair then braid my hair in 4 small sections, my curls are looser, longer, and nicer after I remove the braids and shake my hair free. :) I am not a mixed chick, but my hair loves this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is not easy to find a good product for curly hair, but this did the trick. It is very concentrated, so I actually pour it into a smaller bottle and mix it with water. 50/50 and it works really well.</li>
            <li> I ordered a travel size from the Mixed Chicks website because if it didn&#x27;t work on my hair I didn&#x27;t want to out a quite a bit of money. Plus, I&#x27;m trying to limit my product hoarding, which seems to have take over my bathroom counter and medicine cabinets. I&#x27;m a white male, and I have Type 2B/C to 3A hair type. My hair is down to my shoulder blades, and yes I&#x27;m blonde. I did a DNA test when I was in college and I&#x27;m 95% European, and 5% Sub-Saharan African. I guess it make me a &amp;#34;Mixed Man&amp;#34;. I makes sense about the hair type that was passed down to me, although it was a very long time ago. I never tried to figure out genetics. My mother and father have stick straight hair, and both my brothers have stick straight hair. I&#x27;m the only one out of the family that this mass of curly hair. I have fine to medium hair which made me worried when I ordered this product because EVERYTHING else I tried either left my hair heavy, greasy, sticky. The leave in conditioner has a thicker consistency. When I smoothed this into my hair was waiting for the conditioner to make it heavy, and greasy. However much to my surprise it hair very full of shine, and for the first time I could honestly say my wavy/curly hair looked the best it ever has. My hair was left into beautiful spiral curls and long flowing waves. I was very impressed and that is something coming from a guy who doesn&#x27;t really care about hair products. I just wanted them to work in my hair, and not have my hair look like I haven&#x27;t washed in a week, or look like a white Don King when I go outside.The reason why I&#x27;m writing this review is because I was stopped earlier this week by an older woman when I was out with my two nieces. The lady stopped me and said to me &amp;#34;That is so unfair&amp;#34;. I looked at her weirdly. She said it was so unfair because she used to spend 1000&#x27;s of dollars getting her straight hair to look like mine. She patted my shoulder and said you didn&#x27;t do much to get your hair to look like that did you. I said just some mixed chicks left it alone. My nieces giggled because they thought an older lady was hitting on their uncle. Here is what I do:&lt;br /&gt;1. Wash and Condition as usual&lt;br /&gt;2. I use a microfiber towel to squeeze some of the water out of my hair&lt;br /&gt;3. Spray in a leave in condition and comb through my hair&lt;br /&gt;4. I take half size dollar amount and completely saturate my hair.&lt;br /&gt;5. I take a finer brush to make sure the product is evenly distributed throughout my hair.&lt;br /&gt;6. I flip my hair up and scrunch from bottom, and flip my head back up and crunch again.&lt;br /&gt;7. *MOST IMPORTANT STEP* Leave it alone, to air dry or (diffuse with dryer) Do not touch or even look at it. I know it is hard not to touch your hair&lt;br /&gt;8 . Your hair will feel crunchy, when your hair is dry 100% dry then go back into your hair and scrunch again to get rid of the crunchiness.&lt;br /&gt;9. I have long flowing waves/spiral curls that look amazing, with minimal effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered the 33 oz jug of Mixed Chicks leave in conditioner. As long as I wear my hair long. I will always use Mixed Chicks in my hair. I hope this review will help someone who is sitting on the fence about this like I was. Order a sample and try it out to see if you like it. It&#x27;s what I did and I have a jug coming to me now..... I said just some mixed chicks left it alone.

            <li> My daughter is indeed mixed. I am African American and her dad is Indian, so her hair turned out to be really curly.  We struggled for a long time searching for products that would keep her hair moisturized and hold her curls.  This product is perfect. The key is applying it when the hair is wet and leaving it to dry.  No build up, great bounce.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is a little pricey, but worth every penny. Especially for unruly curly hair that has a mind of it&#x27;s own :) Mixed Chicks magically tames the untamed!</li>
            <li> My daughter has such frizzy hair and it really tones it down and makes it look naturally curly. Without making feel heavy. They use to call her chia pet at camp.&lt;br /&gt;I have a little curl in my hair and I tried it recently and loved it for me because it added body to my hair while it was air drying I put some on and scrunched it out and it looked great. Made the little hair I have feel full.&lt;br /&gt;I am sure everyone will love this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love this leave-in conditioner! I have dry, fine, frizzy hair and this helps with keeping it soft and naturally curled. Otherwise, I would have troll doll hair! I do use it in conjunction with a few other products. I don&#x27;t wash my hair every day so when I use it, I mix it with water so it&#x27;s thinner and doesn&#x27;t glop in places on my hair. Before I discovered this conditioner, I&#x27;ve used other brands and none have come close to these results.</li>
            <li> I bough t this product for my daugther.  It meets my expectations.... I used once and it is as described.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! I have thick curly hair about shoulder length and it leaves my hair soft and shiny and washes out nicely leaving no build up!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I both use this product daily. We have two different hair types... I am african american/caucasian mix and my daughter&#x27;s father is african american. This product works well for both of us. I was very pleased to find it in this size. I use it daily and recommend it.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of defining my curls and taking away the frizz. I can even feel the silkiness in my hair when I wash my hair two days later. I highly recommend it to anyone with curly hair.</li>
            <li> Love it!! My girls and I have thin Hair but very curly it works great !!! Love it love it love it</li>
            <li> this product made my hair feel tough and it tangled my hair. i lost so much hair in one wash it was unbelievable. i am sorry i wasted my money i could have bought some $4 Treseme condition and saved some hair and money.</li>
            <li> For those of us that don&#x27;t have straight hair or extremely tight curls, this product gives body to your hair so it can be styled and so that style stays during the day without harsh chemicals.  Seems much more natural way to handle curly hair.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using Mixed Chicks for more than 5 years, and it is amazing. Nothing else has worked nearly as well at keeping my hair healthy and frizz free.</li>
            <li> this is an excellent product for my granddaugters hair, she is biracial and there are very few products like it, the leave in conditioner when her hair is wet I can comb right thru her hair. great buy for the price the amt that you get in this deal</li>
            <li> A most have if you have mixed textured hair.</li>
            <li> My daughters are biracial and this is by far the best product I have found to tame their natural curls!</li>
            <li> I have been using this leave-in for about 6 months now and I have to say it is my favorite leave in. I have 3b/c hair and of all the products I have tried this has been the best for my hair. I use this on soaking wet hair in the shower, about 10 - 12 pumps for my whole head. My hair is currently shoulder length when dry in its curly state. Since I do my wash and go only once a week, the 33 oz bottle lasts for about 4 or 5 months which I think is a great value. I do not use any other products in my hair with this leave-in, though sometimes I will put a little deva curl anGEL on my edges and at the very ends of my curls for a little more hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never had any problems with flaking or dryness with this leave-in and I have also never suffered from build up. I wash with shampoo each week and once a month I use a clarifying shampoo in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I will point out is how the price has really gone up on this product on amazon. I usually pay about $34 per bottle (I have bought this product twice in the last 6 months) and now it is $50! I will not be purchasing from here for that price but I will continue to buy this product forever! :D</li>
            <li> Great product for my Loves who have beautifull curly, soft hair. Price point now matches what is available in our local stores.</li>
            <li> I decide that for the summer, I would go natural.  But, my hair is wavy, not curly.  So I have tried a few products and I like this one the best.  It isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; like these products can be sometimes.  I have perfected the application and really like it a lot.  I have not blow dried my (long and thick) hair in 6 months!  I am white, not ethnic, but this is for anybody who wants to amplify their waves or curls.  I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a really good leave in product. By end of the day you do need to re wet and apply more if u have long hair.  Smell and how it holds is very nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this for many years now...its by far! My favorite leave in conditioner!!! Please don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> I have tried every product out there (just about) I love how this product shapes my curls, makes my  naturally dry, curly hair, smooth, controlling frizz and manageable.  It&#x27;s been helping me grow my hair out with many good hair days!!!!  I does make the hair slightly &amp;#34;crispy&amp;#34; initially but that seems to soft throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t to live without this product</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried many different moisturizers and conditioners for my kids hair, and this one is still the best. Please keep it in stock Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> My daughter can&#x27;t live without this product. This is all she uses in her hair. She has thick curly hair and does wonders for her.</li>
            <li> Works super well on naturally curly hair.  Tames frizz wonderfully.</li>
            <li> The only thing that actually works on my thick, frizzy hair.  One pump, run it through my hair, air dry and I am ready to go.  Nice, non-offensive smell.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love mixed chicks.  My kids have soft curly hair and this really helps to define the curls.  It makes their hair look really curly and soft.  The like it, I like.  Does a nice job.  I would recommend getting a smaller bottle to try first and then if you like it, buying the larger size.</li>
            <li> I get out of the shower and just do a pat down with a towel on my hair, one pump squirt of this great product and then work it into the hair evenly.  Gives me the best Whte-boy Jeri-curl you ever saw!</li>
            <li> This product works well with my thick, naturally curly hair.  I use a lot of it which makes my hair a bit stiff, but after a few hours, it softens up and my curls look very controlled.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and as anyone with curly hair knows it is impossible to find something that works consistently in my hair to maintain or style my curls.  I love Mix Chicks Leave In. A little goes a long way, it is not sticky, it is not heavy, and it has a light smell.  I am a life long client.</li>
            <li> Great reliable service and I love this stuff</li>
            <li> Finally a product for girls with hair somewhere in between straight and nappy.  Mixed chicks is fantastic and really helps my tight, tight, tight (did I mention tight) curly hair look pretty.  The leave in conditioner really helps &#x27;organize&#x27; my mop of curls so I look more &#x27;finished&#x27; rather than sloppy.  I also use it in between washes by wetting my hands and using one to two squirts of conditioner and apply it all over my head.  It freshens up the curl the day after a wash and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly African-American hair and wanted a product that would leave my tresses feeling moisturized. This product did NOT do that! It left my hair EXTREMELY dry! I will not be using again!</li>
            <li> I am a black women with mixed ancestory. I have long, thick, naturally curly hair. My mom turned me on to this product. I use regular shampoo and conditioner and then put a generous amount of this product in my hair. It is wonderful!! No more mousse or spray in gel, which leaves hair too crunchy. It controls frizz and leaves my hair curly and soft. It does not break and damage your hair like hair spray either. I love this product!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and I have used it now for several years.  It tends to get a little pricey at times, but Amazon still remains the cheapest source in which to purchase this product.  Fast delivery also! Very impressive.</li>
            <li> My mom &amp; niece had no problems with it at all.. It gave me hell.. It smells really good and makes combing &amp; styling easy.. Just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Leave my hair hard but holds style superbly.</li>
            <li> Nice smell... lightweight, fresh and non-sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer OGX argan curl defining cream, but this works nicely too. I think it&#x27;s a bit overpriced though. If I use it straight out of the shower to scrunch in to curls, it dries nicely and keeps frizz at bay. It&#x27;s a good product overall.</li>
            <li> Only thing that keeps my 3c hair from looking dry. I tried the c.g. method and my hair was good but this makes my hair great!  Oh its authentic I brought the small one from target its the same</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair.  It&#x27;s the kind of hair that makes people ask me if I&#x27;ve had a perm (the curly perm, not the straightening perm).  I&#x27;m Samoan and African-American, so I&#x27;ve got a thorough mixture going on.  First, it smells great.  Second, it makes your curls super soft and defined.  Third, you don&#x27;t need a lot of it to get the desired effect.  Highly recommend because I love love this product.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter and I use this product. It really helps to define our curls and defrizz the hair  in this humid weather. We have been using it for many years and it is still a great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I have been using it for years.  It leaves my curls soft and defined, with good hold.  I think I have 3c curls.</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff.  Use alone or with the Mixed Chicks Serum.  Detangles my wavy hair without out using a comb and moisturizes.  Apply before you towel dry or leave the shower,  just takes a few pumps, product goes far.</li>
            <li> The best stuff on the planet for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Our son is mixed African American with a strong heritage of Indian in him and I am Caucasian. For years everything we tried either made his hair too greasy or didn&#x27;t hold and moisture enough so his curls were frizz by the end of the days. With this stuff he showed, gets out and ours in the Leave in conditioner, combs it and that&#x27;s it. The curls hold all day and when I say all day I mean it. Our son plays competitive soccer and even after a 10 hour day I&#x27;m the field his hair still looks pretty dang good. You can&#x27;t go wrong trying this once. I order from here because it&#x27;s much mire expensive at other stores.</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Item arrived earlier than expected and the product is awesome.  I have course curly hair and have searched hair products for 35 years until my sister in law introduces me to this.  It replaces my entourage of products.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Fantastic product ! I&#x27;m greek so I have very Mediterranean hair literally if I don&#x27;t wash it for a week&lt;br /&gt;It starts to dreadlock ! This stuff is awesome I put it on my hair after I wash it , with a little organic gel&lt;br /&gt;And it looks great , also i put a little on my hair when it&#x27;s dry for my frizzies .&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it .</li>
            <li> Great stuff, great price. Used it and immediately liked it more than my last leave in (kinky curly). Better curl definition</li>
            <li> My daughter is from Ethiopia love love it with the wet brush!</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner for my weave so far. It does get a little crunchy but it&#x27;s better than the frizzy, poofy, afro. look.</li>
            <li> Never been disappointed with this product. I get so many compliments on my hair and mixed chicks is the only product I use on my hair. Can&#x27;t say enough about the product.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re latino, mixed all across the board with almost all colors and hair types available in our home. Our curly hair ranges from loose curls to extremely tight curls, most if not all easily tangle; this product it makes our hair very manageable. When applied after wetting your hair it&#x27;ll keep it smooth and controlled, less fly aways and loose hairs sticking up all crazy like. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel heavy or like you applied anything to it. It&#x27;s good enough that you don&#x27;t even have to use it daily, I use it every other day when I shampoo (should length medium/tight curls that if not combed every few days can lock up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for curly haired individuals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get it from amazon because it&#x27;s a lot more expensive in most stores.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with Mixed Chicks on a recommendation from a friend.  I have African American hair, and I use it everyday.  It makes my natural curls pop.  My curls are so defined. This is my staple.  I actually add a little S-Curl for a added moisture.  I love my curly afro!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have curly hair and have tried countless anti-frizz products.  Finally, found a product that works.  Friends and family have noticed the difference and even my hair stylist is amazed that I am only using one product to eliminate the frizz. I&#x27;m staying with &amp;#34;Mixed Chicks&amp;#34; leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I use everyday and have minimal build up. My curls are defined and not frizzy yet still super soft. I refuse to use anything else.</li>
            <li> Makes my daughters hair looks manageable and curl hair stay on all day.</li>
            <li> I actually had high hopes for this product.  However, it left my hair extremely dry and brittle.  Now just because it did not work for me does not mean it will not work for you.  Please try for yourself.</li>
            <li> Wonderful conditioner!  My daughter is mixed with Puerto Rican and Black and has crazy curls that become a frizzy mess without this product.  I use this on my 2 year old daughters hair at night after her bath while it is wet and keep it in a ponytail overnight while she sleeps.  The next morning it is easy to comb through and nearly tangle free.  I use another dime size amount on her hair in the morning and it keeps her curls beautiful and shiny.  It does not leave her hair greasy, but soft and well moisturized.  She receives so many compliments on her curls and it is because of this product.  I love the jumbo size of this bottle.  It is a little pricey, but the last bottle lasted us 6 months, so it was definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> Works so well in my granddaughters hair. Less tears and healthier hair.</li>
            <li> BEST curly hair product I&#x27;ve ever used.. I have long curl type 3A- mixed spanish/white.  Nothing groups my curls together better.</li>
            <li> Great product! Always a winner!</li>
            <li> Very nice product but it also makes my hair feel stiff.</li>
            <li> Loved the way that it made my hair feel and look. My only complaint is that when I began using the product my hair seemed to be breaking off/falling out. I have fine hair, but I have A LOT of hair. It scared me seeing so much hair coming out on my comb but it seems to have stopped and it wasn&#x27;t noticable. So, I am going to continue using the product because it works wonders.</li>
            <li> Hard to find, great to buy online.  Works well!</li>
            <li> Mixed chicks makes my very curly hair look healthy and feel natural.  I&#x27;ve tried MANY products and this is the best.</li>
            <li> Love this product I&#x27;ve been using it for years.</li>
            <li> This leave in has become my staple styler. I took off one star because some of the reviews claimed they recieved &amp;#34;bottles of glue&amp;#34;?? Which made me question the authenticity but fortunately the bottle I recieved was perfect so no complaints here! Just a word of warning...this leave in might dry a little crunchy but once your hair is dry you can scrunch and run your fingers through your hair and your curls will be extremely soft! :)</li>
            <li> I really love this conditioner! It really works well in the shower!  I use it with the leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was transitioning for about 5 years and just did the big chop about two months ago. I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of different products and this is by far the best for my hair. I have tried some other expensive products that others raved about. They were ok, but their curl-defining and conditioning abilities don&#x27;t compare at all to what Mixed Chicks Leave-in Conditioner does for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very thick, very thirsty, tangles easily. I conditioner-wash my hair in the morning with the MC leave-in. Just wash and go. It defines curls I didn&#x27;t even know were there. My hair naturally gets very dry by the end of the day, but much less so with this product. I highly recommend this for big, thick hair!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product we use it everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white, 100% Caucasian woman, I&#x27;ve always had blonde hair, straight like a stick. Then once I had my kids, my hair turned into curly hair, none of the products worked for me. My hair was frizzy, uncontrollable, no shine, no shape, all tangled, just a mess!!!!! I&#x27;ve tried frizz free products, shining serums, all types of conditioners and shampoos. Oh the money I&#x27;ve spent on my hair... and then I found MIXED CHICKS LEAVE-IN CONDITIONER and I absolutely love it. I wash my hair, I dry it just a bit, then apply product, without brushing my hair, I shape the curls and waves with my hands, then wait until my hair is completely dry, fluff my hair, shape it with my hands again and I&#x27;m ready to go. I do have to say it doesn&#x27;t work well when my hair isn&#x27;t completely dry before I go to bed, if there&#x27;s a slight bit of moisture I wake up with a mess. So I usually wash my hair in the afternoon. But I do strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> OK so here are my \\&quot;specs\\&quot; - - -  My hair is super fine and poker straight...but not Anglo-Saxon lay down flat poker straight. It&#x27;s more like \\&quot;I&#x27;ve got a mind of my own\\&quot; poker straight and can and will stick out all over the place, think \\&quot;chia pet\\&quot;....humid summers in the Mid Atlantic region or a windy day are potential hair disasters... - so I have to have to maintain an orderly head of hair with a knowledgeable hair stylist and an assortment of hair care products - usually a mix and match process with some shampoos and conditioners from the caucasian aisle (Trader Joes inexpensive and very good Nourish Spa shampoo and conditioner, Guarnier Fructis Sleek and Shine, Pantene, and Kiehls along with Schwartzkopf XL Got2B Ultra Glued)with some afrocentric products like Wet n Wavy creme moist curl creme (really great product) thrown in to manage my hair. And Yes - I mean Got2B Ultra Glued and Wet n Wavy at the same time. Not a ton of either product, but enough to HOLD that wild thing on top of my head in place. I had heard about Mixed Chicks products and I had read reviews both pro and con, but I watched the video of the 2 lovely ladies who created the product and I decided to jump in with both feet - I bought the big jar for $46. This is unlike any product I have used in that it is not at all greasy and not particulary heavy, smells faintly (not much noticeable scent from this product, great!) like Frederick Fekkai shea butter conditioner and Kiehls shampoo and/or conditioner (both are also great products, but so much $$$!). The 2 Mixed Chicks ladies had much longer and much curlier/kinkier hair than I do and they said the product would define curls and tame the wildness...Well, they were telling the absolute truth. I put a medium size pearl of Mixed Chicks into my wet hair when I get out of the shower - dry off except for my hair, get dressed and then voila. I can manage my hair with my bare hands and a comb, or use a blow dryer and concentrator on the back of my head where I have 2 cowlicks that have proven untameable over the years  -and I am good to go. The product seems to adhere to my hair (without being greasy or heavy or \\&quot;gluey/sticky\\&quot; in the slightest) and somehow changes the very texture of my hair to where even in a steady breeze my hair gets blown about....and then settles back down with very little assistance from me. Unheard of in the past. Bottom line, for anyone with wild ethnic hair that needs additional control, this stuff Rocks...Period. Thank you, Mixed Chicks!here I have 2 cowlicks that have proven untameable over the years  -and I am good to go. The product seems to adhere to my hair (without being greasy or heavy or \\&quot;gluey/sticky\\&quot; in the slightest) and somehow changes the very texture of my hair to where even in a steady breeze my hair gets blown about....and then settles back down with very little assistance from me. Unheard of in the past. Bottom line, for anyone with wild ethnic hair that needs additional control, this stuff Rocks...Period. Thank you, Mixed Chicks!</li>
            <li> This product is too expensive! I will not be purchasing this product. Not all people are made of money as the two women that created this product must think. I&#x27;m sure they even marked it up once Halle Berry endorsed it.</li>
            <li> We have two mixed chicks at home, age 3 and 9, and this product is a real life saver. The other mixed chick conditioner (wash-out), and the shampoo are also good, but if you had to rank the Mixed Chicks products, I would say that this is the best one (but still I would get the other ones as well). Depending on the type of curls it may be heavy or just right - but it works wonders for us, despite my daughters&#x27; hair has a different textures in the front and back (some more curly and some more curly patches).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We use this together with the shampoo, and it is as if using it regularly changes the structure of the hair. So when we go to the local swimming pool (where there is no time for anything but washing the hair in some generic shampoo), the hair still looks good afterwards (despite not using the mixed chicks products there).</li>
            <li> I have waited my whole life for a hair product that was neither for Caucasian or African American hair.  This is right in the middle, and I am totally in love with it!  I wish I could give more than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> great price. great product</li>
            <li> best i have found for my curly locks. with a great cut, this is the product to use!</li>
            <li> Every black girl needs</li>
            <li> If I could rate the Mixed Chicks products a ZERO I would. I tried the leave in conditioner and the deep conditioners. Both of them were so thick and sticky I couldn&#x27;t get them out of the bottle. They are like lumps of thick glue. Waxy. Thick, and very hard to even apply to natural hair. I would prefer something without the goopy gloopy feel. Never again and a big waste of money on a jar of goop that can&#x27;t be used.</li>
            <li> Left my hair dry, crunchy, and with a residue on it that felt like greasy wax.  Couldn&#x27;t wait to wash it out of my hair.  It didn&#x27;t smell as bad as I thought it would, but it sure made my hair look and feel disgusting.  Thankfully I had only bought a sample because I would be pissed if I wasted a lot of money on this.</li>
            <li> Firstly, let me say: Both of my parents are mixed (Jamaican and Irish), and my hair is pin-straight when wet and curly when dry. I need something to keep my frizz under control when and I wanted a good leave-in conditioner. I&#x27;m growing my hair out.&lt;br /&gt;I tried &amp;#34;HIS MIX&amp;#34; by Mixed Chicks, for MEN, and the product is great!!&lt;br /&gt;I was told that Mixed Chicks (For women) was the same product and cheaper. Only half of that was true.&lt;br /&gt;The product was cheaper! But it WAS NOT the same!&lt;br /&gt;Mixed Chicks leave-in conditioner is waxy! After applying it takes forever to dry into the hair, and once it does it becomes solid as a rock! Although, this happens a lot with different conditions, I&#x27;ve learned to finger comb my hair out and the curls lot less intimidating-- you can&#x27;t do this with Mixed Chicks!&lt;br /&gt;It left this waxy film on my hair and it just looked gross! I had to wash it out immediately!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a guy or if you ladies have sons, please revert them over to &amp;#34;HIS MIX&amp;#34; by the same company and apply that to their hair. It&#x27;s gives you the same control over your hair, however, it&#x27;s not waxy and doesn&#x27;t leaving any film in the hair!</li>
            <li> love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> Does great for my curly hair :). Smells good. Have even used on my baby nephew. Great hydration and no need for another product to maintain curl or keep away frizz</li>
            <li> I just finished my first bottle and already ordered another one! Yes it&#x27;s pricey but is NEEDED for curly hair. In between bottles I used product that I previously used on my hair and I noticed a HUGE difference! My hair was sticky, dry and not as curly. Now im back on Mixed Chicks and this product is so good you do not need to use anything else. This will \\&quot;tame\\&quot; your hair and define the curls all day long while keeping your hair soft and flake free. This mixed chick loves it. I&#x27;m hooked!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product to me. It is the best styling product I have ever used.  It is hard for me to get a wash and wear style but I do with this.  It is a curly look but looks and feels natural.</li>
            <li> Have to say it really does work. I have 4a,b,and c hair. After their deep conditioner, I applied this to my very wet hair. Oh and don&#x27;t rinse your hair too much after the deep conditioner. You still want a little coating of it. But I applied the Leave-in and really had the lose ring hair for most of the day. Toward the end my hair did start to puff as it usually does. But this is the first product I have found that helps with hold, motorizes without leaving oil behind on  your face and shoulders.  I wont say that I will transition to only using this, because honestly I can&#x27;t. I still supplement with Shea Moisture in between. But it does work for that wet and wear due.</li>
            <li> I have long 3b/3c hair.  Latina..Mexican and Central American.  I use this with another leave-in and some oil when I want bigger, loose, soft curls.  Doesn&#x27;t provide the hold I need to go dancing where I&#x27;m bound to sweat and the humidity is higher, but for every day use in the SF Bay area....it works well enough.  The price here is better than anywhere else, but still a little too pricey! I was kinda sad when they won their suit against Sally&#x27;s for their Mixed Silk version of this product. It worked great (dare I say better) and was waaay cheaper!  But I understand copyright infringement, small business deserves to make money blah blah blah...LOL! J/K....I will continue to buy this.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever! Great price!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the products I received were fake. I checked it against others I purchased. So not happy</li>
            <li> Great product for natural hair.  And a terrific price for 32oz..</li>
            <li> Defective? I&#x27;ve used mixed chicks for years I know the products well, this leave in is off-wrong, either expired, not being stored properly or not authentic. The smell is really off and smells strongly of fragrance and alcohol. Shaking the bottle to mix it (which I&#x27;ve never had to do before) helped with the smell but after sitting the same smell returns. I can&#x27;t find the expiration date-batch code which is unusual for this product. You might save a few dollars online but it&#x27;s not the same performance hence not worth the price. The purchase was from pro concepts \\&quot;amazon filled\\&quot;...This leave in is ok but does not meet brand standards and would not pass as a legit performing product... It&#x27;s probably as good as something in the $15-20 but not up to MC manufacturing- selling standards, and not worth the $42...probably defective, expired or improperly stored either way I didn&#x27;t get what I expected or a product that warrants such a high price</li>
            <li> I purchased the product from my local beauty supply store and I love it.  I am 8 months transitioning back to natural,  I don&#x27;t know 3 ab or c from 4 ab or c but this product works.  My natural hair is soft and springy,  the relaxed part is soft.  I got the best braid out in 8 months using mixed chicks leave in conditioner.  I am not mixed, I have many textures in my hair and mixed chicks worked on all of it.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I decided to buy the 33 oz because I was buying the little bottle in stores and it cost me $20. I use it almost every day so having this is perfect! A couple of things about it 1) you have to make sure it mixes will with any other products you put in your hair with it. For example, this mixes well with my moisturizer, but not my styling gel so I had to switch gels. 2) I originally bought this product for $32 and now it&#x27;s almost $50! Maybe it&#x27;s because of the holiday season, but I won&#x27;t buy it again until the price goes down.</li>
            <li> This product is now the only curly hair product I will ever use(as a styler) , It is moisturizing ,long lasting and flake free. My (3C) curls pop for up to 7 days without any touch ups. Thank goodness I&#x27;ve found this it is so awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 years and after searching long and hard and spending a small fortune on various hair products, I can finally say that I&#x27;ve found something that works for me!  I have curly/wavy indian hair and have tried many products or a combination of products but hadn&#x27;t found anything that just \\&quot;fit\\&quot; until trying Mixed Chicks Leave in Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair crunchy like many gels do and when I use the right amount, it won&#x27;t leave my hair greasy like other curl cremes have done.  But there is a fine balance on how much you should use b/c there have been times where I&#x27;ve gone overboard and my hair ends up being a bit greasy, but now I separate my hair in to 4 sections after a shower and usually 1/2 - 1 pump is good for each section.  I let air dry and get soft, frizz-free, beautiful curls/waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been struggling to find a curl product that works for you, I&#x27;d recommend giving this a try.  I prefer buying the larger size as it lasts such a long time.</li>
            <li> great leave in conditioner - does not weigh your hair down!  It is great for taming my son, daughter and my hair in Florida&#x27;s humility.</li>
            <li> This is something I will be ordering through Amazon consistently because a bottle this size costs me about $60 at the local hair store. Such a great price for a great product.</li>
            <li> This product is great for curls.  No need for gels and mouse.  It keeps my hair healthy, shiny and frizz free. I love the convenience of the pump too.</li>
            <li> I love this product.I am Caucasian with curly hair.My hair is a mixture of coarse and fine hair which creates a frizzy mess with humidity.&lt;br /&gt;This product helps with the curl pattern and does not leave my hair stiff.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it a 4 star only because it does not completely tame my frizz,but I have not found a product yet that can get close to the results that I have had with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a keeper. :)</li>
            <li> I have tried a bunch of leave in/creams/gelee/etc. products. I really like mixed chicks because when it dries my hair is not frizzy and the curls are really defined. The only problem is that it leaves my hair a little crunchy almost like a light hold gel. I prefer soft, supple,  springy curls with movement. Also you can&#x27;t mess with the curls once they are dry. If you try to fool with them too much it will become frizzy and dry looking. I will definitely use up this bottle and keep it as my fall back while I find that perfect product. I like that unlike other products all you need is the shampoo and leave in. Its 2 steps. Not 4-5 like other product lines. Keep it simple. It&#x27;s great for using when you are wearing a ponytail or want the wet look.  The smell is non-offensive to me but it is nothing to brag about either.  Its not greasy once it dries.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on pillows and stuff once it dries. Will leave one if your hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> This product provides hold and curl definition as expected. I rated it 4 stars because it tends to be drying.  I mix it with a little Moroccan oil to combat the dryness.  I think it&#x27;s a bit expensive as well, but I haven&#x27;t found another product that works as well.</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended by my hairdresser and is the best product I have found to define my curls&lt;br /&gt;and leave my hair soft without that over product crunch.&lt;br /&gt;A little expensive in the salon but a great value in this size.&lt;br /&gt;You only need to use a dime size dollop.</li>
            <li> My wife is Brazilian, and she says this is the best hair conditioning lotion she has ever used, by a wide margin.  It calms and relaxes her hair, leaving it far less tangled.  It&#x27;s not cheap... but nothing else on the market seems to be able to do quite what this product does... so it is worth it.</li>
            <li> I have very curly, frizzy  hair and I&#x27;ve tried many, many products for many years, to keep it from going wild after it dries.  This is the ONLY product that let&#x27;s me keep curls and controls friz.  On day two, I put a small amount in a spray bottle filled with water and spray my hair to tame frizzies from sleeping.  (Sleeping on a silk pillowcase also helps keep my hair calm.)  I rake through my hair with my fingers and scrunch the ends and I&#x27;m ready to go.  The Mixed Chicks does leave my hair stiff after it dries, but if I turn my head upside down and shake it a bit, it helps break up the stiffness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the full Mixed Chicks system for about six months now and I would highly recommend it to anyone with curly or mixed hair. This is the first line of products that I&#x27;ve used that follows the same system I developed myself after many years of trying all the products in the store. Shampoo, deep condition, then use leave-in conditioner. When I use the Mixed Chicks leave-in conditioner my hair it is easy to comb, curls beautifully, and doesn&#x27;t frizz as much during the day. I have an African American/ Caucasian mix of hair that has both straighter parts and frizzy parts. I do still use a cream gel designed for curly hair to keep my hair where I want it. When I use the conditioner on my girls (half my mix and half Puerto Rican) their hair looks curly instead of frizzy and is much easier to comb.</li>
            <li> This was NOT a real mixed chicks product.</li>
            <li> My hair salon recommended this to me and used it for many months. It moisturized my hair better than anything else I had used. I formerly used Pantene Pro-V but this product was much better. It helped define my curls and prevent breaking. I stopped using it when I made the connection that it was causing breakouts on my forehead and shoulders. Now I use Dove and that works almost as well. It is too bad it didn&#x27;t agree with my skin. I would definitely recommend that other &amp;#34;Mixed Chicks&amp;#34; give it a try.</li>
            <li> Mixed Chicks is bye far the best leave in for my transitioning hair. It is not sticky when dry. I keep trying other products but I always come back to mixed chicks. My ends are relaxed and my natural is growing in 4a and totally gray . I also like As I Am and Kinky Curly.</li>
            <li> This is great it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do for your hair I love it I will definitely be buying more</li>
            <li> this is the best Leave-In Conditioner that I have found for my daughter hair. the product work great for my daughter hair.</li>
            <li> Our daughter has curly blond hair that can get tangled and matted if we don&#x27;t handle it constantly.  We have found that using a generous amount of this conditioner during her tubbie and brushing her curls out with The Wet Brush (check it out) minimizes the pain of de-tangling, and leaves her hair silky smooth and smelling great.  Bonus: her hair naturally curls back up as it dries into some adorable, Shirley Temple ringlets. :)</li>
            <li> Love this product. My daughters curly hair stays put not frizzy or puffy I recommend it</li>
            <li> Have curly/frizzy hair and this stuff works GREAT!</li>
            <li> This product arrived damaged. Top pump on the top of the container was broken.</li>
            <li> I have very curly and frizzy hair that tends to puff up at the roots.  After reading all the reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I like it; it is very moisturizing, but it is too heavy and my hair ended up looking too stiff.  I have tried using less, but it didn&#x27;t control the frizz well enough.  I have read that the MEN&#x27;S version is much better, so am giving that a try next.</li>
            <li> Well I like the product but it did not do so well with the tangles and as for the sheen/shine from the product I did not get that from only this product.It was a collective amount of other products right along with the mix chick product to get the shine and vibrance and tangle frree freedom that came from three others along with mix chicks. I was told that all these things that I so desire would come from one product and that would be mix chicks.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve ever used for my hair, I have curly hair so it&#x27;s hard to find a good product without it drying my hair it&#x27;s perfect bc it conditions your hair at the same time when I wash it out my hair is so soft and smooth I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 yrs now and I absolutely love it and recommend, I have 3 girls and the two older girls have curly hair with different textures and they both use the mixed chicks and they love it As well as for my 15 month old not sure if she will have curly hair like ours but if she does I hear the children&#x27;s products are great as well</li>
            <li> I can tell a difference from this product vs other products. I can also tell a difference with the moisturizing aspect which is what i was looking for.</li>
            <li> this is probably the only leave-in conditioner i&#x27;ll ever use to get that fresh wet curly hair look, and I love that it lasts all day without my hair feeling greasy or weighed down. Product is great, customer service is even better, just an all around great deal!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good ,, not bad product ,, but not marvelous or perfect same i read ,, my opinion it&#x27;s make your hear more curly if you have a curly  hear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a mixed chick and I like to wear my hair curly. This is the best product I have found to set my curls.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from Pantene to Miss Jessie&#x27;s to Deva to Carol&#x27;s Daughters to every mousse/setting lotion I could get my hands on.  Everything left my hair dry, crunchy, and brittle with varying levels of curl.  With Mixed Chicks Leave In Conditioner, my curls are springy, shiny, soft, and last for at least 2 days without the frizz! LOVE.</li>
            <li> Great product arrived on time</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years. I saved $10 purchasing this item online. I would definitely buy it again if offered at the same price.</li>
            <li> My kids hair needs this conditioner to maintain a kept look. Only product I use on her hair since it was recommended by a hair dresser.</li>
            <li> This conditioner works wonders on my daughters hair who is mixed. We can comb it so easily after using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but for this amount of money I was expecting it to be GREAT. I thought it was going to be a special staple in my hair care regimen, but I won&#x27;t be purchasing anymore once I use up this big bottle.</li>
            <li> I have had used and bought this proudct before. This seller did package the boddle very nicely and delivery was very fast. Other than that mixed chicks is the best product I&#x27;ve ever bought for my curly hair. Leave it soft, shinny, and with beautiful tamed curls</li>
            <li> GREAT CONDITIONER. I use it in the shower, and also on dry hair to provide definition and to pick up lank curls. This is some of the best product I have ever found for curly hair. I also mix it with water and spritz my dry hair in the morning, then scrunch it for a texture refresh.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Works awesome for any type of curly hair. ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> Lowest cost+shipping price I could find anywhere online! After trying out the Trio sample package of the Mixed Chicks line (shampoo, deep conditioner, and leave-in conditioner) I fell in love with the last two items.This product line is a bit expensive and since I&#x27;m tight on money I opt to just buy the one product I couldn&#x27;t do without, the Leave-In Conditioner. You don&#x27;t have to be of mixed ethnicity to use these products and if you&#x27;re unsure you want to dish out the money I highly recommend buying the sample trio to help you make up your mind, the pouches look small but I got at least 3 uses out of each pouch.  I&#x27;m multi-racial and my hair texture is just as varied; looking at a single strand the texture ranges from coarse, medium and fine (and not necessarily in that order). My curl type is a 50/50 mix of type 2B  and type 2C (I figured out my hair type using the naturallycurly.com website).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have struggled for a long time to find a lightweight, non sticky, medium hold product that works all day long and smells at least moderately nice and the Mixed Chicks Leave-In conditioner does all of that for me. *BTW my idea of a medium hold is no frizz, curls hold their shape even after a bit of primping but stays touchable soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend looking up the Mixed Chicks video as they tell you the best ways to use the products. The way that works best for me is to apply it after I&#x27;ve taken a shower; using a microfiber towel I scrunch  most of the water out, then use a wide tooth comb to work out any tangles. T hen I apply about 2 quarter sized dollops through out my hair concentrating primarily on the mid section and the ends, scrunching as  I go, and then let it air dry. I avoid hairdryers as heat makes curly hair frizzier but in the winter I do use a diffuser simply because it&#x27;s too cold not to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every once in a while I need to retouch my hair after a really long day or after some sort of hectic activity. In those cases I just use water to redefine curls then add a bit more of the conditioner OR a bit of Herbal Essence Body Envy mousse. I&#x27;ve tried mixing the leave in conditioner with a bit of water and spritzing it on to \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; after a long day but for some reason I don&#x27;t get the same type of hold that way.  IMO this stuff smells ok but I would love love love it if it came in some delectable fruity fragrances &#x3D;Dedefine curls then add a bit more of the conditioner OR a bit of Herbal Essence Body Envy mousse. I&#x27;ve tried mixing the leave in conditioner with a bit of water and spritzing it on to \\&quot;refresh\\&quot; after a long day but for some reason I don&#x27;t get the same type of hold that way.  IMO this stuff smells ok but I would love love love it if it came in some delectable fruity fragrances &#x3D;D</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always hard to find hair products for super curly hair. either it makes it crunchy and not good to touch or else there is frizz galore. This product is a leave in conditioner but I use it as a curl creme like you are supposed to do It helps the curls and at the same time keeps the frizz down. if you use it in conjunction with a tiny bit of keratin lotion the combination is amazing. And if you buy the quart size bottle of this it will last you at east 6 months. It really is a good buy!</li>
            <li> makes my hair soft and manageable. i use it everyday. has a really nice and clean smell.  worth the price</li>
            <li> I like it feels good on hair try it, it might work for you I have strange hair lol ha</li>
            <li> The effects of the moisture for the hair are very good so I use it daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> my 15yr old daughter has been using this product since a couple of years. she absolutely loves it. it makes her look great not heavy on the curls actually defines them.</li>
            <li> I have 3b/3c hair and this product is a DREAM!!! It gives me hold without weighing my hair down or making it sticky. It smells light and gives the right amount of slick for a multitude of styles from wash and goes to braid outs. Also a few pumps goes a long way so you don&#x27;t have to continuously buy it. Although it&#x27;s on the pricier side I think it&#x27;s worth every cent !</li>
            <li> It has transformed my curly hair and life.  One product to style my hair after I have showered?  I wouldn&#x27;t have believed it before this product.  Sometimes I only get my hair wet and then reapply this product and I am all set.  Amazing.  My routine in the morning use to be (before this product) a multifaceted step process of many products.  Now, one shampoo, one conditioner and one leave in styling product.  Amazing.  If you have curly hair, slightly curly hair, wavy hair and you a looking to enhance what God gave you versus fighting your natural hair with chemicals, straighteners, heat products....this will make your hair your friend.  They have products that work equally as well when you do want to wear your hair straight.  Btw, product is good for all ethnic types-read their story.</li>
            <li> It is the best leave in conditioner and leaves your curls free of frizz, shiny, and promotes growth. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair this is a dream come true.  We have used this product for the last year. When you have hair that snarls and frizz this product will keep the hair in control all day!!!!  The price is right when you purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I cant speak for everyone but my sister has fine long beautiful hair. (African American woman) her hair was coming out bad and we thought it was her seizure medication until we stopped using this line of products an her hair immeadiately stop coming out. It was not hair breakage (broken pieces in the sink) it was strings from her root coming out every time we brushed or combed her hair. I would not recommend if you have fine hair...</li>
            <li> My daughter has very thick curly hair. This conditioner is the only one that works, holds her curl with hardly any frizz. Great product. Definitely Suggest.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, works great!</li>
            <li> Love this! I use it daily as a moisturizer and it has stopped my hair from breaking and it is growing.</li>
            <li> I used to switch curl products every few months with hugely varying results, until my salon used mixed chicks on my hair. This will define you curls better than anything else. No need to use a gel with, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caution! There is a learning curve. You can ONLY use this product with soaking wet hair. Apply in small sections, then quickly barely-rinse over it all to make it coat every strand together. Scrunch and if you want, finger twist fuzzy sections the direction you want with a tiny dab of product each. Crunch hair with a used clean, old t shirt or a microfiber or shammy upside down. NO TOWELS! Then diffuse for volume or air dry. After it dries, it will be crispy and defined, if you want it looking softer, scrunch only after it is 100% dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t get the exact results my salon can from this, but it&#x27;s darn close. I can get 4-5 day hair with this! (usually up in a bun last 3 days). The only other curl product I like is pillow soft curls by miss jessie!</li>
            <li> This is the best leave in conditioner on the market. Not greasy or heavy. Moisturizes and nourishes hair. Great for naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months with four girls using it and it&#x27;s half full still! It works wonders and makes combing out hair so much easier fresh out the shower or just damp in the morning for a fresh pony tail look</li>
            <li> I ordered this product due to prior experience with it, but also for pricing. I usually buy the smaller version at target for about 2/3 the price of this one. Ordering from Amazon, you get more for your money.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product for my 4B type hair when I want to go natural. It keeps my curls defined and shinny.</li>
            <li> Great product great for kids with mixed hair. Keeps their hair tamed and manageable.Absolutely love the product very easy to manage</li>
            <li> I get hair compliments every day and my hair is soft.</li>
            <li> This stuff changed my life. I have very curly hair and all my life i&#x27;ve worn it up in a ponytail. (since around 14, i&#x27;m 34 now). A friend of mine recommended this and so i read all the reviews and decided to give it a try. I LOVE this stuff. I wear it in my hair and i can finally wear it down, curly and without frizz. It leave my curls defined without frizz and without being hard. I used to always use GEL on my hair and it felt hard and crunchy. If you put TOO much of this it can get a little crunchy. If that happens i just use my hands to scrunch the curls and it softens right up. LOVE this stuff. Everyone&#x27;s curls are different but this did the trick for me. I usually put a leave in conditioner in my hair before using this though. I find it helps even more.</li>
            <li> If you have curly hair of any type or even wavy, this product works fantastic..I highly recommend it! Buy some and try some</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product. My hair is curly and it does wonderful job defining my curls and making my hair look hydrated</li>
            <li> My daughter has soft cork screw curls and we have found this product to be perfect for her &#x27;white girl&#x27; curls.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample of this product first, never hearing about mixed chicks products before. It took me months to even use the sample but once I did I was hooked. I loved the way that my curls looked and how they felt. They looked amazing in my opinion. Now because its winter time and cold I dont leave my hair in its naturally curly state, I blow dry it and straighten it, but I still love the way this product makes my hair feel! Now I only gave it 4 stars because of the price. But other than that I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now - originally purchased at a local beauty supply shop that is no longer in business so now ordering off Amazon.  I am of Irish descent and have very fine, very curly hair that is prone to being dry.  I love my curls, not crazy about frizz!  As I have aged I find my hair getting drier so after researching I have settled on the following magical formula for good looking hair everyday.  I get many compliments on my hair and my girlfriends cant believe it is so easy:&lt;br /&gt;1. I don&#x27;t use shampoo (unless my hair is truly dirty which is rare). I use the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method and essentially wash my hair with an inexpensive conditioner. I gently detangle with my fingers as I am rinsing - I prefer a detangler type conditioner for this reason&lt;br /&gt;2. I wrap my wet hair in an  mens tshirt.  The fabric on towels or terry cloth wraps encourage frizz!&lt;br /&gt;3. As I let my hair down, i use my fingers to untangle any further if needed.&lt;br /&gt;4. Put small amount of mixed chicks in, and spread evenly.&lt;br /&gt;5. Dry naturally or if time pressed use a defuser... but natural trying is better. I gently fluff after drying, but never ever ever run your fingers, a comb or brush  through dried hair as that introduces frizz.&lt;br /&gt;This gives me ringlets that are either soft and loose or tighter depending on how the planets align that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do sometimes add a shiner or even a curl enhancer or a volumizing gel (seriously - i have enough volume but sometimes even bigger hair is fun..haha) for &amp;#34;different looks&amp;#34; and to add drama but the above is my daily routine.</li>
            <li> Great product, I have very long, thick, and curly hair. Nothing seems to tame it as well as mixed chicks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mixed with mexican, irish, creo, and black. So my hair texture is all over the place, from curly to wavy, to course, its also pretty thick. I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last three months and i have to say it&#x27;s not yet the &#x27;holy grail&#x27; product for me yet. It does an okay job of making my curls uniform, but the moisturizing part just doesn&#x27;t cut it for my hair. However this product works really well on my mom&#x27;s hair, she&#x27;s hispanic, with wavy curly hair.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on my little mixed chick&#x27;s curly hair.  Makes combing her hair out so much easier, and it dries into perfect ringlets.  It seems expensive, but a bottle lasts nearly a year so it&#x27;s actually quite economical.</li>
            <li> Perfect for curly hair. Doesnt make your hair stiff, but holds the curls together.</li>
            <li> I love love love mixed chicks!!! I get it for my kids, their half Afro and Asian. My friend got me a sample of it in 2009 and now that&#x27;s the only hair product I  don&#x27;t mind spending money on. When people stop us when we&#x27;r out and ask how I manage their hair because they have kids that they just cant deal with their hair, I tell them about mixed chicks and how it dose not puff up as bad and the curls all curl together and it don&#x27;t feel all crunchy like moose and gel. Buy it!!! You will be glad you did and your going to remember this review and say \\&quot;hey I am glad I got this\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I love this mixed chicks conditioner. My hair feels absolutely soft and manageable after I use it. I use it for deep conditioning and also mix with water for everyday leave in conditioning. No build up from it by the end of the week.</li>
            <li> We have purchased this product before and by far it is much cheaper on Amazon. It is a great conditioner for all types of hair.</li>
            <li> It takes patience and because each person hair is different but a few tips...don&#x27;t be afraid to use alot of product...have water in the hair ....some people can comb product in, I can&#x27;t ...I comb my hair with the conditioner in and rinse...then I apply this leave-in...and shake...my curls form better...point...you gotta learn your curl pattern with this product...Talking mostly to African americans going natural and you want pretty,soft curls. Also depending on your hair, you may or not have to add water each day to freshen. Some days, I can just add product because the curl is set..</li>
            <li> Great prize for such a big bottle, normally cost $50-60</li>
            <li> Perfect product. Purchased as a gift for my mother. She lives fit this stuff. Smells amazing, conditions her curly, chilly hair very well</li>
            <li> My daughter is not mixed &amp; does not have mixed hair but she does have unmanageable curly red hair that this product works wonders with!  Have tried and tested tons of other products and none compare.  We have used Mixed Chicks for a couple of years now &amp; couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.</li>
            <li> Detangles black hair amazing doing great things.</li>
            <li> I had never tried this product before, but a friend was telling me about it &amp; thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I love it. I have wavy hair that likes to go in all directions. This product makes my hair smooth out. It&#x27;s never stiff like it&#x27;s been with other products. It really works for me.</li>
            <li> I have 2 mixed daughters, and this stuff is a godsend for their hair. Only thing that will define their curls w/o leaving their hair stiff or greasy. Thank you mixed chicks!</li>
            <li> I am not technically a mixed chick, but love this product and what it does for my unruly, sometimes frizzy curls.  No frizz, nice curls, soft hair.  And it smells nice too!</li>
            <li> Love this product works extremely well. Keeps my hair moist and the curls intact. Highly recommend worth every penny I spent</li>
            <li> This is the BEST product I have ever used on my very curly haired granddaughters.  We cleanse their hair with the deep conditioner by Mixed Chicks and finish with this conditioner.  We don&#x27;t use shampoo on their hair at all because shampoo dries their hair out and makes it frizzy.  My hairdresser says cleansing with a conditioner is acceptable. On certain occasions we do shampoo their hair, but not often.  Great great product!!!</li>
            <li> the price is right...the item arrived on time...it works great in my hair (which is naturally curly and all over the place like a lion&#x27;s mane) :)</li>
            <li> Best product on the market for curly hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and this is best leave in conditioner for me. i have curly, thick, 5 inch long coarse hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Mixed Chicks products and this combined with the deep conditioner and shampoo make my hair feel amazing!</li>
            <li> I have very long curly hair which is thin and fine. I used this product last summer and I found that it does work. It provides definition and left my hair feeling a little more thick (which is what I look for in a product). However, as I kept using it, it seemed that I needed to use a lot more to get the same results. I would use it again though. Don&#x27;t care for the cost :(</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this works great!! thanks.</li>
            <li> Best stuff I have ever used on my mixed Indian and African American hair. It is also vegan so thats a bonus.</li>
