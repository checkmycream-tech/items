            <li>So, on a whim, I purchased this Argan oil at a discount in exchange for my honest review, and the results for me were amazing.</li>
            <li>I used this on my hair overnight TWICE, and the results are amazing...  </li>
            <li>This oil is amazing.</li>
            <li>The price is amazing for the size, as you don&#x27;t need a lot of the oil per application.</li>
            <li>Works great for smoothing hair and keeping ends split free</li>
            <li>works amazing for my bi-racial childrens hair.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been three weeks in and my hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li>: I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li>Five stars for the amazing quality and price.</li>
            <li>And can honestly feel and see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>i received this product in return for an honest reciew</li>
            <li>Then after all that I spray my hair with Proganix Anti-fade weightless argon oil + UV protection which adds a nice shine to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I see my hair not as frizzy which is nice to have.</li>
            <li>Shipped in nice package.</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a scent and consistency is nice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this 5 months (give or take) and haven&#x27;t seen spectacular results.</li>
            <li>Gives my hair a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>This one make my hair so nice and shinny I can skip the shine spray .</li>
            <li>but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li>That is my own thoughts.</li>
            <li>send me this product to review it, but my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to try the InstaNatural Argan Oil to see what it could do to keep my tresses lovely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but is still nice to spray into your hand and then rub into your hair.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived fast and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li>I, honestly, don&#x27;t think I would ever want to go without it.</li>
            <li>I feel it does a nice job of protecting and conditioning my hair.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>Smells nice and not overpowering.</li>

            <li>So I have been making my own shampoo bars for some time now.</li>

            <li>I washed it out using my shampoo and the results were astounding.</li>
            <li>I liked the product but it makes my hair&lt;</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that my hair feels a lot softer and thicker because of this oil.</li>
            <li>After showering it out, my hair feels smooth, clean, and looks VERY nice!</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>

            <li>good product easy absorb</li>
            <li>Good company too, easy to work with.</li>
            <li>split ends very easily.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use,</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait to find many more uses for it!</li>
            <li>best thing about this oil is it&#x27;s natural, and it&#x27;s just oil!</li>
            <li>The oil has a mild but pleasant smell so that is nice too.</li>
            <li>It is nice that the smell is ok too.</li>
            <li>This hair oil is amazing, it leaves my hair feeling hydrated and healthy.</li>
            <li>I believe this a deep-down kind of healthy sheen.</li>
            <li>I love this product, amazing ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and is perfect for all hair types.</li>
            <li>Argan oil has become one of the most popular oils for hair restoration.</li>
            <li>My friend has finer, more controllable hair, and she liked her results as well.</li>
            <li>This product does wonderful things for my permed hair, keeping it moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny and soft Argan oil is the best period making my nails grow as well</li>
            <li>So far this is the best I have found.</li>
            <li>Great for smoothing... would like to have a better fragrance, but not bad</li>
            <li>and I have had the best shiny, healthy, and conditioned soft hair ever!  </li>
            <li>Love love love this!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good leave in oil treatment but not as good as their Pure Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>I have tried many hair oils this one is by far the best one.</li>
            <li>was provided this product for free for review, but nonetheless - my thoughts are honest and my own.</li>
            <li>(Hot Tools makes a great one).  </li>
            <li>Oil is very light yet nourishing for damaged hair&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t squirt a huge amount out -- which is great because then it won&#x27;t leave my hair full of grease.  </li>
            <li>Nice pump bottle makes it easy to dispense the oil&lt;</li>
            <li>I liked that the elixir came with a pump so it was easy to get out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li>That really helped with dandruff and keeping her looking more beautiful.  </li>
            <li>The product is easy to use and absorbs into the hair nicely.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product; I love it!</li>
            <li>It is also nice as a oil based rinse out conditioner or overnight hair and scalp treatment for fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li>It has all my favorite oils I use for my skin care as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK but not working as I hoped.  </li>
            <li>Love using argan oil products in my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>glad i did becuz</li>

            <li>This is my favorite argan oil.</li>
            <li>I bought this item to help my hair and also go more organic with my hair and skin products.</li>
            <li>So ok product</li>
            <li>so I have not been able to get it trimmed in 8 months and</li>
            <li>Most of them either made my hair my hair greasy or didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair at all or &amp;#34;stiffed&amp;#34; it out.</li>
            <li>Just Love this oil blend.  </li>
            <li>I always forget to do the deep conditioning treatment but am so happy when I do!  </li>

            <li>Either way, I&#x27;m rating it as it&#x27;s okay, since it didn&#x27;t make anything really better</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>

            <li>have used this product for both the minimum amount of time (10mins) and the max (overnight) and find It works best for me when I leave it in overnight a couple nights a week and a smaller amount of time the rest of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this oil</li>
            <li>This is better for a hair night treatment.  </li>

            <li>&amp; my hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li>The salon told me the stylist filling in for her had many years experience</li>
            <li>Now I just got most of the severe damage cut off.  </li>
            <li>did a lot of research looking for a healthy treatment for my hair.</li>

            <li>The smell of this product can be way better.</li>
            <li>I love using this in my hair before a bath.</li>
            <li>So every week I add this to my hair and sit in the tub for 20 mins while it works its magic.</li>
            <li>My arsenal is growing and of course I will add InstaNatural Argan Oil  Hair Treatment to my top 5.</li>
            <li>And what&#x27;s not to love about no added chemicals?  </li>
            <li>I used for a week and noticed my hair was softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since using this product my hair is much more manageable, and in better condition.  </li>
            <li>After reading the backs of them, they have just about as many chemicals in them as the hair dye</li>
            <li>I love that your hair don&#x27;t feel oily</li>
            <li>LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I use about a 1/2 a pump on my hair, any more than that</li>

            <li>I love, love, love Argan oil and it loves my hair, whoever gets this will be just as in love as i am</li>
            <li>, I just wish it weren&#x27;t $20, but it is definitely the best product I have found.</li>
            <li>I love using Argan Oil in my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair felt more moisturized and had more volume.</li>
            <li>And was able to go 4 days begone needing to this time.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>Love that it was on a promotion for $1.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shinier, softer, more healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Something I&#x27;d invest in after we run out for sure.</li>
            <li>I agreed to write my honest opinion in return for getting this product free</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it has a pump dispenser</li>
            <li>Love this argan oil</li>
            <li>I will stick with that brand for sure.</li>
            <li>Your product can be used for so many areas, have to admit I rub it on elbows, hands, feet, legs</li>
            <li>Just want  to say Thank You  for such wonderful products.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay by me.</li>
            <li>I am glad to have recieved this product to review.</li>
            <li>Love this oil..</li>
            <li>Love the oil :) it makes my hair so soft and had a beautiful shine</li>
            <li>After application (if using as a leave in conditioner) it will feel like it has a protective barrier over each and every strand, which makes perfect when using your blow dryer and/or flat iron.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week, and it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>Pure argan oil does not have a pleasant smell, but that does not bother me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sooo rich!</li>
            <li>Just let it soak on your hands for 5minutes, than wash off with a mild soap and warm water.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>I notice that there is no smell in this product which makes it easy to add to your favorite conditioners or leave-ins for the added benefit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this on my cuticles and it prevents them from drying and tearing at the sides of my nails; it&#x27;s really wonderful for dry skin</li>
            <li>NICE BIG SICE AND GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li>Smells great and makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>Drama aside, this product has truly been life changing for me, as it has been the best moisturizing agent that has worked wonders for my skin and my dry and brittle hair!</li>
            <li>excellent for very dry hair.</li>
            <li>Really becoming a fan of InstaNatural.  </li>
            <li>So far this is a great product</li>
            <li>I love argon oil and this is even better having such great ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>Finally, to make sure every inch of me is beautiful</li>
            <li>Great natural product, I use it overnight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li>I received the products fast and a fair amount for the money.</li>
            <li>So my technique is fairly practiced and I don&#x27;t feel I am adding too much.</li>
            <li>Smells good and really makes a difference in your hairs look and texture</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft and styled very nicely.</li>
            <li>So I was more than excited to try this out.</li>
            <li>but I swear it&#x27;s just as good, and maybe even more effective, than some of the other treatments costing a lot more.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t been breaking off as easily as before, resulting in fewer split ends, almost none at all.</li>
            <li>Hair can easily go an the greasy side if you are not watchful.</li>
            <li>I am a happy woman, who finally embraced her hair with love.</li>
            <li>I like that the bottle has a pump so easy to use</li>
            <li>It does come out easily with the shampoo, and does not leave my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair strong and strength</li>
            <li>Just good natural ingredients :)</li>
            <li>The product has a strong sunflower seed smell.</li>
            <li>wear in conditioner is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>I have used other Argan Oils and this seems very nice!</li>
            <li>It says this is leave in conditioner, and maybe for someone that has dry or damaged hair or kid that gets tangles easily, this would be perfect for you, but my hair is already oily so putting it on dry first works perfect for me!!</li>
            <li>It has a sweet, lovely, fruity scent.</li>
            <li>I try not to get it too close to my roots as I have fine hair</li>
            <li>But it works fine on the frizzy/curly hair without adding the greasiness .</li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;I have extremely fine and thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>It works super well!</li>
            <li>I have been using Argan Oil for years and loved the way this product has my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>but what I love more is when I find a new product to love.</li>
            <li>Overall, a very nice and easy to use product.</li>
            <li>Super excited to find one to use now!  </li>
            <li>have always been a huge fan of oil treatments.  </li>
            <li>By morning it had soaked in and my hair was really a nice texture and very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>a great oil for your hair especially if yu have a try scalp</li>
            <li>Make your hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li>I figured this was worth a shot and was pleased to get a sample to review.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel comfortable applying it.</li>
            <li>This Argan oil hair treatment is light, non greasy.</li>
            <li>I get FABULOUS results.</li>
            <li>I think it would be fabulous for someone with thicker, dryer hair.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything spectacular.</li>
            <li>The ingredients scream out great product, but overall I didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes and leaves my hair smooth, and doesn&#x27;t leave residue.</li>
            <li>A great product with loads of essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;**Product</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny,  frizz free</li>
            <li>This was a free sample product for review</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly and spreads evenly.  </li>
            <li>The directions mention rubbing a drop or two between your hands/palms then smooth or scrunch into your hair.  </li>
            <li>washed it out with the same conditioner and my hair felt great.</li>
            <li>I received this for free to review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I started with 1 pump, rubbed through my hands and distributed lightly throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>That’s a great improvement from the hair food we were using that would only work for about two to three days.  </li>
            <li>We both had great results even though we both have very different kinds of hair.  </li>
            <li>Light oil.</li>
            <li>I tried a lot of stuff that made my hair feel great but only for a day or for a week</li>
            <li>Great deep conditioning treatment!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample to evaluate, and liked the oil so much that I have just purchased another bottle.</li>
            <li>The seller sent me a free sample.  </li>
            <li>Got it for free...</li>
            <li>I have been on the lookout for a conditioner that&#x27;s all nature and free of the yucky stuff.</li>
            <li>It also is light</li>
            <li>Love the product, but what a cheap container, the bottle top was lose and no matter how much effort you put to make it tighter</li>
            <li>My hair is healthier and looking better- more shinny and much softer.</li>
            <li>This should last me for a good while and will purchase more once this is gone.</li>

            <li>I love this oil.., my hair is natural locs and I&#x27;ve had it on for  2yrs, this oil gives it an amazing shine.my hair stays full and looks rich every day .</li>
            <li>This may be too much for fine hair, and what may work better for fine hair is a keratin mask treatment.</li>
            <li>I am a strong user of oils and the pure form the better for me to try out.</li>
            <li>It is great to put on hair too smooth after blow dry or at night before bed for overnight treatment, then shampoo out in morning.the</li>

            <li>Your hair is softer, more manageable and shine restored after the first overnight treatment.</li>
            <li>I am noticing significantly fewer split ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When she mentions &amp;#34;hair loss,&amp;#34; she&#x27;s referring to a significant permanent hair loss that she had while in college</li>
            <li>far, I have been very pleased with InstaNatural&#x27;s product line, and the Hair elixir is no exception.</li>
            <li>So excited to have this.</li>
            <li>Does a great job taming my dry summer hair.</li>
            <li>this product and Argan oil treatment is great on hair that is out of control with frizzy, dry, split ends, and damaged from chemical overload.  </li>
            <li>marvelous oil deep nourish made my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>, I have try different brands and so far this is the best thing I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>The Argan Oil Hair Treatment works great if you have a dry scalp as well.</li>
            <li>Amazing natural product!  </li>
            <li>I use lots of beauty products this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>I have used pure Argan oil and that works a lot better for my hair then this stuff.</li>
            <li>I find it to work better than pure argan oil.</li>
            <li>so needs special care.  </li>
            <li>Instanatural Argan has great reviews so I splurged and spent the $20 for 4 oz.</li>
            <li>Then I had tons of hair products that made it look great, but you gotta understand that pomade and gel are pretty much entirely made up of chemicals.</li>
            <li>it feels nice and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Overall  its a good product.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a good size so it should last awhile.</li>
            <li>Is this a good enough reason to return it?  </li>
            <li>and it looked healthy with so much shine.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>With all the hair products that are out there you just never know what is good and what actually works.</li>
            <li>This does not have a scent but the benefits out weigh the need for something sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>gave it to her because I know that she sometimes applies heat to her hair, but yet wants to maintain healthy</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers</li>
            <li>Makes it nice and soft.</li>
            <li>it has a nice light scent and makes your hair and ends especially soft and shiny, I put it on my hair before beach day to protect then put in braid and washed out after hair was very manageable and had lots of body.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair nice, soft and shiny but nothing to write home to mom about.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too thick, not too liquid - I find it the perfect viscosity for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall, good product.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad product</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel soft and it looks very healthy and has a great shine without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>Just by putting it on my ends look more healthy and I really love that, if that&#x27;s just putting it right now, Imagine what it can do a long term.</li>
            <li>Amazing product if you are looking for a super soft hair.</li>
            <li>I like everything about this product except the smell, but considering how wonderful this product works, it is something can be looked past!</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it if you need to make your hair more manageable and keep it from becoming a hot mess!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair moisturized and calm but requires a lot more dosage than the Pure Argan Oil.</li>
            <li>I didn’t experience any rashes or allergic reactions which I’ve experienced with other hair treatments I’ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love to use shea butter  on my  skin and for deep conditioning masks, but have never been able to use it in my hair without my hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li>Mild smell.</li>
            <li>The smell is mild and it absorbs rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Everything shipped and arrived as quickly as promised.  </li>
            <li>This particular brand and product is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>of course my lenght has improved tremendously too.</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair SUPER shiny without looking oily at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an EXCELLENT elixer, and I probably will never go back to using regular argan oil!</li>
            <li>Although this cost more than my last, I like it a lot better.  </li>
            <li>, the Agran Oil has done it&#x27;s magic, and my hair is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>But because it IS oil, you have to make sure you do a decent job at washing it out.</li>
            <li>I have straight Asian hair that tends to get a lot of fly aways and breakage underneath from wearing ponytails.  </li>
            <li>I recieved this for free for giving my honest feedback, and I would reccommend this to anyone that wants soft, silky, shiney hair!</li>
            <li>I love argan oil hair products and if you&#x27;ve never tried them, I highly recommend it, espeically InstaNatural brand.</li>
            <li>The best part is I now use this on my young daughter&#x27;s super curly hair instead of expensive products that I don&#x27;t feel good about.  </li>
            <li>The product needs to be dabbed first, then lightly massaged onto the hair (I do this by rolling/</li>
            <li>this bottle goes a long way and that makes it a good value</li>
            <li>I should treat my hair good whether it is long or short.&lt;br</li>
            <li>was very lucky to be able to try for small fee and my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>I gave the Argan Oil for Hair treatment &amp; Elixir Serum a 5 star rating because in the week that I have been using it I have been bombarded with compliments about the softness and new healthy feel of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Another great place to use this on on the tips through half way up the shaft.</li>
            <li>My hair is softer and less fly away.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m not sorry I did try!</li>
            <li>The first thing i noticed about the Argan Oil was the smell, Oh my god!</li>
            <li>I love how the ingredients are natural  and that I recognize them all!  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is meant to!</li>
            <li>I highly recommended it!!!</li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels so much healthier!!</li>
            <li>I love that it is all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li>This is perfect for my dry, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>It looks healthy and is super soft.</li>
            <li>A pure unadulterated &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34; for my tresses.</li>
            <li>~~ Quick Quote: A pure and all-natural product that leaves hair looking and feeling healthier! ~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I love how soft and bouncy my hair is with this.</li>
            <li>She is a big fan of Argan Oil for her hair and was thrilled that this product came with a spray pump for easier application.</li>
            <li>I intend to keep using it to give my hair a more natural look and feel, as well as conditioning it.</li>
            <li>and I just tried it today and my hair feels soft and looks 80% better ..</li>
            <li>I love the way my hair is so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I have been using the Insta Natural Argan Oil Hair Treatment for almost 3 weeks now and the directions say you can use it for a ten-minute, two-hour or overnight hair repair treatment.</li>
            <li>And, like I said, after about almost 3 weeks of use, not everyday, my hair does feel softer, silkier and definitely more manageable.</li>
            <li>The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li>The Natural ingredients in it also made me feel comfortable to apply it on my daughters hair for a tangle free brush and shine.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try with that pledge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I would like to think that I am taking care of my hair, but I can honestly say, now that I am wearing a short hair style</li>
            <li>well worth it</li>

            <li>So, far, I love it.</li>
            <li>Used to be nice when i was younger.</li>
            <li>For me however, I prefer having an oil with a nice aromatic smell and for that reason only I have knocked one star.   </li>
            <li>LOVE natural products..</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, so I love to use products that can enhance my curls, or moisturize and nourish my hair in the kindest way.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>Love it, it makes my hair shiny, soft and no frizzys.</li>
            <li>They were kind enough to send me a bottle of Argan Oil Hair Treatment to try out and review for the Beauty Diva blog.</li>
            <li>The following is her honest feedback:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a distinct smell to it, so it won&#x27;t bother you while you&#x27;re going about your day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple different oils and they help make my hair look nice and shiny, but I feel like THIS oil really penetrates into my hair and really makes it healthy.</li>
            <li>I love Argan Oil because my hair is very dry and frizzy, I put it on right after I wash my hair so it can add more conditioning to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have tried more than my fair share of these types of product and this is right on part with some of the much more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>and if you&#x27;re looking for something easy to use for your hair, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The first one I tried out is the InstaNatural 100% Pure Argan Oil which I love, the next one I tried out is the InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Moroccan Rose Water.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item based on the positive reviews and they were right!</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve said before in many other reviews, I am always looking for products that make my hair healthier and look better.</li>
            <li>I bought this hair treatment because I was already familiar with most of the essential oils used in this product.</li>
            <li>I think it does a really nice job as a heat protectant before I use my flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I could see a difference right away.</li>
            <li>My comb glided right through my hair.</li>
            <li>.Excellent ,the right combination of oils</li>
            <li>I put it on my in my hair right after I am done swimming, and by the time I am home from the pool</li>
            <li>And sometimes I&#x27;ll put some in right before bed to let my hair soak it up.</li>
            <li>I opted to dive right in and do an overnight treatment on my hair.</li>
            <li>if you do use it for this purpose I would recommend applying right after a shower.</li>
            <li>It is a new love of mine, makes my hair soft, shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>It may just the combination of oils, or maybe I&#x27;m used to a scented product that covers up their true smell, but I didn&#x27;t love snuggling up to him when this was recently applied.</li>
            <li>MY HAIR LOOK MORE SMOOTH AND NOT TOO DRY.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several different products and so far this is the best one I have used.</li>
            <li>The knots in her hair after sleep have gone down to almost nothing which makes both our mornings much more peaceful. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Argan Oil Hair Treatment has been such relief to my split ends, my fly away hair that&#x27;s stands on end due to static and my dry itchy scalp, and who doesn&#x27;t enjoy silky smooth hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair was always dull, but now it has a nice healthy glossy look.</li>
            <li>I use this baby, blow dry and get amazing results.  </li>
            <li>I find the scent very mild, in fact I don&#x27;t really recall any particular scent.</li>
            <li>Though I like the fact that this product has so many natural ingredients, I really find that it leaves my hair feeling oily.</li>
            <li>I loved how this elixir worked especially for my daughter’s natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I have over the years tried almost everything available, plus I have made a few of my own.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have a single product that is an oil treatment, frizz reducer, or thermal protectant for you hair depending on how you use it.</li>
            <li>It soaks in within about 10-15 minutes for a non-greasy feel and until I wash my hair, it&#x27;s smooth, soft and my curls stay defined without the need of gel!</li>
            <li>Makes your hair feel smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>This product has changed my hair from ordinary to awesome, it makes it really shinny and soft and it just looks fuller.  </li>
            <li>It used to be a pure mixture of oils that were incredibly useful on hair and nails.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this product has been amazing for my hair!</li>
            <li>It seems to strengthen your hair at the first use.</li>
            <li>I love this actually, I leave it in my hair for about an hour or so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am excited to try other products from this company :-)</li>
            <li>My hair feels healthy and not so coarse anymore.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>In fact, when I run out of my current supply, I will probably be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Notice softer hair within the first week.</li>
            <li>This bottle is probably going to get used up fast!</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it&#x27;s not for us.</li>
            <li>After my first order of these products I saw this</li>
            <li>Probably ok if you rinse it off shortly after application.</li>
            <li>After reviewing this product before buying, I would like to say first-</li>
            <li>I have used it as directed, not for the EXACT times it says you can use it for treatment...</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start telling you why I like this company, all their products have natural ingredients also their products are cruelty free.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>I like to dampen my hair first, then apply it.</li>
            <li>By the way, I am able to use all of their products together which is also a big bonus.</li>
            <li>While it did not perform miracles and give her straight and shiny hair, it did make her curls behave, and kept the frizz at bay- even with humidity!</li>
            <li>I recently discovered argan oil for hair and fell in love with it immediately.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this product!</li>
            <li>My hair thanks you!</li>
            <li>I even love how it looks the same day I showered (unheard of!).  </li>
            <li>By the third week I was able to brush it and style it almost the way I used to.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s most likely 90% sunflower oil...10% the rest.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>but it actually makes it more brittle.</li>
            <li>I believe that the name of the product (&amp;#34;Argan Oil&amp;#34;) is misleading as it should be named sunflower seed oil.</li>
            <li>I am sure, If I did not use this product, my hair fall would have been rapid as it is since last 2-3 years.</li>
            <li>and it never fails to pamper my skin, hair and nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Treatment was exactly that..</li>
            <li>My wife was interested in trying argan oil, so when I was offered an opportunity to try some, I got a bottle for her to use.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or you will need to wash your hair again!  </li>
            <li>My first time to love such a product</li>
            <li>I also started to get pretty itchy after a day.</li>
            <li>This Argan Oil Hair Treatment has a rich blend of oils that help make up this super power that will tame your hair and make it shiny and more</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for anyone who needs a a great hair treatment for their dry hair because I have only used it twice</li>
            <li>The pump dispenses a modest amount so you can easily decide how much you want without a handful of oil to deal with.  </li>
            <li>Overall I do recommend this product, it give me fantastic results and the bottle is huge comparing how much you really use.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li>none of my other products were damaged because the glass bottle is in a nice cardboard box.</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love using this for days after flat ironing our hair.</li>
            <li>I also love it as a heat protectant and my hair looks silkier after a flat iron.</li>
            <li>The original order&#x27;s ingredients were six natural oils.</li>
            <li>A little drop is good to rub into the hair gently.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I have seen a positive difference in her hair.</li>
            <li>Okay, so I have been watching the Argan Oil thing for a long time.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it as a hot iron oil, as it&#x27;s very oily.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve pretty much tried everything that was out there.</li>
            <li>I recieved this product for review and have been very pleased with my results after a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend using it in your hair right after you go swimming.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to be without it so long! :)</li>
            <li>Not only is it regular argan oil it also has jojoba oil, AND coconut oil, along with tons of other awesome ingredients.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and washed out with regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really feel like it made too much of a difference even after consistent use, so</li>
            <li>It has kept my dry frizzy hair smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li>On the back side it states the ingredients and list : Sunflower oil as the primary and first ingredient.</li>
            <li>It leans towards dry rather than oily but is fairly healthy in all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the first application my hair was shiny and smooth immediately, but over the weeks of continuous use it has brought life back to my hair.  </li>
            <li>My nails and dry cuticles are healed, nails are healthy grow out,</li>
            <li>I then took a bath in the morning and my hair was super soft, no frizz, and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I was also able to use this product as a heat protectant when I decided to flat-iron and blow dry my hair after washing.</li>
            <li>One pump is the perfect amount for my long thick hair.  </li>
            <li>The product is light and does not weight my hair down and my hair feel so smooth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for soft shiny hair, and it will save you the trouble of mixing multiple oils, the perfect blend is made for you!</li>
            <li>Natural Argan oil has a raw, green and nutty aroma, but what is so great about this type of oil is that the scent disappears minutes after being on your skin or hair as true Argan oil absorbs very quickly and without that</li>
            <li>I just use one drop on my fine chin-level hair and that is enough.</li>
            <li>For the first week the main difference I noticed was it was easier to get a comb through my hair</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin and use it mostly on my face and hands, and sometimes on my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see much improvement</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>and you can&#x27;t apply too much</li>
            <li>haha).  </li>
            <li>Makes hair very shiny, moisturized and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is left silky, shiny, and smooth.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like it because too oily after put it on.</li>
            <li>I really like this hair treatment.</li>
            <li>So I put this on and really focused on the ends</li>
            <li>and I can really say it added lots of moisture and sheen.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really getting into oils now</li>
            <li>I did not feel much a difference in this oil mix than the organic coconut oil</li>
            <li>thanks you.</li>
            <li>Definitely did not make hair smooth or silky.  </li>
            <li>It has a ton of uses which makes it very multi-purpose.  </li>
            <li>The easiest way we found to work this oil through our hair is making sure our hair was wet before we put the oil in it.</li>
            <li>and I have to really work at getting it straight</li>
            <li>The differences don&#x27;t show up very well on my curly hair, so it&#x27;s always to my advantage to leave it</li>
            <li>I tried it and it really does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This oil really works on my gray hair.  </li>
            <li>It really helps your hair look</li>
            <li>/&gt;Daily I spritz some of the oil on my hair comb, and work it through my hair in the morning while I&#x27;m getting ready.</li>
            <li>I also really like it as a frizz remover and detangler for my hair.</li>
            <li>I also really like it as a frizz remover and detangler for my hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Wonderful hair product, my hair feels like silk, really, I&#x27;m always telling everyone, touch my hair!&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so much that I find myself using this as a skin moisturizer as well.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels healthier and it is so much easier to manage.  </li>
            <li>I rub in a couple drops of this before showering to protect it from drying out, and then add another drop along with a drop of straightening serum after getting out, before combing it straight</li>
            <li>while blow-drying it, then using a straight iron.</li>
            <li>My hair felt so smooth after I applied it and left it on overnight.</li>
            <li>My hair refuses to absorb this oil and leaves me looking very greasy.</li>
            <li>Absolutely can not wear it when going out.</li>
            <li>elixir kept her scalp from drying out for a whole week.  </li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>Ok so I must&#x27;ve spent over a hundred dollars on hair products ranking from shampoo and conditioners to pomades and gel.</li>
            <li>my hair  and my scalp felt very refreshed.</li>
            <li>It was Ok, but I expected something else.</li>
            <li>I observed a distinct difference in the overall appearance of my hair, and just how much this fabulous product restored my strands, and renewed my faith in yet another natural hair product.</li>
            <li>One recommendation is don&#x27;t put too much on your palms when putting this in your hair after shower or your hair will look really greasy in the morning .</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much softer.</li>
            <li>My hair is much softer, shiny and healthier than ever.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the sample, because I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will be reordering.  </li>
            <li>It has a gentle scent, almost a nutty scent, not woodsy and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I used it 10mins before washing my hair and it instantly gives it a smooth feel.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>If you put on after, your hair would be really greasy.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make much difference to my hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice much of an argan oil scent</li>
            <li>My hair is so much easier to style now.</li>
            <li>I put this in my hair and left it in about 45 minutes while I did some light house cleaning.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so much healthier and nourished.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would be more of a serum, but it&#x27;s more of a thin oil</li>
            <li>i tried it only one time and it made my hair look soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love the combo of several natural oils blended</li>
            <li>After I dried it, I did notice my hair had a nice shine to it</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m define rely going to buy some of this because my hair is now alive!!!</li>
            <li>I have a new great product to share with you for your hair, especially if you have dry or damaged hair from natural causes or from years of using hair dryers and curling irons along with all of those type of hair tools.</li>
            <li>all natural combination of oils absorb right into your hair with no oily residue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very environmental friendly because it&#x27;s glass, but at the same time if u accidental drop it there goes your product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since my hair is really thick and long, I have to use more pumps of this stuff than most people most likely have to, so I find I&#x27;m going through it quicker.</li>
            <li>I recently changed all of my hair products over from a high end brand that I have used for years to more natural products.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is clean and professional and the function of the product and how to use it are clearly printed on the label.</li>
            <li>and I have better results with it than other oils.</li>
            <li>you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful</li>
            <li>Now it is just a very standard silicone hair serum with a drop of the original oils in it.</li>
            <li>I place a little bit of it in a glass bowl and heat it up before applying it, wash my hair first and towel dry it, smooth on a large amount making sure I cover every strand and the scalp, cover my head with a shower cap and sleep with it on overnight.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels glossy, slick, smooth, flow-y, frizz free, WITHOUT looking greasy if I use the correct method of application.</li>
            <li>This Argan Oil is one of the products I really like, I would definitely buy it full price giving its size.</li>
            <li>Great for all hair types, a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li>I am hoping continual use will really keep the frizz down as the weather gets more humid.</li>
            <li>It really helps my dry hair feel smooth and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I found this treatment conditions my hair nicely but easily even can make it too greasy.</li>
            <li>I LOVE how it has helped my hair become much smoother and less tangible.  </li>
            <li>feels smooth all day long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never skip that first step as it makes my hair soft, manageable, and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Use it like a hot oil treatment and your hair feels soft and silky for days.  </li>
            <li>I will normally do this on the weekend when I can really give it time to soak in and do</li>
            <li>I was first hesitant to put oil directly onto my scalp,</li>
            <li>With all natural ingredients and a reasonable price, I have no problems recommending this product!</li>
            <li>Working from the top down to the end of our hair.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of issues with breakage and most conditioners just weigh my curls down without helping with the breakage issue at all.</li>
            <li>It helps to keep the frizz down on my hair and make it look healthy.</li>
            <li>My hair has new life!</li>
            <li>and I feel like I can make this mix in a diy project and have more of it for less.</li>
            <li>: Less is more.</li>
            <li>The frizziness it still there, less noticeable but still there, maybe after I use it for one week it would be better.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair with a black soap shampoo, put on my conditioner, and put this on top for a sealer.</li>
            <li>Typically I put the oil in, put my hair in a bun on the top of my head and let it sit for a minimum of 2 hours before I go up and shampoo it</li>
            <li>As I am getting older those hair pulled out while brushing started bothering me.</li>
            <li>I want to try another product with a better scent, but if I have to come back to this one, I will definitely update.</li>
            <li>It is not the brand, as I have reviewed Insta Natural products in the past and have considered them to be a very reputable company.  </li>
            <li>I use it mainly overnight and wash/rinse out in the morning.</li>
            <li>Overall this product has delivered tremendously as a strengthener and restoring shine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been having my hair double processed for many years without ever experiencing dryness or damage until my regular stylist went on maternity leave.</li>
            <li>It smells decent.</li>
            <li>I got to try the whole bunch of Insta Natural products with a very generous promotion.</li>
            <li>I use it daily but mostly on Friday night as a deep oil treatment.  </li>
            <li>This is a particularly oily serum.</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy curly hair and live in a high humidity climate.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling very soft!</li>
            <li>I have the most curly, wiry mess of a beard in the world, and this seems to help somewhat.</li>
            <li>have naturally thick, wavy hair, that is not easy to deal with on the best of days.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It works as a fantastic massage oil for dry skin!</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair more shiny in a good way &amp; its not near as dry &amp; dull looking.</li>
            <li>First off, I like the easy pump top, but be careful not to pump too hard cause</li>
            <li>I have ALWAYS had soft hair until I reached a certain age.</li>
            <li>A little is all you need to get your hair more manageable.</li>
            <li>I have long hair, in good condition, a little course in texture.</li>
            <li>Not so bad and not so great!</li>
            <li>and it tames my frizz so much that I can go with my natural hair now.</li>
            <li>This hair treatment left my hair and scalp feeling moisturized and fresh.</li>
            <li>I normally use a smoothing serum after straightening too, but it was not needed.</li>
            <li>Now, the next day after my treatment, my hair was still as shiny, not weighed or greasy looking, just a healthy state that I have not seen in a long time.    </li>
            <li>No free bottle or discount for this review. :)</li>
            <li>This product helped while the temperature and humidity were at normal levels in my house...</li>
            <li>I just washed like normal and when I got out of the shower my hair felt moisturized and not oily.</li>
            <li>I may continue to try this a few more times before I decide if it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Yay&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Nay&amp;#34; product -</li>
            <li>I put about four pumps for my long hair full off the oil in my hands and massage it on my scalp and towards the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make it feel greasy or weighed down just soft, shiny and more manageable.</li>
            <li>I have always kind of balked at using oil on my hair as I have fine thin hair and was concerned it would make my hair oily or flat.  </li>
            <li>I have super thick and frizzy hair, so by the next morning when I&#x27;m ready to brush my hair, my hair ends up with 1,000x more volume</li>
            <li>I typically end up with some light frizzes all over my head, but this helps relax those and my hair feels much healthier.</li>
            <li>It did a nice job of moisturizing my rough dry hands too.</li>
            <li>After only using it once it made a difference, now when I have used it a few times, I really love it!</li>
            <li>weighed my hair down and not as good as other argan oil products i have tried on amazon...</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something new for their hair care regime.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ll pick up a new &#x60;treatment&#x27; and test it out.</li>
            <li>Argan oil is sure number one moisturizer for rough and coarse hair.</li>
            <li>I have super dry ones.</li>
            <li>I have super dry hair</li>
            <li>I apply the Insta Natural Argan oil to the palm of my hand and then rub my hands together and then smooth it across my hair, being careful to keep the style.  </li>
            <li>This oil  quality is good for the hair; the only negative issue is I received the product with leakage</li>
            <li>This product also smells good, isn&#x27;t as greasy as other products I&#x27;ve used in the past, and you get more for less money.  </li>
            <li>I like the applicator part, because it is very sensitive</li>
            <li>and these product makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li>This argan oil hair treatment helps keep my gray hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I am still using this product, so I still have a bit left to go before I get the full bottle final results, but so far I am very pleased!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have pretty natural curls, they just need some help calming down the frizz in 60% humidity or higher!</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it washed out easily and didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down afterwards because it seems so oily.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair really soft!</li>
            <li>Just a small amount and my hair looks better without looking greasy.</li>
            <li>So I suggest that you start of small and if you need to add more then do so</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft after using this!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, not sure it is doing any &#x27;growing&#x27; or not.</li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>It was soft to the feel and even looked softer!</li>
            <li>Thank you for making such a much needed product!</li>
            <li>This oil is light and does not weigh the hair down or leave a product build up.</li>
            <li>My hair just looks amazing when i use it, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Oddly enough I have added it to other things to use on my skin because of the many oils in it and it makes NY skin feel soft.</li>
            <li>My hair felt soft and luxurious, I live argan oil</li>
            <li>Have only had time to use this once, I have very curly hair,which tends to be dry,especially the last 6 inches of the length, worked this in,put on a shower cap to contain my body heat, left it on for 2 or 3 hours while I did some chores around the house, washed and conditioned like normal, was very pleased, soft silky hair that I didn&#x27;t have to yank a comb through, but my curls where there and not weighed down or greasy.</li>
            <li>This huge bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li>(For a few months now) My hairdresser says that my hair has never been healthier, and if I forget I can easily tell a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I am thinking of using it on my cuticles next to see if I can get the dry looking skin around my fingernails to go back to being smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li>I am thinking of using it on my cuticles next to see if I can get the dry looking skin around my fingernails to go back to being smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, has gotten thicker, and grew much more than usual in the time I&#x27;ve been using the product.</li>
            <li>I am an Indian born with very fine, silky, soft, shiny black hair but lost that lovely texture at puberty (and also because of harsh shampoo and rough handling).</li>
            <li>I use it all over my body and the combination of natural, high-quality oils leave my skin feeling silky and soft!  </li>
            <li>and it still feels like my 6 year old granddaughters soft and silky hair!</li>
            <li>Instanaturals Argan oil hair treatment rivals much more expensive products out there, and works just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li>I have fine color processed hair and it is not too heavy for me.</li>
            <li>so it can get a reasonable amount &#x27;on the right place&#x27; and not &#x27;squirt it off in any odd direction&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I used this treatment on my hair for about 5 min and went into the shower and left it on a little longer, then I poured water over my hair and used my shampoo on top of it.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty thin hair and without proper treatment, my hair gets tangled very easy.</li>
            <li>It weighs down my super fine hair and makes it look greasy (even when I apply just a little), but it might be because this product contains a variety of oils.</li>
            <li>your cuticles are soft, and easily ready to push back!  </li>
            <li>have long (mid-back length), fine hair with dry, damaged ends and oily roots.</li>
            <li>This combines not only the much buzzed about Argan oil, but also jojoba and coconut to leave you with lush, shiny&#x27; hydrated hair that you&#x27;ll want to run your fingers through all</li>
            <li>hair feels soft and shiny, yet not oily.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I put this oil in my hair directly after shampooing, conditioning, and towel drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>Not recommend people with sensitive skin, didn&#x27;t like the smell of the treatment once on my hair</li>
            <li>It leaves hair soft and it adds a lot of shine.</li>
            <li>It made my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It made my hair so soft, silky and manageable.  </li>
            <li>and it was soft as silk.</li>
            <li>The treatment is a mix of natural oils that condition the hair and add shine.</li>
            <li>When I do that my hair feels soft and looks shiny.</li>
            <li>My beard is now soft as a kitten, dense as the core of a dying star, and glows with the fury of a thousand suns.  </li>
            <li>I rubbed a generous quarter sized amount from ends to roots and left it on for 2 whole days as a treatment</li>
            <li>My hair was and still is soft and shiny even the day after.    </li>
            <li>I used thus on my hair before i washed my hair and my hair feels so soft and looks shiny.</li>
            <li>leaves hair soft and with shine.</li>
            <li>so you can control how much product you actually use.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural.  </li>
            <li>Made my hair very greasy/static-y with only one pump.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural / afro</li>
            <li>and this keep it soft and shiny</li>
            <li>And once a week I put it in my hair before going to bed and my hair is conditioned for at least 2 more washings.</li>
            <li>my hair comes out soft and with shine.</li>
            <li>It think the key is to figure out how much works for your hair type.</li>

            <li>it keeps both my hair and my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I think I just do not personally like the whole oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t happen often as I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Naturally that wrecks havoc on my hair.</li>
            <li>I was contacted by InstaNatural to try out some of their natural beauty products.</li>

            <li>It makes my hair soft and manageable without a greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>I’ve been hearing about Argan Oil as a solution to all kinds of beauty problems and when I saw the Insta Natural Argan Oil Hair Treatment &amp; Elixir I wanted to give it a try to see how well it would work for me and for my daughter.  </li>
            <li>I used it on my relaxer treated hair and on my daughter’s natural hair.  </li>
            <li>Make my hair soft, but not oily</li>
            <li>I have used it on my skin frequently and it works sooo well.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>My ends are so soft and my hair looks healthier.</li>
            <li>Leaves it soft and shiny</li>
            <li>So decided to go with natural oils because I did some research on that</li>
            <li>Do the research on each of these oils and you&#x27;ll be surprised.</li>
            <li>but it still does not feel soft.</li>
            <li>I noticed immediately when it began drying that it felt soft and &#x27;alive&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I used the Argan Oil Treatment faithfully for the last 30 days to determine just how much progress was noticeable.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and moisturized after I use it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m natural and have 4b hair and it made it feel amazingly soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I shampoo my hair, apply a couple of squirts of treatment near the ends and breakage areas, wait 10 minutes, and shampoo twice to get the treatment out.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really helped after only one use!</li>
            <li>This makes my hair so soft and manageable and shiny.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not heavy &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gives my hair a light shine without being heavy,</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>Makes it shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and soft as a result.  </li>
            <li>This made my hair feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li>About twice a year I&#x27;ll go to the salon to color my hair, and recently I&#x27;ve noticed a few more split ends</li>
            <li>have rather thick hair on top of</li>
            <li>Needless to say InstaNatural has created a good product here.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and although my blow dry time was cut much shorter and my hair was tamed, I noticed that it weighed it down quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I usually use Moroccan Oil Light - thought I would try something new.  </li>
            <li>Any moisture gained by the treatment  is negated by the fact I&#x27;m having to wash my hair more than usual to get the oiliness out!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The more subtle results are immediate.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and I use a small amount this oil as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>The Argan oil from InstaNatural is actually a unique blend of other essential oils with it, like coconut, jojoba, grapeseed, etc.</li>
            <li>My hair, by the way is bleached like white, and after four bleachings total, this is exactly what it needed.</li>
            <li>I use it every time I get out of the shower and a little more after I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair hair very soft and my curls are not dry.</li>
            <li>Applied it to my hair two hours prior to showering, and after washing it leaves my hair is very soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>This is nice, my hair tends to be dry &amp; kinda dull looking.</li>
            <li>Whether I blow dry and style or just let dry naturally, my hair is soft and super shiny.  </li>
            <li>It works well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking greasy (as long as I don&#x27;t use to much).</li>
            <li>I add a few drops to my regular conditioner to make it more of a deep conditioning treatment.  </li>
            <li>She has finally put away her flat iron and can get ready to leave the house in under an hour!</li>
            <li>About an hour later, I took a shower and washed my hair as normal.</li>
            <li>I massaged this through my hair,  left it on for 15 minutes then washed and conditioned my hair normally</li>
            <li>I towel dried my hair and my waves bounced into place without a weighed down feeling and it air dried beautifully and not frizzy.</li>
            <li>Only thing I dislike about it, is the smell, although that technically means it is really pure oils, no addition of scent to it.</li>
            <li>, it looked so dull, this product has brought back a more youthful look to my hair.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for offering this at such a low price.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fickle and while one product will work one month, the next month I won’t get the same results.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product is not tested on animals and also offers a money-back guarantee if you are not happy with it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve noticed that if I apply this product in my hair (while wet) before I go to sleep, my hair is much more manageable in the morning and less frizzy!</li>
            <li>My hair started to show signs of life after the first use and after about the 3rd or 4th time of using this on my hair there was not signs of any damaged hair or dry brittle frizzy out of control hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it as a styling aid, but in small amounts I can see it being useful for certain types of hair, particularly hair that is left to air dry.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and have been looking for something that works like this for a long time.  </li>
            <li>It is light and non-oily and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Just a tiny bit of this oil really goes a long way to conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>I only used it once so far and have noticed a difference in the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>One treatment left in for 15 minutes and her hair was soft and wavy and controllable.  </li>
            <li>bringing out my natural red highlights and a create glow.</li>
            <li>I have been using old products trying to get it back to a manageable place.  </li>
            <li>Paid too much for really no results...</li>
            <li>When I washed it out the next day I noticed immediately how shiny and soft my hair was.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural&#x27;s Argan Oil Hair Treatment and Elixir is so natural that it is only made 100% from plant based oils.  </li>
            <li>I even used it after my Epilepsy Testing and it removed the glue from the probes in my hair and made my hair extra soft and shiny</li>
            <li>I even used it after my Epilepsy Testing and it removed the glue from the probes in my hair and made my hair extra soft and shiny</li>
            <li>have discovered that it gives my natural sandy, red hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even been told even that the bottom of my feet feel baby soft after applying this product regularly.</li>
            <li>This left my hair feeling so silky and soft.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s barely even noticeable.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m always on the look out for as natural things as I can find to use for personal use.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I woke up and brushed my hair to see NO grease!</li>
            <li>Leaving it on overnight then wake up to shampoo n rinse leaving my hair not only soft but shiny without the oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>It is shiny, soft and I can see a big improvement with my split ends.</li>
            <li>I love this oil I put 2 pumps on my thick long hair after I shower</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not completely satisfied with the product, just contact them and they&#x27;ll give you a full refund (no need to return the bottle).</li>
            <li>so of course I&#x27;m game to try as many as I can..</li>
            <li>I know sometimes reading these reviews can make you skeptical, but this review is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li>One thing I wanted to add was the oil is in a bottle with a pump, you can use as little or more without the mess of trying to pour oil out and it ends up everywhere</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use and a small amount of oil goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have recently began to have dry and itchy scalp, and it has been very bothersome to me.  </li>
            <li>I am in my 30&#x27;s now and still battling coarse, puffy, wavy-to-curly, frizzy, thick, easily tangled, crispy hair.</li>
            <li>After the first use of the Argan Oil, I noticed less hair in my brush.</li>
            <li>This oil is great, very thin, and doesn&#x27;t weight hair down.</li>
            <li>This oil is for all hair types, my hair is really curly and it have a mind of his own, my ends are horrible, they are super dry; and my hair overall is really frizzy</li>
            <li>usually wash my hair every 2-3 days, and for the last couple weeks after I get out of the shower, I put a few drops of this in my hair, and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li>My hair loss is so extreme that I am resigned to wearing wigs or hats much of the time when I&#x27;m away from the house.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and again my hair was full of shine and was soft.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Even my grey hairs were soft!</li>
            <li>I may have been looking for a more dramatic difference, but I do think the product helps.  </li>
            <li>Not much growth so far just 1 week so far</li>
            <li>I wanted a more natural solution that wouldn&#x27;t make me feel guilty while dabbing product on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Bought it for my straight thick hair and it works really well.</li>
            <li>little goes a long way, so this 4 fluid ounce bottle will last a while and keep you frizz free all summer long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a very busy lifestyle and with gym workouts, my hair can be neglected and ultimately dry, course, unmanageable with split ends.  </li>
            <li>There was no significant shine improvement, but it may take a longer treatment time for this to become evident.  </li>
            <li>I figured it would still dry out over night, but was pleasantly surprised this morning when I woke up!</li>
            <li>I received this quickly and was not able to use it until last night on my hair.</li>
            <li>but once again I have to say I&#x27;m a bit disappointed because I already have an Argan oil mask product that I was happy with using for overnights.  </li>
            <li>i am an african american women who has recently transitioned from relaxer to natural.  </li>
            <li>It appears as though my hair cuticles are suddenly (and finally) behaving (as though a curse/ magic spell was broken).</li>
            <li>When I tried it on my hair, I pumped a couple times around my palms and rubbed it straight on my scalp, then worked my way down to my hair</li>
            <li>I am with all the high reviews and such, I expected to see results.</li>
            <li>Unlike before, it does not get huge, and I don&#x27;t need to tame it with hair elastics or any other products.  </li>
            <li>This works, but there will be a little trial-and-error because you don&#x27;t need a lot of this product even though you&#x27;ll want to, but a little sure does go a long way with this</li>
            <li>My 4 year old has very long hair.</li>
            <li>But it left my hair light and slightly glossier with a bit less frizz.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair and it has helped my ends not look so dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li>Now, I let it dry naturally</li>
            <li>For me I wanted something to help with my dry scalp and also keep my hair soft and shinny between washes.  </li>
            <li>I try a lot of products for my dry, naturally curly hair and this is a god one.</li>
            <li>Since my hair is naturally course and dry</li>
            <li>My hair was much softer, silkier, less frizzy and had volume.</li>
            <li>Havent used it long enough, but leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li>Now, we&#x27;ve tried all those oils separately and though they work pretty well in my hair, my daughter&#x27;s hair after awhile goes back to that dried</li>
            <li>I  have to be careful with conditioners as my hair can look weighed down and greasy if it isn&#x27;t absorbed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight enough to use on my difficult but very fine hair.</li>
            <li>I recommend this for people who want to try a natural leave-in conditioner especially if they have dry, thicker hair.</li>
            <li>Slowly I am noticing that my hair has more volume and seeing less damage from the heat.</li>
            <li>Huge mistake as she left me with inches of dry, brittle, frizzy, dull hair.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, silky and shiny and smoothes away the dry frizzies!</li>
            <li>It states can be used within 10 minutes off application and use as much as needed but remember a little goes</li>
            <li>So little does so much as a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Most of the oil was put on the ends and the middle of my hair and very little on the roots.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used as a serum, but you should only use a small dot , because it will make your hair oily.</li>

            <li> I love this oil!</li>
            <li> So, on a whim, I purchased this Argan oil at a discount in exchange for my honest review, and the results for me were amazing.</li>
            <li> I used this on my hair overnight TWICE, and the results are amazing...  </li>
            <li> This oil is amazing.</li>
            <li> The price is amazing for the size, as you don&#x27;t need a lot of the oil per application.</li>
            <li> Works great for smoothing hair and keeping ends split free</li>
            <li> works amazing for my bi-racial childrens hair.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been three weeks in and my hair feels amazing.</li>
            <li> : I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li> Five stars for the amazing quality and price.</li>
            <li> And can honestly feel and see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> i received this product in return for an honest reciew</li>
            <li> Then after all that I spray my hair with Proganix Anti-fade weightless argon oil + UV protection which adds a nice shine to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I see my hair not as frizzy which is nice to have.</li>
            <li> Shipped in nice package.</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a scent and consistency is nice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 5 months (give or take) and haven&#x27;t seen spectacular results.</li>
            <li> Gives my hair a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> This one make my hair so nice and shinny I can skip the shine spray .</li>
            <li> but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> That is my own thoughts.</li>
            <li> send me this product to review it, but my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to try the InstaNatural Argan Oil to see what it could do to keep my tresses lovely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but is still nice to spray into your hand and then rub into your hair.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived fast and in perfect condition.  </li>
            <li> I, honestly, don&#x27;t think I would ever want to go without it.</li>
            <li> I feel it does a nice job of protecting and conditioning my hair.  </li>
            <li> Nice product,will buy it again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> Smells nice and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice sheen, makes hair a lot easier to comb without getting greasy.  </li>
            <li> have received this product in return of my HONEST review.</li>
            <li> thanks for the great price!</li>
            <li> So I have been making my own shampoo bars for some time now.</li>
            <li> I have to be honest -</li>
            <li> I felt my hair had a nice shine or luminosity to it.  </li>
            <li> I washed it out using my shampoo and the results were astounding.</li>
            <li> I liked the product but it makes my hair&lt;</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that my hair feels a lot softer and thicker because of this oil.</li>
            <li> After showering it out, my hair feels smooth, clean, and looks VERY nice!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was given free product in order to facilitate my review and the opinions expressed are my own!</li>
            <li> Quick, friendly, perfect!</li>
            <li> Super happy about the product</li>
            <li> good product easy absorb</li>
            <li> Good company too, easy to work with.</li>
            <li> split ends very easily.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use,</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to find many more uses for it!</li>
            <li> best thing about this oil is it&#x27;s natural, and it&#x27;s just oil!</li>
            <li> The oil has a mild but pleasant smell so that is nice too.</li>
            <li> It is nice that the smell is ok too.</li>
            <li> This hair oil is amazing, it leaves my hair feeling hydrated and healthy.</li>
            <li> I believe this a deep-down kind of healthy sheen.</li>
            <li> I love this product, amazing ...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and is perfect for all hair types.</li>
            <li> Argan oil has become one of the most popular oils for hair restoration.</li>
            <li> My friend has finer, more controllable hair, and she liked her results as well.</li>
            <li> This product does wonderful things for my permed hair, keeping it moisturized and soft.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and soft Argan oil is the best period making my nails grow as well</li>
            <li> So far this is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> Great for smoothing... would like to have a better fragrance, but not bad</li>
            <li> and I have had the best shiny, healthy, and conditioned soft hair ever!  </li>
            <li> Love love love this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good leave in oil treatment but not as good as their Pure Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I have tried many hair oils this one is by far the best one.</li>
            <li> was provided this product for free for review, but nonetheless - my thoughts are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> (Hot Tools makes a great one).  </li>
            <li> Oil is very light yet nourishing for damaged hair&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t squirt a huge amount out -- which is great because then it won&#x27;t leave my hair full of grease.  </li>
            <li> Nice pump bottle makes it easy to dispense the oil&lt;</li>
            <li> I liked that the elixir came with a pump so it was easy to get out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> That really helped with dandruff and keeping her looking more beautiful.  </li>
            <li> The product is easy to use and absorbs into the hair nicely.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product; I love it!</li>
            <li> It is also nice as a oil based rinse out conditioner or overnight hair and scalp treatment for fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li> It has all my favorite oils I use for my skin care as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but not working as I hoped.  </li>
            <li> Love using argan oil products in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this.  </li>
            <li> glad i did becuz</li>

            <li> so I have not been able to get it trimmed in 8 months and</li>
            <li> Most of them either made my hair my hair greasy or didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair at all or &amp;#34;stiffed&amp;#34; it out.</li>
            <li> Just Love this oil blend.  </li>
            <li> I always forget to do the deep conditioning treatment but am so happy when I do!  </li>

            <li> Either way, I&#x27;m rating it as it&#x27;s okay, since it didn&#x27;t make anything really better</li>

            <li> &amp; my hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li> The salon told me the stylist filling in for her had many years experience</li>
            <li> Now I just got most of the severe damage cut off.  </li>
            <li> did a lot of research looking for a healthy treatment for my hair.</li>
            <li> More so, with this product they have combined a list of the best essential oils that aid in healthy hair and restoration.  </li>
            <li> This argan oil hair treatment has so many uses.</li>
            <li> will buy again, love this.</li>
            <li> Instead of using a dropper like most Argan Oil products I’ve tried before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I look forward to seeing if continued use makes more of a difference.</li>
            <li> , it now has a healthy sheen.</li>
            <li> This has tons of lovely ingredients that have so many health benefits.</li>
            <li> Love the shine I get from this.</li>
            <li> I used For Face, Skin, Hair Growth, Stretch Marks, Scars, Nails, Muscle &amp; Joint Pain, great product and high quality!</li>
            <li> Love my argan oil.</li>
            <li> There are better alternatives than this but for the price and the ingredients, it cant be beat.</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t be buying more</li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>
            <li> I ordered two more bottles of oil to have one in the bathroom, kitchen and night stand.</li>

            <li> Seen a difference in after 3-4 uses, made my hair more calm and smooth and looks great.</li>
            <li> It really keeps your style longer and makes your hair look great.</li>
            <li> Thai argan oil hair treatment has many uses,i used it on my hair after I shampoo my hair</li>
            <li> The smell of this product can be way better.</li>
            <li> I love using this in my hair before a bath.</li>
            <li> So every week I add this to my hair and sit in the tub for 20 mins while it works its magic.</li>
            <li> My arsenal is growing and of course I will add InstaNatural Argan Oil  Hair Treatment to my top 5.</li>
            <li> And what&#x27;s not to love about no added chemicals?  </li>
            <li> I used for a week and noticed my hair was softer and more manageable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since using this product my hair is much more manageable, and in better condition.  </li>
            <li> After reading the backs of them, they have just about as many chemicals in them as the hair dye</li>
            <li> I love that your hair don&#x27;t feel oily</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I use about a 1/2 a pump on my hair, any more than that</li>
            <li> I also love this product for straightening my hair as well.</li>
            <li> I love anything with argan oil in it.</li>
            <li> Love the result</li>
            <li> and I LOVE</li>

            <li> I love, love, love Argan oil and it loves my hair, whoever gets this will be just as in love as i am</li>
            <li> , I just wish it weren&#x27;t $20, but it is definitely the best product I have found.</li>
            <li> I love using Argan Oil in my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair felt more moisturized and had more volume.</li>
            <li> And was able to go 4 days begone needing to this time.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> Love that it was on a promotion for $1.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair shinier, softer, more healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Something I&#x27;d invest in after we run out for sure.</li>
            <li> I agreed to write my honest opinion in return for getting this product free</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it has a pump dispenser</li>
            <li> Love this argan oil</li>
            <li> I will stick with that brand for sure.</li>
            <li> Your product can be used for so many areas, have to admit I rub it on elbows, hands, feet, legs</li>
            <li> Just want  to say Thank You  for such wonderful products.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay by me.</li>
            <li> I am glad to have recieved this product to review.</li>
            <li> Love this oil..</li>
            <li> Love the oil :) it makes my hair so soft and had a beautiful shine</li>
            <li> After application (if using as a leave in conditioner) it will feel like it has a protective barrier over each and every strand, which makes perfect when using your blow dryer and/or flat iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week, and it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Pure argan oil does not have a pleasant smell, but that does not bother me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sooo rich!</li>
            <li> Just let it soak on your hands for 5minutes, than wash off with a mild soap and warm water.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> I notice that there is no smell in this product which makes it easy to add to your favorite conditioners or leave-ins for the added benefit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my cuticles and it prevents them from drying and tearing at the sides of my nails; it&#x27;s really wonderful for dry skin</li>
            <li> NICE BIG SICE AND GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> Drama aside, this product has truly been life changing for me, as it has been the best moisturizing agent that has worked wonders for my skin and my dry and brittle hair!</li>
            <li> excellent for very dry hair.</li>
            <li> Really becoming a fan of InstaNatural.  </li>
            <li> So far this is a great product</li>
            <li> I love argon oil and this is even better having such great ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> Finally, to make sure every inch of me is beautiful</li>
            <li> Great natural product, I use it overnight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I received the products fast and a fair amount for the money.</li>
            <li> So my technique is fairly practiced and I don&#x27;t feel I am adding too much.</li>
            <li> Smells good and really makes a difference in your hairs look and texture</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft and styled very nicely.</li>
            <li> So I was more than excited to try this out.</li>
            <li> but I swear it&#x27;s just as good, and maybe even more effective, than some of the other treatments costing a lot more.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t been breaking off as easily as before, resulting in fewer split ends, almost none at all.</li>
            <li> Hair can easily go an the greasy side if you are not watchful.</li>
            <li> I am a happy woman, who finally embraced her hair with love.</li>
            <li> I like that the bottle has a pump so easy to use</li>
            <li> It does come out easily with the shampoo, and does not leave my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair strong and strength</li>
            <li> Just good natural ingredients :)</li>
            <li> The product has a strong sunflower seed smell.</li>
            <li> wear in conditioner is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> I have used other Argan Oils and this seems very nice!</li>
            <li> It says this is leave in conditioner, and maybe for someone that has dry or damaged hair or kid that gets tangles easily, this would be perfect for you, but my hair is already oily so putting it on dry first works perfect for me!!</li>
            <li> It has a sweet, lovely, fruity scent.</li>
            <li> I try not to get it too close to my roots as I have fine hair</li>
            <li> But it works fine on the frizzy/curly hair without adding the greasiness .</li>
            <li> Works just fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;I have extremely fine and thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> It works super well!</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan Oil for years and loved the way this product has my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> but what I love more is when I find a new product to love.</li>
            <li> Overall, a very nice and easy to use product.</li>
            <li> Super excited to find one to use now!  </li>
            <li> have always been a huge fan of oil treatments.  </li>
            <li> By morning it had soaked in and my hair was really a nice texture and very silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> a great oil for your hair especially if yu have a try scalp</li>
            <li> Make your hair smooth and manageable.</li>
            <li> I figured this was worth a shot and was pleased to get a sample to review.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel comfortable applying it.</li>
            <li> This Argan oil hair treatment is light, non greasy.</li>
            <li> I get FABULOUS results.</li>
            <li> I think it would be fabulous for someone with thicker, dryer hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything spectacular.</li>
            <li> The ingredients scream out great product, but overall I didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes and leaves my hair smooth, and doesn&#x27;t leave residue.</li>
            <li> A great product with loads of essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;**Product</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny,  frizz free</li>
            <li> This was a free sample product for review</li>
            <li> It applies smoothly and spreads evenly.  </li>
            <li> The directions mention rubbing a drop or two between your hands/palms then smooth or scrunch into your hair.  </li>
            <li> washed it out with the same conditioner and my hair felt great.</li>
            <li> I received this for free to review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I started with 1 pump, rubbed through my hands and distributed lightly throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> That’s a great improvement from the hair food we were using that would only work for about two to three days.  </li>
            <li> We both had great results even though we both have very different kinds of hair.  </li>
            <li> Light oil.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of stuff that made my hair feel great but only for a day or for a week</li>
            <li> Great deep conditioning treatment!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample to evaluate, and liked the oil so much that I have just purchased another bottle.</li>
            <li> The seller sent me a free sample.  </li>
            <li> Got it for free...</li>
            <li> I have been on the lookout for a conditioner that&#x27;s all nature and free of the yucky stuff.</li>
            <li> It also is light</li>
            <li> Love the product, but what a cheap container, the bottle top was lose and no matter how much effort you put to make it tighter</li>
            <li> My hair is healthier and looking better- more shinny and much softer.</li>
            <li> This should last me for a good while and will purchase more once this is gone.</li>
            <li> I also used this oil as a styling aid for my natural curls,my hair loved this treatment with these pent rating oils,and also the shine.</li>
            <li> I have been playing around with the right colors and highlights and to top it off</li>
            <li> Mine is very fine and a little dry.&lt;br /&gt;The best part of this product is the fast and friendly customer service.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.., my hair is natural locs and I&#x27;ve had it on for  2yrs, this oil gives it an amazing shine.my hair stays full and looks rich every day .</li>
            <li> This may be too much for fine hair, and what may work better for fine hair is a keratin mask treatment.</li>
            <li> I am a strong user of oils and the pure form the better for me to try out.</li>
            <li> It is great to put on hair too smooth after blow dry or at night before bed for overnight treatment, then shampoo out in morning.the</li>
            <li> I used it as a hair mask per the instructions and when I shampooed it out my hair felt fantastic - super smooth and silky and not at all greasy or oily.  </li>
            <li> I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It does leave a pretty shine and makes me feel like my hair is more polished.</li>
            <li> product is totally worth it!</li>
            <li> I will let you know how successful I am later on with this project.helps that makes life easier for you.</li>
            <li> I will let you know how successful I am later on with this project.</li>
            <li> Your hair is softer, more manageable and shine restored after the first overnight treatment.</li>
            <li> I am noticing significantly fewer split ends.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When she mentions &amp;#34;hair loss,&amp;#34; she&#x27;s referring to a significant permanent hair loss that she had while in college</li>
            <li> far, I have been very pleased with InstaNatural&#x27;s product line, and the Hair elixir is no exception.</li>
            <li> So excited to have this.</li>
            <li> Does a great job taming my dry summer hair.</li>
            <li> this product and Argan oil treatment is great on hair that is out of control with frizzy, dry, split ends, and damaged from chemical overload.  </li>
            <li> marvelous oil deep nourish made my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> , I have try different brands and so far this is the best thing I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil Hair Treatment works great if you have a dry scalp as well.</li>
            <li> Amazing natural product!  </li>
            <li> I use lots of beauty products this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> I have used pure Argan oil and that works a lot better for my hair then this stuff.</li>
            <li> I find it to work better than pure argan oil.</li>
            <li> so needs special care.  </li>
            <li> Instanatural Argan has great reviews so I splurged and spent the $20 for 4 oz.</li>
            <li> Then I had tons of hair products that made it look great, but you gotta understand that pomade and gel are pretty much entirely made up of chemicals.</li>
            <li> it feels nice and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Overall  its a good product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a good size so it should last awhile.</li>
            <li> Is this a good enough reason to return it?  </li>
            <li> and it looked healthy with so much shine.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> With all the hair products that are out there you just never know what is good and what actually works.</li>
            <li> This does not have a scent but the benefits out weigh the need for something sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> gave it to her because I know that she sometimes applies heat to her hair, but yet wants to maintain healthy</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers</li>
            <li> Makes it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> it has a nice light scent and makes your hair and ends especially soft and shiny, I put it on my hair before beach day to protect then put in braid and washed out after hair was very manageable and had lots of body.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair nice, soft and shiny but nothing to write home to mom about.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too thick, not too liquid - I find it the perfect viscosity for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad product</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft and it looks very healthy and has a great shine without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> Just by putting it on my ends look more healthy and I really love that, if that&#x27;s just putting it right now, Imagine what it can do a long term.</li>
            <li> Amazing product if you are looking for a super soft hair.</li>
            <li> I like everything about this product except the smell, but considering how wonderful this product works, it is something can be looked past!</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it if you need to make your hair more manageable and keep it from becoming a hot mess!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair moisturized and calm but requires a lot more dosage than the Pure Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> I didn’t experience any rashes or allergic reactions which I’ve experienced with other hair treatments I’ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love to use shea butter  on my  skin and for deep conditioning masks, but have never been able to use it in my hair without my hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li> Mild smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is mild and it absorbs rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Everything shipped and arrived as quickly as promised.  </li>
            <li> This particular brand and product is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li> of course my lenght has improved tremendously too.</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair SUPER shiny without looking oily at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an EXCELLENT elixer, and I probably will never go back to using regular argan oil!</li>
            <li> Although this cost more than my last, I like it a lot better.  </li>
            <li> , the Agran Oil has done it&#x27;s magic, and my hair is soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> But because it IS oil, you have to make sure you do a decent job at washing it out.</li>
            <li> I have straight Asian hair that tends to get a lot of fly aways and breakage underneath from wearing ponytails.  </li>
            <li> I recieved this for free for giving my honest feedback, and I would reccommend this to anyone that wants soft, silky, shiney hair!</li>
            <li> I love argan oil hair products and if you&#x27;ve never tried them, I highly recommend it, espeically InstaNatural brand.</li>
            <li> The best part is I now use this on my young daughter&#x27;s super curly hair instead of expensive products that I don&#x27;t feel good about.  </li>
            <li> The product needs to be dabbed first, then lightly massaged onto the hair (I do this by rolling/</li>
            <li> this bottle goes a long way and that makes it a good value</li>
            <li> I should treat my hair good whether it is long or short.&lt;br</li>
            <li> was very lucky to be able to try for small fee and my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I gave the Argan Oil for Hair treatment &amp; Elixir Serum a 5 star rating because in the week that I have been using it I have been bombarded with compliments about the softness and new healthy feel of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Another great place to use this on on the tips through half way up the shaft.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer and less fly away.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not sorry I did try!</li>
            <li> The first thing i noticed about the Argan Oil was the smell, Oh my god!</li>
            <li> I love how the ingredients are natural  and that I recognize them all!  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is meant to!</li>
            <li> I highly recommended it!!!</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels so much healthier!!</li>
            <li> I love that it is all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my dry, coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> It looks healthy and is super soft.</li>
            <li> A pure unadulterated &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34; for my tresses.</li>

            <li> I intend to keep using it to give my hair a more natural look and feel, as well as conditioning it.</li>
            <li> and I just tried it today and my hair feels soft and looks 80% better ..</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair is so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I have been using the Insta Natural Argan Oil Hair Treatment for almost 3 weeks now and the directions say you can use it for a ten-minute, two-hour or overnight hair repair treatment.</li>
            <li> And, like I said, after about almost 3 weeks of use, not everyday, my hair does feel softer, silkier and definitely more manageable.</li>
            <li> The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li> The Natural ingredients in it also made me feel comfortable to apply it on my daughters hair for a tangle free brush and shine.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try with that pledge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> My mother gets a dime sized amount in her palm, and works it into her freshly shampooed hair before combing it out.</li>
            <li> I would like to think that I am taking care of my hair, but I can honestly say, now that I am wearing a short hair style</li>
            <li> well worth it</li>

            <li> So, far, I love it.</li>
            <li> Used to be nice when i was younger.</li>
            <li> For me however, I prefer having an oil with a nice aromatic smell and for that reason only I have knocked one star.   </li>
            <li> LOVE natural products..</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, so I love to use products that can enhance my curls, or moisturize and nourish my hair in the kindest way.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> Love it, it makes my hair shiny, soft and no frizzys.</li>
            <li> They were kind enough to send me a bottle of Argan Oil Hair Treatment to try out and review for the Beauty Diva blog.</li>
            <li> The following is her honest feedback:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a distinct smell to it, so it won&#x27;t bother you while you&#x27;re going about your day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple different oils and they help make my hair look nice and shiny, but I feel like THIS oil really penetrates into my hair and really makes it healthy.</li>
            <li> I love Argan Oil because my hair is very dry and frizzy, I put it on right after I wash my hair so it can add more conditioning to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have tried more than my fair share of these types of product and this is right on part with some of the much more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;re looking for something easy to use for your hair, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The first one I tried out is the InstaNatural 100% Pure Argan Oil which I love, the next one I tried out is the InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Moroccan Rose Water.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on the positive reviews and they were right!</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve said before in many other reviews, I am always looking for products that make my hair healthier and look better.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair treatment because I was already familiar with most of the essential oils used in this product.</li>
            <li> I think it does a really nice job as a heat protectant before I use my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I could see a difference right away.</li>
            <li> My comb glided right through my hair.</li>
            <li> .Excellent ,the right combination of oils</li>
            <li> I put it on my in my hair right after I am done swimming, and by the time I am home from the pool</li>
            <li> And sometimes I&#x27;ll put some in right before bed to let my hair soak it up.</li>
            <li> I opted to dive right in and do an overnight treatment on my hair.</li>
            <li> if you do use it for this purpose I would recommend applying right after a shower.</li>
            <li> It is a new love of mine, makes my hair soft, shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> It may just the combination of oils, or maybe I&#x27;m used to a scented product that covers up their true smell, but I didn&#x27;t love snuggling up to him when this was recently applied.</li>
            <li> MY HAIR LOOK MORE SMOOTH AND NOT TOO DRY.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several different products and so far this is the best one I have used.</li>
            <li> The knots in her hair after sleep have gone down to almost nothing which makes both our mornings much more peaceful. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Argan Oil Hair Treatment has been such relief to my split ends, my fly away hair that&#x27;s stands on end due to static and my dry itchy scalp, and who doesn&#x27;t enjoy silky smooth hair!&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was always dull, but now it has a nice healthy glossy look.</li>
            <li> I use this baby, blow dry and get amazing results.  </li>
            <li> I find the scent very mild, in fact I don&#x27;t really recall any particular scent.</li>
            <li> Though I like the fact that this product has so many natural ingredients, I really find that it leaves my hair feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I loved how this elixir worked especially for my daughter’s natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I have over the years tried almost everything available, plus I have made a few of my own.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a single product that is an oil treatment, frizz reducer, or thermal protectant for you hair depending on how you use it.</li>
            <li> It soaks in within about 10-15 minutes for a non-greasy feel and until I wash my hair, it&#x27;s smooth, soft and my curls stay defined without the need of gel!</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> This product has changed my hair from ordinary to awesome, it makes it really shinny and soft and it just looks fuller.  </li>
            <li> It used to be a pure mixture of oils that were incredibly useful on hair and nails.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this product has been amazing for my hair!</li>
            <li> It seems to strengthen your hair at the first use.</li>
            <li> I love this actually, I leave it in my hair for about an hour or so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am excited to try other products from this company :-)</li>
            <li> My hair feels healthy and not so coarse anymore.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> In fact, when I run out of my current supply, I will probably be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Notice softer hair within the first week.</li>
            <li> This bottle is probably going to get used up fast!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it&#x27;s not for us.</li>
            <li> After my first order of these products I saw this</li>
            <li> Probably ok if you rinse it off shortly after application.</li>
            <li> After reviewing this product before buying, I would like to say first-</li>
            <li> I have used it as directed, not for the EXACT times it says you can use it for treatment...</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start telling you why I like this company, all their products have natural ingredients also their products are cruelty free.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> I like to dampen my hair first, then apply it.</li>
            <li> By the way, I am able to use all of their products together which is also a big bonus.</li>
            <li> While it did not perform miracles and give her straight and shiny hair, it did make her curls behave, and kept the frizz at bay- even with humidity!</li>
            <li> I recently discovered argan oil for hair and fell in love with it immediately.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product!</li>
            <li> My hair thanks you!</li>
            <li> I even love how it looks the same day I showered (unheard of!).  </li>
            <li> By the third week I was able to brush it and style it almost the way I used to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s most likely 90% sunflower oil...10% the rest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> but it actually makes it more brittle.</li>
            <li> I believe that the name of the product (&amp;#34;Argan Oil&amp;#34;) is misleading as it should be named sunflower seed oil.</li>
            <li> I am sure, If I did not use this product, my hair fall would have been rapid as it is since last 2-3 years.</li>
            <li> and it never fails to pamper my skin, hair and nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Treatment was exactly that..</li>
            <li> My wife was interested in trying argan oil, so when I was offered an opportunity to try some, I got a bottle for her to use.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much or you will need to wash your hair again!  </li>
            <li> My first time to love such a product</li>
            <li> I also started to get pretty itchy after a day.</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil Hair Treatment has a rich blend of oils that help make up this super power that will tame your hair and make it shiny and more</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for anyone who needs a a great hair treatment for their dry hair because I have only used it twice</li>
            <li> The pump dispenses a modest amount so you can easily decide how much you want without a handful of oil to deal with.  </li>
            <li> Overall I do recommend this product, it give me fantastic results and the bottle is huge comparing how much you really use.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> none of my other products were damaged because the glass bottle is in a nice cardboard box.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love using this for days after flat ironing our hair.</li>
            <li> I also love it as a heat protectant and my hair looks silkier after a flat iron.</li>
            <li> The original order&#x27;s ingredients were six natural oils.</li>
            <li> A little drop is good to rub into the hair gently.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I have seen a positive difference in her hair.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I have been watching the Argan Oil thing for a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as a hot iron oil, as it&#x27;s very oily.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve pretty much tried everything that was out there.</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for review and have been very pleased with my results after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend using it in your hair right after you go swimming.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to be without it so long! :)</li>
            <li> Not only is it regular argan oil it also has jojoba oil, AND coconut oil, along with tons of other awesome ingredients.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and washed out with regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really feel like it made too much of a difference even after consistent use, so</li>
            <li> It has kept my dry frizzy hair smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> On the back side it states the ingredients and list : Sunflower oil as the primary and first ingredient.</li>
            <li> It leans towards dry rather than oily but is fairly healthy in all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After the first application my hair was shiny and smooth immediately, but over the weeks of continuous use it has brought life back to my hair.  </li>
            <li> My nails and dry cuticles are healed, nails are healthy grow out,</li>
            <li> I then took a bath in the morning and my hair was super soft, no frizz, and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I was also able to use this product as a heat protectant when I decided to flat-iron and blow dry my hair after washing.</li>
            <li> One pump is the perfect amount for my long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The product is light and does not weight my hair down and my hair feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for soft shiny hair, and it will save you the trouble of mixing multiple oils, the perfect blend is made for you!</li>
            <li> Natural Argan oil has a raw, green and nutty aroma, but what is so great about this type of oil is that the scent disappears minutes after being on your skin or hair as true Argan oil absorbs very quickly and without that</li>
            <li> I just use one drop on my fine chin-level hair and that is enough.</li>
            <li> For the first week the main difference I noticed was it was easier to get a comb through my hair</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and use it mostly on my face and hands, and sometimes on my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see much improvement</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> and you can&#x27;t apply too much</li>
            <li> haha).  </li>
            <li> Makes hair very shiny, moisturized and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is left silky, shiny, and smooth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like it because too oily after put it on.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair treatment.</li>
            <li> So I put this on and really focused on the ends</li>
            <li> and I can really say it added lots of moisture and sheen.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really getting into oils now</li>
            <li> I did not feel much a difference in this oil mix than the organic coconut oil</li>
            <li> thanks you.</li>
            <li> Definitely did not make hair smooth or silky.  </li>
            <li> It has a ton of uses which makes it very multi-purpose.  </li>
            <li> The easiest way we found to work this oil through our hair is making sure our hair was wet before we put the oil in it.</li>
            <li> and I have to really work at getting it straight</li>
            <li> The differences don&#x27;t show up very well on my curly hair, so it&#x27;s always to my advantage to leave it</li>
            <li> I tried it and it really does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This oil really works on my gray hair.  </li>
            <li> It really helps your hair look</li>
            <li> /&gt;Daily I spritz some of the oil on my hair comb, and work it through my hair in the morning while I&#x27;m getting ready.</li>
            <li> I also really like it as a frizz remover and detangler for my hair.</li>
            <li> I also really like it as a frizz remover and detangler for my hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Wonderful hair product, my hair feels like silk, really, I&#x27;m always telling everyone, touch my hair!&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so much that I find myself using this as a skin moisturizer as well.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels healthier and it is so much easier to manage.  </li>
            <li> I rub in a couple drops of this before showering to protect it from drying out, and then add another drop along with a drop of straightening serum after getting out, before combing it straight</li>
            <li> while blow-drying it, then using a straight iron.</li>
            <li> My hair felt so smooth after I applied it and left it on overnight.</li>
            <li> My hair refuses to absorb this oil and leaves me looking very greasy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely can not wear it when going out.</li>
            <li> elixir kept her scalp from drying out for a whole week.  </li>
            <li> I really like this oil.</li>
            <li> Ok so I must&#x27;ve spent over a hundred dollars on hair products ranking from shampoo and conditioners to pomades and gel.</li>
            <li> my hair  and my scalp felt very refreshed.</li>
            <li> It was Ok, but I expected something else.</li>
            <li> I observed a distinct difference in the overall appearance of my hair, and just how much this fabulous product restored my strands, and renewed my faith in yet another natural hair product.</li>
            <li> One recommendation is don&#x27;t put too much on your palms when putting this in your hair after shower or your hair will look really greasy in the morning .</li>
            <li> My hair feels so much softer.</li>
            <li> My hair is much softer, shiny and healthier than ever.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the sample, because I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will be reordering.  </li>
            <li> It has a gentle scent, almost a nutty scent, not woodsy and not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I used it 10mins before washing my hair and it instantly gives it a smooth feel.&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> If you put on after, your hair would be really greasy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make much difference to my hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice much of an argan oil scent</li>
            <li> My hair is so much easier to style now.</li>
            <li> I put this in my hair and left it in about 45 minutes while I did some light house cleaning.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so much healthier and nourished.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be more of a serum, but it&#x27;s more of a thin oil</li>
            <li> i tried it only one time and it made my hair look soft and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love the combo of several natural oils blended</li>
            <li> After I dried it, I did notice my hair had a nice shine to it</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m define rely going to buy some of this because my hair is now alive!!!</li>
            <li> I have a new great product to share with you for your hair, especially if you have dry or damaged hair from natural causes or from years of using hair dryers and curling irons along with all of those type of hair tools.</li>
            <li> all natural combination of oils absorb right into your hair with no oily residue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very environmental friendly because it&#x27;s glass, but at the same time if u accidental drop it there goes your product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since my hair is really thick and long, I have to use more pumps of this stuff than most people most likely have to, so I find I&#x27;m going through it quicker.</li>
            <li> I recently changed all of my hair products over from a high end brand that I have used for years to more natural products.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is clean and professional and the function of the product and how to use it are clearly printed on the label.</li>
            <li> and I have better results with it than other oils.</li>
            <li> you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful</li>
            <li> Now it is just a very standard silicone hair serum with a drop of the original oils in it.</li>
            <li> I place a little bit of it in a glass bowl and heat it up before applying it, wash my hair first and towel dry it, smooth on a large amount making sure I cover every strand and the scalp, cover my head with a shower cap and sleep with it on overnight.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels glossy, slick, smooth, flow-y, frizz free, WITHOUT looking greasy if I use the correct method of application.</li>
            <li> This Argan Oil is one of the products I really like, I would definitely buy it full price giving its size.</li>
            <li> Great for all hair types, a little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I am hoping continual use will really keep the frizz down as the weather gets more humid.</li>
            <li> It really helps my dry hair feel smooth and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found this treatment conditions my hair nicely but easily even can make it too greasy.</li>
            <li> I LOVE how it has helped my hair become much smoother and less tangible.  </li>
            <li> feels smooth all day long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never skip that first step as it makes my hair soft, manageable, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Use it like a hot oil treatment and your hair feels soft and silky for days.  </li>
            <li> I will normally do this on the weekend when I can really give it time to soak in and do</li>
            <li> I was first hesitant to put oil directly onto my scalp,</li>
            <li> With all natural ingredients and a reasonable price, I have no problems recommending this product!</li>
            <li> Working from the top down to the end of our hair.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of issues with breakage and most conditioners just weigh my curls down without helping with the breakage issue at all.</li>
            <li> It helps to keep the frizz down on my hair and make it look healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair has new life!</li>
            <li> and I feel like I can make this mix in a diy project and have more of it for less.</li>
            <li> : Less is more.</li>
            <li> The frizziness it still there, less noticeable but still there, maybe after I use it for one week it would be better.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair with a black soap shampoo, put on my conditioner, and put this on top for a sealer.</li>
            <li> Typically I put the oil in, put my hair in a bun on the top of my head and let it sit for a minimum of 2 hours before I go up and shampoo it</li>
            <li> As I am getting older those hair pulled out while brushing started bothering me.</li>
            <li> I want to try another product with a better scent, but if I have to come back to this one, I will definitely update.</li>
            <li> It is not the brand, as I have reviewed Insta Natural products in the past and have considered them to be a very reputable company.  </li>
            <li> I use it mainly overnight and wash/rinse out in the morning.</li>
            <li> Overall this product has delivered tremendously as a strengthener and restoring shine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having my hair double processed for many years without ever experiencing dryness or damage until my regular stylist went on maternity leave.</li>
            <li> It smells decent.</li>
            <li> I got to try the whole bunch of Insta Natural products with a very generous promotion.</li>
            <li> I use it daily but mostly on Friday night as a deep oil treatment.  </li>
            <li> This is a particularly oily serum.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy curly hair and live in a high humidity climate.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling very soft!</li>
            <li> I have the most curly, wiry mess of a beard in the world, and this seems to help somewhat.</li>
            <li> have naturally thick, wavy hair, that is not easy to deal with on the best of days.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It works as a fantastic massage oil for dry skin!</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair more shiny in a good way &amp; its not near as dry &amp; dull looking.</li>
            <li> First off, I like the easy pump top, but be careful not to pump too hard cause</li>
            <li> I have ALWAYS had soft hair until I reached a certain age.</li>
            <li> A little is all you need to get your hair more manageable.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, in good condition, a little course in texture.</li>
            <li> Not so bad and not so great!</li>
            <li> and it tames my frizz so much that I can go with my natural hair now.</li>
            <li> This hair treatment left my hair and scalp feeling moisturized and fresh.</li>
            <li> I normally use a smoothing serum after straightening too, but it was not needed.</li>
            <li> Now, the next day after my treatment, my hair was still as shiny, not weighed or greasy looking, just a healthy state that I have not seen in a long time.    </li>
            <li> No free bottle or discount for this review. :)</li>
            <li> This product helped while the temperature and humidity were at normal levels in my house...</li>
            <li> I just washed like normal and when I got out of the shower my hair felt moisturized and not oily.</li>
            <li> I may continue to try this a few more times before I decide if it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Yay&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Nay&amp;#34; product -</li>
            <li> I put about four pumps for my long hair full off the oil in my hands and massage it on my scalp and towards the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make it feel greasy or weighed down just soft, shiny and more manageable.</li>
            <li> I have always kind of balked at using oil on my hair as I have fine thin hair and was concerned it would make my hair oily or flat.  </li>
            <li> I have super thick and frizzy hair, so by the next morning when I&#x27;m ready to brush my hair, my hair ends up with 1,000x more volume</li>
            <li> I typically end up with some light frizzes all over my head, but this helps relax those and my hair feels much healthier.</li>
            <li> It did a nice job of moisturizing my rough dry hands too.</li>
            <li> After only using it once it made a difference, now when I have used it a few times, I really love it!</li>
            <li> weighed my hair down and not as good as other argan oil products i have tried on amazon...</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something new for their hair care regime.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ll pick up a new &#x60;treatment&#x27; and test it out.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is sure number one moisturizer for rough and coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I have super dry ones.</li>
            <li> I have super dry hair</li>
            <li> I apply the Insta Natural Argan oil to the palm of my hand and then rub my hands together and then smooth it across my hair, being careful to keep the style.  </li>
            <li> This oil  quality is good for the hair; the only negative issue is I received the product with leakage</li>
            <li> This product also smells good, isn&#x27;t as greasy as other products I&#x27;ve used in the past, and you get more for less money.  </li>
            <li> I like the applicator part, because it is very sensitive</li>
            <li> and these product makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li> This argan oil hair treatment helps keep my gray hair very soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I am still using this product, so I still have a bit left to go before I get the full bottle final results, but so far I am very pleased!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have pretty natural curls, they just need some help calming down the frizz in 60% humidity or higher!</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it washed out easily and didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down afterwards because it seems so oily.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair really soft!</li>
            <li> Just a small amount and my hair looks better without looking greasy.</li>
            <li> So I suggest that you start of small and if you need to add more then do so</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft after using this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, not sure it is doing any &#x27;growing&#x27; or not.</li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> It was soft to the feel and even looked softer!</li>
            <li> Thank you for making such a much needed product!</li>
            <li> This oil is light and does not weigh the hair down or leave a product build up.</li>
            <li> My hair just looks amazing when i use it, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough I have added it to other things to use on my skin because of the many oils in it and it makes NY skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> My hair felt soft and luxurious, I live argan oil</li>
            <li> Have only had time to use this once, I have very curly hair,which tends to be dry,especially the last 6 inches of the length, worked this in,put on a shower cap to contain my body heat, left it on for 2 or 3 hours while I did some chores around the house, washed and conditioned like normal, was very pleased, soft silky hair that I didn&#x27;t have to yank a comb through, but my curls where there and not weighed down or greasy.</li>
            <li> This huge bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> (For a few months now) My hairdresser says that my hair has never been healthier, and if I forget I can easily tell a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I am thinking of using it on my cuticles next to see if I can get the dry looking skin around my fingernails to go back to being smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li> I am thinking of using it on my cuticles next to see if I can get the dry looking skin around my fingernails to go back to being smooth and pretty.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, has gotten thicker, and grew much more than usual in the time I&#x27;ve been using the product.</li>
            <li> I am an Indian born with very fine, silky, soft, shiny black hair but lost that lovely texture at puberty (and also because of harsh shampoo and rough handling).</li>
            <li> I use it all over my body and the combination of natural, high-quality oils leave my skin feeling silky and soft!  </li>
            <li> and it still feels like my 6 year old granddaughters soft and silky hair!</li>
            <li> Instanaturals Argan oil hair treatment rivals much more expensive products out there, and works just as good, if not better.</li>
            <li> I have fine color processed hair and it is not too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> so it can get a reasonable amount &#x27;on the right place&#x27; and not &#x27;squirt it off in any odd direction&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I used this treatment on my hair for about 5 min and went into the shower and left it on a little longer, then I poured water over my hair and used my shampoo on top of it.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty thin hair and without proper treatment, my hair gets tangled very easy.</li>
            <li> It weighs down my super fine hair and makes it look greasy (even when I apply just a little), but it might be because this product contains a variety of oils.</li>
            <li> your cuticles are soft, and easily ready to push back!  </li>
            <li> have long (mid-back length), fine hair with dry, damaged ends and oily roots.</li>
            <li> This combines not only the much buzzed about Argan oil, but also jojoba and coconut to leave you with lush, shiny&#x27; hydrated hair that you&#x27;ll want to run your fingers through all</li>
            <li> hair feels soft and shiny, yet not oily.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I put this oil in my hair directly after shampooing, conditioning, and towel drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not recommend people with sensitive skin, didn&#x27;t like the smell of the treatment once on my hair</li>
            <li> It leaves hair soft and it adds a lot of shine.</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It made my hair so soft, silky and manageable.  </li>

            <li> When I do that my hair feels soft and looks shiny.</li>
            <li> My beard is now soft as a kitten, dense as the core of a dying star, and glows with the fury of a thousand suns.  </li>
            <li> I rubbed a generous quarter sized amount from ends to roots and left it on for 2 whole days as a treatment</li>
            <li> My hair was and still is soft and shiny even the day after.    </li>

            <li> I noticed immediately when it began drying that it felt soft and &#x27;alive&#x27;.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m natural and have 4b hair and it made it feel amazingly soft and manageable.</li>

            <li> About twice a year I&#x27;ll go to the salon to color my hair, and recently I&#x27;ve noticed a few more split ends</li>
            <li> have rather thick hair on top of</li>
            <li> Needless to say InstaNatural has created a good product here.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and although my blow dry time was cut much shorter and my hair was tamed, I noticed that it weighed it down quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I usually use Moroccan Oil Light - thought I would try something new.  </li>
            <li> Any moisture gained by the treatment  is negated by the fact I&#x27;m having to wash my hair more than usual to get the oiliness out!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The more subtle results are immediate.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and I use a small amount this oil as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li> The Argan oil from InstaNatural is actually a unique blend of other essential oils with it, like coconut, jojoba, grapeseed, etc.</li>
            <li> My hair, by the way is bleached like white, and after four bleachings total, this is exactly what it needed.</li>
            <li> I use it every time I get out of the shower and a little more after I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair hair very soft and my curls are not dry.</li>
            <li> Applied it to my hair two hours prior to showering, and after washing it leaves my hair is very soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li> This is nice, my hair tends to be dry &amp; kinda dull looking.</li>

            <li> It works well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking greasy (as long as I don&#x27;t use to much).</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to my regular conditioner to make it more of a deep conditioning treatment.  </li>
            <li> She has finally put away her flat iron and can get ready to leave the house in under an hour!</li>
            <li> About an hour later, I took a shower and washed my hair as normal.</li>
            <li> I massaged this through my hair,  left it on for 15 minutes then washed and conditioned my hair normally</li>
            <li> I towel dried my hair and my waves bounced into place without a weighed down feeling and it air dried beautifully and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> Only thing I dislike about it, is the smell, although that technically means it is really pure oils, no addition of scent to it.</li>
            <li> , it looked so dull, this product has brought back a more youthful look to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for offering this at such a low price.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fickle and while one product will work one month, the next month I won’t get the same results.  </li>
            <li> I love that this product is not tested on animals and also offers a money-back guarantee if you are not happy with it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve noticed that if I apply this product in my hair (while wet) before I go to sleep, my hair is much more manageable in the morning and less frizzy!</li>
            <li> My hair started to show signs of life after the first use and after about the 3rd or 4th time of using this on my hair there was not signs of any damaged hair or dry brittle frizzy out of control hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it as a styling aid, but in small amounts I can see it being useful for certain types of hair, particularly hair that is left to air dry.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and have been looking for something that works like this for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is light and non-oily and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit of this oil really goes a long way to conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> I only used it once so far and have noticed a difference in the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> One treatment left in for 15 minutes and her hair was soft and wavy and controllable.  </li>
            <li> bringing out my natural red highlights and a create glow.</li>
            <li> I have been using old products trying to get it back to a manageable place.  </li>
            <li> Paid too much for really no results...</li>
            <li> When I washed it out the next day I noticed immediately how shiny and soft my hair was.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Argan Oil Hair Treatment and Elixir is so natural that it is only made 100% from plant based oils.  </li>
            <li> I even used it after my Epilepsy Testing and it removed the glue from the probes in my hair and made my hair extra soft and shiny</li>
            <li> I even used it after my Epilepsy Testing and it removed the glue from the probes in my hair and made my hair extra soft and shiny</li>
            <li> have discovered that it gives my natural sandy, red hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even been told even that the bottom of my feet feel baby soft after applying this product regularly.</li>
            <li> This left my hair feeling so silky and soft.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s barely even noticeable.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m always on the look out for as natural things as I can find to use for personal use.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when I woke up and brushed my hair to see NO grease!</li>
            <li> Leaving it on overnight then wake up to shampoo n rinse leaving my hair not only soft but shiny without the oily feeling.  </li>
            <li> It is shiny, soft and I can see a big improvement with my split ends.</li>
            <li> I love this oil I put 2 pumps on my thick long hair after I shower</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not completely satisfied with the product, just contact them and they&#x27;ll give you a full refund (no need to return the bottle).</li>
            <li> so of course I&#x27;m game to try as many as I can..</li>
            <li> I know sometimes reading these reviews can make you skeptical, but this review is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li> One thing I wanted to add was the oil is in a bottle with a pump, you can use as little or more without the mess of trying to pour oil out and it ends up everywhere</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use and a small amount of oil goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have recently began to have dry and itchy scalp, and it has been very bothersome to me.  </li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s now and still battling coarse, puffy, wavy-to-curly, frizzy, thick, easily tangled, crispy hair.</li>
            <li> After the first use of the Argan Oil, I noticed less hair in my brush.</li>
            <li> This oil is great, very thin, and doesn&#x27;t weight hair down.</li>
            <li> This oil is for all hair types, my hair is really curly and it have a mind of his own, my ends are horrible, they are super dry; and my hair overall is really frizzy</li>
            <li> usually wash my hair every 2-3 days, and for the last couple weeks after I get out of the shower, I put a few drops of this in my hair, and it is amazing.  </li>
            <li> My hair loss is so extreme that I am resigned to wearing wigs or hats much of the time when I&#x27;m away from the house.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and again my hair was full of shine and was soft.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Even my grey hairs were soft!</li>
            <li> I may have been looking for a more dramatic difference, but I do think the product helps.  </li>
            <li> Not much growth so far just 1 week so far</li>
            <li> I wanted a more natural solution that wouldn&#x27;t make me feel guilty while dabbing product on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Bought it for my straight thick hair and it works really well.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way, so this 4 fluid ounce bottle will last a while and keep you frizz free all summer long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a very busy lifestyle and with gym workouts, my hair can be neglected and ultimately dry, course, unmanageable with split ends.  </li>
            <li> There was no significant shine improvement, but it may take a longer treatment time for this to become evident.  </li>
            <li> I figured it would still dry out over night, but was pleasantly surprised this morning when I woke up!</li>
            <li> I received this quickly and was not able to use it until last night on my hair.</li>
            <li> but once again I have to say I&#x27;m a bit disappointed because I already have an Argan oil mask product that I was happy with using for overnights.  </li>
            <li> i am an african american women who has recently transitioned from relaxer to natural.  </li>
            <li> It appears as though my hair cuticles are suddenly (and finally) behaving (as though a curse/ magic spell was broken).</li>
            <li> When I tried it on my hair, I pumped a couple times around my palms and rubbed it straight on my scalp, then worked my way down to my hair</li>
            <li> I am with all the high reviews and such, I expected to see results.</li>
            <li> Unlike before, it does not get huge, and I don&#x27;t need to tame it with hair elastics or any other products.  </li>
            <li> This works, but there will be a little trial-and-error because you don&#x27;t need a lot of this product even though you&#x27;ll want to, but a little sure does go a long way with this</li>
            <li> My 4 year old has very long hair.</li>
            <li> But it left my hair light and slightly glossier with a bit less frizz.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and it has helped my ends not look so dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Now, I let it dry naturally</li>
            <li> For me I wanted something to help with my dry scalp and also keep my hair soft and shinny between washes.  </li>
            <li> I try a lot of products for my dry, naturally curly hair and this is a god one.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is naturally course and dry</li>
            <li> My hair was much softer, silkier, less frizzy and had volume.</li>
            <li> Havent used it long enough, but leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> Now, we&#x27;ve tried all those oils separately and though they work pretty well in my hair, my daughter&#x27;s hair after awhile goes back to that dried</li>
            <li> I  have to be careful with conditioners as my hair can look weighed down and greasy if it isn&#x27;t absorbed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight enough to use on my difficult but very fine hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for people who want to try a natural leave-in conditioner especially if they have dry, thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Slowly I am noticing that my hair has more volume and seeing less damage from the heat.</li>
            <li> Huge mistake as she left me with inches of dry, brittle, frizzy, dull hair.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, silky and shiny and smoothes away the dry frizzies!</li>
            <li> It states can be used within 10 minutes off application and use as much as needed but remember a little goes</li>
            <li> So little does so much as a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Most of the oil was put on the ends and the middle of my hair and very little on the roots.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used as a serum, but you should only use a small dot , because it will make your hair oily.</li>
            <li> My daughter who is bi-racial, Asian, African American and Caucasian has really really tight curls, super frizzy and really dried.</li>
            <li> I am a big user of hair serums for frizz control and use deep conditioners to treat damage from heat like flat ironing and blow drying.</li>
            <li> main point is little goes looong way.</li>
            <li> Did moisturize my scalp, but left my hair flat and oily.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for an all natural way to control my frizzy ends that could be used on wet or dry hair</li>
            <li> In the past, when I did this much damage to my hair I paid for it dearly...</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the review and people complaint about it did not have Argan oil as first ingredient.</li>
            <li> And I was also constantly worried that all of these products must contain damaging chemicals ruining my hair in the long run</li>
            <li> Then about 1 or 2 times a week I will use this as a hour long deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> This is a big bottle and it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> flat.</li>
            <li> It cut down the time it took for my hair to get a flat soft feel</li>
            <li> The argan oil keeps my hair hydrated and prevents it from turning into a frizzy mess down here in hot and HUMID south</li>
            <li> I wil buy again as it leaves my hair soft, not weighed down and frizz reduced.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that when my package arrived, the top was slightly unscrewed and a little bit leaked out.</li>
            <li> I have been told that wetting your hair daily can dry it out.  </li>
            <li> my hair didn&#x27;t feel dry, and actually feels and looks thicker.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Immediately after I applied the Argan Oil Hair Treatment, the dry scalp feeling I had lingering constantly that was bothering my every being is NO LONGER there!  </li>
            <li> but I actually skipped the dry oil</li>
            <li> I apply a small drop on my hair before blow drying and a small drop after blow drying to smooth my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am currently wearing a short hair, wet hair cut.  </li>
            <li> It works great as a heat protector when I straighten my hair, and I am probably going to be testing this bad boy out as a moisturizer and on my stretch marks to see if it helps my skin!</li>
            <li> I have used this treatment once on my hair &amp; my daughters hair, suddenly my hands got red &amp; extremely itchy.</li>
            <li> Since this one is mixed with other oils, it last until it&#x27;s gone!</li>
            <li> Start off by using a very little at first as it only takes a little bit.</li>
            <li> and I dabbed just a bit on my palm and spread it all over my dry hair before flat ironing it.</li>
            <li> I blow dry it a couple times a month and flat iron it a couple times a year.</li>
            <li> Or nothing can really combat the hard water here.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Doing so, I really do think it helps restore the shine in my hair (since color treated hair can get dull).</li>
            <li> Plus I wanted my hair slick and smooth not rock hard as gel would make it.</li>
            <li> This Argan oil treatment leaves your hair soft and silky but not weighed down!</li>
            <li> As weird as this may sound, I am feeling &amp;#34;accomplished&amp;#34; today.  </li>
            <li> love the fact that this oil has no preservatives, chemicals or artificial fragrances added to it.</li>
            <li> My hair has been driving me crazy because it does not even feel like my hair any more.</li>
            <li> so you cannot leave it on for long time.</li>
            <li> it was the weekend home with my family, but I would not recommend doing the treatment this long if you have plans on going out.</li>
            <li> I have wavy frizzy long hair.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is long and looked damaged.  </li>
            <li> a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she was taking too long to use</li>
            <li> (I guess you can consider it long) and</li>
            <li> so be careful if you are using this not as a deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have used coconut oil for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money trying different shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Works well on my long hair.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair</li>
            <li> The serum is thick and makes your hair very oily.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dull, dry, and very brittle.</li>
            <li> I only need to use less than a palmful and it spreads evenly (I have pretty long and thick hair), this has lasted me a long time</li>
            <li> I have actually also used it on my hands and legs, and with the dry and cold weather, it has definitely kept my skin moisturized and smooth.  </li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In just a few days, I&#x27;ve noticed a marked improvement in my dry overly color damaged ends.</li>
            <li> By the second week there was significantly less breakage at the ends and some shine had actually returned.  </li>
            <li> I tried different amounts and I tried using both on wet and on dry hair.</li>
            <li> Left my hair oily when applied wet or dry and remained frizzy after shampooing....</li>
            <li> My scalp isn&#x27;t itchy or dry as long as I keep this around to help tame this natural mane.</li>
            <li> I have medium length, loose curly, blonde, unprocessed hair (no dyes or chemicals).</li>
            <li> I think a deep treatment like that once every week or even every other week will work for me.</li>
            <li> My fiance has not seen the same softening results from this product as we have seen when he has used other brands of beard/hair oil.</li>
            <li> I have VERY long hair (almost to my knees), and I like to use this for the ends after a shower.  </li>
            <li> hair is very long</li>
            <li> It looks a lot shinier, healthier and stays moist for a very very long time.</li>
            <li> : I wish I could sound less dramatic</li>
            <li> This has been a miracle on my daughter&#x27;s ultra dry hair.</li>
            <li> I take this into the shower with me and put it all over my dry hair</li>
            <li> I use a flat-iron and my hair is damaged and dry.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s so dry</li>
            <li> After my hair is dry</li>
            <li> I use it as a leave in treatment before I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> If you have dry hands to put this on every-time you washed your hands.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair and it started to dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry on the ends.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference after using in my dry damaged hair.</li>
            <li> and I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have dry hair, so it helps with that without leaving it to oily.</li>
            <li> I applied it before I blew my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I was driving in snow two weeks before Thanksgiving- my skin has been getting extremely dry</li>
            <li> I used it to help my dry scalp</li>
            <li> it being dry</li>
            <li> Every time I shave it seems like it makes my legs dry and itching</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely dry and I needed something to keep it from looking so brittle.  </li>
            <li> It’s usually dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> you have dry, lifeless, or brittle hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t apply heat to my hair, but it still is frizzy, dry and has split ends.</li>
            <li> and then I let it air dry</li>
            <li> For the hair treatment, i&#x27;ve used it to moisturize my dry scalp and my hair.</li>
            <li> For her I wanted something to help with her dry scalp and her hair drying out.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry and straighten my hair so often</li>
            <li> I have dry hair</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to help your dry hair this is the product for you.  </li>
            <li> but if all over, too greasy even if you have extremely dry hair.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m straightening my hair I put it in before I blow dry.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry and brittle.</li>
            <li> It has restored life to my dry, brittle, over processed hair.</li>
            <li> I let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> I THINK THAT WHY MY HAIR ALWAYS DRY AND DAMAGE.  </li>
            <li> There must be only a few drops inside those bottles because I never saw what the big &amp;#34;Argan&amp;#34; fuss was over!    </li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for 14 years now, I have dark brown hair and the grey hairs are taking over, they come in very coarse and frizzy, this Aryan oil treatment has been a lifesaver.  </li>
            <li> less tangles (I have thinning hair, but is very coarse (African American, tight coils).</li>
            <li> I really like the product my hair is dry  and brittle due to California hard water  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, long hair that I have never colored, and the air is so dry where I live that no matter what product I applied my hair looked dry and frizzy - especially on the day I washed my hair.  </li>
            <li> My son is mixed and I have trouble keeping his hair from looking frizzy or flat, this helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I was not able to use it as a leave-in conditioner and natural styling product.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiney, soft, and after using it a few times it looks like my split ends are gone!</li>
            <li> I coated my hair (l have long hair past mid back) then put it up in a bun and slept with the oil in.</li>
            <li> loosely twisting portions of hair shaft like a rope) and combed out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair if used properly.</li>
            <li> The Argan Oil is lightweight and does not weigh down the individual hairs.  </li>
            <li> I am planning to continue using this as a deep conditioner for my hair every week or every other week!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy other products from this seller!</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks of using this product continuously every day, I had waved goodbye to my itchy and dry scalp!  </li>
            <li> Gives lots of shine to my really dry ends!</li>
            <li> I left it in for a about a half hour then washed my hair.</li>
            <li> I am a Black Male.</li>
            <li> Tried it quite a bit in wet &amp; dry hair, as a mask and also as leave in.  </li>
            <li> but I usually left it in for half an hour before showering.</li>
            <li> I am a little less conscious of hair care.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry, curly hair.</li>
            <li> it has been very dry already this winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ends were very dry but since using this they are silky.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy, thick, dry, course hair that damages and gets</li>
            <li> It did not work nearly as well as other hair treatments I&#x27;ve tried on the past.</li>
            <li> Every other product I&#x27;ve ever tried - and there have been countless - always ends up weighing down my hair, and still turn my hair frizzy once I get out into the humidity.  </li>
            <li> I applied and brushed a little into my hair at night and it appeared to be a bit greasy, so I pinned my hair up.</li>
            <li> and you only need a little --</li>
            <li> I keep this magic serum in my office and on a humid bad hair day, have instant relief by putting a few drops in my palms and massaging my scalp.</li>
            <li> I still use this oil and hope this will stop the hair fall at least completely</li>
            <li> Now, given that, after I shampooed my hair and was done showering, my hair did feel softer and easier to comb through wet.</li>
            <li> I could wet my hair, put it in and shave or wash up, then rinse it out and shampoo.</li>
            <li> Although this is still an oil treatment so it does not really mist</li>
            <li> I usually wet it</li>
            <li> i added a few drops to my regular conditioner and applied to my hair.</li>
            <li> The really expensive ones are full of synthetic ingredients and fragrances and argan oil is usually the last ingredient on the list.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying again once empty.</li>
            <li> I use it both as an everyday leave in conditioner and an overnight deep conditioner once a week.</li>
            <li> I left it in my hair for a few hours and kept smelling diarrhea throughout.</li>
            <li> I use the Argan Oil in my hair, especially on the dried ends, and it softens and conditions my hair overnight.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just what I expected.</li>
            <li> Takes only a few drops in wet hair...also bought a bottle for my  daughter &amp; granddaughter.</li>
            <li> Since my hair is very dry due to coloring, I tried this out as an overnight hair treatment to start.</li>
            <li> The serum is different than just plain Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I can see where it might make some people look oily, but if you have course hair like mine that is naturally very dry, I would recommend this a thousand times over!</li>
            <li> Not only does this help tame it on frizzy days, it&#x27;s making the ends softer and they aren&#x27;t splitting like they were before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it regularly on my hair as a deep conditioner, and have already seen serious results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It made my dry ends smooth and my wavy hair practically straight without the nasty spilt ends I always get...</li>
            <li> I use this Argan oil after straightening my hair to make my hair look healthier and less dry.</li>
            <li> But after being outside on a hot &amp; muggy summer day, it poofed up just as it always</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way even for my hair.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> Trust me while experimenting with this a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Just a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> I must be one of those unfortunate people on this planet with very course, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Before I got it, the other sprays didn&#x27;t do the trick by themselves and my hair would get dryer and dryer each day between shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Do keep in mind that a little goes a LONG way!  </li>
            <li> This was given as a gift to a daughter who lives in the east and was having extreme frizzies and flyaway hair.  </li>
            <li> I have just past the shoulder length hair and apply to the bottom third while still damp.  </li>
            <li> The texture of my hair has become extremely course.  </li>
            <li> This is the biggest waste of my money in a long time.</li>
            <li> i am looking forward to try other porduct from Instanatural.</li>
            <li> And a FYI, a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use curling irons but do use the other two.</li>
            <li> I am a natural dirty blonde, but I color my hair every 6 weeks to a lighter shade of blonde.</li>
            <li> There are no chemicals or preservatives added, they do not test on animals and they even offer a 100% money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> I rub only a small spray drop into my hair after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I rub only a small spray drop into my hair after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> and I felt I had no choice other than to trust them.</li>
            <li> Even with such a small amount we often feel that it is too oily a product.</li>
            <li> Definitely not on par with the brand I usually purchase from Sephora.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s WAY too oily to just wear in my hair, but I&#x27;ve been mixing it with some other oils and using it as night treatment and that&#x27;s working well for me.</li>
            <li> I HAVE LONG HAIR AND SHAMPOO EVERYDAY.  </li>
            <li> No more having to buy multiple oil because this is an all in one product.</li>
            <li> I use about half a teaspoon of the oil on my long hair but use less if you have shorter</li>
            <li> I have very thick coarse hair and this just put life back into it.</li>
            <li> The problem is that my hair is always dry and frizzy and never smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> (it also adds on another half hour of blow drying time, no thanks).  </li>
            <li> so i was anxious to see how it looked wet and dry.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and trust me, all you need is a little.</li>
            <li> I styled as usual with a root enhancer and blow dry which I ususally finish with a dry oil to give a little shine</li>
            <li> It cost much less than other products</li>
            <li> I am a black female with 3 months of transition hair (from perm to natural) and I have very thin hair.</li>
            <li> Used it quite a few times over the past several weeks.  </li>
            <li> have thick asian hair</li>
            <li> what a waste of money spent that did nothing to my hair but make it greasy all over again.</li>
            <li> Having natural African American hair, I need an oil that doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down and an oil that doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> I have hair that tends to want to dry out, especially on the ends, it&#x27;s very thick and wavy/curly.</li>
            <li> that is down to my waist.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Your hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or weighed down.  </li>
            <li> It keeps it moisturized and cut down on blow drying time.</li>
            <li> I have hair down pass my waist</li>
            <li> I use it as a pre-treatment (10 minutes) before shampooing and then another small dab after the towel dry for a leave-in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My hair is about 3 inches past my shoulders so the ends tend to get a bit dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed, since I thought I would be able to use this as a leave-in protectant on my hair, but it is too heavy for a leave-in treatment.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so apply a small amount to start.</li>
            <li> I used to use a few different products to tone it down, but lately it had just lost</li>
            <li> The one thing I would recommend is that if you have oily hair (like I do), don&#x27;t use conditioner AND this, because it will weigh hair down and make it look like a soupy, greasy mess.</li>
            <li> I previously gave the product a 5 star rating.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed less fall out from my hair since adding this to my routine.</li>
            <li> but if I&#x27;m inside, in the ac, it does make my hair softer and less frizzy, a lot less tangled.</li>
            <li> I think it would work wonders on women with less bothersome hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also made my hair much less frizzy and seems to have helped fight off humidity caused craziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was slightly less brittle.</li>
            <li> It also smoothed out my hair, making it less frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have seen less split ends since using hair treatment</li>
            <li> I spend days with that mess hidden up in a bun while I researched what to do.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not good, similar to edible oil.</li>
            <li> I have always worn my thick hair long</li>
            <li> so if you have thin hair you will barely need any otherwise your hair will look oily.</li>
            <li> so if you have thin hair you will barely need any otherwise your hair will look oily.</li>
            <li> I have very long and thick hair and use to dye it.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, past my shoulders, and coarse.  </li>
            <li> The scent of this product is a little disturbing, but it did seem to make my hair very soft and manageable,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to tame it and not to mention that I have really really long hair</li>
            <li> Since it’s a mixture of all kinds of oils, I was a little bit worried if it would leave my hair looking greasy</li>
            <li> I tried to put a little bit on after I washed my hands.</li>
            <li> I massage a little bit of oil on at night and shampoo in the morning.</li>
            <li> I purchased InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Treatment because I had a perm and felt the ends of my hair were a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> I also add a little bit of the oil into my homemade conditioner.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this product because my little girl has been in the hospital and has &amp;#34;hospital head&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> A little goes a looooong way</li>
            <li> Even as a little girl I used them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Argan Oil treatments for my hair in the past.  </li>
            <li> I usually shampoo every other day...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always a little nervous using these in case</li>
            <li> I have been using a little in my hair at night before bed, then wash in the morning.</li>
            <li> I use it after I have used your Argan oil shampoo, a little pool in the palm of my hand and rub them together and apply to my hair.</li>
            <li> but it is a little sticky feeling</li>
            <li> This product, in the smallest amounts on either wet or dry hair, leaves it greasy and worse than if I didn&#x27;t use anything at all.</li>
            <li> The down side is that it makes ur hair a little oily, but again all oils do!</li>
            <li> Then I put a few spritzes of Matrix Miracle Treat Lotion Spray and work that in.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops on the ends of my hair after every shower.</li>
            <li> I recently have processed my thin hair with highlights, and I knew I was going to need all the help I could get....</li>
            <li> Even after washing my hair it felt heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> My hair has had a rough time lately.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few weeks now.  </li>
            <li> I put a few drops in my hands, rubbed them together, then put it in my hair.</li>
            <li> but i think it helps with my frizziness when i let it in for a few minutes then</li>
            <li> I can honestly say I would not have survived that horrible hair time if it had not been for this argon oil hair treatment.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not primarily Argan Oil.  </li>
            <li> And this probably has something to do with me applying shampoo every time I shower for a few years now, which by the way you shouldn&#x27;t do.</li>
            <li> This exclusive (pleasure in a bottle) contains some heavy hitters:&lt;br /&gt;•shea butter</li>
            <li> You can read my full review below on my blog: [...]</li>
            <li> We use it everyday</li>
            <li> Protects from harsh shampoo.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair greasy, as other customers complained.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and it didnt make it flat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry to tell you that I&#x27;m not satisfied with this product, it have a strong smell , and it&#x27;s not just not working , but it made my hair so rough ,and I Followed the instruction very carefully :(</li>
            <li> Not a product junkie, but tried quite a bit of the serums, lotions and the like to tame my hair.</li>
            <li> I have to use a lot of product to tame the frizz.  </li>
            <li> Very, very slight scent</li>
            <li> Use it to help repair damage, tame frizz, give a finishing shine and manageability to your hair.</li>
            <li> My mother has tried everything for her frizzy and curly hair, and she still has yet to fully tame her locks.</li>
            <li> I have very hard to manage, tangle prone, dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty bad.</li>
            <li> With that being said, we&#x27;ve had the privilege to try out InstaNatural Argan + Coconut + Jojoba oil hair treatment &amp; elixir for the past few weeks or so.</li>
            <li> elixir is not too thick and it doesn’t weight down your hair.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it if you have dry hairs with broken ends.</li>
            <li> I have thin, dry and color treated hair.</li>
            <li> It seems to protect the hair from heat damage, at least a little.</li>
            <li> Also this oil has very little scent so can be used as substitute of anti frizz product or hair serum.</li>
            <li> She applies it to her hair an hour or so before showering, then she washes her hair as usual.</li>
            <li> Heat styling doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair as much as usual since I have been using this.  </li>
            <li> Usually you have to wait months to see results with products but with this...</li>
            <li> Not completely satisfied, wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;d like, and I usually end up just wrapping it in a bun to hide the frizziness.  </li>
            <li> No more ruining my hair blow drying and straightening.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I am a fan of Argon Oil.  </li>
            <li> I bought this brand randomly when I searched for the oil once my current brand ran out and was no longer offered.  </li>
            <li> I usually use two pumps of the bottle, rub my hands together and apply to my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I find the pump dispenser helps me to get even amounts for application without going overboard with the product.  </li>
            <li> No more frizzy, fuzzy bits at my temple, or ends.</li>
            <li> Not sure..</li>
            <li> Instead of using hair food like I usually</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also applied a small amount to my ends before blow drying and styling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay when smelling it in the bottle, but when putting it through my hair, it&#x27;s horrible.</li>
            <li> used a small amount of product and finger-combed it through, before wrapping my hair in a satin scarf at night.</li>
            <li> This product adds a lot of shine to your locks, and soaks into your scalp generously-so let me reiterate that just a small amount does the trick.</li>
            <li> You can use it during the day, but I usually use it at night as it goes on a bit greasy for my liking.  </li>
            <li> I use it once a week, putting a small amount on my hair before shampooing.  </li>
            <li> After blow drying, I add just a small drop, rubbed between my hands to my hair, and this small amount does not make may hair greasy</li>
            <li> Over the past year I&#x27;ve gained an interest in hair treatments to help fix damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it after a shower while my hair is still damp.</li>
            <li> I used this in my hair as directed and was not pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Some treatments are so heavy that the hair is matted down and looks worse from the treatment.  </li>
            <li> I got this oil as my hair is uber dry following a really bad perm  </li>
            <li> As crazy as it sounds, doing the oil soak actually made my hair less oily.</li>
            <li> Very heavy.</li>
            <li> I give very few 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I am not sure whether there is any regrowth of hair or not, but my Hair fall has been decreased or slowed down.</li>
            <li> felt that this product helped to manage my hair and repaired a lot of the dry, brittle trauma that I am unfortunately used to.</li>
            <li> Also, and know this is confusing because I just said we got this because of the unscented nature of the product, but this smells a bit musty to me.</li>
            <li> For someone with thick bulky hair like mine, it requires section by section application (when i say &amp;#34;section&amp;#34;, I am strictly talking about the salon style layered sections, NOT side-by-side and/or quadrant style).</li>
            <li> hair is thick, curly</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> The consistency is somewhat thick but, not sticky or heavy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as thick as Fakkai&#x27;s oil or Organix Morrocan Argan oil.  </li>
            <li> I have thick shoulder lenght hair</li>
            <li> I wanted to try this because it&#x27;s not as expensive as some of the other oils I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing they mean for this statement as the two-hour or overnight treatment because the direction say shampoo after treatment</li>
            <li> I mean come</li>
            <li> No more split ends!</li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy, but my hair is really really dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finding the right treatment for your hair can be very difficult and seem almost impossible at times.  </li>
            <li> If you have ever wasted money on expensive Argan oil Shampoos and conditioners, you are not alone.</li>
            <li> Not a good product at all despite all those labels on the bottle.</li>
            <li> The smell is not really good.</li>
            <li> The other argan product I bought at the same time was also awful.  </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s humid or hot my hair looks insane and it&#x27;s not even curly</li>
            <li> so usually it is very hard to detangle my hair.</li>
            <li> It helped keep my very thick, frizzy hair in control.</li>
            <li> I have very thick should length hair.</li>
            <li> like I hoped, but didn&#x27;t make anything worse either.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> It feels like a thin film is on our hands until you wash off.</li>
            <li> goodbye chapped winter lips and no fly away hair.</li>
            <li> And if you have thin hair, DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I have curly, thick hair and it gives it the moisture and de-frizzing that it desperately needs.</li>
            <li> Now this product helped my hair so much I have been sick and my hair got thin and started breaking horrible</li>
            <li> It smelled terrible and my hair started falling out not long after using it.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it sounds silly, but a writing partner introduced argan oil into one of our joint projects as a type of hair treatment and up until that point, I had never heard of it.</li>
            <li> Suspicious this is a fake product from China.  </li>
            <li> Just by adding this to my hair, I feel guilty that I have been neglecting my hair.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair greasy, and difficult to evenly apply.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this oil is just not for me.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that hair argan oil and did not want to use 100% Argan oil because it so expensive</li>
            <li> It did feel weird having oily hair</li>
            <li> There is just the slightest scent to the product, but it&#x27;s so faint</li>
            <li> Turns out I was wrong -</li>
            <li> I have used 100% cold pressed argan oil in the past but hated wasted $80 on a 2oz bottle that goes bad in a few weeks :(</li>
            <li> it is bad I had cut some of the front ends of and made it look ridiculous..</li>
            <li> I am very confused why it is &amp;#34; leave in conditioner&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is a very thin treatment-</li>
            <li> This does not have the artificial smell that a lot do.</li>
            <li> I use this to treat bamboo cutting boards.</li>
            <li> Makes me itch and break out like crazy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> Did not work and smells bad.</li>
            <li> Really bad product, stains clothes...</li>
            <li> I hate to give bad reviews, but this product isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the bottle shows all of these oils on the front side.</li>
            <li> I have bought three products from this company and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate when an oil serum is greasy and makes hair looked unwashed</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate bait and switch.</li>
            <li> I use this after a shower and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy but it does leave my hand a bit sticky which I found annoying.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed .</li>
            <li> This was an absolutely horrible product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> Nasty...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Argan oil is sure number one moisturizer for rough and coarse hair. It keeps my hair silky and smooth. It is nice that the smell is ok too.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty thin hair and without proper treatment, my hair gets tangled very easy. As I am getting older those hair pulled out while brushing started bothering me. This hair treatment blend leaves my hair just the way I want. Since it’s a mixture of all kinds of oils, I was a little bit worried if it would leave my hair looking greasy but it doesn’t! It has all my favorite oils I use for my skin care as well.</li>
            <li> My son is mixed and I have trouble keeping his hair from looking frizzy or flat, this helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I like this. Only problem is the oil stains my sheets through my head wrap.</li>
            <li> great product! hair feels soft and shiny, yet not oily. This product is a must.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is great for your body.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! And can honestly feel and see a difference in my hair. I use it as an overnight treatment once or twice a week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but not working as I hoped.  I don&#x27;t see much improvement</li>
            <li> This has been a miracle on my daughter&#x27;s ultra dry hair. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love using argan oil products in my hair.  Smells and feels good.</li>
            <li> I love this.  A little goes a long way.  It seems to strengthen your hair at the first use.</li>
            <li> Super happy about the product</li>
            <li> i received this product in return for an honest reciew&lt;br /&gt;im glad i did becuz i love it.&lt;br /&gt;what a great oil for your hair especially if yu have a try scalp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my daughter&#x27;s ethnic brittle hair for over 3 weeks now. I have to admit that I have seen a positive difference in her hair. It hasn&#x27;t been breaking off as easily as before, resulting in fewer split ends, almost none at all. I can only believe that if I continue the treatment, it will her help her hair in it&#x27;s totality. I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because of the scent. It&#x27;s unpleasant. I mix it in with another nourishing creme to try and disguise it. I want to try another product with a better scent, but if I have to come back to this one, I will definitely update.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be more of a serum, but it&#x27;s more of a thin oil and you can&#x27;t apply too much or it will leave your hair oily</li>
            <li> I like everything about this product except the smell, but considering how wonderful this product works, it is something can be looked past! I take this into the shower with me and put it all over my dry hair and then I do all my shaving, then I rinse it out. I then shampoo and rinse and I then use the InstaNatural Hair Mask they sell, and then scrub my body and do everything else I do in the shower and then rinse it out! Omg, my hair hasn&#x27;t been this healthy in years! It says this is leave in conditioner, and maybe for someone that has dry or damaged hair or kid that gets tangles easily, this would be perfect for you, but my hair is already oily so putting it on dry first works perfect for me!! I was given the chance to review this product on my blog for testing purposes and I am soooo glad I did!! I would definitely recommend this product, I promise you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
            <li> I really love argan oil. I have used argan oil on my hair for about 2 years now. I had the opportunity to review this argan oil from InstaNatural and I love it. It makes your hair feel wonderful and get rid of the frizz. Make your hair smooth and manageable. I would recommend this to anyone who has frizzy hair. I have yet to try it on my face or nails but I would almost bet that it would work for them too.</li>
            <li> Okay, so I have been watching the Argan Oil thing for a long time. I use a flat-iron and my hair is damaged and dry. I figured this was worth a shot and was pleased to get a sample to review. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now, and I am impressed. The one thing I would recommend is that if you have oily hair (like I do), don&#x27;t use conditioner AND this, because it will weigh hair down and make it look like a soupy, greasy mess. I love how soft and bouncy my hair is with this.</li>
            <li> Love it! Use it on my hair and my sons hair. A great conditioning treatment pre-wash, and as a leave in after the shower. Gives our hair shine and softness. A little goes a long way, so apply a small amount to start.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time. The only con I have about Instanatural product is all their bottles are glass. It&#x27;s very environmental friendly because it&#x27;s glass, but at the same time if u accidental drop it there goes your product. The product itself is great. Having natural African American hair, I need an oil that doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down and an oil that doesn&#x27;t smell bad. This oil is perfect.</li>
            <li> I love InstaNatural products.  I got this oil as my hair is uber dry following a really bad perm  (oh why did I do it? haha).  Anyway, I put this oil in my hair directly after shampooing, conditioning, and towel drying my hair.  Since it&#x27;s so dry I use a dime sized amount in my palm, rub my hands together, then work through the front of my hair.  Then repeat on the back.  I try not to get it too close to my roots as I have fine hair and it could be greasy if I do that.  It works so well that I can comb through my hair after doing it.  Then I put a few spritzes of Matrix Miracle Treat Lotion Spray and work that in.  (I alternate the Matrix with Proganix Quench Leave-in Moisture).  Then I put about 6 spritzes of It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Silk Leave-in.  I know it sounds crazy, but my hair is really really dry and it drinks these products up and doesn&#x27;t look greasy at all.  After my hair is dry I touch it up with a 3/8&amp;#34; curling iron (Hot Tools makes a great one).  Then after all that I spray my hair with Proganix Anti-fade weightless argon oil + UV protection which adds a nice shine to my hair.  With all this work, I don&#x27;t do my hair often--twice a week and I&#x27;m good.  The Argon Oil Hair Treatment works wonders.  I&#x27;d never skip that first step as it makes my hair soft, manageable, and shiny.  Before I got it, the other sprays didn&#x27;t do the trick by themselves and my hair would get dryer and dryer each day between shampoos.  Thank you InstaNatural and Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have used this treatment once on my hair &amp; my daughters hair, suddenly my hands got red &amp; extremely itchy. I don&#x27;t feel comfortable applying it. Not recommend people with sensitive skin, didn&#x27;t like the smell of the treatment once on my hair but it did work on my frizzy hair that day.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle in a bottle. Makes hair very shiny, moisturized and manageable. Love, love, love. A must buy!</li>
            <li> It leaves hair soft and it adds a lot of shine. There&#x27;s some frizz control. However,  I do find my hair is easier to style.</li>
            <li> I love it on my skin as well as my hair. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> I love this actually, I leave it in my hair for about an hour or so. Than wash it out. My hair is left silky, shiny, and smooth. This does not have the artificial smell that a lot do. Pure argan oil does not have a pleasant smell, but that does not bother me. This is also good for your cuticles! I have used it for that purpose as well. Just let it soak on your hands for 5minutes, than wash off with a mild soap and warm water. your cuticles are soft, and easily ready to push back!  Complementary product received for review.</li>
            <li> This Argan oil hair treatment is light, non greasy. It made my hair soft and shiny. Also this oil has very little scent so can be used as substitute of anti frizz product or hair serum. I like it, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I have always worn my thick hair long that is down to my waist.  I have a very busy lifestyle and with gym workouts, my hair can be neglected and ultimately dry, course, unmanageable with split ends.  I go through a lot of hair products who &#x27;say&#x27; it would help damaged hair, but if I try it and it doesn&#x27;t work - it gets tossed and on to the next hair product.  i decided to try Argan Oil as I have read about the healing properties of this oil.  Three words:  I LOVE IT.  A little goes a long way even for my hair.  I use it as a pre-treatment (10 minutes) before shampooing and then another small dab after the towel dry for a leave-in conditioner.  It made my hair so soft, silky and manageable.  So glad I found you!</li>
            <li> This hair oil is amazing, it leaves my hair feeling hydrated and healthy. This and a non-sulphate shampoo will help your hair stay healthy. I only need to use less than a palmful and it spreads evenly (I have pretty long and thick hair), this has lasted me a long time and I expect it to last another 6 months to a year, though I don&#x27;t use it every day.</li>
            <li> I have tried many hair oils this one is by far the best one. I LOVE IT! I use it as a leave in treatment before I blow dry my hair. I get FABULOUS results.</li>
            <li> This hair treatment left my hair and scalp feeling moisturized and fresh. My hair felt softer and rejuvenated. I recommend this product for anyone who needs a a great hair treatment for their dry hair because I have only used it twice and I already notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my cuticles. I have super dry ones. So I have been putting it on there anywhere from one to fives a day. I tried to put a little bit on after I washed my hands. That is a great habit to get into. If you have dry hands to put this on every-time you washed your hands. I am using it all the way up the back of the hands. I am also using this on my feet. I am noticing they are softer. I am doing this before bed then putting on a pair of socks and then going to bed. So the warmth can help heal my feet. Another great place to use this on on the tips through half way up the shaft. I leave it on for a while. Then later washing it out of my hair. I an noticing my hair is softer and looking my healthier. I see my hair not as frizzy which is nice to have. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience!</li>
            <li> Not only does it work wonders on my hair, but it&#x27;s great for diaper rash and baby skin, too! I love it!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff. She is a big fan of Argan Oil for her hair and was thrilled that this product came with a spray pump for easier application. And there is no doubt that her regimen is working.  She applies it to her hair an hour or so before showering, then she washes her hair as usual. It looks healthy and is super soft.</li>
            <li> I love this argan oil hair treatment. really works great to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried the product once as a deep conditioning treatment. I left it in for a about a half hour then washed my hair. I was surprised that it washed out easily and didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down afterwards because it seems so oily.  But it left my hair light and slightly glossier with a bit less frizz.  I will continue to use it about once a week. I am hoping continual use will really keep the frizz down as the weather gets more humid. I didn&#x27;t use it as a styling aid, but in small amounts I can see it being useful for certain types of hair, particularly hair that is left to air dry. I may have been looking for a more dramatic difference, but I do think the product helps.  Update! I put a few drops on the ends of my hair after every shower. (For a few months now) My hairdresser says that my hair has never been healthier, and if I forget I can easily tell a difference in my hair. I will buy it again when I run out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like it because too oily after put it on. It is for hair treatment so you cannot leave it on for long time.</li>
            <li> Have only had time to use this once, I have very curly hair,which tends to be dry,especially the last 6 inches of the length, worked this in,put on a shower cap to contain my body heat, left it on for 2 or 3 hours while I did some chores around the house, washed and conditioned like normal, was very pleased, soft silky hair that I didn&#x27;t have to yank a comb through, but my curls where there and not weighed down or greasy. I think a deep treatment like that once every week or even every other week will work for me.</li>
            <li> Stops facial hair breakage.</li>
            <li> Really becoming a fan of InstaNatural.  This is one of three products I&#x27;ve tried of theirs and they are very impressive.  I left this on overnight and washed my hair in the morning and it was soft as silk.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Argan Oil and of InstaNatural. I received a sample of this Argan Oil Hair Treatment for review. The treatment is a mix of natural oils that condition the hair and add shine. It contains a cocktail of oils that are known to be beneficial for hair including Argan, coconut, shea, jojoba and others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have long (mid-back length), fine hair with dry, damaged ends and oily roots. I guess I have combination hair.  I  have to be careful with conditioners as my hair can look weighed down and greasy if it isn&#x27;t absorbed. I have had good luck with using Argan oil on my hair and also with coconut oil (and with InstaNatural&#x27;s hair mask). Unfortunately, I found this treatment conditions my hair nicely but easily even can make it too greasy. I was not able to use it as a leave-in conditioner and natural styling product. I think it would be fabulous for someone with thicker, dryer hair. I am able to use it though. I think the issue for me might be the shea butter. I love to use shea butter  on my  skin and for deep conditioning masks, but have never been able to use it in my hair without my hair looking greasy. Shea butter is great for others I know who have thicker hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have actually been using it as a rinse out conditioner--just a drop. When I do that my hair feels soft and looks shiny. Heat styling doesn&#x27;t seem to damage my hair as much as usual since I have been using this.  Of course, your miles may vary. The oils used are all known to be beneficial moisturizers and conditioners for the hair. I find the scent very mild, in fact I don&#x27;t really recall any particular scent. A little goes a long way so I expect this bottle will last months even with daily use. I recommend this for people who want to try a natural leave-in conditioner especially if they have dry, thicker hair. It is also nice as a oil based rinse out conditioner or overnight hair and scalp treatment for fine hair like mine.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty bad. gag</li>
            <li> Love the oil :) it makes my hair so soft and had a beautiful shine</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner for both hair and skin.</li>
            <li> when i got this.. it was a third of the way gone because it had leaked.. so ended up just throwing it away because it got everywhere..</li>
            <li> It makes my hair strong and strength</li>
            <li> Great product!!! I already purchased more!!!</li>
            <li> I use this for my beard, best treatment I&#x27;ve used, very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love this!  Applied it to my hair two hours prior to showering, and after washing it leaves my hair is very soft and shiny!  I am planning to continue using this as a deep conditioner for my hair every week or every other week!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only 2 weeks and I have already seen a difference.  My hair is softer and shinier.  I massage a little bit of oil on at night and shampoo in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. The product is light and does not weight my hair down and my hair feel so smooth.</li>
            <li> Great for Body and Hair!!!</li>
            <li> No complaints. Not too sticky. Mild smell. Shipped in nice package.</li>
            <li> My beard is now soft as a kitten, dense as the core of a dying star, and glows with the fury of a thousand suns.  This product also smells good, isn&#x27;t as greasy as other products I&#x27;ve used in the past, and you get more for less money.  10/10 would put on my face again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very moisturizing! I use it strictly as a hair mask, and my hair already feels healthier. I don&#x27;t use it as a hot iron oil, as it&#x27;s very oily. But for a hair mask, it&#x27;s amazing!!</li>
            <li> I really like this hair treatment. The smell is mild and it absorbs rather quickly. I have naturally curly hair and it has helped my ends not look so dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Does a great job taming my dry summer hair. Even after not using for a day or two, my hair is perfectly conditioned after shampooing and I shampoo every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Revonda Jones</li>
            <li> yessssssss. I use this Argan oil after straightening my hair to make my hair look healthier and less dry. A little goes a long way so it lasts for months.</li>
            <li> My hair has new life! I typically end up with some light frizzes all over my head, but this helps relax those and my hair feels much healthier. It&#x27;s shiny, bouncy, and well moisturized. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Havent used it long enough, but leaves hair soft.</li>
            <li> Love it. Use it for my face and hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair hair very soft and my curls are not dry. So far this is a great product</li>
            <li> 2 Weeks and i still see no changes, think i need to wait</li>
            <li> I recently have processed my thin hair with highlights, and I knew I was going to need all the help I could get....So I tried this product. I must say, I have been so happy!!!! I can comb through my hair with no problem. I have been alternating the application of this product between putting this on at night before I go to bed- and then washing it out during my morning shower- and by heating some of it up in the microwave and putting it on for 10 to 20 minutes before I shower. In the past, when I did this much damage to my hair I paid for it dearly...it would take me 20 minutes just to brush my hair...it is no longer an issue with this treatment!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am excited to try other products from this company :-)</li>
            <li> I like this. It makes my hair feel wonderful. Know that it is oil and not in a spray bottle. I use it at night on my hair and hands.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product! I like the fact that my hair looks a lot more sophisticated.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase!  Everything shipped and arrived as quickly as promised.  It is a very good product and a great value for the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now and it does nothing for my 4c hair. Still searching for the product that works vest for me. Oddly enough I have added it to other things to use on my skin because of the many oils in it and it makes NY skin feel soft.</li>
            <li> Awesome will buy again.  Did receive for review. I will buy again</li>
            <li> I washed my hair and it started to dry. My hair is dry on the ends.  So I put this on and really focused on the ends and I can really say it added lots of moisture and sheen. Not too greasy. No smelly odors either. Thank you. I like it!!</li>
            <li> If you have ever wasted money on expensive Argan oil Shampoos and conditioners, you are not alone. There must be only a few drops inside those bottles because I never saw what the big &amp;#34;Argan&amp;#34; fuss was over!    So, on a whim, I purchased this Argan oil at a discount in exchange for my honest review, and the results for me were amazing. My hair is thick, past my shoulders, and coarse.  I rubbed a generous quarter sized amount from ends to roots and left it on for 2 whole days as a treatment (I wasn&#x27;t going anywhere being it was the weekend home with my family, but I would not recommend doing the treatment this long if you have plans on going out. Your hair will look oily). I shampooed my hair twice and conditioned it once, and BAM. My hair had brilliant shine after drying and straightening it. I normally use a smoothing serum after straightening too, but it was not needed. My hair was and still is soft and shiny even the day after.    The Argan oil from InstaNatural is actually a unique blend of other essential oils with it, like coconut, jojoba, grapeseed, etc. Which, I like a lot. Surprisingly, it has no tropical fragrance though. As I thought it might with the coconut oil.    Now, the next day after my treatment, my hair was still as shiny, not weighed or greasy looking, just a healthy state that I have not seen in a long time.    Cons? This may be too much for fine hair, and what may work better for fine hair is a keratin mask treatment. Let me just note that I also attached some pictures of my hair after my treatment and that my hair is NEVER this shiny. The only time I had ever got it this shiny was when I use to use a shine spray, but that was just coating my hair. I believe this a deep-down kind of healthy sheen.</li>
            <li> This is soooo perfect for my hair and scalp. My scalp isn&#x27;t itchy or dry as long as I keep this around to help tame this natural mane. Thanks for offering this at such a low price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference after using in my dry damaged hair. Will try again.</li>
            <li> My hair feels healthy and not so coarse anymore. I have very thick coarse hair and this just put life back into it. I haven&#x27;t done it over night yet but definitely should try since even just ten minutes feels like silk!</li>
            <li> Nice product. This is a great product, quality made.  Works well!  I got this on a promotion to provide my experience about it.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a couple of weeks, so waiting a month or so to see if it works!</li>
            <li> I was hopeful for this product but it made my hair have too much static. I have long hair, in good condition, a little course in texture. But when using this product it would be too flyaway. Too bad.</li>
            <li> I have been using Argan Oil for years and loved the way this product has my hair feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product; I love it! I also received excellent tips from the seller, as well. I used this on my hair overnight TWICE, and the results are amazing...  I just coated my hair and scalp with the oil, and then wrapped it in a towel before going to bed.  I washed my hair in the morning, and it has never been softer!  I am very pleased! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Another great product and non greasy ! My hair looks shiny. Don&#x27;t use too much.. a little goes a long way. Light scents!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair really soft!</li>
            <li> It works super well! I have pretty natural curls, they just need some help calming down the frizz in 60% humidity or higher! my only complaint is that when my package arrived, the top was slightly unscrewed and a little bit leaked out. none of my other products were damaged because the glass bottle is in a nice cardboard box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good leave in oil treatment but not as good as their Pure Argan Oil. It leaves my hair moisturized and calm but requires a lot more dosage than the Pure Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> Great product. I used thus on my hair before i washed my hair and my hair feels so soft and looks shiny. I love it.</li>
            <li> Did moisturize my scalp, but left my hair flat and oily.  Does not rinse out with water.  You have to shampoo out the product as mentioned in the instructions.  Alternatively I began using this treatment as a daily facial moisturizer; but then I started getting acne on my forehead and I have dry skin.  The only use I can think of for this product is a pre-shampoo hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry to tell you that I&#x27;m not satisfied with this product, it have a strong smell , and it&#x27;s not just not working , but it made my hair so rough ,and I Followed the instruction very carefully :( may be it just me !&lt;br /&gt;P.S:- I already send the bottle back .</li>
            <li> I love argan oil. I have very dry, curly hair. I color it and relax it which makes it even drier. This product is a godsend. My hair has never looked better. I love the amount I was given and the fact that it came along  with a spray attachment. Definitely a good buy!!</li>
            <li> Great for healing distressed hair!  Love to use overnight for healing.</li>
            <li> I purchased InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Treatment because I had a perm and felt the ends of my hair were a little frizzy. I only used it once so far and have noticed a difference in the texture of my hair. It was easy to use and washed out with regular shampoo. I intend to keep using it to give my hair a more natural look and feel, as well as conditioning it.</li>
            <li> I love argon oil and this is even better having such great ingredients in it. It really helps my dry hair feel smooth and not frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have VERY long hair (almost to my knees), and I like to use this for the ends after a shower.  Makes my hair so shiny and silky.  Do keep in mind that a little goes a LONG way!  Very happy with purchase and seller!</li>
            <li> It is okay but not something I would buy again.  Even after washing my hair it felt heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> My hair has had a rough time lately. I have been playing around with the right colors and highlights and to top it off it has been very dry already this winter.&lt;br /&gt;The Argan Oil Hair Treatment has been such relief to my split ends, my fly away hair that&#x27;s stands on end due to static and my dry itchy scalp, and who doesn&#x27;t enjoy silky smooth hair!&lt;br /&gt;The best part about the Argan Treatment is that you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to see and feel results. Usually you have to wait months to see results with products but with this...I could see a difference right away. I love that I got to review this but what I love more is when I find a new product to love.</li>
            <li> Hair is softer and more manageable.  Takes only a few drops in wet hair...also bought a bottle for my  daughter &amp; granddaughter. And the price is great.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve said before in many other reviews, I am always looking for products that make my hair healthier and look better. Perhaps it sounds silly, but a writing partner introduced argan oil into one of our joint projects as a type of hair treatment and up until that point, I had never heard of it. When it saw it as part of a promotion, I thought I definitely needed to try it just so that I knew what we were writing about. And I&#x27;m not sorry I did try! In fact, when I run out of my current supply, I will probably be ordering more. It&#x27;s really easy to use and a small amount of oil goes a long way. The packaging is clean and professional and the function of the product and how to use it are clearly printed on the label. I am extremely happy with it and if you&#x27;re looking for something easy to use for your hair, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is so good for your hair!  Use it like a hot oil treatment and your hair feels soft and silky for days.  I love it so much! I&#x27;ll be buying this again and giving it as gifts.  Shipped quickly and nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> Notice softer hair within the first week. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing. I am 2 months post relaxer so usually it is very hard to detangle my hair. My comb glided right through my hair. I also used it on my hair for shine after blow drying. This bottle is probably going to get used up fast!</li>
            <li> This is not a leave in conditioner. Its too oily if you dont wash your hair with shampoo. I thought it will not be sticky after applying this oil but it is. Even description says wash your hair after applying. I am very confused why it is &amp;#34; leave in conditioner&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I love using this as a leave-in conditioner, heat protectant, and finishing serum-basically all the time! I used to use separate oils like Argan, Jojoba, or Coconut, but this is a mix of all of them and I have better results with it than other oils. I highly recommend for soft shiny hair, and it will save you the trouble of mixing multiple oils, the perfect blend is made for you!</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love using this for days after flat ironing our hair. It didn&#x27;t leave either of our hair greasy.  Overall, a very nice and easy to use product.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Smelled like it was burning my hair. They send you an email with ways to use it after you buy it and all the different ways require you to wash it off. If it&#x27;s supposed to be washed off why market it as a leave in conditioner?</li>
            <li> i have read reviews where people have said that they can use this as a leave-in conditioner. i cannot. it made my hair incredible oily. i can put it on at night and then rinse it out in the shower in the mornings and i have no problems with it that way. it feels nice and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I really love argan oil. I&#x27;m really getting into oils now and all you need to use is a drop. A little goes a long way. I also add a little bit of the oil into my homemade conditioner.</li>
            <li> have Just started using it .Excellent ,the right combination of oils</li>
            <li> leaves hair soft and with shine.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Leaves your hair feeling very soft!</li>
            <li> Nothing against the product but it did not do anything for my hair. I must be one of those unfortunate people on this planet with very course, dry hair.  I have tried lots of products and nothing seems to work. I&#x27;ve tried everything from Coconut Oil to Argan Oil and cr&amp;egrave;mes.</li>
            <li> Argon oil is is great for your hair this one adds some shine too</li>
            <li> Wife loves this and thinks it is great</li>
            <li> Love the product, but what a cheap container, the bottle top was lose and no matter how much effort you put to make it tighter it remains the same. overall I got 60% of the entire product I paid for.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I leave it in overnight as conditioner and also use it on my ends during the day to keep them healthy and reduce frizz. My hair is soft, has gotten thicker, and grew much more than usual in the time I&#x27;ve been using the product.</li>
            <li> My fiance has not seen the same softening results from this product as we have seen when he has used other brands of beard/hair oil. This does seem to be a good value, and I specifically looked at this brand because it&#x27;s unscented. Unfortunately it&#x27;s not for us. Also, and know this is confusing because I just said we got this because of the unscented nature of the product, but this smells a bit musty to me. It may just the combination of oils, or maybe I&#x27;m used to a scented product that covers up their true smell, but I didn&#x27;t love snuggling up to him when this was recently applied.</li>
            <li> I was given a discount for this product for a review.  I love this product and Argan oil treatment is great on hair that is out of control with frizzy, dry, split ends, and damaged from chemical overload.  My hair started to show signs of life after the first use and after about the 3rd or 4th time of using this on my hair there was not signs of any damaged hair or dry brittle frizzy out of control hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all natural way to control my frizzy ends that could be used on wet or dry hair and I&#x27;m glad I found this. Just a small amount and my hair looks better without looking greasy. I also love it as a heat protectant and my hair looks silkier after a flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite argan oil. I like the applicator part, because it is very sensitive so it doesn&#x27;t squirt a huge amount out -- which is great because then it won&#x27;t leave my hair full of grease.  I like how lightweight my hair still feels with this in.  It doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> I am a black female with 3 months of transition hair (from perm to natural) and I have very thin hair. I bought this item to help my hair and also go more organic with my hair and skin products. I did not feel much a difference in this oil mix than the organic coconut oil I use all the time and I feel like I can make this mix in a diy project and have more of it for less. So ok product but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Used on in combination with coconut oil.  I like how there is a pump so you can control how much product you actually use.</li>
            <li> Now this product helped my hair so much I have been sick and my hair got thin and started breaking horrible, I can&#x27;t go anywhere so I have not been able to get it trimmed in 8 months and it is bad I had cut some of the front ends of and made it look ridiculous.. After my first order of these products I saw this and I just tried it today and my hair feels soft and looks 80% better .. I can only imagine after a couple of deep treatments and leave in for a while 👍🏻 I still need a haircut but what a difference this made .. Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is very long</li>
            <li> I have seen progress with several bald spots after using Argan Oil Hair Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Fr Jude, S.J.P.</li>
            <li> Not so bad and not so great!</li>
            <li> I love the way my hair is so soft and silky. I have used this 3 times and left it one for about 1 hour and then shampooed .  I can see the difference. I have very long and thick hair and use to dye it. The ends were very dry but since using this they are silky. I would buy this product again and again.</li>
            <li> As weird as this may sound, I am feeling &amp;#34;accomplished&amp;#34; today.  Background: I am an Indian born with very fine, silky, soft, shiny black hair but lost that lovely texture at puberty (and also because of harsh shampoo and rough handling). I am in my 30&#x27;s now and still battling coarse, puffy, wavy-to-curly, frizzy, thick, easily tangled, crispy hair. Not a product junkie, but tried quite a bit of the serums, lotions and the like to tame my hair. Most of them either made my hair my hair greasy or didn&#x27;t moisturize my hair at all or &amp;#34;stiffed&amp;#34; it out. And I was also constantly worried that all of these products must contain damaging chemicals ruining my hair in the long run (I had to use them generously after every hair wash. I wanted a more natural solution that wouldn&#x27;t make me feel guilty while dabbing product on my hair.  Actual Review - InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Treatment: I wish I could sound less dramatic but this was THE product I was pining for decades! I used it as a leave-in and it quenched my thirsty hair instantly. It appears as though my hair cuticles are suddenly (and finally) behaving (as though a curse/ magic spell was broken). My hair looks and feels glossy, slick, smooth, flow-y, frizz free, WITHOUT looking greasy if I use the correct method of application. I can PLAY with my hair (this was unimaginable up until now). I am also dreaming about going for actual fancy bangs on my next hair cut.  Precautions: Less is more. Hair can easily go an the greasy side if you are not watchful. For someone with thick bulky hair like mine, it requires section by section application (when i say &amp;#34;section&amp;#34;, I am strictly talking about the salon style layered sections, NOT side-by-side and/or quadrant style). The product needs to be dabbed first, then lightly massaged onto the hair (I do this by rolling/loosely twisting portions of hair shaft like a rope) and combed out.  I am a happy woman, who finally embraced her hair with love. (Slightly proud, but hesitant to admit).</li>
            <li> Not much growth so far just 1 week so far</li>
            <li> Been using this for a few weeks now.  I have wavy frizzy long hair.  I have to use a lot of product to tame the frizz.  I wanted to try this because it&#x27;s not as expensive as some of the other oils I&#x27;ve seen and I like that it&#x27;s natural.  It doesn&#x27;t have a scent and consistency is nice.  I mix with my staying cream, it does the job.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy.</li>
            <li> Made my hair very greasy/static-y with only one pump. Attempted to use on multiple occasions. Not completely satisfied, wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product. I wear my hair natural / afro american/ It has solved my problems. It perfectly meets the needs of my hair</li>
            <li> I really like the product my hair is dry  and brittle due to California hard water  and these product makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li> Leaves hair greasy, as other customers complained. Didn&#x27;t really do anything spectacular. I&#x27;ve been using this 5 months (give or take) and haven&#x27;t seen spectacular results. I am with all the high reviews and such, I expected to see results. The ingredients scream out great product, but overall I didn&#x27;t care for it. I will not buy it again.</li>
            <li> This purchase was a reorder. The original order&#x27;s ingredients were six natural oils. This purchase&#x27;s first six ingredients were unpronouncable chemicals including a polymer which usually refers to a plastic. I didn&#x27;t read the ingredients before purchasing because I thought it was the same product - same manufacturer - same name. My mistake. Caveat emporium.</li>
            <li> Amazing natural product!  This was given as a gift to a daughter who lives in the east and was having extreme frizzies and flyaway hair.  Her hair is long and looked damaged.  One treatment left in for 15 minutes and her hair was soft and wavy and controllable.  It looked shiny and well cared for.&lt;br /&gt;She was impressed and so am I.</li>
            <li> i tried it only one time and it made my hair look soft and healthy. I have thin hair and it didnt make it flat.Overall  its a good product.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:15caf80e35fc472cf09a532fe1c94bef]] I like this product because:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Nice pump bottle makes it easy to dispense the oil&lt;br /&gt;2.  Oil is very light yet nourishing for damaged hair&lt;br /&gt;3.  Very, very slight scent&lt;br /&gt;4.  Great company with quality products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t think of any cons.  A little goes a long ways.  Nourishes, coats and protects damaged hair.  Leaves hair feeling silky smooth.  Use it to help repair damage, tame frizz, give a finishing shine and manageability to your hair.</li>
            <li> Just Love this oil blend.  I always forget to do the deep conditioning treatment but am so happy when I do!  I am amazed how easily it washes out and the incredible shine.  I do use this as a leave-in treatment almost every time I shampoo and the results are terrific. I have just past the shoulder length hair and apply to the bottom third while still damp.  Whether I blow dry and style or just let dry naturally, my hair is soft and super shiny.  Love this!</li>
            <li> I am a Black Male. Gives my hair a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> wear in conditioner is pretty amazing. Has increased body and luster of my hair. bringing out my natural red highlights and a create glow. use it on my beard as well to soften it. main point is little goes looong way. one or 2 squirts enough for even medium length hair.</li>
            <li> This was an absolutely horrible product.  It smelled terrible and my hair started falling out not long after using it.  The texture of my hair has become extremely course.  I have been using old products trying to get it back to a manageable place.  This is the biggest waste of my money in a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it won&#x27;t buy it again.:(</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it every time I get out of the shower and a little more after I blow dry my hair. I have super dry hair and this keep it soft and shiny</li>
            <li> My ends already feel way softer, love it</li>
            <li> Excellent product! My hair feels great!</li>
            <li> This one make my hair so nice and shinny I can skip the shine spray . this bottle goes a long way and that makes it a good value&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a sample in order do make an informed review but my opinions are my own</li>
            <li> Just good natural ingredients :)</li>
            <li> Argan oil is like liquid gold in a bottle! This product is awesome for your hair! I have super thick and frizzy hair, so by the next morning when I&#x27;m ready to brush my hair, my hair ends up with 1,000x more volume then I&#x27;d like, and I usually end up just wrapping it in a bun to hide the frizziness.  However, I&#x27;ve noticed that if I apply this product in my hair (while wet) before I go to sleep, my hair is much more manageable in the morning and less frizzy!</li>
            <li> I love this! love the ingredients and the product. I add a few drops to my regular conditioner to make it more of a deep conditioning treatment.  And once a week I put it in my hair before going to bed and my hair is conditioned for at least 2 more washings. I have fine color processed hair and it is not too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> the lid wasn&#x27;t on very good  and some of leek out .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how it smells.</li>
            <li> GREAT OIL FOR HAIR AND BODY. NICE BIG SICE AND GREAT PRICE.</li>
            <li> Didnt Care for it... Paid too much for really no results... My hair was fried and this only made it oily and greasey... After i rinsed it out still no difference..i used it for quite some time...</li>
            <li> i am an african american women who has recently transitioned from relaxer to natural.  i am still trying to figure out my hair type but it is somewhere along the 4 spectrum(4a, 4b,4c). it works best for me when applied before styling. my hair comes out soft and with shine. i have been using this product for almost a month now and i will continue to shop with this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Excellent product!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft and shiny! I love this stuff! I am currently using all the Instanaturals products. Almost every ingredient is organic. I love this company!</li>
            <li> Too greasy as a leave-in conditioner. Probably ok if you rinse it off shortly after application.</li>
            <li> This works beautifully. After reviewing this product before buying, I would like to say first- I did not notice a smell. I put a few drops in my hands, rubbed them together, then put it in my hair. A tiny bit I used on my scalp and massaged it. I let it on overnight and washed it thoroughly. My hair was so soft and styled very nicely. It think the key is to figure out how much works for your hair type. Mine is very fine and a little dry.&lt;br /&gt;The best part of this product is the fast and friendly customer service. That is my own thoughts. No free bottle or discount for this review. :)</li>
            <li> I use this Argan oil to help combat the frizzies in my hair. It works well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking greasy (as long as I don&#x27;t use to much). My hair feels softer and has a healthy looking shine. I like that the bottle has a pump so easy to use and it&#x27;s a good size so it should last awhile. The oils that are in this are a great mixture and my hair thanks you.</li>
            <li> Its not want i need. I was looking for leave-in conditioner and end up buying this hair oil. I will be good for appying before sampoo but i dont like it in my hair for longer. i cant sleep with this oil in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updates-&lt;br /&gt;It may work for others as it depends on the type of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have recevied good customer service from InstaNatural. i am looking forward to try other porduct from Instanatural.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on the positive reviews and they were right! I love this oil I put 2 pumps on my thick long hair after I shower and it tames my frizz so much that I can go with my natural hair now. No more ruining my hair blow drying and straightening.</li>
            <li> Definitely did not make hair smooth or silky.  Tried it quite a bit in wet &amp; dry hair, as a mask and also as leave in.  Did not work and smells bad. Suspicious this is a fake product from China.  The other argan product I bought at the same time was also awful.  Is this a good enough reason to return it?  I&#x27;ve never returned anything on Amazon before.</li>
            <li> Love it.  This product moisturizes your hair and leaves it soft. Your hair doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or weighed down.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is way better than the stuff i have bought in the beauty supply store.  My hair just looks amazing when i use it, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love Argan Oil because my hair is very dry and frizzy, I put it on right after I wash my hair so it can add more conditioning to my hair.  This Argan Oil helps moisturize my hair and keep it soft and silky.  I&amp;#34;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week, and it&#x27;s pretty good. It moisturizes and leaves my hair smooth, and doesn&#x27;t leave residue. I have dry hair, so it helps with that without leaving it to oily.</li>
            <li> I put this on my beard daily and have seen growth and strength in my beard.</li>
            <li> This oil is a great product to treat the hair and moisturize the scalp. It has a sweet, lovely, fruity scent. I’m pleased with the results and my hair feels silky and healthy. I didn’t experience any rashes or allergic reactions which I’ve experienced with other hair treatments I’ve tried.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda neutral about it... I have used it as directed, not for the EXACT times it says you can use it for treatment... but I usually left it in for half an hour before showering. It doesn&#x27;t really feel like it made too much of a difference even after consistent use, so maybe it needs to be longer? Or nothing can really combat the hard water here. Either way, I&#x27;m rating it as it&#x27;s okay, since it didn&#x27;t make anything really better like I hoped, but didn&#x27;t make anything worse either.</li>
            <li> Used this on my hair overnight, loved it!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using argan oil for some time now and I love it. it keeps both my hair and my skin soft. Look ways to use argan oil, you will be impressed. This particular brand and product is my all time favorite. The serum is different than just plain Argan oil. It&#x27;s fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample in order to give my honest opinion</li>
            <li> I love this oil.., my hair is natural locs and I&#x27;ve had it on for  2yrs, this oil gives it an amazing shine.my hair stays full and looks rich every day . It&#x27;s not oily,oily (If u know what I mean)and of course my lenght has improved tremendously too. I love the combo of several natural oils blended I one. It&#x27;s sooo rich! I&#x27;ll recommend it to any one who loves a shine to both hair and skin.this is my 2nd buy and I&#x27;m going to keep buying it!!!!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start telling you why I like this company, all their products have natural ingredients also their products are cruelty free. The first thing i noticed about the Argan Oil was the smell, Oh my god! It smell so good like &amp;#34;almondish&amp;#34;.  This oil is for all hair types, my hair is really curly and it have a mind of his own, my ends are horrible, they are super dry; and my hair overall is really frizzy I guess is a tread of Caribbean girls. So I was more than excited to try this out. I put the oil on all my hair but emphasizing my ends. Just by putting it on my ends look more healthy and I really love that, if that&#x27;s just putting it right now, Imagine what it can do a long term. The frizziness it still there, less noticeable but still there, maybe after I use it for one week it would be better. Also even though it left my hands greasy the hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy at all. Overall I do recommend this product, it give me fantastic results and the bottle is huge comparing how much you really use. The only problem for me is how I can take The Argan Oil with my on vacation this next month. I don&#x27;t want to be without it so long! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as &amp;#34;helpful&amp;#34;*&lt;br /&gt;*InstaNatural send me this product to review it, but my opinions are my own.*</li>
            <li> I love this product, amazing ...</li>
            <li> Okay, so I have been using the Insta Natural Argan Oil Hair Treatment for almost 3 weeks now and the directions say you can use it for a ten-minute, two-hour or overnight hair repair treatment. Let me start off with using it as a &#x27;Leave In Conditioner&#x27; which is stated on the front of the bottle. I&#x27;m guessing they mean for this statement as the two-hour or overnight treatment because the direction say shampoo after treatment and you must, you can not just leave it in all day. I used just 2 pumps of the oil for my hair and  left it in over night and the next morning my hair looked so oily and greasy, it literally looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in days. I felt like I needed to wash my pillow case the next day. I had the same results with the two-hour treatment. Now, given that, after I shampooed my hair and was done showering, my hair did feel softer and easier to comb through wet. After I dried it, I did notice my hair had a nice shine to it and it was a lot softer. I, personally, liked doing the ten-minute treatment the best because it was the easiest and most convenient... I could wet my hair, put it in and shave or wash up, then rinse it out and shampoo. And, like I said, after about almost 3 weeks of use, not everyday, my hair does feel softer, silkier and definitely more manageable. This works, but there will be a little trial-and-error because you don&#x27;t need a lot of this product even though you&#x27;ll want to, but a little sure does go a long way with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post. The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Good product and on time</li>
            <li> I gave the Argan Oil for Hair treatment &amp; Elixir Serum a 5 star rating because in the week that I have been using it I have been bombarded with compliments about the softness and new healthy feel of my hair.  I am a big user of hair serums for frizz control and use deep conditioners to treat damage from heat like flat ironing and blow drying. i used the serum in a couple different ways to see how my hair would react to it. I hate when an oil serum is greasy and makes hair looked unwashed so i was anxious to see how it looked wet and dry. And this product does not do that at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick, curly and I dabbed just a bit on my palm and spread it all over my dry hair before flat ironing it. It was Amazing!! It cut down the time it took for my hair to get a flat soft feel and it looked healthy with so much shine. I am telling you this product is a must have. I have also been using it on wet hair after towel drying and by the time it drys it shines and feels soft to touch. I am so happy with this product. The Natural ingredients in it also made me feel comfortable to apply it on my daughters hair for a tangle free brush and shine. Great product.</li>
            <li> Frizz be gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally thick, wavy hair, that is not easy to deal with on the best of days. I need help keeping it all under control. I was thrilled to try the InstaNatural Argan Oil to see what it could do to keep my tresses lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have healthy hair so I have not tried it as a leave in conditioner. I applied it before I blew my hair dry. It does leave a pretty shine and makes me feel like my hair is more polished. The oil has a mild but pleasant smell so that is nice too. I love that this product is not tested on animals and also offers a money-back guarantee if you are not happy with it. Definitely worth a try with that pledge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, so this 4 fluid ounce bottle will last a while and keep you frizz free all summer long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I am a fan of Argon Oil.  It is not the brand, as I have reviewed Insta Natural products in the past and have considered them to be a very reputable company.  I think I just do not personally like the whole oily feeling.  The oil can be used to soften the cuticles.  It can be used with a shampoo product to help with the scalp and hair.  It can also be used on the skin as a softener and massage oil.  It can be used when shaving.  It has a ton of uses which makes it very multi-purpose.  I even tried to mix some in my favorite body lotion.  There was no lack of trying.  As the winter weather is starting to thrust upon us- I mean come on- I was driving in snow two weeks before Thanksgiving- my skin has been getting extremely dry and my hands are doing that lovely cracking thing.  I am going to give this oil another shot and continue to rub it into my skin through the winter and hopefully see results.  But, at this point, I cannot say I am a fan.  It has to grow on me.  #InsatNatural</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I used it to help my dry scalp and it does help.</li>
            <li> Very good for my hair~Love it</li>
            <li> I previously gave the product a 5 star rating. It used to be a pure mixture of oils that were incredibly useful on hair and nails. They changed the product but kept the name the same. Now it is just a very standard silicone hair serum with a drop of the original oils in it. Not anything like it used to be. I am cancelling my subscription. I absolutely hate bait and switch. I was looking for an oil, not a silicone serum.</li>
            <li> My hair gets really frizzy during the summer months and really dried during the winter months. Sometimes it&#x27;s hard to tame it and not to mention that I have really really long hair so that doesn&#x27;t always help either. My daughter who is bi-racial, Asian, African American and Caucasian has really really tight curls, super frizzy and really dried. We&#x27;ve pretty much tried everything that was out there. It just seems like her hair does not keep moisture in it. With that being said, we&#x27;ve had the privilege to try out InstaNatural Argan + Coconut + Jojoba oil hair treatment &amp; elixir for the past few weeks or so. Now, we&#x27;ve tried all those oils separately and though they work pretty well in my hair, my daughter&#x27;s hair after awhile goes back to that dried look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this oil treatment &amp; elixir, my daughters hair looks like it has been brought back to life. It looks a lot shinier, healthier and stays moist for a very very long time. She can even manage to comb through her hair with no problems. The easiest way we found to work this oil through our hair is making sure our hair was wet before we put the oil in it. Working from the top down to the end of our hair. And a FYI, a little goes a long way! So I suggest that you start of small and if you need to add more then do so but chances are you won&#x27;t need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this oil has no preservatives, chemicals or artificial fragrances added to it. It&#x27;s all natural and is perfect for all hair types. Even those who have over processed hair, hair damaged from curling/flat irons and damage from blow drying your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is totally worth it! Remember if you chose to purchase this product you have a 100% 100-Day Satisfaction Guarantee! If you&#x27;re not completely satisfied with the product, just contact them and they&#x27;ll give you a full refund (no need to return the bottle). No questions asked.</li>
            <li> I have a new great product to share with you for your hair, especially if you have dry or damaged hair from natural causes or from years of using hair dryers and curling irons along with all of those type of hair tools. This Argan Oil Hair Treatment has a rich blend of oils that help make up this super power that will tame your hair and make it shiny and more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have rather thick hair on top of it being dry but this is an after photo of when I used the Argan Oil Treatment from Instanatural and it came out beautifully. I love when I can touch my hair and it feels so soft and silky. That doesn&#x27;t happen often as I have naturally curly hair and I have to really work at getting it straight or rather I used to. Now, I let it dry naturally and then I apply the Argan Oil and will either leave it be or sometimes for the purpose of my hair reviews, I will straighten it so you can see the difference. The differences don&#x27;t show up very well on my curly hair, so it&#x27;s always to my advantage to leave it straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use as leave in conditioner, overnight hair treatment or heat protectant. It will reduce damage and dryness on hair and scalp, removes frizz, adds instant shine and softness. Also, it will work as a Heat Protectant if you do have to use hair dryers, curling irons and straighteners. I don&#x27;t use curling irons but do use the other two. I have found that it does protect my hair better if I have applied some Argan Oil to my hair. Do not overdo it because it will leave it oily looking if you do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was reading some comments and found one that said they used this Argan Oil Treatment on their legs afterwards to help with moisturizing their legs and I can understand that. Every time I shave it seems like it makes my legs dry and itching feeling so this oil will relieve that. I tried it and it really does work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, just experiment with it. It&#x27;s just a blend of oils so it won&#x27;t hurt you and you may find out something that it helps that makes life easier for you. I am thinking of using it on my cuticles next to see if I can get the dry looking skin around my fingernails to go back to being smooth and pretty. I will let you know how successful I am later on with this project.helps that makes life easier for you.

            <li> This product does exactly what it says.  I left it in overnight and noticed the difference after I showered the next morning.</li>
            <li> With all the hair products that are out there you just never know what is good and what actually works. I am a strong user of oils and the pure form the better for me to try out. I feel more confident knowing and understanding the ingredients that go into my hair. I use it mainly overnight and wash/rinse out in the morning. It states can be used within 10 minutes off application and use as much as needed but remember a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more subtle results are immediate. Your hair is softer, more manageable and shine restored after the first overnight treatment. After application (if using as a leave in conditioner) it will feel like it has a protective barrier over each and every strand, which makes perfect when using your blow dryer and/or flat iron. Vitamin B5 from pathenol strengthens and of course shea butter to thicken and create volume. This does not have a scent but the benefits out weigh the need for something sweet smelling. Overall this product has delivered tremendously as a strengthener and restoring shine. Slowly I am noticing that my hair has more volume and seeing less damage from the heat.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely dry and I needed something to keep it from looking so brittle.  This oil really works on my gray hair.  I was completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Awesome product - worked well with my hair and provided my hair added shine.  I have thin hair so I would not suggest using this product as a leave in conditioner, but it worked well to decrease my frizz and my hair felt soft and was even more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product for free for review, but nonetheless - my thoughts are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair is softer and less fly away.</li>
            <li> This is an all natural product with many helpful uses. Can be used as a hair treatment,  on the skin, body and nails.  I use it on my hands and feet and they seem softer. A great product with loads of essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;**Product provided by the company**</li>
            <li> I LOVE this. Not only is it regular argan oil it also has jojoba oil, AND coconut oil, along with tons of other awesome ingredients. I&#x27;ve been using it regularly on my hair as a deep conditioner, and have already seen serious results. My hair, by the way is bleached like white, and after four bleachings total, this is exactly what it needed. It works great as a heat protector when I straighten my hair, and I am probably going to be testing this bad boy out as a moisturizer and on my stretch marks to see if it helps my skin! It also makes my hair SUPER shiny without looking oily at all. It&#x27;s an EXCELLENT elixer, and I probably will never go back to using regular argan oil!</li>
            <li> Since my hair is very dry due to coloring, I tried this out as an overnight hair treatment to start. When I washed it out the next day I noticed immediately how shiny and soft my hair was. It looked great.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the elixir out as a leave in conditioner. A little goes a long way and again my hair was full of shine and was soft.&lt;br /&gt;This product makes your hair look and feel healthy. I couldn’t get over the softness of my hair. It’s usually dry and brittle. I was worried about it being greasy from using oil and it was in no way greasy.&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry, lifeless, or brittle hair I suggest you give this a try. It really helps your hair look healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> The InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Treatment &amp; Elixir Serum is one of my latest loves! My hair has never looked better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and I have to say my hair is looking better and better each week. I put my hair through a lot. I am a natural dirty blonde, but I color my hair every 6 weeks to a lighter shade of blonde. Naturally that wrecks havoc on my hair. I don&#x27;t apply heat to my hair, but it still is frizzy, dry and has split ends. I have added this treatment into my hair care routine, and it is the best thing I have used yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daily I spritz some of the oil on my hair comb, and work it through my hair in the morning while I&#x27;m getting ready. Then about 1 or 2 times a week I will use this as a hour long deep conditioning treatment. I like to dampen my hair first, then apply it. I will normally do this on the weekend when I can really give it time to soak in and do its job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The frizz in my hair has dramatically reduced, and the shine I have now is stunning. My hair was always dull, but now it has a nice healthy glossy look. I have also noticed less fall out from my hair since adding this to my routine. I am still using this product, so I still have a bit left to go before I get the full bottle final results, but so far I am very pleased!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have found an additional use for this. It works as a fantastic massage oil for dry skin! No issue with breakouts or anything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
            <li> I hate to give bad reviews, but this product isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ll buy again.</li>
            <li> Love it! My hair is so soft and shiny! I definitely don&#x27;t miss the frizz!</li>
            <li> I was contacted by InstaNatural to try out some of their natural beauty products. Once I saw what they offered I jumped at the chance to try their items out. The first one I tried out is the InstaNatural 100% Pure Argan Oil which I love, the next one I tried out is the InstaNatural&#x27;s 100% Pure Moroccan Rose Water. By the way, I am able to use all of their products together which is also a big bonus. My third product by InstaNatural&#x27;s that I tried out is their Youth Express Age-Defying Moisturizer. I am always keeping my eyes looking for that perfect moisturizer. Finally, to make sure every inch of me is beautiful InstaNatural let me try out their Argan Oil Hair Treatment and Elixir.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Argan oil is a type of plant oil that is produced from the kernels of the Argan tree that is native in Morocco. Natural Argan oil has a raw, green and nutty aroma, but what is so great about this type of oil is that the scent disappears minutes after being on your skin or hair as true Argan oil absorbs very quickly and without that greasy feeling.&lt;br /&gt;  InstaNatural strive to have their customers 100% satisfied. Their logo is actually &amp;#34;we truly care about you&amp;#34;. The Argan Oil  Hair Treatment and Elixir comes in a 4 fl. oz (120 mL) glass bottle with a pump spray. Although this is still an oil treatment so it does not really mist but is still nice to spray into your hand and then rub into your hair.  Trust me while experimenting with this a little goes a long way. InstaNatural&#x27;s Argan Oil Hair Treatment and Elixir is so natural that it is only made 100% from plant based oils.  Besides argan oil, there is also shea butter, coconut oil, jojoba oil, olive oil and grapeseed oil.  There are no chemicals or preservatives added, they do not test on animals and they even offer a 100% money back guarantee if you are not satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;  The InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Treatment and Elixir is a multipurpose oil.  For cosmetic uses you can use it as a leave-in conditioner, frizz remover,  hair moisturizer or as a heat/damage protectant. I even used it after my Epilepsy Testing and it removed the glue from the probes in my hair and made my hair extra soft and shiny afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;  I also really like it as a frizz remover and detangler for my hair. I rub only a small spray drop into my hair after I get out of the shower. I have thick hair so if you have thin hair you will barely need any otherwise your hair will look oily. It protects my hair from any heat damage I may do to it as well as make it shiny, soft and frizz free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Next Generation Stay At Home Mom gives InstaNatural&#x27;s Argan Oil Hair Treatment and Elixir  5 Stars!onditioner, frizz remover,  hair moisturizer or as a heat/damage protectant.

            <li> I use this oil as a styling product. It leaves my hair shiny,  frizz free then I just rub the left over oil on my hands after putting in my hair to moisturize my hands</li>
            <li> I have very hard to manage, tangle prone, dry, frizzy hair. If it&#x27;s humid or hot my hair looks insane and it&#x27;s not even curly so it looks like I just haven&#x27;t bothered to brush it for a week. It&#x27;s awful. This product helped while the temperature and humidity were at normal levels in my house... But after being outside on a hot &amp; muggy summer day, it poofed up just as it always does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in my case, it&#x27;s not helpful in heat or humidity at all but if I&#x27;m inside, in the ac, it does make my hair softer and less frizzy, a lot less tangled. It just can&#x27;t stand the weather I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For hair similar to mine, you may want to look elsewhere, this product isn&#x27;t for severely frizzy and tangled hair. I think it would work wonders on women with less bothersome hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t knock this product, but it isn&#x27;t as great as it&#x27;s cracked up to be, for me anyways. I will likely return it.</li>
            <li> Not a good product at all despite all those labels on the bottle. It leaves my hair even dryer</li>
            <li> This product deliver&#x27;s even more then it promises. I will continue as a customer.</li>
            <li> The smell is not really good. But it works fine on the frizzy/curly hair without adding the greasiness .</li>
            <li> Instanaturals Argan oil hair treatment rivals much more expensive products out there, and works just as good, if not better. My mother has tried everything for her frizzy and curly hair, and she still has yet to fully tame her locks. This treatment has been the best thing she has used to date. While it did not perform miracles and give her straight and shiny hair, it did make her curls behave, and kept the frizz at bay- even with humidity! The price is amazing for the size, as you don&#x27;t need a lot of the oil per application. My mother gets a dime sized amount in her palm, and works it into her freshly shampooed hair before combing it out. She has finally put away her flat iron and can get ready to leave the house in under an hour!</li>
            <li> The label on this product asserts it makes your hair luminous.  It does! Even without flat-ironing! Not only that, it&#x27;s the only product, since living in Florida, that also makes my hair voluminous. Every other product I&#x27;ve ever tried - and there have been countless - always ends up weighing down my hair, and still turn my hair frizzy once I get out into the humidity.  Thank you, Instanatural!!</li>
            <li> Initially I had given my bottle of Argan Oil Hair Treatment &amp; Elixir Serum, but I had to take it back and use it for myself.  I never do this, but I did not realize what I had and I think I needed it and she was taking too long to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it to her because I know that she sometimes applies heat to her hair, but yet wants to maintain healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have discovered that it gives my natural sandy, red hair some shine.  I am currently wearing a short hair, wet hair cut.  I usually wet it and then I let it air dry and then I run my fingers through my hair.  I have been told that wetting your hair daily can dry it out.  Mind you, my hair color does not help the situation.  I would like to think that I am taking care of my hair, but I can honestly say, now that I am wearing a short hair style I am a little less conscious of hair care.  I should treat my hair good whether it is long or short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After running my fingers through my hair I apply the Insta Natural Argan oil to the palm of my hand and then rub my hands together and then smooth it across my hair, being careful to keep the style.  Of course it does not stay perfect so, I have to style it a bit afterwards.  The oil does ad some shine.  I do not have to use a lot to get the shine that I want.  I keep it in all day and then the next day, it is washed or rinsed out and reapplied.  Just by adding this to my hair, I feel guilty that I have been neglecting my hair.  Well, that has all changed.  I am confident that my hair is healthy.</li>
            <li> marvelous oil deep nourish made my hair feel so soft. i added a few drops to my regular conditioner and applied to my hair. after 3-4 minutes i rinsed. i could immediately feel improved softness in my hair. i look forward to seeing if it help mend my split ends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard that Argan oil is great for your hair. Now that I&#x27;ve tried this product I know for sure it&#x27;s a great oil for softening and moisturizing your hair. My hair is natural  it&#x27;s dull, dry, and very brittle. I spray this Argan oil on one side of my hair and it&#x27;s so shiny and soft. I can comb through it without break the comb now. This was a free sample product for review and I&#x27;m define rely going to buy some of this because my hair is now alive!!!</li>
            <li> I recently discovered argan oil for hair and fell in love with it immediately.  I bought this brand randomly when I searched for the oil once my current brand ran out and was no longer offered.  Although this cost more than my last, I like it a lot better.  It applies smoothly and spreads evenly.  I have hair that falls below my shoulder (I guess you can consider it long) and it is wavy/frizzy after every wash.  I use this baby, blow dry and get amazing results.  I usually use two pumps of the bottle, rub my hands together and apply to my hair.  Then I comb through.  My hair looks great every time.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product arrived fast and in perfect condition.  Works great for smoothing hair and keeping ends split free</li>
            <li> wouldnt recommend leaving it in because of how greasy it is. but i think it helps with my frizziness when i let it in for a few minutes then wash it out.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Wonderful hair product, my hair feels like silk, really, I&#x27;m always telling everyone, touch my hair!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;my daughter - Josie</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy curly hair and live in a high humidity climate. I keep this magic serum in my office and on a humid bad hair day, have instant relief by putting a few drops in my palms and massaging my scalp. Smooth, silky hair results immediately!</li>
            <li> I just ordered this product because my little girl has been in the hospital and has &amp;#34;hospital head&amp;#34;. I read online that to get the knots out to use oils and this product has them all in one. I&#x27;m praying this works!</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product! I, honestly, don&#x27;t think I would ever want to go without it. It&#x27;s lightweight enough to use on my difficult but very fine hair. It doesn&#x27;t make it feel greasy or weighed down just soft, shiny and more manageable. That&#x27;s not the only thing I use this wonderful product for, however. I use it all over my body and the combination of natural, high-quality oils leave my skin feeling silky and soft!  I&#x27;ve even been told even that the bottom of my feet feel baby soft after applying this product regularly. You can&#x27;t ask for more then that.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It has kept my dry frizzy hair smooth and shiny!</li>
            <li> Works well, great price, over all good quality!</li>
            <li> This [[ASIN:B00KD73PBQ Argan Oil For Hair Treatment &amp; Elixir Serum]] has a great mixture of oils inside: Argan, Shea Butter, Coconut Oil, Jojoba Oil, Olive Oil, Grapeseed Oil, and Sunflower Oil.  I like the combination and the benefits of each.  The ingredients list also mentions Panthenol (Vitamin B5), so good to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a 4oz (120ml) bottle with a pump top. Using only a couple drops per application, this product size seems to last forever and I find the pump dispenser helps me to get even amounts for application without going overboard with the product.  The directions mention rubbing a drop or two between your hands/palms then smooth or scrunch into your hair.  I like this approach best and find that I&#x27;m able to evenly coat my hair this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this product for both the minimum amount of time (10mins) and the max (overnight) and find It works best for me when I leave it in overnight a couple nights a week and a smaller amount of time the rest of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> Love this oil it&#x27;s a must</li>
            <li> This is better for a hair night treatment.  The serum is thick and makes your hair very oily.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair with a black soap shampoo, put on my conditioner, and put this on top for a sealer. put on a plastic cap and left it on for over 2 hours. washed it out with the same conditioner and my hair felt great. less tangles (I have thinning hair, but is very coarse (African American, tight coils). my hair didn&#x27;t feel dry, and actually feels and looks thicker. Great to use as addition to conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS I NEED MORE FOR MY HAIR</li>
            <li> This combines not only the much buzzed about Argan oil, but also jojoba and coconut to leave you with lush, shiny&#x27; hydrated hair that you&#x27;ll want to run your fingers through all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In just a few days, I&#x27;ve noticed a marked improvement in my dry overly color damaged ends. It&#x27;s also made my hair much less frizzy and seems to have helped fight off humidity caused craziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a hairstylist,  I have tried more than my fair share of these types of product and this is right on part with some of the much more expensive brands. well worth it and I highly recommend it if you need to make your hair more manageable and keep it from becoming a hot mess!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers</li>
            <li> I received this to review and love it! A little goes a looooong way so be careful if you are using this not as a deep conditioner. This left my hair feeling so silky and soft. Great product!</li>
            <li> *I received this for free to review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been a huge fan of oil treatments.  Even as a little girl I used them.  Super excited to find one to use now!  I love how the ingredients are natural  and that I recognize them all!  No mystery!  Works great!  My hair thanks you!</li>
            <li> My hair is healthier and looking better- more shinny and much softer. I use this product as a leave in and also as an oil treatment twice a week.  So, far, I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil to use with my beard and I love it. It has softened my beard quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Use it on both my and my daughters hair. Makes it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other Argan Oil treatments for my hair in the past.  The really expensive ones are full of synthetic ingredients and fragrances and argan oil is usually the last ingredient on the list.  This treatment and elixir contains argan oil, coconut oil, grapeseed oil, jojoba oil, olive oil and shea butter.  I feel it does a nice job of protecting and conditioning my hair.  I use a tiny tiny bit on damp hair.  I rub 2 pumps of the oil into my palms after towel drying my hair and apply it to the ends of my hair. I think it does a really nice job as a heat protectant before I use my flat iron.  I am noticing significantly fewer split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the ingredient list so much that I find myself using this as a skin moisturizer as well.  The bottle is a generous size and I probably will never use it all if I only use it for my hair.</li>
            <li> This oil is great, very thin, and doesn&#x27;t weight hair down. Excellent nourishment treatment to hair. Only thing I dislike about it, is the smell, although that technically means it is really pure oils, no addition of scent to it. However it is not pungent so it makes this product perfect!</li>
            <li> FIRST TIME TRYING THIS, BUT THE PRODUCT IS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD!!!</li>
            <li> I love Argan Oil Hair treatment. It makes my hair soft and manageable without a greasy feeling. I received the products fast and a fair amount for the money. I&#x27;ve already re-ordered.</li>
            <li> I recently changed all of my hair products over from a high end brand that I have used for years to more natural products.  I have very thick, long hair that I have never colored, and the air is so dry where I live that no matter what product I applied my hair looked dry and frizzy - especially on the day I washed my hair.  I used to use a few different products to tone it down, but lately it had just lost it&#x27;s shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually wash my hair every 2-3 days, and for the last couple weeks after I get out of the shower, I put a few drops of this in my hair, and it is amazing.  I even love how it looks the same day I showered (unheard of!).  My hair looks and feels healthier and it is so much easier to manage.  Unlike before, it does not get huge, and I don&#x27;t need to tame it with hair elastics or any other products.  I love this hair treatment!!!  The best part is I now use this on my young daughter&#x27;s super curly hair instead of expensive products that I don&#x27;t feel good about.  The knots in her hair after sleep have gone down to almost nothing which makes both our mornings much more peaceful. :)</li>
            <li> It makes my hair greasy, and difficult to evenly apply. The smell is not good, similar to edible oil.</li>
            <li> Argan oil is sent from heaven.  It&#x27;s the greatest thing I&#x27;ve ever used &amp; my hair has never felt better.</li>
            <li> Love it! I have used 100% cold pressed argan oil in the past but hated wasted $80 on a 2oz bottle that goes bad in a few weeks :( Since this one is mixed with other oils, it last until it&#x27;s gone! :) My hair and face feel amazing! I will be buying again once empty.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> I have the most curly, wiry mess of a beard in the world, and this seems to help somewhat. I rub in a couple drops of this before showering to protect it from drying out, and then add another drop along with a drop of straightening serum after getting out, before combing it straight while blow-drying it, then using a straight iron. It seems to protect the hair from heat damage, at least a little. The smell isn&#x27;t great, but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> I just love your product,its working great for my hair and i will order again.</li>
            <li> I have bought from this company before. They make good products. This one is no different. I tried it as an over night leave in conditioner, but it&#x27;s a bit too greasy for this. I used it in the morning and kept it in all day and it worked out well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> Nice product,will buy it again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed, since I thought I would be able to use this as a leave-in protectant on my hair, but it is too heavy for a leave-in treatment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having my hair double processed for many years without ever experiencing dryness or damage until my regular stylist went on maternity leave. The salon told me the stylist filling in for her had many years experience and I felt I had no choice other than to trust them. Huge mistake as she left me with inches of dry, brittle, frizzy, dull hair. I spend days with that mess hidden up in a bun while I researched what to do.  I chose this product because it has a combination of something to treat each individual problem. It has argon and jojoba oil which can penetrate the hair shaft and help heal some of the damage. Shea butter can seal the hair shaft and act as a protectant. The coconut oil is excellent at doing both of these while the olive oil acts as a great carrier oil holding all of these amazing ingredients together. I use it both as an everyday leave in conditioner and an overnight deep conditioner once a week. When I&#x27;m doing the overnight deep conditioning I place a little bit of it in a glass bowl and heat it up before applying it, wash my hair first and towel dry it, smooth on a large amount making sure I cover every strand and the scalp, cover my head with a shower cap and sleep with it on overnight.  For the first week the main difference I noticed was it was easier to get a comb through my hair and it was slightly less brittle. By the second week there was significantly less breakage at the ends and some shine had actually returned.  By the third week I was able to brush it and style it almost the way I used to. Now I just got most of the severe damage cut off.  I can honestly say I would not have survived that horrible hair time if it had not been for this argon oil hair treatment.  The hair that I have remaining is now shiny, smooth, and healthy despite having undergone chemical warfare, because the awesome healing and protective ingredients in this product came to its rescue.</li>
            <li> Though I like the fact that this product has so many natural ingredients, I really find that it leaves my hair feeling oily. I just use one drop on my fine chin-level hair and that is enough. My son has short course hair and he uses one drop as well. Even with such a small amount we often feel that it is too oily a product.</li>
            <li> I have recently began to have dry and itchy scalp, and it has been very bothersome to me.  I might blame it on the weather and/or all of the constant blow drying and the hair sprays I use on my hair, and I can&#x27;t help it but itch my scalp constantly.  I was so close to putting on my Shea Butter hand lotion until I saw the InstaNatural Argan Oil and had to try it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has no scent, and it comes in a pump glass bottle.  I have actually also used it on my hands and legs, and with the dry and cold weather, it has definitely kept my skin moisturized and smooth.  When I tried it on my hair, I pumped a couple times around my palms and rubbed it straight on my scalp, then worked my way down to my hair strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after I applied the Argan Oil Hair Treatment, the dry scalp feeling I had lingering constantly that was bothering my every being is NO LONGER there!  I was first hesitant to put oil directly onto my scalp, because let&#x27;s face it, you would immediately assume that your hair would look greasy.  This Agran Oil Hair Treatment does not look oil nor greasy on my hair at all.  After 2 weeks of using this product continuously every day, I had waved goodbye to my itchy and dry scalp!  Plus, I definitely recommend using this product along with the InstaNatural Hair Treatment.  I am using them together and I have had the best shiny, healthy, and conditioned soft hair ever!  I hope that this review was helpful on making your purchase decision.</li>
            <li> This has been a godsend for me. No more frizzy, fuzzy bits at my temple, or ends. By the 2nd week of using this, my hair feels healthier. I thank everyone for their reviews, you&#x27;re the reason I bought this product.</li>
            <li> I love using InstaNatural&#x27;s Argan Oil products! For the hair treatment, i&#x27;ve used it to moisturize my dry scalp and my hair. I&#x27;ve used it for a quick treatment of my hair, and it works great! I&#x27;m pleased!&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was given free product in order to facilitate my review and the opinions expressed are my own!</li>
            <li> I use this to treat bamboo cutting boards. Works just fine.</li>
            <li> This does not work well for my hair.  The number 1 ingredient listed is &amp;#34;Sunflower Oil&amp;#34;...it&#x27;s not primarily Argan Oil.  I have used pure Argan oil and that works a lot better for my hair then this stuff. I am just going to see if this works as a deep conditioning treatment.. as a leave in it makes my hair clump.  Not sure..but I wish it did work. I was disappointed that the bottle shows all of these oils on the front side. On the back side it states the ingredients and list : Sunflower oil as the primary and first ingredient. It&#x27;s most likely 90% sunflower oil...10% the rest.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft after using this! I&#x27;ll definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> Great product, leaves my hair very smooth, silky, and frizz-free.  It cost much less than other products but I swear it&#x27;s just as good, and maybe even more effective, than some of the other treatments costing a lot more.</li>
            <li> This is nice, my hair tends to be dry &amp; kinda dull looking. Used to be nice when i was younger. This stuff makes my hair more shiny in a good way &amp; its not near as dry &amp; dull looking. Their products work.</li>
            <li> Great natural product, I use it overnight.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair treatment because I was already familiar with most of the essential oils used in this product. I&#x27;m very happy that I purchased it. My hair felt so smooth after I applied it and left it on overnight. I will definitely buy other products from this seller!</li>
            <li> I will purchase the product again!!!</li>
            <li> I usually use Moroccan Oil Light - thought I would try something new.  This product, in the smallest amounts on either wet or dry hair, leaves it greasy and worse than if I didn&#x27;t use anything at all. I do use it for a night time conditioner to shampoo out in the am, as it doesn&#x27;t work well for what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my hair, would defiantly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have medium length, loose curly, blonde, unprocessed hair (no dyes or chemicals). It does get frizzy sometimes. I blow dry it a couple times a month and flat iron it a couple times a year. It leans towards dry rather than oily but is fairly healthy in all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research looking for a healthy treatment for my hair. Instanatural Argan has great reviews so I splurged and spent the $20 for 4 oz. Unfortunately, this oil is just not for me. I have used coconut oil for a long time. And before that I used Biosilk.  And I have always used frizz serums. So my technique is fairly practiced and I don&#x27;t feel I am adding too much. I started with 1 pump, rubbed through my hands and distributed lightly throughout my hair. I tried different amounts and I tried using both on wet and on dry hair. No go. My hair refuses to absorb this oil and leaves me looking very greasy. It makes my skin feel greasy too but it does absorb into my skin. It smells decent. So it gets 2 stars.</li>
            <li> I been using this oil now about from 2 weeks and can feel the difference. I use it as over night treatment before shampoo. I would recommend it if you have dry hairs with broken ends.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of the review and people complaint about it did not have Argan oil as first ingredient. Im using this for an heat protection when blowdrying my hair. It works well. I wanted something that hair argan oil and did not want to use 100% Argan oil because it so expensive so I wanted to keep my 100% for different uses. So this product will do for heat protect or heat treatment. It works for me</li>
            <li> I was eager to try this product to see if it could stand up against some of the big names brands I have used. Needless to say InstaNatural has created a good product here. First off, I like the easy pump top, but be careful not to pump too hard cause a little goes a long way. This oil is light and does not weigh the hair down or leave a product build up. Argan oil has become one of the most popular oils for hair restoration. More so, with this product they have combined a list of the best essential oils that aid in healthy hair and restoration.  It provides an overall shine and luster to the hair and helps in rebuilding the hair shaft with continued use. Compared to others, this company has provided a good amount of product (4oz) for the money, making this a great buy. I notice that there is no smell in this product which makes it easy to add to your favorite conditioners or leave-ins for the added benefit. For me however, I prefer having an oil with a nice aromatic smell and for that reason only I have knocked one star.   I did receive a discount in this purchase for my review, however, my opinion is solely based on my personal experience and preference.</li>
            <li> light weight, a bit sour smell, not sure if it&#x27;s my bottle, but the expiration date is in 2016.</li>
            <li> This argan oil hair treatment has so many uses. It is great to put on hair too smooth after blow dry or at night before bed for overnight treatment, then shampoo out in morning.the all natural combination of oils absorb right into your hair with no oily residue. it has a nice light scent and makes your hair and ends especially soft and shiny, I put it on my hair before beach day to protect then put in braid and washed out after hair was very manageable and had lots of body. was very lucky to be able to try for small fee and my honest opinion. will buy again, love this.</li>
            <li> rather greasy. weighed my hair down and not as good as other argan oil products i have tried on amazon...</li>
            <li> I like it, it is beautiful.</li>
            <li> This hasn&#x27;t worked for my hair for the dryness or frizz. My hair is very dry. You would think oil would work great!!! but it actually makes it more brittle.</li>
            <li> I can already tell a difference in my hair. Love it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> The product has a strong sunflower seed smell. Absolutely can not wear it when going out. I believe that the name of the product (&amp;#34;Argan Oil&amp;#34;) is misleading as it should be named sunflower seed oil.</li>
            <li> I was provided a sample for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finding the right treatment for your hair can be very difficult and seem almost impossible at times.  My hair is very fickle and while one product will work one month, the next month I won’t get the same results.  I’ve been hearing about Argan Oil as a solution to all kinds of beauty problems and when I saw the Insta Natural Argan Oil Hair Treatment &amp; Elixir I wanted to give it a try to see how well it would work for me and for my daughter.  I liked that the elixir came with a pump so it was easy to get out of the bottle.  Instead of using a dropper like most Argan Oil products I’ve tried before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The elixir is not too thick and it doesn’t weight down your hair.  I used it on my relaxer treated hair and on my daughter’s natural hair.  For her I wanted something to help with her dry scalp and her hair drying out.  For me I wanted something to help with my dry scalp and also keep my hair soft and shinny between washes.  I loved how this elixir worked especially for my daughter’s natural hair.  Instead of using hair food like I usually so I used this to oil her scalp weekly and help with dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The elixir kept her scalp from drying out for a whole week.  That’s a great improvement from the hair food we were using that would only work for about two to three days.  That really helped with dandruff and keeping her looking more beautiful.  For me it worked great for after I washed my hair and helping comb through my hair.  It worked just as good for me as well.  We both had great results even though we both have very different kinds of hair.  Overall it’s a great product and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something new for their hair care regime.</li>
            <li> I got to try the whole bunch of Insta Natural products with a very generous promotion. This Argan Oil is one of the products I really like, I would definitely buy it full price giving its size. I have very dry skin and use it mostly on my face and hands, and sometimes on my hair. I also add some to my moisturizer during the day.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is meant to!</li>
            <li> Good product. Strengthens hair. Got it at a reduce price for my review</li>
            <li> Make my hair soft, but not oily</li>
            <li> Great for smoothing... would like to have a better fragrance, but not bad</li>
            <li> good product easy absorb</li>
            <li> I have very fine, dry, curly hair. I have a lot of issues with breakage and most conditioners just weigh my curls down without helping with the breakage issue at all. After the first use of the Argan Oil, I noticed less hair in my brush. It also smoothed out my hair, making it less frizzy. I look forward to seeing if continued use makes more of a difference.</li>
            <li> I have been coloring my hair for 14 years now, I have dark brown hair and the grey hairs are taking over, they come in very coarse and frizzy, this Aryan oil treatment has been a lifesaver.  After the first application my hair was shiny and smooth immediately, but over the weeks of continuous use it has brought life back to my hair.  I blow dry and straighten my hair so often, it looked so dull, this product has brought back a more youthful look to my hair.  I thoroughly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great for hair. I also use this on my scalp as a treatment mask several hours before washing. Lot&#x27;s of great benefits</li>
            <li> works amazing for my bi-racial childrens hair. This is the perfect amount of moisture without leaving it feeling greasy!!!</li>
            <li> Great treatment for my hair, it now has a healthy sheen.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it makes my hair and skin feel so good! Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. It helps to keep the frizz down on my hair and make it look healthy. Start off by using a very little at first as it only takes a little bit. This huge bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Omg, makes my hair feel so good. I love argan oil hair products and if you&#x27;ve never tried them, I highly recommend it, espeically InstaNatural brand. This has tons of lovely ingredients that have so many health benefits. Love the shine I get from this. A little goes a long way and trust me, all you need is a little. This should last me for a good while and will purchase more once this is gone. I love it!!</li>
            <li> It helped keep my very thick, frizzy hair in control. I used it to help protect against heat damage and to help reverse damage from overrprocessing, and I am very happy with the results. My friend has finer, more controllable hair, and she liked her results as well. I will definitely be recommending this product to my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;Works great for all types of skin, I will definitely be buying again. I used For Face, Skin, Hair Growth, Stretch Marks, Scars, Nails, Muscle &amp; Joint Pain, great product and high quality!</li>
            <li> Great product works well.</li>
            <li> I wil buy again as it leaves my hair soft, not weighed down and frizz reduced. I have used it on my skin frequently and it works sooo well. I highly recommended it!!!</li>
            <li> Love my argan oil. Leaves my hair soft. Just a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Beautiful healthy hair is what you see when you use this.  It has a very light pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This is great for so many things! I&#x27;ve used this as an overnight treatment on my hair. I&#x27;ve also applied a small amount to my ends before blow drying and styling. And I&#x27;ve tried it on my cuticles. It works great for all of these things and I can&#x27;t wait to find many more uses for it!</li>
            <li> I have actually started receiving complements on my hair since using this product. My hair is fine and I use a small amount this oil as a leave in conditioner. My hair looks and feels so much healthier!!</li>
            <li> Works well, softens and moisturizes. Keeps my hair nice, soft and shiny but nothing to write home to mom about. There are better alternatives than this but for the price and the ingredients, it cant be beat. I use this after a shower and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy but it does leave my hand a bit sticky which I found annoying. It feels like a thin film is on our hands until you wash off. I received this at a one time discounted price to give my review. It&#x27;s nice but I won&#x27;t be buying more</li>
            <li> Love this oil.I have dry hair and I use it as a leave in conditioner.My ends are so soft and my hair looks healthier.</li>
            <li> This product does wonderful things for my permed hair, keeping it moisturized and soft.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> A little is all you need to get your hair more manageable. I have thin, dry and color treated hair. Just a tiny bit of this oil really goes a long way to conditioning my hair. I applied and brushed a little into my hair at night and it appeared to be a bit greasy, so I pinned my hair up. By morning it had soaked in and my hair was really a nice texture and very silky and smooth. It did a nice job of moisturizing my rough dry hands too.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I purchased one bottle and have used it in my hair, applied it to my chapped lips and twice daily to my hands, massaging into my cuticles. One thing I wanted to add was the oil is in a bottle with a pump, you can use as little or more without the mess of trying to pour oil out and it ends up everywhere but where you want it. The results in just 2 weeks are awesome. My nails and dry cuticles are healed, nails are healthy grow out, goodbye chapped winter lips and no fly away hair. I ordered two more bottles of oil to have one in the bathroom, kitchen and night stand. I do not do reviews so for me to post one, trust me it&#x27;s great product. I use lots of beauty products this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> Seems to work well,  but only as a night treatment and wash it out in the morning</li>
            <li> Light oil. Smells nice and not overpowering. I have bought three products from this company and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> Purchased on 22nd Jul 2014, written review on 05th Apr 2015&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been facing Hair Fall problem since last 2-3 years. After reading all the reviews on this Oil, I have purchased this product and started using regularly. I have even ordered the 2nd bottle to go on using further. I am not sure whether there is any regrowth of hair or not, but my Hair fall has been decreased or slowed down. I am sure, If I did not use this product, my hair fall would have been rapid as it is since last 2-3 years. I still use this oil and hope this will stop the hair fall at least completely</li>
            <li> I have color treated hair and this helps keep the moisture in. Leaves it soft and shiny</li>
            <li> Ok so I must&#x27;ve spent over a hundred dollars on hair products ranking from shampoo and conditioners to pomades and gel. The problem is that my hair is always dry and frizzy and never smooth and silky. And this probably has something to do with me applying shampoo every time I shower for a few years now, which by the way you shouldn&#x27;t do. Because it stops away the sebum that your hair glands produce. I tried a lot of stuff that made my hair feel great but only for a day or for a week and then it wouldn&#x27;t feel that way ever again. Then I had tons of hair products that made it look great, but you gotta understand that pomade and gel are pretty much entirely made up of chemicals. Plus I wanted my hair slick and smooth not rock hard as gel would make it. So decided to go with natural oils because I did some research on that and I gave this a go. It&#x27;s been three weeks in and my hair feels amazing. This is how I&#x27;ve always wanted my hair to feel. End of story. It&#x27;s organic plus it&#x27;s got all the best known oils on the market for healthy hair combined into one. Do the research on each of these oils and you&#x27;ll be surprised.</li>
            <li> I use this Argan Oil, not only for my hair but all over my body. Drama aside, this product has truly been life changing for me, as it has been the best moisturizing agent that has worked wonders for my skin and my dry and brittle hair! I use this several times a week and it never fails to pamper my skin, hair and nails!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Used it quite a few times over the past several weeks.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This oil  quality is good for the hair; the only negative issue is I received the product with leakage so I have lost some amount of the product in delivery!</li>
            <li> Yes this is a great product. I loved it! I have curly, thick hair and it gives it the moisture and de-frizzing that it desperately needs. It is light and non-oily and a little goes a long way. I highly recommend this product and have been looking for something that works like this for a long time.  I give it five stars*****</li>
            <li> This the greatest combination of oils that I have ever found for a hair treatment.  It definitely helps my hair with smoothness and styling.</li>
            <li> I received The Argan Oil hair treatment for review. I like the dispenser on the amber packaged bottle because you can control the amount you need to pump out for your hair. I used this treatment on my hair for about 5 min and went into the shower and left it on a little longer, then I poured water over my hair and used my shampoo on top of it. I just washed like normal and when I got out of the shower my hair felt moisturized and not oily. I towel dried my hair and my waves bounced into place without a weighed down feeling and it air dried beautifully and not frizzy. After it dried I just scrunched my hair with sea salt spray and hairspray and was ready to leave the house with confidence . I love Argan Oil :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, not sure it is doing any &#x27;growing&#x27; or not. Another thing, the &#x27;spout&#x27; opening is too big. Use a smaller &#x27;spray&#x27; opening so it can get a reasonable amount &#x27;on the right place&#x27; and not &#x27;squirt it off in any odd direction&#x27;. Too wasteful.</li>
            <li> Great product. Good for any type of hair. The down side is that it makes ur hair a little oily, but again all oils do! Seen a difference in after 3-4 uses, made my hair more calm and smooth and looks great.</li>
            <li> It really keeps your style longer and makes your hair look great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have a single product that is an oil treatment, frizz reducer, or thermal protectant for you hair depending on how you use it. It&#x27;s convenient and doesn&#x27;t weigh down your hair if used properly.</li>
            <li> This smells like diarrhea! I tried it three times, and the experience was the same each time. It&#x27;s okay when smelling it in the bottle, but when putting it through my hair, it&#x27;s horrible. I left it in my hair for a few hours and kept smelling diarrhea throughout. I love all the oils blended into this - and none of them smell this way on their own! - but this is definitely going back.</li>
            <li> I received this quickly and was not able to use it until last night on my hair. I have ALWAYS had soft hair until I reached a certain age. My hair has been driving me crazy because it does not even feel like my hair any more. I have spent a lot of money trying different shampoo and conditioner but it still does not feel soft. I tried this for the first time last night. I put it in my hair then massaged it in thoroughly. It did feel weird having oily hair but what the heck, I was at home! About an hour later, I took a shower and washed my hair as normal. I noticed immediately when it began drying that it felt soft and &#x27;alive&#x27;. I figured it would still dry out over night, but was pleasantly surprised this morning when I woke up! It was soft to the feel and even looked softer! Even my grey hairs were soft! I LOVE IT!!!!! I am at the end of the day now and it still feels like my 6 year old granddaughters soft and silky hair!</li>
            <li> Thai argan oil hair treatment has many uses,i used it on my hair after I shampoo my hair and I was very happy with the results,my hair  and my scalp felt very refreshed.I also used this oil as a styling aid for my natural curls,my hair loved this treatment with these pent rating oils,and also the shine.I HAVE RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNT FOR MY HONEST AND UNBIASED FEEDBACK.</li>
            <li> Very superb hair product. My hair felt soft and luxurious, I live argan oil .Disclosure: I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product can be way better. I soaked my hair in this and then slept with a towel underneath. I then took a bath in the morning and my hair was super soft, no frizz, and bouncy. Make sure you wash it all off real good. Most of the oil was put on the ends and the middle of my hair and very little on the roots.&lt;br /&gt;Can be used as a serum, but you should only use a small dot , because it will make your hair oily.</li>
            <li> Very good! Products works just like i need it to! I will buy again</li>
            <li> It was Ok, but I expected something else.</li>
            <li> Great deep conditioning treatment! Great customer service also in case you have any questions or concerns.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and soft Argan oil is the best period making my nails grow as well</li>
            <li> used once and wont use again,&lt;br /&gt;it left my hair clunky as if I haven&#x27;t washed my hair in a while.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick asian hair and I only used a pea size of this. what a waste of money spent that did nothing to my hair but make it greasy all over again.</li>
            <li> I love using this in my hair before a bath. I have oily hair so I cant use this as a shine booster or flyaway timer. So every week I add this to my hair and sit in the tub for 20 mins while it works its magic. I then wash it out. My hair has been so delicious and shines since I started using this. It is like night and day.</li>
            <li> Good hair moisturizer. I find it to work better than pure argan oil. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Left my hair oily when applied wet or dry and remained frizzy after shampooing....I am very disappointed .</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with how well the oil improves the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> The Nectar of the Hair Goddess..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love..love..LOVE natural products.. so of course I&#x27;m game to try as many as I can.. I have naturally curly hair, so I love to use products that can enhance my curls, or moisturize and nourish my hair in the kindest way. InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Treatment was exactly that.. A pure unadulterated &amp;#34;treat&amp;#34; for my tresses. This exclusive (pleasure in a bottle) contains some heavy hitters:&lt;br /&gt;•shea butter&lt;br /&gt;•coconut oil&lt;br /&gt;•jojoba oil&lt;br /&gt;•olive oil&lt;br /&gt;•grapeseed oil&lt;br /&gt;I used a small amount of product and finger-combed it through, before wrapping my hair in a satin scarf at night. I repeated the process again in the morning before styling my hair.  This product adds a lot of shine to your locks, and soaks into your scalp generously-so let me reiterate that just a small amount does the trick. I was also able to use this product as a heat protectant when I decided to flat-iron and blow dry my hair after washing. There is just the slightest scent to the product, but it&#x27;s so faint, it&#x27;s barely even noticeable. The consistency is somewhat thick but, not sticky or heavy.&lt;br /&gt; My hair is normally:&lt;br /&gt;•dry&lt;br /&gt;•brittle&lt;br /&gt;•frizzy&lt;br /&gt;•damaged&lt;br /&gt;I felt that this product helped to manage my hair and repaired a lot of the dry, brittle trauma that I am unfortunately used to. I used the Argan Oil Treatment faithfully for the last 30 days to determine just how much progress was noticeable. I observed a distinct difference in the overall appearance of my hair, and just how much this fabulous product restored my strands, and renewed my faith in yet another natural hair product. My arsenal is growing and of course I will add InstaNatural Argan Oil  Hair Treatment to my top 5.</li>
            <li> Thumbs up!  I use the Argan Oil in my hair, especially on the dried ends, and it softens and conditions my hair overnight. You can use it during the day, but I usually use it at night as it goes on a bit greasy for my liking.  Although it does feel a bit greasy going on, it doesn&#x27;t leave any trace of grease, just softness. I highly recommend using it in your hair right after you go swimming.  I put it on my in my hair right after I am done swimming, and by the time I am home from the pool and I jump in the shower to wash my hair, the Agran Oil has done it&#x27;s magic, and my hair is soft and smooth.  I love it!  I also love that the company has a 100% 100-Day satisfaction guarantee policy - awesome because you can try this product risk free!  And what&#x27;s not to love about no added chemicals?  Don&#x27;t forget to take a peak at their blog, they have a lot of great ideas on how to use Argan oil besides just for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> My wife was interested in trying argan oil, so when I was offered an opportunity to try some, I got a bottle for her to use. Her comments are below. When she mentions &amp;#34;hair loss,&amp;#34; she&#x27;s referring to a significant permanent hair loss that she had while in college forty years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I have extremely fine and thinning hair.  I tried the Argon Oil as a leave-in hair conditioner for two weeks.  The product is easy to use and absorbs into the hair nicely.  I did not notice any residue on the pillow case from applying the product at night as a leave-in treatment.  My hair loss is so extreme that I am resigned to wearing wigs or hats much of the time when I&#x27;m away from the house.  I keep my hair cut very short to minimize breakage.  The Argan Oil has made a difference in the strength and feel of my hair in just two weeks.  It feels and looks fuller and stronger.  Some treatments are so heavy that the hair is matted down and looks worse from the treatment.  The Argan Oil is lightweight and does not weigh down the individual hairs.  There was no significant shine improvement, but it may take a longer treatment time for this to become evident.  It has a luxurious feel and a pleasant aroma.  I would recommend the product as a good conditioner for any type of hair.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product sample of argan oil was provided by InstaNatural for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Love the stuff!  I use it on my hair and body.  I love that it is all natural ingredients!</li>
            <li> Love it, it makes my hair shiny, soft and no frizzys.</li>
            <li> InstaNaturals makes a great line of beauty products. They were kind enough to send me a bottle of Argan Oil Hair Treatment to try out and review for the Beauty Diva blog. I received a 4 ounce spray bottle of the argan oil blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair treatment is a blend of argan oil, shea butter, coconut oil, jojoba oil, olive oil, grapeseed oil and sunflower oil. I use about half a teaspoon of the oil on my long hair but use less if you have shorter hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the hair treatment as a leave in conditioner after I wash my hair. My hair is about 3 inches past my shoulders so the ends tend to get a bit dry. I concentrate using the oil on the ends of my hair, to help repair the split ends. Since my scalp is oily I avoid using the oil on my scalp and bangs. The argan oil keeps my hair hydrated and prevents it from turning into a frizzy mess down here in hot and HUMID south Florida.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil can be used as a leave in conditioner (that&#x27;s how I like to use it), as an over night conditioning treatment or use it as a deep conditioning treatment and wash it out after 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something to help your dry hair this is the product for you.  I like that it&#x27;s made up of 100% plant based oils, I&#x27;m always on the look out for as natural things as I can find to use for personal use. All of these oils are very good for your hair!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, I used this also on the ends of my hair. Gives a nice sheen, makes hair a lot easier to comb without getting greasy.  I like the pump dispenser rather than a dropper.  This is a nice product, great value.</li>
            <li> I try a lot of products for my dry, naturally curly hair and this is a god one. My hair feels soft and moisturized after I use it.</li>
            <li> Quick, friendly, perfect!</li>
            <li> Great hair product. I used for a week and noticed my hair was softer and more manageable. Also used as a moisturizer for my hands! Worked great. Good company too, easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my straight thick hair and it works really well. A little drop is good to rub into the hair gently. This is a big bottle and it lasts for a long time. Five stars for the amazing quality and price.</li>
            <li> This is what you need! One recommendation is don&#x27;t put too much on your palms when putting this in your hair after shower or your hair will look really greasy in the morning . All the oils in this bottle are the most awesome collection you will find</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use too much or you will need to wash your hair again!  So little does so much as a leave in conditioner.  Not as thick as Fakkai&#x27;s oil or Organix Morrocan Argan oil.  For the price I would rather use one of thos two.</li>
            <li> I put it on my hair every night and then shampoo the next morning.  My hair feels so much softer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m natural and have 4b hair and it made it feel amazingly soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Works great for me.  I use it once a week, putting a small amount on my hair before shampooing.  I leave it on for a couple of hours.  It does come out easily with the shampoo, and does not leave my hair greasy. After blow drying, I add just a small drop, rubbed between my hands to my hair, and this small amount does not make may hair greasy either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this product my hair is much more manageable, and in better condition.  I have quit using the conditioner and mousse I was using beforehand, as I do not even need them when I use this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given a sample to evaluate, and liked the oil so much that I have just purchased another bottle.</li>
            <li> Great for ends but if all over, too greasy even if you have extremely dry hair. Had to experiment to get correct amount.</li>
            <li> ~~ Quick Quote: A pure and all-natural product that leaves hair looking and feeling healthier! ~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When InstaNatural approached me about reviewing their products, there were a couple that caught my eye, but the Argan Oil hair treatment was one of several that my girlfriend requested. The following is her honest feedback:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;-- Over the past year I&#x27;ve gained an interest in hair treatments to help fix damaged hair. About twice a year I&#x27;ll go to the salon to color my hair, and recently I&#x27;ve noticed a few more split ends then I used to get. So I&#x27;ll pick up a new &#x60;treatment&#x27; and test it out. After reading the backs of them, they have just about as many chemicals in them as the hair dye does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this oil is it&#x27;s natural, and it&#x27;s just oil! That&#x27;s it. Oil. No chemicals. No preservatives. No hoopla to try and read through and pretend knowing what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my hair is really thick and long, I have to use more pumps of this stuff than most people most likely have to, so I find I&#x27;m going through it quicker. However, after using it twice (two weeks in a row), I&#x27;ve noticed how shiny my hair has been!  Typically I put the oil in, put my hair in a bun on the top of my head and let it sit for a minimum of 2 hours before I go up and shampoo it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doing so, I really do think it helps restore the shine in my hair (since color treated hair can get dull). It doesn&#x27;t have a distinct smell to it, so it won&#x27;t bother you while you&#x27;re going about your day. But because it IS oil, you have to make sure you do a decent job at washing it out. Leftover WILL cause your hair to get greasier quicker. After showering it out, my hair feels smooth, clean, and looks VERY nice! \\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I have been very pleased with InstaNatural&#x27;s product line, and the Hair elixir is no exception. With all natural ingredients and a reasonable price, I have no problems recommending this product!</li>
            <li> I have thick shoulder lenght hair and I&#x27;ve been using this oil treatment for about 2 weeks now, I have try different brands and so far this is the best thing I&#x27;ve found. My hair is much softer, shiny and healthier than ever. I love that your hair don&#x27;t feel oily and it&#x27;s great for your skin also.. LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Best hair treatment ever used..</li>
            <li> The seller sent me a free sample.  This is perfect for my dry, coarse hair.  Makes it shine, but&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;better yet leaves my hair controllable.  Takes away the wiriness!!!  Thanks for the sample, because I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will be reordering.  Their service is great.</li>
            <li> I have very thick should length hair. I use about a 1/2 a pump on my hair, any more than that and I look like a greasy mess.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried it as a leave in conditioner and it makes my hair crunchy so i won&#x27;t do that again. If I&#x27;m straightening my hair I put it in before I blow dry. If I&#x27;m curling my hair i put it in after I curl it. I do like it. I might try something different when it is gone tho. And if you have thin hair, DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> This product met all of my expectations when it came to moisturizing and conditioning my hair. I also love this product for straightening my hair as well. Thank you for making such a much needed product!</li>
            <li> Amazing product if you are looking for a super soft hair. My first time to love such a product</li>
            <li> This is not a bad product but I was not blown away by the results.  I had intended to use it as a leave in prior to styling but the consistency makes my hair too greasy for that (it also adds on another half hour of blow drying time, no thanks).  I have ultimately started using it as a mask overnight but once again I have to say I&#x27;m a bit disappointed because I already have an Argan oil mask product that I was happy with using for overnights.  All in all I&#x27;m not that upset because the price was moderate but I won&#x27;t be buying it again as a leave-in treatment.</li>
            <li> Very heavy. Had to wash my hair two days in a row to get it out.</li>
            <li> I love anything with argan oil in it. It is a new love of mine, makes my hair soft, shiny and smooth. The Argan Oil Hair Treatment works great if you have a dry scalp as well. You can read my full review below on my blog: [...]</li>
            <li> Love this product, great for my hair.. Can see the bounce!</li>
            <li> Definitely love this!  It has a gentle scent, almost a nutty scent, not woodsy and not overpowering.  The pump dispenses a modest amount so you can easily decide how much you want without a handful of oil to deal with.  It&#x27;s not too thick, not too liquid - I find it the perfect viscosity for my hair.  I have hair that tends to want to dry out, especially on the ends, it&#x27;s very thick and wavy/curly. I use this in-between washes on the ends of my hair, and if it&#x27;s humid out or I know I&#x27;ll be in the sun, I&#x27;ll apply all over.  It soaks in within about 10-15 minutes for a non-greasy feel and until I wash my hair, it&#x27;s smooth, soft and my curls stay defined without the need of gel! I have seen less split ends since using hair treatment - it&#x27;s my go to product for my hair!</li>
            <li> I used it 10mins before washing my hair and it instantly gives it a smooth feel.&lt;br /&gt;Hair feels smooth all day long.</li>
            <li> excellent for very dry hair.</li>
            <li> This argan oil hair treatment helps keep my gray hair very soft and manageable.  Love it!</li>
            <li> The scent of this product is a little disturbing, but it did seem to make my hair very soft and manageable,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product in return of my HONEST review.</li>
            <li> I have straight Asian hair that tends to get a lot of fly aways and breakage underneath from wearing ponytails.  I use this as a weekly hair treatment since my roots get oily and I just need it on my problem areas.  The results are immediate: sleeker, shinier, and softer hair!  I shampoo my hair, apply a couple of squirts of treatment near the ends and breakage areas, wait 10 minutes, and shampoo twice to get the treatment out.  No need for conditioner.  Voila!  Love the result and so does hubby.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> Got it for free... Used it just once and I LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;It made my dry ends smooth and my wavy hair practically straight without the nasty spilt ends I always get... Great find!</li>
            <li> Used this on my hair and loved it!!!! Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works great.  Thanks</li>
            <li> We love it!  It is so great on hair and on skin!  We use it everyday will have to order more soon.  I especially like to use it on my tattoos and on my sons hair!  Makes them both shiny 😂  thanks for the great price!</li>
            <li> My hair is color treated and needs repair often. This stuff really helped after only one use!</li>
            <li> Lovely on my hair!&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way but it&#x27;s just what I expected.</li>
            <li> So I have been making my own shampoo bars for some time now. I have been on the lookout for a conditioner that&#x27;s all nature and free of the yucky stuff. Low and behold I think I just found what I have been looking for! This makes my hair so soft and manageable and shiny. What a wonderful product to have stumbled upon.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love Argan oil and it loves my hair, whoever gets this will be just as in love as i am</li>
            <li> This oil smells great and is good quality. Easy to use, and a little bit goes a long way. Works well on my long hair.</li>
            <li> beware that this is something you put on your hair BEFORE you wash it, not after. If you put on after, your hair would be really greasy. Doesn&#x27;t make much difference to my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my hair. I&#x27;ve tried a couple different oils and they help make my hair look nice and shiny, but I feel like THIS oil really penetrates into my hair and really makes it healthy. I have naturally wavy, thick, dry, course hair that damages and gets split ends very easily. I have only used this product a handful of times, but my hair has never been healthier! My hair is no longer damaged looking AT ALL and it&#x27;s never been softer or shinier. I usually apply it after a shower while my hair is still damp. And sometimes I&#x27;ll put some in right before bed to let my hair soak it up. I can see where it might make some people look oily, but if you have course hair like mine that is naturally very dry, I would recommend this a thousand times over! I know sometimes reading these reviews can make you skeptical, but this review is my 100% honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I give very few 5 stars. Since my hair is naturally course and dry I have over the years tried almost everything available, plus I have made a few of my own. So far this is the best I have found. I have on one occasion left it on overnight before washing, and twice applied just before a shower, .i plan to keep using it, I just wish it weren&#x27;t $20, but it is definitely the best product I have found.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair feel smooth and soft! Great for all hair types, a little bit goes a long way! Smells good and really makes a difference in your hairs look and texture</li>
            <li> So excited to have this. I love using Argan Oil in my hair. It keeps it moisturized and cut down on blow drying time. Can&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence about this one. I have fine hair and although my blow dry time was cut much shorter and my hair was tamed, I noticed that it weighed it down quite a bit. I also started to get pretty itchy after a day. I may continue to try this a few more times before I decide if it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;Yay&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;Nay&amp;#34; product - but as of this moment, it&#x27;s nothing to run home to.</li>
            <li> Very very nice product! I have used other Argan Oils and this seems very nice! I LOVE the bottle!</li>
            <li> This Argan oil treatment leaves your hair soft and silky but not weighed down! Very easy to use, place some in the palm of your hands and work it thru your hair. Leave on and rinse off and your hair is silky and glowing!</li>
            <li> I really love this product! After only using it once it made a difference, now when I have used it a few times, I really love it! My hair is shiney, soft, and after using it a few times it looks like my split ends are gone! I know they haven&#x27;t just disappeared,  but the oil must be &#x27;holding&#x27;them together.&lt;br /&gt; I recieved this for free for giving my honest feedback, and I would reccommend this to anyone that wants soft, silky, shiney hair!</li>
            <li> Incredible results, even after just one use. I opted to dive right in and do an overnight treatment on my hair. I coated my hair (l have long hair past mid back) then put it up in a bun and slept with the oil in. I washed it out the next morning and immediately noticed an improved texture. My hair felt more moisturized and had more volume. As crazy as it sounds, doing the oil soak actually made my hair less oily. I usually shampoo every other day... And was able to go 4 days begone needing to this time. My hair looks shiny and feels great.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair smooth and shiny! It also is light so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair dawn.</li>
            <li> Loved loved this! I used this after my shower and left in over night. I&#x27;m always a little nervous using these in case my hair looks to greasy. I was pleasantly surprised when I woke up and brushed my hair to see NO grease! I will definitely purchase again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Love that it was on a promotion for $1. I expected a small bottle, 15 ml or so, but this was a full 4oz bottle.</li>
            <li> Received this at a great price from Uberz. This will be my second week using.  I LOVE how it has helped my hair become much smoother and less tangible.  I use it daily but mostly on Friday night as a deep oil treatment.  Leaving it on overnight then wake up to shampoo n rinse leaving my hair not only soft but shiny without the oily feeling.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using a little in my hair at night before bed, then wash in the morning. It makes my hair shinier, softer, more healthy looking. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have to be honest - I haven&#x27;t actually used this product so I can&#x27;t speak for how well it works.  However, the smell of this is so off putting that I will never put this product in my hair.  It smells like fertilizer and I do not want to walk around all day smelling like that.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This product has changed my hair from ordinary to awesome, it makes it really shinny and soft and it just looks fuller.  I was never one touse leave in conditioners or treatments, but this one has made a believer out of me. awesome results, for a more manageable hair with no split ends I would recommend to try this product</li>
            <li> Love love love this! My 4 year old has very long hair. Not only does this help tame it on frizzy days, it&#x27;s making the ends softer and they aren&#x27;t splitting like they were before. Something I&#x27;d invest in after we run out for sure. I agreed to write my honest opinion in return for getting this product free</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I massaged this through my hair,  left it on for 15 minutes then washed and conditioned my hair normally and it looks amazing! It is shiny, soft and I can see a big improvement with my split ends. I also love the fact that it has a pump dispenser so it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Argan Oil Hair Treatment - I recieved this product on a promotion and had never tried Argon Oil before although I have seen it just about everywhere in hair care.  I have always kind of balked at using oil on my hair as I have fine thin hair and was concerned it would make my hair oily or flat.  Turns out I was wrong - I used it as a hair mask per the instructions and when I shampooed it out my hair felt fantastic - super smooth and silky and not at all greasy or oily.  I styled as usual with a root enhancer and blow dry which I ususally finish with a dry oil to give a little shine but I actually skipped the dry oil I felt my hair had a nice shine or luminosity to it.  I am going to continue using this on a weekly basis as a mask!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but this product has been amazing for my hair! I process my hair a lot between color highlights and keratin but could never find a product that could help overnight like this one. I will definitely buy this again once I run low.</li>
            <li> Love this argan oil it&#x27;s not heavy &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy. I mix it with my conditioner it&#x27;s gives my hair a light shine without being heavy,</li>
            <li> I used this in my hair as directed and was not pleased with the results. It is a very thin treatment- basically several oils mixed together. It did not work nearly as well as other hair treatments I&#x27;ve tried on the past. I washed my hair twice after the treatment and my hair still looks greasy. Any moisture gained by the treatment  is negated by the fact I&#x27;m having to wash my hair more than usual to get the oiliness out! Definitely not on par with the brand I usually purchase from Sephora. I will stick with that brand for sure.</li>
            <li> Great product. My hair was dry and brittle. I&#x27;ve tried different hair oils but this one gave me instant results. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel soft and it looks very healthy and has a great shine without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> I use it after I have used your Argan oil shampoo, a little pool in the palm of my hand and rub them together and apply to my hair. Start on the outside of my hair then start running my fingers through it, not only has it also done wonders for the condition of my hair and scalp but I can see the shine in my hair without it being oily.  I have hair down pass my waist so needs special care.  Have used as instructed by applying to saturation and letting it sit prior to shampooing. It makes a world of difference to my hair. Your product can be used for so many areas, have to admit I rub it on elbows, hands, feet, legs and it makes my skin so soft. Just want  to say Thank You  for such wonderful products.</li>
            <li> I love how silky this makes my hair!  I improves the texture as well.</li>
            <li> One pump is the perfect amount for my long thick hair.  Makes it shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Very nice conditioning results but it is a little sticky feeling</li>
            <li> Gives lots of shine to my really dry ends!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this on my cuticles and it prevents them from drying and tearing at the sides of my nails; it&#x27;s really wonderful for dry skin and you only need a little -- if you do use it for this purpose I would recommend applying right after a shower. I didn&#x27;t really notice much of an argan oil scent but that&#x27;s okay by me. I did take off one star, however, because I can&#x27;t use it on my hair. It weighs down my super fine hair and makes it look greasy (even when I apply just a little), but it might be because this product contains a variety of oils. Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Very amazing product!</li>
            <li> It has restored life to my dry, brittle, over processed hair. I put it on every night after I shampoo my hair. I let my hair air dry. Then the next morning I style it. My hair is so much easier to style now. I am glad to have recieved this product to review. It makes my hair soft, silky and shiny and smoothes away the dry frizzies! Love it!</li>
            <li> I drench my hair in this treatment at night and sleep with it on my hair twice a week.  When I wake up I shampoo my hair twice and condition it.  I apply a small drop on my hair before blow drying and a small drop after blow drying to smooth my hair.  My hair is shiny and soft as a result.  No more split ends!</li>
            <li> Really bad product, stains clothes... Just oil with no scent. Stays on your face. Nasty...</li>
            <li> I put this in my hair and left it in about 45 minutes while I did some light house cleaning. I washed it out using my shampoo and the results were astounding. My hair was much softer, silkier, less frizzy and had volume. It did not leave my hair greasy or oily. I have very fine hair so anything that makes it look thicker is great! I recieved this product for review and have been very pleased with my results after a few weeks. My hair feels so much healthier and nourished. It&#x27;s easier to style and shines like never before! I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a particularly oily serum. Maybe I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough. I didn&#x27;t realize that&#x27;s what it would be. It&#x27;s WAY too oily to just wear in my hair, but I&#x27;ve been mixing it with some other oils and using it as night treatment and that&#x27;s working well for me. The ingredients look good.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! My hair started growing non stop. Must buy product.</li>
            <li> Makes me itch and break out like crazy</li>
            <li> I have really long hair but I only need a drop or two to rub into my ends to help with dryness and smoothness.</li>
            <li> I liked the product but it makes my hair&lt;br /&gt;to flat.</li>
            <li> I HAVE LONG HAIR AND SHAMPOO EVERYDAY.  I THINK THAT WHY MY HAIR ALWAYS DRY AND DAMAGE.  I USE THIS INSTANATURAL ARGAN OIL HAIR TREATMENT MY HAIR LOOK MORE SMOOTH AND NOT TOO DRY.  WISH MY HAIR WILL SHINING AND MOISTURE ONE DAY. OF COURSE I WILL KEEP TO USE IT.I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different products and so far this is the best one I have used.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! My hair is coarse and wavy curls. This made my hair feel soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Love this oil..it has a wonderful scent and does what it&#x27;s supposed to..</li>
            <li> All the ingredient in this argan oil. No more having to buy multiple oil because this is an all in one product. I&#x27;ve been using this for about three weeks  on my hair. I put about four pumps for my long hair full off the oil in my hands and massage it on my scalp and towards the ends of my hair. I can honestly say that my hair feels a lot softer and thicker because of this oil. Thank you for the opportunity to review this product.</li>
            <li> I put this in my hair about 20 minutes before I wash it. Protects from harsh shampoo. Leaves hair silky and shiny</li>
