            <li>Kind of OK.</li>
            <li>the price was right, and the micro beads in the soap feels great.</li>
            <li>It smells good and makes me clean, what more is there to say?</li>
            <li>I love dove products.</li>
            <li>I will have to say that it has replaced Nivea Men&#x27;s as my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love the product  </li>
            <li>Probably my favorite body soap.</li>
            <li>I really love this soap.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t know how better to describe it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to use it on my body and face with no worries.</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>rather it had more suds and lather than the scrubbing grit it has in it</li>
            <li>I love Dove soap.  </li>
            <li>Okay, ladies...</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>My favorite of ALL the Dove Men Care products line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Dove for Men products for a while and love them.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t like the microbe ads, for environmental reasons, otherwise love it.</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is one many wouldn&#x27;t find appealing either.</li>
            <li>it feels more like a scrub than a wash</li>
            <li>I love this product  both the wash and bar soap.</li>
            <li>Has a very nice manly scent, not old man just good scent that&#x27;s not girly - if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good body wash.</li>
            <li>I used this product for about 3 months now and the deep clean one is the best smelling and contains micro scrubbers.</li>
            <li>#34;it smells really good&amp;#34;, which is a good thing coming from him, he can be picky.</li>
            <li>Smell is more of a fresh clean smell which is nice in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Love the fresh feeling and scent it leaves on the skin!</li>
            <li>It works easily.</li>
            <li>This is a great product by dove,has a nice clean scent, has moisturizers to help with dry skin,and makes you feel awake in the morning...</li>
            <li>Fine, I believe I could buy it at target cheaper.</li>
            <li>It works fine in place of soap in the shower though.</li>
            <li>I like the convenience of having the scent needed readily available.</li>
            <li>This soap makes one feel clean without drying out one&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>While there is a bit of \\&quot;grittyness\\&quot; to the way it feels it rinses away clean.  </li>
            <li>but it does make my skin feel clean.</li>
            <li>He still smells like my husband, just clean.</li>
            <li>and you do feel really clean after wards.</li>
            <li>The pleasant, but understated scent is a real extra.</li>
            <li>Smooth on skin, doesn&#x27;t dry skin and it has good, light, pleasing smell.</li>
            <li>It is an extra clean layer of smelling good.</li>
            <li>It has really cool fragrance</li>
            <li>I love using this as it has crystals that scrub my skin and makes me smell very manly.  </li>
            <li>Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
            <li>This particular scent is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this product as it refreshes and makes  you come alive.  </li>
            <li>Keeps your skin moist all day and that my friends will keep a smile on your face.</li>
            <li>This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve tried this body wash and it has a nice feel to it.  </li>
            <li>Its worth  buying!!&lt;br /&gt;Especially when we have deal of subscribe and save offer.</li>
            <li>And leaves you feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>and I found myself using another product right after this one because I didn&#x27;t feel like it even did anything.</li>
            <li>the product doesn&#x27;t provide a large lather and doesn&#x27;t wash clean without a good few rinses.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that they were using micro-scrubbers made out of a polymer (which end up bypassing waste-water treatment plants and end up in the environment) out but based on the label it looks like it&#x27;s pretty much a natural (albeit very mild)</li>
            <li>The product I like very much.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend is not very picky when it comes to what he gets as a body wash, but he really liked how this smelled</li>
            <li>and he really likes it!  </li>
            <li>I like the grit , but the bars seem to do a better job of actually cleaning.</li>
            <li>I only gave it two stars because of the price; otherwise, more like one.</li>
            <li>It can be purchased locally for a bit more money, unless it is on sale.  </li>
            <li>This product really scrubs your face and body skin for some exfoliation, and it leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel fresh and the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming like a couple of other brands.</li>
            <li>And Dove now offers a full mens line that include body wash, shampoo, conditioner and deodorant.</li>
            <li>This body wash does an overall good job, but it seems alot of it has to be used to be useful as far as the deep cleaning aspect of it.</li>
            <li>but that is used to make sure your skin is exfoliated and all the dirt and dry skin are removed.</li>
            <li>If you want a good soap without smelling like you are trying to hard</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>they have a very competitive price.</li>
            <li>Dove has been a lifelong love of mine.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really moisturize</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really lather up well and requires reapplication&lt;</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Just doesn&#x27;t sud up as much as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>much better&lt;</li>
            <li>This stuff works very well.</li>
            <li>worked better than expected didn&#x27;t dry out my skin micro beads washed off easy almost scentless</li>
            <li>worked better than expected didn&#x27;t dry out my skin micro beads washed off easy almost scentless</li>
            <li>Love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but would appreciate it if the moisturizing effect would be a little more intense.</li>
            <li>B00372DYFQ Dove Men Plus Care Body Wash, Deep Clean, 13.5 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>Kind of less foamy and doesn&#x27;t leave skin as smooth as other versions.</li>
            <li>This product is by far one of the higher end body washes to use for a guy.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new body wash that wasn&#x27;t too overpowering but at the same time I wanted something that make you feel clean without any residue.  </li>
            <li>a cross between a douglas fir and clean sheets without it being too masculine.</li>
            <li>The micro beads are nice, I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of work on my car lately and normally</li>
            <li>I love the little textured body washes because there is less effort to make them lather - and they feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and cant use anything else.  </li>
            <li>I normally use something like old spice but wanted to change it up.</li>
            <li>Micro moisture give different bathing experience that many other leading body wash products in market cannot.</li>
            <li>In most other products I&#x27;ve tried that have these beads, they actually work.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend uses Dove Men Deep Clean as his daily cleanser and he has no complaints.</li>
            <li>I like dove body wash but not a big fan of deep clean version.</li>
            <li>The Dove doesn&#x27;t get nearly as sudsy as the old spice</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s too fragrant and not that masculine.</li>
            <li>It leaves you skin feeling soft and invigorated.</li>
            <li>the only downside is that there isnt much sud.</li>
            <li>I do not like scented body soap, or at least the strong scents like this and AXE.  </li>
            <li>but the beads are quite large and rough when used for washing.</li>
            <li>I work out a lot and count on Dove products to keep me acceptable for society in general.</li>
            <li>the stuff looks weird; kind of like semen with micro beads in</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to this body wash based on other reviewers&#x27; reviews here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I really like the scent and the little scrubbing beads in this body wash.</li>

            <li> Has a very nice manly scent, not old man just good scent that&#x27;s not girly - if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good body wash.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 3 months now and the deep clean one is the best smelling and contains micro scrubbers.</li>
            <li> #34;it smells really good&amp;#34;, which is a good thing coming from him, he can be picky.</li>
            <li> Smell is more of a fresh clean smell which is nice in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love the fresh feeling and scent it leaves on the skin!</li>
            <li> It works easily.</li>
            <li> This is a great product by dove,has a nice clean scent, has moisturizers to help with dry skin,and makes you feel awake in the morning...</li>
            <li> Fine, I believe I could buy it at target cheaper.</li>
            <li> It works fine in place of soap in the shower though.</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of having the scent needed readily available.</li>
            <li> This soap makes one feel clean without drying out one&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> While there is a bit of \\&quot;grittyness\\&quot; to the way it feels it rinses away clean.  </li>
            <li> but it does make my skin feel clean.</li>
            <li> He still smells like my husband, just clean.</li>
            <li> and you do feel really clean after wards.</li>
            <li> The pleasant, but understated scent is a real extra.</li>
            <li> Smooth on skin, doesn&#x27;t dry skin and it has good, light, pleasing smell.</li>
            <li> It is an extra clean layer of smelling good.</li>
            <li> It has really cool fragrance</li>
            <li> I love using this as it has crystals that scrub my skin and makes me smell very manly.  </li>
            <li> Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
            <li> This particular scent is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it refreshes and makes  you come alive.  </li>
            <li> Keeps your skin moist all day and that my friends will keep a smile on your face.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve tried this body wash and it has a nice feel to it.  </li>
            <li> Its worth  buying!!&lt;br /&gt;Especially when we have deal of subscribe and save offer.</li>
            <li> And leaves you feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> and I found myself using another product right after this one because I didn&#x27;t feel like it even did anything.</li>
            <li> the product doesn&#x27;t provide a large lather and doesn&#x27;t wash clean without a good few rinses.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that they were using micro-scrubbers made out of a polymer (which end up bypassing waste-water treatment plants and end up in the environment) out but based on the label it looks like it&#x27;s pretty much a natural (albeit very mild)</li>
            <li> The product I like very much.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is not very picky when it comes to what he gets as a body wash, but he really liked how this smelled</li>
            <li> and he really likes it!  </li>
            <li> I like the grit , but the bars seem to do a better job of actually cleaning.</li>
            <li> I only gave it two stars because of the price; otherwise, more like one.</li>
            <li> It can be purchased locally for a bit more money, unless it is on sale.  </li>
            <li> This product really scrubs your face and body skin for some exfoliation, and it leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel fresh and the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming like a couple of other brands.</li>
            <li> And Dove now offers a full mens line that include body wash, shampoo, conditioner and deodorant.</li>
            <li> This body wash does an overall good job, but it seems alot of it has to be used to be useful as far as the deep cleaning aspect of it.</li>
            <li> but that is used to make sure your skin is exfoliated and all the dirt and dry skin are removed.</li>
            <li> If you want a good soap without smelling like you are trying to hard</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> they have a very competitive price.</li>
            <li> Dove has been a lifelong love of mine.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really moisturize</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really lather up well and requires reapplication&lt;</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t sud up as much as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> much better&lt;</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well.</li>
            <li> worked better than expected didn&#x27;t dry out my skin micro beads washed off easy almost scentless</li>
            <li> worked better than expected didn&#x27;t dry out my skin micro beads washed off easy almost scentless</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but would appreciate it if the moisturizing effect would be a little more intense.</li>
            <li> B00372DYFQ Dove Men Plus Care Body Wash, Deep Clean, 13.5 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Kind of less foamy and doesn&#x27;t leave skin as smooth as other versions.</li>
            <li> This product is by far one of the higher end body washes to use for a guy.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new body wash that wasn&#x27;t too overpowering but at the same time I wanted something that make you feel clean without any residue.  </li>
            <li> a cross between a douglas fir and clean sheets without it being too masculine.</li>
            <li> The micro beads are nice, I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of work on my car lately and normally</li>
            <li> I love the little textured body washes because there is less effort to make them lather - and they feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and cant use anything else.  </li>
            <li> I normally use something like old spice but wanted to change it up.</li>
            <li> Micro moisture give different bathing experience that many other leading body wash products in market cannot.</li>
            <li> In most other products I&#x27;ve tried that have these beads, they actually work.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend uses Dove Men Deep Clean as his daily cleanser and he has no complaints.</li>
            <li> I like dove body wash but not a big fan of deep clean version.</li>
            <li> The Dove doesn&#x27;t get nearly as sudsy as the old spice</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s too fragrant and not that masculine.</li>
            <li> It leaves you skin feeling soft and invigorated.</li>
            <li> the only downside is that there isnt much sud.</li>
            <li> I do not like scented body soap, or at least the strong scents like this and AXE.  </li>
            <li> but the beads are quite large and rough when used for washing.</li>
            <li> I work out a lot and count on Dove products to keep me acceptable for society in general.</li>
            <li> the stuff looks weird; kind of like semen with micro beads in</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this body wash based on other reviewers&#x27; reviews here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent and the little scrubbing beads in this body wash.</li>
            <li> I am going to start trying out their other male products, such as their deodorant, as soon as my Old Spice supply runs out.</li>
            <li> Small gentle circular motions and</li>
            <li> The smell sticks to you after a long time after bath also.</li>
            <li> The smell is apparent but not very strong.</li>
            <li> When I received this the lid was open and all over my other items .</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t smell like he&#x27;s wearing cologne, which is a big problem with other men&#x27;s body washes on the market.</li>
            <li> I have had dry flaky skin for years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a faint clean smell.</li>
            <li> (his main complaint with alot of bodywashes).  </li>
            <li> Worked as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dirty, I use this stuff with a loooofa thing and water, I end up getting clean.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t irritate him like some other scents do.</li>
            <li> a few other things shipped to me in bulk and its easier than getting it at the store when they dont always have it on stock.</li>
            <li> when I come in my arms are just covered in black dirt.</li>
            <li> A little advice, do not &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; with this soap too vigorously on your skin.</li>
            <li> Dove marketing people are a little nutty....</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t feel dried out after using it, either.</li>
            <li> Fresh\\&quot; variety which comes out of the container like green water.</li>
            <li> I was not sure about the little &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I had to stop using this as a face wash because it dried the skin too much and badly irritated my eye lids even after washing it off well.</li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t be an issue if the shape of the flap wasn&#x27;t contoured in a way that makes it very difficult to open with wet hands.</li>
            <li> Dried the heck out of my skin!</li>
            <li> Put this in your shopping cart next time around, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> overall, i&#x27;m disappointed and too expensive</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thin soap that is a hair thicker than water and it has sand beads in it as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this to wash my face a couple times but it dries it out and those little beads are terrible if they get in your eyes.</li>
            <li> It is suppose to be a exfoliant but is just annoying.</li>

            <li> This is good bodywash. I love dove products. The scent is really nice.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent and the little scrubbing beads in this body wash. I will have to say that it has replaced Nivea Men&#x27;s as my favorite. This soap makes one feel clean without drying out one&#x27;s skin. The pleasant, but understated scent is a real extra.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dirty, I use this stuff with a loooofa thing and water, I end up getting clean.  It&#x27;s like magic!</li>

            <li> Perfect for my skin, smells great and love the micro scrubs makes me feel great.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and came quickly.</li>
            <li> I bought this as amazon had a $2 off coupon so I couldn&#x27;t pass it up. I normally use something like old spice but wanted to change it up. The Dove doesn&#x27;t get nearly as sudsy as the old spice but I still feel it is enough. The micro beads are nice, I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of work on my car lately and normally when I come in my arms are just covered in black dirt. I have no issues getting it off. I&#x27;ve used this to wash my face a couple times but it dries it out and those little beads are terrible if they get in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Leaves you feeling refreshed with a pleasent scent.  Keeps your skin moist all day and that my friends will keep a smile on your face. Put this in your shopping cart next time around, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, but would appreciate it if the moisturizing effect would be a little more intense.</li>
            <li> great price and smell. luv the granules inside.</li>
            <li> My husband said this smelled good and works great. It didn&#x27;t irritate him like some other scents do.</li>
            <li> husband was very pleased with this...got this at a reduced price so he gave it a try. now he uses it daily</li>
            <li> Love the product  I use it all the time.  they have a very competitive price. Nd vry dependable.  I will use this endor again hen thy have a product I need.</li>
            <li> Scent and wash are good. I only use dove now</li>
            <li> Dove Men Plus Care Body Wash, Deep Clean&lt;br /&gt;cleans you as a good body wash. It has good smell also.</li>
            <li> Smells great and my man loves it.</li>
            <li> Probably my favorite body soap. Fairly neutral scent and leaves my skin feeling great</li>
            <li> It has really cool fragrance and you can feel the freshness and cleanness feeling after bath. The smell sticks to you after a long time after bath also.</li>
            <li> I really love this soap.  Of all the million soaps I have and have tried out there I just keep coming back to this one.  The smell is very pleasant and is not too strong.  The smell seems kinda like ginger and sandalwood to me.  I love it and I don&#x27;t know how better to describe it.  The consistency is perfect and it isn&#x27;t watered-down like some soaps out there.</li>
            <li> I love the little textured body washes because there is less effort to make them lather - and they feel fantastic. Wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell, but what do you expect with online shopping...?</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I&#x27;ve tried this body wash and it has a nice feel to it.  While there is a bit of \\&quot;grittyness\\&quot; to the way it feels it rinses away clean.  When I noticed the gritty feeling I was concerned that they were using micro-scrubbers made out of a polymer (which end up bypassing waste-water treatment plants and end up in the environment) out but based on the label it looks like it&#x27;s pretty much a natural (albeit very mild) abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00372DYFQ Dove Men Plus Care Body Wash, Deep Clean, 13.5 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Dove has been a lifelong love of mine. I grew up in a household that used Dove White bar soap. As times have changed so have the methods of cleaning. It does appear that body wash is king. Times may have changed by my loyalty to the Dove brand remain. And Dove now offers a full mens line that include body wash, shampoo, conditioner and deodorant. My boyfriend uses Dove Men Deep Clean as his daily cleanser and he has no complaints. The formula has micro beads that help to soften the skin.  This is an excellent option for men who want to take care of their skin. I would recommend this for men of any age.</li>
            <li> Great body wash. Dove makes one of the best products with a very competitive price. I used this product for about 3 months now and the deep clean one is the best smelling and contains micro scrubbers.</li>
            <li> I love its wonderful freshness.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with the great smell and quality of this hybrid wash.  I&#x27;m able to use it on my body and face with no worries.</li>
            <li> 1. Expensive&lt;br /&gt;2. Doesn&#x27;t really moisturize&lt;br /&gt;3. Doesn&#x27;t really lather up well and requires reapplication&lt;br /&gt;4. The smell isn&#x27;t so great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the stuff looks weird; kind of like semen with micro beads in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll go back to Nivea for Men.</li>
            <li> Its ok. Has a gritty feel to it. Smells good!</li>
            <li> Dove body wash is a great to use.  My son skin is very sensitive and dove works perfectly for him.</li>
            <li> the body wash has micro beads but the beads are quite large and rough when used for washing. the product doesn&#x27;t provide a large lather and doesn&#x27;t wash clean without a good few rinses. i don&#x27;t find some scent it leaves that pleasant, it&#x27;s too fragrant and not that masculine. overall, i&#x27;m disappointed and too expensive even tho i got it at a subscribe and save discount.</li>
            <li> it does smell good...a cross between a douglas fir and clean sheets without it being too masculine. I would rather it had more suds and lather than the scrubbing grit it has in it but it does make my skin feel clean. I also don&#x27;t feel dried out after using it, either. If my husband likes it, I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Fine, I believe I could buy it at target cheaper.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t possible to buy it in Japan. It was bought through transmission traders. The product I like very much.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest body and face wash ever.  I am now a fan of DOVE Men+ care products.  I used to view DOVE as a &amp;#34;Girl&amp;#34; brand.... but no longer.  This product really scrubs your face and body skin for some exfoliation, and it leaves my skin soft and smooth. I really like this product.  I will be using this exclusively from now on.  DOVE did a great job.  I am going to start trying out their other male products, such as their deodorant, as soon as my Old Spice supply runs out.</li>
            <li> Smooth on skin, doesn&#x27;t dry skin and it has good, light, pleasing smell. Micro moisture give different bathing experience that many other leading body wash products in market cannot.</li>
            <li> Its worth  buying!!&lt;br /&gt;Especially when we have deal of subscribe and save offer.</li>
            <li> Bottle shape requires you to store with lid at the bottom, which of course means you must fully close the flap every time. This wouldn&#x27;t be an issue if the shape of the flap wasn&#x27;t contoured in a way that makes it very difficult to open with wet hands.</li>
            <li> I love using this as it has crystals that scrub my skin and makes me smell very manly.  It is an extra clean layer of smelling good.</li>
            <li> Great product. The only downside is the grit in the soap. It is suppose to be a exfoliant but is just annoying. I would still reccomend it.</li>
            <li> I love Dove soap.  I have very sensitive skin and cant use anything else.  This particular scent is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.  It has teeny, tiny grains that feel like a defoliant.</li>
            <li> The shipper was prompt. The item is as described. This does help to keep my skin drier. I have had dry flaky skin for years. I would say for others to try the product.</li>
            <li> My spouse swears by this stuff. He can&#x27;t get enough of Dove and neither can I. Since he likes it I love it!</li>
            <li> Love the fresh feeling and scent it leaves on the skin! Okay, ladies... my hubby loves it... and I love it! Who says our body wash needs to smell like a garden? This wash has a nice fragrance. Not too manly but enough to kill that locker room stink! It leaves you skin feeling soft and invigorated. Waking up to this is the best eye-opener! It definitely deep cleans your pores. A little advice, do not &amp;#34;scrub&amp;#34; with this soap too vigorously on your skin. You might feel irritated a bit like razor rash if you do this. Small gentle circular motions and it will feel like a total spa for your body! Enjoy! My favorite of ALL the Dove Men Care products line.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is not very picky when it comes to what he gets as a body wash, but he really liked how this smelled and I got it for him. He loves the scent!</li>
            <li> this was a good filler item for the free shipping.</li>
            <li> Works well, but I found-out I am more of a bar soap type of person now, great product though!</li>
            <li> Just doesn&#x27;t sud up as much as I&#x27;d like and I&#x27;m not a fan of the grittiness. Will stick with non deep cleansing</li>
            <li> great price and quick delivery</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new body wash that wasn&#x27;t too overpowering but at the same time I wanted something that make you feel clean without any residue.  I was not sure about the little &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; in the soap but after using it for a while I like it.  If you want a good soap without smelling like you are trying to hard this is for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dove for Men products for a while and love them. I like the micro beads for that extra cleaning sensation. I have no quarrels with this product when ordered from Amazon. Cannot say the same for the \\&quot;Extra Fresh\\&quot; variety which comes out of the container like green water.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend so he wouldn&#x27;t use my stuff and he really likes it!  He said &amp;#34;it smells really good&amp;#34;, which is a good thing coming from him, he can be picky.</li>
            <li> Good smell and I like the grit , but the bars seem to do a better job of actually cleaning.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the microbe ads, for environmental reasons, otherwise love it.</li>
            <li> I like dove body wash but not a big fan of deep clean version. Kind of less foamy and doesn&#x27;t leave skin as smooth as other versions. Kind of OK.</li>
            <li> This truly cleans you and clears up your skin.  Great product for men.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance, great feel... And leaves you feeling fresh. I work out a lot and count on Dove products to keep me acceptable for society in general.</li>
            <li> Keeps the family smelling nice</li>
            <li> When I received this the lid was open and all over my other items . The product it&#x27;s self is great</li>
            <li> Got it for a great price. Thanks Amazon.  Worked as expected.</li>
            <li> Only bodywash my picky husband will use.  Has a nice scent, but isn&#x27;t SO scented as to be overpowering (his main complaint with alot of bodywashes).  The micro scrubby bead things are a nice addition, and seem to help keep any gym-induced body acne away.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to this body wash based on other reviewers&#x27; reviews here on Amazon. Well, I got it and I don&#x27;t like it. I really don&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s a very thin soap that is a hair thicker than water and it has sand beads in it as well. In most other products I&#x27;ve tried that have these beads, they actually work. In this product, they are a nuisance. The smell of this product is one many wouldn&#x27;t find appealing either. Basically, it doesn&#x27;t feel like a body wash and I found myself using another product right after this one because I didn&#x27;t feel like it even did anything. I only gave it two stars because of the price; otherwise, more like one.</li>
            <li> worked better than expected didn&#x27;t dry out my skin micro beads washed off easy almost scentless i highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product is by far one of the higher end body washes to use for a guy. (Without going deep into your wallet) Texture is a bit gritty but that is used to make sure your skin is exfoliated and all the dirt and dry skin are removed. Smell is more of a fresh clean smell which is nice in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Has a very nice manly scent, not old man just good scent that&#x27;s not girly - if that makes sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels great going on and washes off nice and clean. Don&#x27;t have to scrub or wait to get residue off the skin.</li>
            <li> I do not like the smell of this soap. It reminds me of AXE body wash. I do not like scented body soap, or at least the strong scents like this and AXE.  I will pass on reordering this.</li>
            <li> This is a great product by dove,has a nice clean scent, has moisturizers to help with dry skin,and makes you feel awake in the morning...great</li>
            <li> Hubby likes this the smell is great</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good body wash. I order it for my husband, and he has no complaints. It works easily. It smells good without being too overpowering. He still smells like my husband, just clean. He doesn&#x27;t smell like he&#x27;s wearing cologne, which is a big problem with other men&#x27;s body washes on the market. I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Dried the heck out of my skin! Went back to using the Dove soap bar....much better&lt;br /&gt;You Dove marketing people are a little nutty....</li>
            <li> Have decided to keep this body wash on auto-delilvery.  It can be purchased locally for a bit more money, unless it is on sale.  I like the convenience of having the scent needed readily available.</li>
            <li> An excellent product.  Easy on my skin and smells great.</li>
            <li> Nice body wash for men.</li>
            <li> Dove Men is the best. It makes me feel fresh and the scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming like a couple of other brands.</li>
            <li> Does what I need it to do; I like the gritty feeling of the micro abrasives.</li>
            <li> Good product. Not the best price I&#x27;ve seen, but I never could seem to find this in stores, so I signed up for the subscription. Like the smell and exfoliating beads.</li>
            <li> Good product and good price.</li>
            <li> I like this body wash. I save money by having amazon prime and I have this and a few other things shipped to me in bulk and its easier than getting it at the store when they dont always have it on stock. Free shipping with prime is also very nice.</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well.</li>
            <li> My boys love this body was because it makes them smell like men hehe, great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> It smells good and makes me clean, what more is there to say?</li>
            <li> Awesome product, Awesome savings</li>
            <li> These stuff cleans my body very good. The smell is apparent but not very strong. It&#x27;s like a faint clean smell. Fragrance not too over powering which is good.</li>
            <li> great smell. not too strong, but pleasant. the price was right, and the micro beads in the soap feels great. it feels more like a scrub than a wash and you do feel really clean after wards. the only downside is that there isnt much sud. it takes a bit more soap to get a nice sud going, but is still great. i will keep using it and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this product  both the wash and bar soap.</li>
            <li> I love it, great product</li>
            <li> Product as listed.  Prompt shipping</li>
            <li> I had to stop using this as a face wash because it dried the skin too much and badly irritated my eye lids even after washing it off well. It works fine in place of soap in the shower though.</li>
            <li> This body wash does an overall good job, but it seems alot of it has to be used to be useful as far as the deep cleaning aspect of it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Will buy again</li>
            <li> Man, this makes me smell good. It also kinda exfoliates. Gotta like it? NO. Gotta love it!!!</li>
