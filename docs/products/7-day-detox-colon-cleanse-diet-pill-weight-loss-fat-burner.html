            <li>I loved this product and I did lose 5 pds in 7 days.  </li>
            <li>I hope the vitamins doing good</li>
            <li>good luck</li>
            <li>u don&#x27;t think it a good weight lose</li>
            <li>but I eat very healthy</li>
            <li>it sounded like it was too good to be true-</li>
            <li>The pills are easy to swallow and I liked not feeling hungry in the evening when I needed it most.  </li>
            <li>I pee way more</li>
            <li>I also feel more thirsty which is ok because you&#x27;re supposed to drink a lot of water.</li>
            <li>i know i couldve lost more if i wouldve changed my diet</li>
            <li>more-</li>
            <li>My stomach was upset after taking so many tabs.</li>
            <li>I felt dizzy most of the times</li>
            <li>it does not help you do anything I gained more just by using this</li>
            <li>i just wanted something to make my body feel better and</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a miracle pill but it makes me feel better after using it.  </li>
            <li>should known better</li>
            <li>just eat healthy and try to exercise since these diets don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>hopefully others had/have better luck with it</li>
            <li>I felt so much better after completing the seven days.</li>
            <li>I had hoped this would be better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>so I think that did better than this for me.</li>
            <li>I did exactly as said and got NO results!!!</li>
            <li>I received product very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I slept fine too.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m pretty sure i&#x27;m better of doing that than taking these pills.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think this product is helpful for weight loss or fat burner but fine as a detox product, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I suggest you look else where for a better colon cleanse because this isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;re searching for to do the right job for you.</li>
            <li>This works great and makes you feel a little better too inside and out, I will be getting this again here soon.</li>
            <li>Clean all that junk out of your system</li>
            <li>What I liked most is that after taking the second set of pills, I didn&#x27;t feel hungry for the rest of the day.  </li>
            <li>One thing it does is making you full, but then again drinking 32 ounces of water will fill one up, I am the type who gets bloated from water.  </li>
            <li>, I wanted a quick fix to add to my work out since I was about to travel to the Caribbean.  </li>
            <li>I get more action using a $2.00 Magnesium Citrate!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are other products out there that are better.</li>
            <li>i exercised and ate right</li>
            <li>Drinking all these tabs did not feel right to me.</li>
            <li>since i took it ive still been losing weight while trying to stay on the right track</li>
            <li>I ate right &amp; exercised quite often</li>
            <li>I read quite a few good reviews, didn&#x27;t really do that much for me.</li>
            <li>And it really does give you energy.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>still nothing- took whole bottle as directed-</li>
            <li>I took these for a week straight, and didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in anything &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; won&#x27;t buy this again</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see much of any difference</li>
            <li>these did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>I wont say miracles happened but after my second round of the cleanse I was able to close some jackets and shirts that i haven&#x27;t been able to wear for a while.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!!!  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>i exercise regularly any way thats my thing ;)-</li>
            <li>No side effects except slight cramping the first day but otherwise highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have used it a few different times (normally after the holidays when my body is full of junk)</li>
            <li>and I was hoping that this product would help clear my system and give me that extra push.</li>

            <li> and I was hoping that this product would help clear my system and give me that extra push.</li>
            <li> not sure the real purpose of it, used before the apidexin</li>
            <li> What makes it even worse is that you have to take 6 humongous pills with 32 ounces of water everyday for 7 days straight, these pills actually gave me headaches and made me feel really dizzy after taking them for a while without seeing any results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking this might actually work, been to the bathroom 3 times today though only down side.</li>
            <li> I was eating vegetables and fruits, taking it as recommended, and jogged/walked (I would walk when tired) 45 minutes daily the whole time I was on it.  </li>
            <li> I weighed myself afterwards, I did not lose a single pound.  </li>
            <li> I heard of scam, but have never been a victim.  </li>
            <li> so I will not say that I was eating junk food for me not to loose a pound.</li>
            <li> Did not really notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I would usually gain up to 2lbs from first waking up until the end of the day since you usually weight less in the morning than at night</li>
            <li> and I wanted to loose the little pouch on my lower abs.</li>
            <li> not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expensive so didn&#x27;t lose much to try.</li>
            <li> - I was hopping for 5 lb, although I have a little less cravings for sweets now.</li>
            <li> After the 7 days I tend to feel a little lighter and healthier.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> I waited thinking maybe it takes a few days..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I bought the Cleanser in May of 2011.After just taking it for few days didn&#x27;t like the feeling of taking the pills.  </li>
            <li> By the way, the product pissed me off so bad that I had to do a review, my first as well.  </li>
            <li> In the weight battle every little bit helps!</li>
            <li> but i have recommended this product in the past and will continue-</li>
            <li> The sad thing is that I also purchase Liporexall which is from the same company I believe and</li>
            <li> The negatives: 6 big tablets is really uncomfortable, when I take them in the morning-i have to wait and go to bathroom at home, otherwise my commute is 1 hr and the stomack starts growling...and I am going to bathroom preety often till 5pm.</li>
            <li> I try to workout at least 3-5 days a week</li>
            <li> This product is a little unfairly listed on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> why because this is no good A waist</li>
            <li> hi i dont understand how you can eat \\&quot;right\\&quot; and not lose weight whether you use a supplement or not lol</li>
            <li> but I feel is the same crap</li>

            <li> Unfortunately this product doesn&#x27;t work at all, I didn&#x27;t feel anything.</li>
            <li> Used in conjustion with diet and exercise and was not impressed.</li>
            <li> This item did not work for me at all..very disappointed in this item.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought 2 bottled of this product and I definitely did notice a decrease in my appetite. However by night time I&#x27;m starving. I have switched the times from 6 before breakfast and 6 before lunch to 6 before lunch and supper. I pee way more but that&#x27;s the toxins being flushed. I also feel more thirsty which is ok because you&#x27;re supposed to drink a lot of water. And it really does give you energy. I would try it again</li>
            <li> I workout about 3-5 times a week and I was hoping that this product would help clear my system and give me that extra push. It did nothing. With taking 12 pills a day I thought I would of seen some change and there was no change. I&#x27;m sure there are other products out there that are better. Please don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> good price, dont kniw if it did any good or not</li>
            <li> hi i dont understand how you can eat \\&quot;right\\&quot; and not lose weight whether you use a supplement or not lol but 7day detox worked great for me i lost 10 pounds in 7 days i know i couldve lost more if i wouldve changed my diet alittle more- i exercise regularly any way thats my thing ;)- but i have recommended this product in the past and will continue- thanks</li>
            <li> just started this today weighed myself when I woke up and lost .8lbs its only been 7 hours. I&#x27;ve eaten breakfast and lunch same food I always eat I would usually gain up to 2lbs from first waking up until the end of the day since you usually weight less in the morning than at night I&#x27;ll post update on day 7. I&#x27;m thinking this might actually work, been to the bathroom 3 times today though only down side.</li>
            <li> I did exactly as said and got NO results!!! I want my money back!! I am so disappointed! I read up on it and it sounded like it was too good to be true-I waited thinking maybe it takes a few days.. still nothing- took whole bottle as directed- HA - a couple of weeks later and still nothing!</li>
            <li> Worked great!  Would buy it again if needed.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing. no hunger control, no energy, and no weight loss. i exercised and ate right and i actually gained weight after taking this product. not worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> I did know feel any different. I thought a detox was suppose to cleanse the body. Nothing was different. Drinking all these tabs did not feel right to me. My stomach was upset after taking so many tabs. I felt dizzy most of the times and I was actually keeping track of my weight and there was no difference. Maybe it was just me but I eat very healthy so I will not say that I was eating junk food for me not to loose a pound. Never going to take this again sorry.</li>
            <li> This was crap and I want my money back it does not work it does not help you do anything I gained more just by using this and now I am working it off my why because this is no good A waist</li>
            <li> i took this expecting nothing and ended up loosing weight and it put in me in a good mood i recommended it to my friend and she found the same results idk what it is but something in it made it easier to wake up it didnt give me energy but thats not what i was looking for i just wanted something to make my body feel better and it def did the trick since i took it ive still been losing weight while trying to stay on the right track</li>
            <li> I tried this product and you are required to take 6 pills like twice a day and  no results. It&#x27;s a waste of time and money. Don&#x27;t bother buying this product.</li>
            <li> This product is a little unfairly listed on Amazon.  It is meant to be a system detox.  I have used it a few different times (normally after the holidays when my body is full of junk) After the 7 days I tend to feel a little lighter and healthier.  This isn&#x27;t a miracle pill but it makes me feel better after using it.  Clean all that junk out of your system</li>
            <li> I took these for a week straight, and didn&#x27;t really notice any difference in anything &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; won&#x27;t buy this again</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product doesn&#x27;t work at all, I didn&#x27;t feel anything. The sad thing is that I also purchase Liporexall which is from the same company I believe and that one I have not start taking it but I feel is the same crap [will not work at all]&lt;br /&gt;I should known better but I was giving it a try, but like all diet products (they don&#x27;t work)&lt;br /&gt;Guys just eat healthy and try to exercise since these diets don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> This item did not work for me at all..very disappointed in this item. didn&#x27;t even lose 1 pound. hopefully others had/have better luck with it</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of any difference</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this. I felt so much better after completing the seven days. No side effects except slight cramping the first day but otherwise highly recommended. I think Ive lost 5 pounds within the 7 days which is great considering Ive been trying to lose my baby weight for 2 years. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought the Cleanser in May of 2011.After just taking it for few days didn&#x27;t like the feeling of taking the pills.  Didn&#x27;t work for me and wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> these did absolutely nothing for me. I was very disappointed with the product. it was packaged well and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> This works great and makes you feel a little better too inside and out, I will be getting this again here soon.</li>
            <li> Hi any potential buyer,  I have never taken any diet pill in my life so I did a lot of research before finally choosing the 7 Day Detox, I wanted a quick fix to add to my work out since I was about to travel to the Caribbean.  This product DOES NOT WORK.  I was eating vegetables and fruits, taking it as recommended, and jogged/walked (I would walk when tired) 45 minutes daily the whole time I was on it.  I weighed myself afterwards, I did not lose a single pound.  Do not waste your money!!!  By the way, the product pissed me off so bad that I had to do a review, my first as well.  I heard of scam, but have never been a victim.  If it works for you, that&#x27;s great; not me.  I get more action using a $2.00 Magnesium Citrate!  One thing it does is making you full, but then again drinking 32 ounces of water will fill one up, I am the type who gets bloated from water.  I had no cramps, diarrhea, weakness, nor jitter.  I slept fine too.  I would NEVER recommend 7 Day Detox to anyone.</li>
            <li> LOST 10 lbs in 7 Weeks! Great Product!</li>
            <li> I have finished my bottle and no change at all.. Will not buy again</li>
            <li> I loved this product and I did lose 5 pds in 7 days.  What I liked most is that after taking the second set of pills, I didn&#x27;t feel hungry for the rest of the day.  The pills are easy to swallow and I liked not feeling hungry in the evening when I needed it most.  I will definetly try this again.</li>
            <li> I am finishing my 7 day Detox Colon Cleanse + 1200 calories diet + exercizing 2-3 times a week and I only lost 2 lb - I was hopping for 5 lb, although I have a little less cravings for sweets now. The negatives: 6 big tablets is really uncomfortable, when I take them in the morning-i have to wait and go to bathroom at home, otherwise my commute is 1 hr and the stomack starts growling...and I am going to bathroom preety often till 5pm.I hope the vitamins doing good and I am getting rid of toxins.</li>
            <li> Dont work for me .do not Did nothing on my estomic and realy am obsed because i was thing Then this pills cleane my body good luck this is not for me</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like this cleanes did not work like the thought wanted buy again u don&#x27;t think it a good weight lose</li>
            <li> A could not tell I took anything.  There were no changes at all.  I had hoped this would be better than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Did not really notice any difference.</li>
            <li> Do your research before buying, I purchased this because I was travelling to Miami for spring break and I wanted to loose the little pouch on my lower abs. I try to workout at least 3-5 days a week and i&#x27;m pretty sure i&#x27;m better of doing that than taking these pills. What makes it even worse is that you have to take 6 humongous pills with 32 ounces of water everyday for 7 days straight, these pills actually gave me headaches and made me feel really dizzy after taking them for a while without seeing any results. I suggest you look else where for a better colon cleanse because this isn&#x27;t what you&#x27;re searching for to do the right job for you.</li>
            <li> not sure the real purpose of it, used before the apidexin and it did not assist in loss of weight</li>
            <li> Use the product as directed and no big difference noted.</li>
            <li> I received product very quickly.  However, it is recommended that you take this for 14days. One bottle is for 7 days.  Don&#x27;t think this product is helpful for weight loss or fat burner but fine as a detox product, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I read quite a few good reviews, didn&#x27;t really do that much for me. I ate right &amp; exercised quite often so I think that did better than this for me. Wasn&#x27;t expensive so didn&#x27;t lose much to try.</li>
            <li> didnt help with any weight loss. Used in conjustion with diet and exercise and was not impressed. thank you for asking though.</li>
            <li> I wont say miracles happened but after my second round of the cleanse I was able to close some jackets and shirts that i haven&#x27;t been able to wear for a while. And felt a smidgen fuller when eating meals. In the weight battle every little bit helps!</li>
