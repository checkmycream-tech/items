            <li>Best body wash I&#x27;ve ever found--</li>
            <li>And the scents offered are delicious (not too perfumy).  </li>
            <li>, that makes me feel at my best.  </li>
            <li>Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>MAKE UP REAL GOOD</li>
            <li>Seller did a great job as well as Amazon.</li>
            <li>I also no longer need to buy a shave cream, this works great for shaving my legs.</li>
            <li>Great value &amp; convenience.</li>
            <li>great product and cant beat the price for buying in bulk</li>
            <li>I love the perfect consistency of how the wash feels on my body, almost like a cream.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is very pleasant but not at all overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Good smell, leaves skin feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A GOOD FACE WASH FOR OILY/DRY SKIN, PLUS IT WASHES OFF</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t buy it again but loved the lather and moisture.</li>
            <li>Olay did good with this body wash...</li>
            <li>wonderful lather, good scent, and very moisturizing for my skin!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Olay Body Wash for a couple of years now and have been very pleased with the results I get.  </li>
            <li>I love the Olay Ribbons Body Wash!  </li>
            <li>Provides both a nice wash and a smoothing lotion.  </li>
            <li>but this is a nice moisturizing body wash.</li>
            <li>the smell is VERY strong.  </li>
            <li>The best there is keeps my skin soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been more of  more of a bar soap kind of girl.  </li>
            <li>What more can I want after leaving my shower--smelling and feeling wonderful, soft smooth and glowing skin--all qualities giving me a good and confident start to my day.</li>
            <li>My favorite body wash</li>
            <li>Love this wash</li>
            <li>So, I was glad to order it from Amazon at their price.</li>
            <li>It smells really lovely</li>
            <li>It also smoothes on your skin very nicely and actually feels good being slathered on your skin.</li>
            <li>now I do not need to worry about dry skin because Olay Ribbons looks after my skin wonderfully.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>Good price fast shipping</li>
            <li>Passed it on to my mom who said the smell was too strong for her as well.  </li>
            <li>Another great quality about the gel is that it has a moisturizer in it (body butter), as once I get out of the shower, I feel clean and baby soft, as if I had already used lotion to moisturize my body.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I hadn&#x27;t, I just used this fantastic body wash.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel smooth &amp; moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but worth it!</li>
            <li>Really rich but</li>
            <li>One day, complaining that I missed certain scents I used to love, a friend recommended Olay Ribbons Body wash, saying that it had a light fragrance that would linger on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will say I have to break up the body wash with an exfoliant to achieve a clean but moisturized body.</li>
            <li>It suds up nicely and it does make your skin feel soft and</li>
            <li>Very creamy and love the lather.</li>
            <li>Olay Ribbons makes your skin feel so soft and and nice to touch.</li>
            <li>so good that I actually feel like I am pampering myself with this body wash when I use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for selling it at such a great price with fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li>and I love to try new things, but this one is going into my permanent line up.</li>
            <li>This product wasn&#x27;t what I had been previously ordering from Amazon, they kept sending this type of body wash which isn&#x27;t a great product.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it works great for my dry skin, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li>happy that i got as expected!!!</li>
            <li>my skin still feels soft and moisturized &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>and I feel fresh as a Daisy after using it.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I feel clean and moisturized at the same time.</li>
            <li>friend was right.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I am squeaky clean, soft and supple and smell just right!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s now 12 hours since my last shower and my skin is still super soft and has a nice protective layer of moisture.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good formula it just needs a little help.</li>
            <li>It will be a while before I am able to experiment and try different fragrances.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li>so at this age I can tell the difference much more than when I was younger and could use anything.  </li>
            <li>Even my daughter noticed the difference when we went to a more thinner liquid body wash and the bubbles weren&#x27;t as &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; and her skin was left &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Anyhow, this Olay body wash does make my skin feel nice and soft, so I keep going back it!</li>
            <li>only real con for me is that it can build up and leave a light film on your shower or bathtub floor.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that you don&#x27;t need that much of it to do the job, a little goes a long way and if you use too much you may need to take extra time to wash it all off as it does produce a nice strong lather.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft and silky!  </li>
            <li>but they would send it right back, so I have discontinued my order.</li>
            <li>I am not very brand loyal</li>
            <li>And the film residue left behind on the shower floor does motivate me to clean the bathroom a bit more frequently, which I guess is a win-win?</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 61 years old</li>
            <li>I rarely get this feeling from using bar soaps or other soaps for that matter.  </li>
            <li>I used this for the first time the other day</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasing, such that it is enough for you to notice it but certainly not overpowering or gag worthy.</li>
            <li>But for my fellow friends in the lazy club that don&#x27;t clean the shower that frequently, the film can bother you a bit, which is why this body wash only gets four stars from me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give you the low down: it has a nice thick consistency that is creamy and not at all runny.</li>
            <li>I usually put some lotion or oil on after showering but on those rare days I don&#x27;t have time</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I usually put some lotion or oil on after showering but on those rare days I don&#x27;t have time</li>
            <li> When you squeeze it, you need to be extra careful, otherwise, you end up with too much while you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry I never use soap on my face only water.  </li>
            <li> so if I use regular soap my skin feels rough and itchy on my body and red rash on my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Olay Body Wash Plus Creme Ribbons, with Almond Oil (pink one) and Olay Body Wash Plus Body Butter Ribbons, with Jojoba Butter (purple) on several occasions with the same result.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to the people with really dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I started to use Olay Ribbons because my skin was getting very dry</li>
            <li> The other properties, lathering and skin softening are also quite commendable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried two other body washes and none of them could match the moisture</li>
            <li> This is of course no problem if you are one of the diligent people that sprays down their shower after every other use.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the three-pack.</li>
            <li> The body wash is quite thick, so the opening is relatively big.</li>
            <li> It is a waste of money and should be a waste of time from Olay for even putting it on shelves.</li>
            <li> IF U HAVE ON HEAVY EYE MAKE-UP OR MASCARA, U&#x27;LL HAVE TO USE AN EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER FOR THAT.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Finally, the gel leaves a faint shimmer on my skin, like a glitter</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m too lazy to do this</li>
            <li> Left a weird filmy feel on my skin, almost oily.  </li>
            <li> Due to respiratory problems, I am unable to wear perfumes or even use heavily scented soaps or lotions.</li>
            <li> this is hard to find around town lately.  </li>
            <li> I wish never to have this product sent to my address again, it is not a good product.</li>
            <li> complaint is that it leaves a dull film in the bathtub and makes your bathtub look dirty after you take a shower.  </li>
            <li> Still, I don&#x27;t find that it makes the shower floor slippery or dangerous, just a bit filmy.</li>
            <li> But, that&#x27;s not so bad.</li>

            <li> Best body wash I&#x27;ve ever found--wonderful lather, good scent, and very moisturizing for my skin!  A bit pricey, but worth it!</li>
            <li> My favorite body wash</li>
            <li> this is hard to find around town lately.  Thank you so much for selling it at such a great price with fast shipping!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been more of  more of a bar soap kind of girl.  Body wash didn&#x27;t appeal to me--that is until I was introduced to Olay Ribbon Body Wash.  Ironically, my former boyfriend introduced me to the body wash over a year ago (so it&#x27;s not just for women).  I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  I love the perfect consistency of how the wash feels on my body, almost like a cream.  And the scents offered are delicious (not too perfumy).  Another great quality about the gel is that it has a moisturizer in it (body butter), as once I get out of the shower, I feel clean and baby soft, as if I had already used lotion to moisturize my body.  I rarely get this feeling from using bar soaps or other soaps for that matter.  Finally, the gel leaves a faint shimmer on my skin, like a glitter, that makes me feel at my best.  What more can I want after leaving my shower--smelling and feeling wonderful, soft smooth and glowing skin--all qualities giving me a good and confident start to my day.</li>
            <li> Good smell, leaves skin feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> It suds up nicely and it does make your skin feel soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;my complaint is that it leaves a dull film in the bathtub and makes your bathtub look dirty after you take a shower.  But it does not make the bathtub slippery.</li>

            <li> I love the smell and it works great for my dry skin, especially in the winter. I do have complaints about the bottle. The body wash is quite thick, so the opening is relatively big. When you squeeze it, you need to be extra careful, otherwise, you end up with too much while you only need a little bit. Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li> The best there is keeps my skin soft</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Love this wash</li>

            <li> THIS IS A GOOD FACE WASH FOR OILY/DRY SKIN, PLUS IT WASHES OFF MAKE UP REAL GOOD WHILE NOT DRYING OUT UR FACE. IF U HAVE ON HEAVY EYE MAKE-UP OR MASCARA, U&#x27;LL HAVE TO USE AN EYE MAKE-UP REMOVER FOR THAT. BUT IT WASHES OFF MY MEDIUM COVERAGE L&#x27;OREAL TRUE-MATCH LIQUID FOUNDATION QUITE WELL.</li>
            <li> Very creamy and love the lather.</li>
            <li> Wow. I used this for the first time the other day and I was amazed. My hand brushed against my leg after my shower while I was putting on makeup and I thought \\&quot;when did I put on lotion?\\&quot; I hadn&#x27;t, I just used this fantastic body wash. I am not very brand loyal and I love to try new things, but this one is going into my permanent line up. It&#x27;s now 12 hours since my last shower and my skin is still super soft and has a nice protective layer of moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Olay Body Wash for a couple of years now and have been very pleased with the results I get.  I have very dry skin so if I use regular soap my skin feels rough and itchy on my body and red rash on my face.  My skin is so dry I never use soap on my face only water.  Olay body wash is different I can even put it on my face if I want.  I&#x27;m 61 years old so at this age I can tell the difference much more than when I was younger and could use anything.  I can only hope that they continue to make this body wash with the butter ribbons to keep my skin moisturized during baths.  I would recommend this to the people with really dry skin.  Seller did a great job as well as Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love the Olay Ribbons Body Wash!  It makes my skin feel very soft and silky!  Its the only body wash I will ever buy!  I also no longer need to buy a shave cream, this works great for shaving my legs.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I feel clean and moisturized at the same time. I usually put some lotion or oil on after showering but on those rare days I don&#x27;t have time or I&#x27;m too lazy to do this my skin still feels soft and moisturized &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Left a weird filmy feel on my skin, almost oily.  Didn&#x27;t like the smell either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks now. Bought it at Walgreens. Makes my skin feel smooth &amp; moisturizes.  So, I was glad to order it from Amazon at their price. Great value &amp; convenience.</li>
            <li> Really rich but the smell is VERY strong.  My partner asked me not to use it because it gave her a headache.  Passed it on to my mom who said the smell was too strong for her as well.  Won&#x27;t buy it again but loved the lather and moisture.</li>
            <li> happy that i got as expected!!!</li>
            <li> Loooove this product.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves a film on me that clogs up my razor when shaving.  I&#x27;ve tried the Olay Body Wash Plus Creme Ribbons, with Almond Oil (pink one) and Olay Body Wash Plus Body Butter Ribbons, with Jojoba Butter (purple) on several occasions with the same result.  I wouldn&#x27;t use this product again.</li>
            <li> I tried two other body washes and none of them could match the moisture this body wash put&#x27;s back into my skin. Even my daughter noticed the difference when we went to a more thinner liquid body wash and the bubbles weren&#x27;t as &amp;#34;poofy&amp;#34; and her skin was left &amp;#34;itchy&amp;#34;. I noticed my skin wasn&#x27;t the same as well. I will say I have to break up the body wash with an exfoliant to achieve a clean but moisturized body. It&#x27;s a good formula it just needs a little help.</li>
            <li> No problems, no hassles...</li>
            <li> Provides both a nice wash and a smoothing lotion.  Have been using this brand for several years now.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know about the firming part of this or any product but this is a nice moisturizing body wash. Smells great and leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> great product and cant beat the price for buying in bulk</li>
            <li> I have used Olay Ribbons for some time, I used to buy it in our local Tesco supermarket but for some reason they stopped selling it. Now I buy through Amazon and the service is brill.  Olay Ribbons makes your skin feel so soft and and nice to touch. It smells really lovely and I feel fresh as a Daisy after using it.  I started to use Olay Ribbons because my skin was getting very dry now I do not need to worry about dry skin because Olay Ribbons looks after my skin wonderfully.  Thank you Olay Ribbons</li>
            <li> Olay did good with this body wash...so good that I actually feel like I am pampering myself with this body wash when I use it in the shower. I&#x27;ll give you the low down: it has a nice thick consistency that is creamy and not at all runny. The scent is pleasing, such that it is enough for you to notice it but certainly not overpowering or gag worthy. It also smoothes on your skin very nicely and actually feels good being slathered on your skin. Another plus is that you don&#x27;t need that much of it to do the job, a little goes a long way and if you use too much you may need to take extra time to wash it all off as it does produce a nice strong lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real con for me is that it can build up and leave a light film on your shower or bathtub floor. This is of course no problem if you are one of the diligent people that sprays down their shower after every other use. But for my fellow friends in the lazy club that don&#x27;t clean the shower that frequently, the film can bother you a bit, which is why this body wash only gets four stars from me. Still, I don&#x27;t find that it makes the shower floor slippery or dangerous, just a bit filmy. And the film residue left behind on the shower floor does motivate me to clean the bathroom a bit more frequently, which I guess is a win-win? Anyhow, this Olay body wash does make my skin feel nice and soft, so I keep going back it!</li>
