            <li> This product contains vasodilators. Vasodilators cause dark circles by dilating the blood vessels under your eyes. If you are willing to have dark circles, you might as well go with an FDA approved vasodilators, rogaine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Q. What vasodilators are used in TREAT and RESCUE to increase microcirculation to the scalp?&lt;br /&gt;A. Methyl nicotinate is in both TREAT products and benzyl nicotinate is in RESCUE. Both of these ingredients have effects similar to Niacin. Nettle and Ivy extract also boost micro-circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.haircolorsofthestars.com/clinicure_thinning_hair_solutions.html</li>
            <li> I lost a lot of hair through radiation and Chemo(brain cancer). I have been using this product for almost a year and will continue to use it. My hairdresser couldn&#x27;t believe how fast my hair came back.  Within 6 months, I went from large bald areas to wearing my own hair around family and friends. Within 8 months, I no longer needed the wig at all.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, along with Clinicure shampoo/conditioner, after a few months I had tons of new growth! I highly recommend this product to anyone, but be patient, it&#x27;s not overnight results. Use it for a 2-3 months along with shampoo conditioner before you see results! My hair is noticeably thicker and healthier!</li>
            <li> First let me say, I ordered this product on June 20th. The product was at my door on June 21st. This was the best customer service ever, just excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for about 6 months, my hair was thinning and spotty, you could actually see my scalp. Now my hair has filled in, my scalp does not show, and I&#x27;m happy. I also use the shampoo, conditioner, and the vitamins. These products are excellent. The prices are reasonable and affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B002TSUWKE Joico Clinicure Thinning Hair Rescue 4 oz.]]</li>
            <li> Great product. Use the shampoo &amp; conditioner&lt;br /&gt;In the same brand.</li>
            <li> Product is great for me.  I was losing hair by the handsful - more than 20 hairs every time I combed.  My beautician used this on my \\&quot;wholy hair\\&quot; and by jove, it stopped coming out!  I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> AFTER ALMOST A YEAR, I SEE NO NEW HAIR.......HOWEVER IT DOES STOP FALLING OUT OF HAIR  !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I STILL USE FOR THAT PURPOSE</li>
            <li> Good size, delivered in time, nice smell, not sticky, but I am not sure if it helps with hair loss.</li>
            <li> I have been using this products for a few months, along with the shampoo and conditioner. Cannot see a difference in the thickness of my hair. I like the application of this product, very easy and not messy. However, it does seem to make my hair needing to be washed everyday instead of every other day.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several months and it is great.  I had very thin hair, and I now have great hair.  This product is worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and have noticed a reduction in my hair loss.  It does make my hair dryer--probably due to the alcohol content.  I massage it in my scalp and then a few minutes later, massage in hair growth oils--to lessen the drying effect.  The product is rather expensive for the ingredients, but it does appear to work.</li>
            <li> Nowhere on the package or the internet can the ingredients of this stuff be found. My skin turns red for hours, like a burn, when it comes into contact with my skin.  I don&#x27;t have any allergies that I have ever discovered. The package says: apply to dry scalp, and later \\&quot;wash your hands immediately after application, avoid getting product on face and neck\\&quot;. Do you trust something that should not come into contact with your skin on your hair? I suspect these reviews are from people in the sales business. Rule of thumb: don&#x27;t trust products with no disclosure of ingredients. Don&#x27;t trust problems that turn your skin red. I was told about it by a customer who happened to work as a \\&quot;cosmetology consultant\\&quot;. It&#x27;s going into the garbage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.  It does seem to help with thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Icy...cool on my scalp. Will have to wait and see but like so far.</li>
            <li> Great system for breaking or thinning hair. (Mine was due to chemo) I am already starting to see a difference!</li>
            <li> I did not see any difference used  two bottles. I will  not buy more, will not recommend to buy sorry.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year and it works!! I highly recommend this product if you are looking to regrow hair!</li>
            <li> Good pricing for this product.</li>
            <li> I take the vitamins and use this product twice a day and have noticed improvement.  My hair is still thin but have noticed some new growth and less hair in my brush.  Will continue to use to prevent more hair loss and am hoping to have thick hair again.</li>
            <li> Have not used it enough yet.</li>
            <li> This product is working for me. I no longer loose my hair and it is growing a lot</li>
