            <li>This perfume has the perfect mix of sexy, clean and soft.</li>
            <li>The product deserves five stars, because it is warm, sweet and floral.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it for evening use, because the projection is strong.</li>
            <li>Very good fragrance and long duration.</li>
            <li>Well, the first one ran out, and I had to get more.</li>
            <li>I purchased this and like the nice subtle scent of the perfume, for never ever wearing it or smelling it, it was a great scent</li>
            <li>The bottle is different and looks good on my dresser.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting a free sample of it in a department store and was hooked right away.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to all you will love it</li>
            <li>because it is my wife&#x27;s favorite fragrance from among a lot of women&#x27;s perfume Amazon, which suits them so much, because of that, I&#x27;m positive assessment of this product.</li>

            <li> Great scent ! Camphory...... later fades into floral. I hated it initially but later grew on to me. Gonna order again soon. Everyone in my lab recognizes it and it TRULY lasts. Great for the price and the packaging was perfect. It is a good \\&quot; pick me up\\&quot; on bad days, A whiff of it helps me feel energized. The packaging is convenient enough to carry in flights from Boston to LA. Very fall/winter/spring.</li>
