            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>works great for my face</li>
            <li>But this was an exception; a great exception.</li>
            <li>smells great</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a really great product, that if someone has not tried, they should.</li>
            <li>Wife uses this and is happy with it.</li>
            <li>Great product, amazing results</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smell good thou&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is because I absolutely loved it, but after four years, eventually had to stop using it.</li>
            <li>I LOVED IT.</li>
            <li>Good face cleanser.</li>
            <li>I also use the fade cream in combination with this product and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Was packaged nicely so that it would not leak</li>
            <li>but if you own a clarisonic (or are planning to purchase one)</li>
            <li>It had good reviews and was cheap and thought i give it a try.</li>
            <li>This product is good for those with light acne but for those people like me that are acne sufferers this is not the product you are looking for.</li>
            <li>love all thing ambi</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>When used with the daily moisturizer, it has to be the best face clearing, skin smoothing, decolletage beautifying product out there.</li>
            <li>I love this cleanser.</li>
            <li>The refreshing feel of Ambi Foam is just that,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just love how my body has one even skin tone.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re like me and want something that is great for the skin and will do the job also try this it really works.</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I love this product and you can see results within a week.</li>
            <li>She moved on but my love of this product has remained 5+ years</li>
            <li>The foam gives you a lot more cleanings than does liquid.</li>
            <li>Beats Kiehls, Mario Badescau, and Clinique to me :)</li>
            <li>didnt work just made me break out more</li>
            <li>I love this cream on my face.</li>
            <li>and i see the color becoming more toned and smoother.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it goes on my face really smooth.</li>
            <li>Good purchase, I haven&#x27;t really had a breakout sense I started using it.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS SKIN CARE, IT KEEPS MY FACE CLEAR AND FRESH!!!!</li>
            <li>Even when I feel that the product is working, my strong guard protects me from falling into those \\&quot;trap.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Great light cleanser that does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but this one was surely needed one.</li>
            <li>skin is radiant and i can see smooth skin.</li>
            <li>It cleanses without over-drying and leaves my skin smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the foam this product produce.</li>
            <li>This is the best skin cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used and only wish I could find it in more of my local stores.  </li>
            <li>My skin cleaned out and is really clean.</li>
            <li>I heard of the Ambi line for women of deeper complexions and so far I love this cleanser!    </li>
            <li>and I am super break out prone..</li>
            <li>Bought this like 2 months ago, I guess its effective, dont really notice too much of a change.</li>
            <li>The smell is not overpowering and the foam makes my face feel fresh.</li>
            <li>I use most of the Ambi skin care products on my face, mainly because they are gentle to my skin that is pron to breakout.</li>
            <li>Just right for my combination skin type.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because one of my friend gave the clean and even soap, and the soap worked, so I decided to buy the whole ambi product, (cleanser,fade cream,lotion and the bar soap) biggest mistake I ever made.</li>
            <li>It is mild and leaves my face feeling smooth, not dried out or splotched.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The whole bottom part of my face is full of bumps.</li>
            <li>Originally I loved it, but eventually I came to the conclusion that it wasn&#x27;t really a glow, just OILY, which can be expected since it&#x27;s an oil based moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Ambi Even &amp; Clear Foaming cleanser is really fantastic for my oily/dry combination skin.</li>
            <li>Item was just as seller described, I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>I first encountered this cleanser while I was on vacation.  </li>
            <li>Rather she left it on the counter and let me sample it and fall in love.</li>
            <li>Admittedly, I use olive oil to remove my makeup first</li>
            <li>This was my first time using a foaming cleanser</li>
            <li>I find ambi a great product to keep away my acne and slowly fade my scars.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin, and this cleanser cuts right through that oil, without being drying.</li>
            <li>and this wash does gradually knock down pimples but not as fast or effective that I would have hoped.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say about the even toning as I don&#x27;t see that yet.</li>
            <li>My skin is really oily and breaks out quite often.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>She has been using it for years and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I used it faithfully for two straight weeks...</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t see much of a result</li>
            <li>I bought this for the promise of even toned smooth skin and in that it definitely delivered!!!</li>
            <li>It is very similar to Aveeno acne foam cleanser, and is EXTREMELY GENTLE for even the most sensitive skin like mine,</li>
            <li>I started using every other day, and that works much better for me.</li>
            <li>Not sure how the product stands on its own...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, but not for oily skin</li>
            <li>However, it does keep my skin clear and it&#x27;s very hydrating</li>
            <li>I use this twice daily and have noticed a dramatic change in my skin, for the good!  </li>
            <li>Provides just the right amount of foaming wash for my clarisonic brush and has cleared up my acne and definitely reduced new breakouts.</li>
            <li>As i got older, I developed naturally oily skin.  </li>
            <li>My face is clear and I like that.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a product that would finally clear up my acne that I&#x27;ve had for 6 years now.</li>
            <li>clear  Winter thru Fall.</li>
            <li>I use this cleanser along with the Even and Clear Tone</li>
            <li>Have used for over 20 years and will not use any other facial cream to clean my face.</li>
            <li>A barely there fragrance, soft foam, no residue.  </li>
            <li>I live in Miami, Fl and I work outside.</li>
            <li>Dry and doesn&#x27;t stop acne, its a total waste of money and time but other products are good, just didnt work for me</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin and often have a harder time finding a cleanser that will both clean my skin and not drain all possible moisture from it</li>
            <li>I have considerably oily skin and moderate acne</li>
            <li>The foam stays true to the idea that less is more as about two pumps delivers enough to wash off makeup and dirt with none left behind.  </li>
            <li>No white heads or clogged pores and my skin does feel fresh without that tight feeling.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so soft and lasts a long time</li>
            <li>It made my skin worse than before, I only had blackheads,but now I have huge acnes on my face, and kinda like a rash on my face.</li>

            <li> It made my skin worse than before, I only had blackheads,but now I have huge acnes on my face, and kinda like a rash on my face.</li>
            <li> I was using it everyday, but that seemed a bit too much because it will dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> So far I have not seen a drastic change in dark spots</li>
            <li> Sensitive skin does not feel tight or dry after cleansing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not wild about the smell, either.</li>
            <li> I still have black and white heads but this will definitely keep your acne at bay.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry or oily.</li>
            <li> Ambi does what it says it will - red marks from healing acne was noticeably less after just one use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and my black marks are starting to disappear</li>
            <li> I have combination skin (oil on t-zone and chin) and usually use toner after cleansing to remove the extra oil</li>
            <li> I have been disappointed by so many products that now I don&#x27;t even feel that it will help me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  stuggled with lifelong acne issues and nothing has ever worked until Ambi!</li>
            <li> I suffer from hyper-pigmentation and am always searching for products that fade dark spots while maintaining breakouts and are non-irritating.  </li>
            <li> and i can tell my dark spots are evening out.</li>
            <li> Just your average known brand.</li>
            <li> My scars have slightly improved with this product but not faded.</li>
            <li> and it caused a slight break out -</li>
            <li> yet this one has the added bonus of a fade cream for those dark spots/age spots/blemish spots!  </li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> After a few hours I&#x27;d look like a rubbed grease on my face.</li>
            <li> but since using this I do not feel excessively oily as the day goes on.    </li>
            <li> The reviews on here are all false</li>
            <li> so I wasted my money on this one :-(</li>
            <li> I started ordering this product online because It was impossible to find it in stores.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 2 weeks and was breaking out horribly during this time.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works as stated on packaging.</li>
            <li> its making my skin glow and i see the color becoming more toned and smoother. I would recommend this to all the enthic community...</li>
            <li> I suffer from hyper-pigmentation and am always searching for products that fade dark spots while maintaining breakouts and are non-irritating.  I heard of the Ambi line for women of deeper complexions and so far I love this cleanser!    The foam stays true to the idea that less is more as about two pumps delivers enough to wash off makeup and dirt with none left behind.  The salicylic keeps my pimples at bay and I have not had one since using this cleanser for about 3 weeks now.  The fragrance is not overbearing and this balances the removal of oil without over drying.  I have combination skin (oil on t-zone and chin) and usually use toner after cleansing to remove the extra oil but since using this I do not feel excessively oily as the day goes on.    No white heads or clogged pores and my skin does feel fresh without that tight feeling.  So far I have not seen a drastic change in dark spots but I plan on continued use.</li>
            <li> I like this cleanser. The smell is not overpowering and the foam makes my face feel fresh. I been using it for about a month already and I don&#x27;t see that it has improved an even skin tone. However, it does keep my skin clear and it&#x27;s very hydrating therefore I like it.</li>
            <li> works great for my face</li>
            <li> I was looking for an alternative but this product did nothing for me as a woman of color. I went back to proactive</li>
            <li> Have used for over 20 years and will not use any other facial cream to clean my face.</li>
            <li> love all thing ambi I am Hispanic never gives me brake outs and I am super break out prone.. love it</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but this one was surely needed one. I have been disappointed by so many products that now I don&#x27;t even feel that it will help me. Even when I feel that the product is working, my strong guard protects me from falling into those \\&quot;trap.\\&quot; But this was an exception; a great exception. My skin cleaned out and is really clean. I can&#x27;t really say about the even toning as I don&#x27;t see that yet. My skin is really oily and breaks out quite often. However, since i have been using this product, no break outs at all. skin is radiant and i can see smooth skin. I am very happy with this product.       I use this product twice a day followed by sunscreen or night cream.</li>
            <li> I use this twice daily and have noticed a dramatic change in my skin, for the good!  I&#x27;ve  stuggled with lifelong acne issues and nothing has ever worked until Ambi!</li>
            <li> Ambi Even &amp; Clear Foaming cleanser is really fantastic for my oily/dry combination skin. It cleanses without over-drying and leaves my skin smooth and refreshed. When used with the daily moisturizer, it has to be the best face clearing, skin smoothing, decolletage beautifying product out there. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I started ordering this product online because It was impossible to find it in stores. It makes my skin feel very soft and clean. I also use the fade cream in combination with this product and have been very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiancé for Christmas. She has been using it for years and absolutely loves it. She is of Latino dissent if that has any bearing on the customers experience with the product.</li>
            <li> smells great and i can tell my dark spots are evening out. i use it once or twice a day.</li>
            <li> Item was just as seller described, I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> I had purchased Ambi Foaming Cleanser a year ago from a drug store retailer and tried it then.&lt;br /&gt;Since that time, I had been looking for it again, as I had tried others since that time as well, and had not&lt;br /&gt;gotten the results I needed and hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;As I age, my skin ages, and with that, changes. The refreshing feel of Ambi Foam is just that,&lt;br /&gt;refreshing.  It is mild and leaves my face feeling smooth, not dried out or splotched.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a really great product, that if someone has not tried, they should.</li>
            <li> Wife uses this and is happy with it.</li>
            <li> I first encountered this cleanser while I was on vacation.  Ambi does what it says it will - red marks from healing acne was noticeably less after just one use.  I have very oily skin, and this cleanser cuts right through that oil, without being drying. I always have an extra Ambi on hand.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it goes on my face really smooth. My face is clear and I like that. I also use Ambi soap as well. I just love how my body has one even skin tone.</li>
            <li> I use most of the Ambi skin care products on my face, mainly because they are gentle to my skin that is pron to breakout. So if you&#x27;re like me and want something that is great for the skin and will do the job also try this it really works.</li>
            <li> This is a really great cleaser, it gets off all of the makeup and crap from your day. I was using it everyday, but that seemed a bit too much because it will dry your skin out. I started using every other day, and that works much better for me.</li>
            <li> Good purchase, I haven&#x27;t really had a breakout sense I started using it.</li>
            <li> I live in Miami, Fl and I work outside. Ambi actually helps control my heat bumps. I would recommend this for ladies working outdoors.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product zero stars I would. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I bought it yesterday. I applied it before I went to sleep. I woke up with a rash all over my face. The whole bottom part of my face is full of bumps. It burns, it itches, and its embarrassing. WASTE OF MONEY. My face is a disaster 👎.</li>
            <li> Clearing up the hypopigmentation</li>
            <li> This is the best skin cleanser I&#x27;ve ever used and only wish I could find it in more of my local stores.  It is very similar to Aveeno acne foam cleanser, and is EXTREMELY GENTLE for even the most sensitive skin like mine, yet this one has the added bonus of a fade cream for those dark spots/age spots/blemish spots!  LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that would finally clear up my acne that I&#x27;ve had for 6 years now. It had good reviews and was cheap and thought i give it a try. Plus it had salicylic acid since benzyl peroxide does not work for me. I have considerably oily skin and moderate acne and this wash does gradually knock down pimples but not as fast or effective that I would have hoped. My scars have slightly improved with this product but not faded. This product is good for those with light acne but for those people like me that are acne sufferers this is not the product you are looking for.</li>
            <li> I used this product for about 2 weeks and was breaking out horribly during this time. I stopped using it and my face cleared up totally so I ended up throwing it in the trash so I wasted my money on this one :-(</li>
            <li> Love this! Was packaged nicely so that it would not leak</li>
            <li> I love this product and you can see results within a week.</li>
            <li> A barely there fragrance, soft foam, no residue.  Sensitive skin does not feel tight or dry after cleansing.  Like it alot.  Only using 1 week, so nothing else noticeable.</li>
            <li> Great! Doesn&#x27;t leave skin dry or oily. Just right for my combination skin type.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to help with my complexion.  I used it faithfully for two straight weeks...didn&#x27;t see much of a result and it caused a slight break out -</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS SKIN CARE, IT KEEPS MY FACE CLEAR AND FRESH!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this foaming cleanser with my clarisonic face cleaner and it definitely gets the job done. Provides just the right amount of foaming wash for my clarisonic brush and has cleared up my acne and definitely reduced new breakouts. Not sure how the product stands on its own... but if you own a clarisonic (or are planning to purchase one) I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Ironically for me as a A.A. woman it was a Nordic complexioned roommate of mine who brought this product to my attention. Rather she left it on the counter and let me sample it and fall in love. She moved on but my love of this product has remained 5+ years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin and often have a harder time finding a cleanser that will both clean my skin and not drain all possible moisture from it but by George Ambi has done it! Admittedly, I use olive oil to remove my makeup first but this cleanser keeps my skin crystal clear  Winter thru Fall. The foam gives you a lot more cleanings than does liquid. I suggest you try it! Beats Kiehls, Mario Badescau, and Clinique to me :)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because one of my friend gave the clean and even soap, and the soap worked, so I decided to buy the whole ambi product, (cleanser,fade cream,lotion and the bar soap) biggest mistake I ever made. It made my skin worse than before, I only had blackheads,but now I have huge acnes on my face, and kinda like a rash on my face. It&#x27;s a waste of money. Am only using the bar soap and the lotion. The reviews on here are all false</li>
            <li> The product works as promised...my skin is notacable clearer.  I have sensative skin, but this product dosn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a foaming cleanser and I don&#x27;t care for it. I feel that I need to pump about 5 times the product just to feel like my face has been thoroughly cleansed. I&#x27;m not wild about the smell, either. And if you&#x27;re a makeup wearer, you definitely need something stronger (even if you use makeup remover beforehand).</li>
            <li> Dry and doesn&#x27;t stop acne, its a total waste of money and time but other products are good, just didnt work for me</li>
            <li> Great product, amazing results</li>
            <li> didnt work just made me break out more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and still have problems with acne! I use this cleanser along with the Even and Clear Tone Correcting Concentrate.</li>
            <li> I love this cream on my face. I also purchased the cocoa butter soap. I&#x27;ve been using it for two weeks and my black marks are starting to disappear</li>
            <li> Bought this like 2 months ago, I guess its effective, dont really notice too much of a change. Just your average known brand. i recommend Simple though.</li>
            <li> I used this along with the Fade cream. It makes your skin feel so soft and lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I used this product for several weeks and all it did was burn my face.&lt;br /&gt;Smell good thou&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great light cleanser that does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a very mixed review for this product. This is because I absolutely loved it, but after four years, eventually had to stop using it. I bought this for the promise of even toned smooth skin and in that it definitely delivered!!! I LOVED IT. I receives lots of compliments on the smoothness  of my skin and the glow I seemed to have. Originally I loved it, but eventually I came to the conclusion that it wasn&#x27;t really a glow, just OILY, which can be expected since it&#x27;s an oil based moisturizer. Problem for me? As i got older, I developed naturally oily skin.  After a few hours I&#x27;d look like a rubbed grease on my face. I used  I will try it again in the winter. Highly recommended, but not for oily skin</li>
            <li> I enjoy the foam this product produce. Good face cleanser.</li>
            <li> I find ambi a great product to keep away my acne and slowly fade my scars. I&#x27;ve tried all of their washes and this one is the only one that took away my acne. I still have black and white heads but this will definitely keep your acne at bay. Use with a clairosinic!</li>
