            <li>This product works great without aluminum.</li>
            <li>I think its not doing a great job in that area.</li>

            <li>product smells amazing!</li>
            <li>Every Man Jack has outstanding products and this deodorant is one of the best!</li>
            <li>This deodorant works great and also smells good.</li>
            <li>Pleasant surprise -</li>
            <li>Keeps the teenager smelling good even after school gym.</li>
            <li>I thought he might need an anti-perspirant to combat that adolescent after gym bouquet, but he wisely doesn&#x27;t want to use anything with aluminum.</li>
            <li>In fact, he tells me he&#x27;s known for smelling good.</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>It has a lighter scent though which is good and</li>
            <li>it smells really good</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t bike, it works fairly well, but be forewarned if you bike or jog, or go to the gym during lunch</li>
            <li>This smells good but not an over powering smell.</li>
            <li>Seems good to me.  </li>
            <li>Well, it smells good.</li>
            <li>The best of all of the aluminum free deos sticks I have tried.</li>
            <li>and I was radiating B/O within the hour, works best if fresh out of shower.</li>
            <li>We both love them!</li>
            <li>This deodorant is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I dont think its anything amazing</li>
            <li>All in all a nice scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not smelled many good perfumes.</li>
            <li>Kind of makes me wonder if this is just some kind of shampoo stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it will last 4 or 5hrs at night for me when its cooler, very nice scent and its everyman jack which is awesome stuff anyways..</li>
            <li>Great product lasts long and smells great!</li>
            <li>Best natural deodorant on the market.</li>
            <li>smell that great, too powerful as well.</li>
            <li>I figured I&#x27;d give this a go because I&#x27;m searching for a good aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li>Works great it last all day &amp; smells nice prevents BO!</li>
            <li>Huge fan of this!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I smell like a walking gym locker.</li>
            <li>So while this has worked for others the search for many of us continues...</li>
            <li>more could you want from a stick of deodorant?</li>
            <li>love Every Man</li>
            <li>This stuff is just ok.</li>
            <li>Effectivness is ok.</li>
            <li>I came across this brand with an aftershave that i love</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;ll want more power than this can offer..</li>
            <li>I was just wondering if maybe there was something better.</li>
            <li>I love Every Man Jack shaving products.</li>
            <li>I love their shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is just ok.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite, but definitely not horrible.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s definitely more than one occasion</li>
            <li>Much better than most</li>
            <li>but this sure beats rubbing a crystal on your pits and thinking that will work (hippies!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>Smells great but doesn&#x27;t give much protection</li>
            <li>I love the cedar scent.</li>
            <li>I tried to stick with it and apply alot more of it</li>
            <li>Better then Drakkar.</li>
            <li>Better than axe.</li>
            <li>I think the cedarwood is 10 times better smelling, in fact it&#x27;s one of my favorite smelling deodorants of all time.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells</li>
            <li>I love their shave cream</li>
            <li>This one (cedarwood) reminds me of old spice, wonderful smell, it&#x27;s a clear gel with great ingredients</li>
            <li>I love that it is made with non-toxic products and its aluminum free!</li>
            <li>Not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sweet, light scent that is pleasant and has an almost exotic quality about it.  </li>
            <li>When I get too hot, I don&#x27;t think I smell so good.</li>
            <li>This one is easily one of my favorites when I want to smell confident and well...manly.  </li>
            <li>This seems to work OK and does nto have a strong odor.  </li>
            <li>It has a great masculine smell (the cedar wood scent) and persists all day for me.  </li>
            <li>If I do a workout in the afternoon I can&#x27;t count on it, but one can&#x27;t count on much after a good workout anyway...time for a shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Choose this deodorant if you&#x27;re looking for something good for your health and if reapplying doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>This deodorant smells great, is not to strong or citrusy, and does not irritate my sensitive pits.</li>
            <li>Smells good at first, and I was happy to use something &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, but DOES NOT LAST.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>My BO must be too strong for it.</li>
            <li>He says this works just fine.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this product as the brand appeals to me, and the ingredients are mainly extracts and oils, how nice!</li>
            <li>find this to work great for a standard day of work</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s aluminium free, it&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;clingy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This deodorant is fabulous.</li>
            <li>And of course its aluminum free</li>
            <li>I enjoy this brand and this scent.  </li>
            <li>Great smelling deodorant, ive noticed if you use alot it kinda turned white in my arm pit..</li>
            <li>you are one who is switching from lets say Old Spice give it a good month or two before giving up.</li>
            <li>Smells great, but it does not work for long.</li>
            <li>feels higher quality than most deodorants.</li>
            <li>I feel cool and comfortable with it</li>
            <li>It works great as long as the temperatures don&#x27;t get over 85 degrees.</li>
            <li>It has a nice sexy smell too it, but if you are a larger guy and sweat a lot like myself, try something else.</li>
            <li>Just keep yourself clean</li>
            <li>I am a clean person and don&#x27;t have BO issues</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely been the best one so far for me.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good aluminum free deodorant, look no further.  </li>
            <li>Works very well for me, good duration and good smell, fresh, not very strong, protects all day, I live in the tropic, this product is good for hot weather, no product stains on my shirts.</li>
            <li>From the very pleasant smell to the long lasting protection, you truly cannot get a better deal then this.</li>
            <li>(though how good could rubbing metal into your arm pits daily be?)</li>
            <li>, EMJ&#x27;s product line has fast become my favorite men&#x27;s care</li>
            <li>I shower every day and have been using this twice a day, and by noon, I can already smell myself pretty easily.</li>
            <li>mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>soft, light, sexy scent.  </li>
            <li>But I agree that many will most likely have to reapply midday through.</li>
            <li>smells fresh, great company, just don&#x27;t rub it on wet armpits</li>
            <li>Much better off with the main stream deodorants.</li>
            <li>The cedar wood deodorant smells pretty good, and if you use it twice a day and aren&#x27;t very active, I am sure it would be passable.</li>
            <li>The shower gel is pretty good and smells the same.</li>
            <li>That stuff works great, but it has no scent, so if I want to add a little scent, I use this.</li>
            <li>The scent is fantastic, very woody and earthy smelling.  </li>
            <li>But honestly, this product requires like 15-20 minutes for the white foam to subside and somewhat absorb.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials Deodorant, Fresh Scent</li>
            <li>This one is by far the most feminine scent they make.  </li>
            <li>The cedarwood was recommended by many users because of the smell and I completely agree.</li>
            <li>Keeps me fresh, rather suttle.</li>
            <li>Better than old spice.</li>
            <li>I also tried Naturally Fresh Liquid Roller  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for those who enjoy a fruity, citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>) Citrus:  A light, bright and slightly sweet smelling orange scent that is surprisingly not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>When I first smelled it fresh out of the package, I cringed.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s only effective for about 7 hours, which means I start to smell overwhelmingly like armpit around 3pm (and by 7pm I&#x27;m embarrassed to be out in public).  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, doesn&#x27;t make my white t under shirts yellow and worn out looking.</li>
            <li>Awesome scent while it lasts, which is only a few hours.</li>
            <li>I am not overweight and don&#x27;t even sweat very much.</li>
            <li>this product say it smells very masculine and unique.</li>
            <li>And for a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorant it smells pretty chemically.</li>
            <li>Might buy again, but most likely not.</li>
            <li>First, it does nothing as a deodorant.</li>
            <li>Reapplying doesn&#x27;t exactly fix the smell, but does improve the situation.  </li>
            <li>I believe this may be intentional as this product has cotton extract in it to theoretically wick away sweat (however I don&#x27;t know for sure).  </li>
            <li>I will not buy the products again and will stick to the much more inexpensive and effective brand of Secret.</li>
            <li>, I use Certain Dri about twice a week to reduce sweating, and that product is 12% aluminum chloride I believe.</li>
            <li>Nothing too powerful or too weak.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty natural.</li>
            <li>Still has Propanediol aka Propylene glycol in it and probably too much sodium.</li>
            <li>and it works really well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell too much cedar wood</li>
            <li>I would only recommend Sandalwood to those comfortable with their masculinity and perhaps for the enjoyment of your partner.  </li>
            <li>I really do like this company but the deodorant just cant handle 8 hour protection.</li>
            <li>I have been trying for quite some time to find a deodorant which is aluminum free AND doesn&#x27;t irritate my underarms (such as Tom&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li>the junk that&#x27;s normally sweat out of the body has to stay stuck in the lymph nodes!</li>
            <li>and I am willing to give up the aluminum and toxins found in most deodorants for a little body odor and two applications a day if it is gym day.</li>
            <li>Bought at the local grocery store, I swear this stuff actually makes my B/O more intense.</li>
            <li>The foaming action... when I first put this on in the morning after showering, it does foam up.  </li>
            <li>I love Every Man Jack products but the deodorant falls very short, especially for its price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure the actual effectiveness of this product is variant from person to person but this is healthier for me and doesnt stain my clothes like the big name brand deodorants.</li>
            <li>It is a decent product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for deodorants that not only smell good but are long lasting for some time now,  after using this for a week</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for winter, switch to the stronger stuff in the summer.</li>
            <li>Not terrible, but a little.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really care that it is made with all natural components</li>
            <li>, overall, Cedarwood is amazing, definitely #1 in my book, while Citrus is a close second.  </li>
            <li>I really like the smell, and this is the only aluminum free deodorant that I have found that actually works.  </li>
            <li>At the end of a normal day, I will have a hint of B.O. if I do a smell check.  </li>
            <li>I had BO in 5 hrs after using it and use other non-alumium products just fine.</li>
            <li>Their other products are fantastic though.</li>
            <li>My husband was skeptical to go without the &amp;#34;antiperspirant&amp;#34; portion of a deodorant, but he is really enjoying this aluminum free, geared towards men- brand.</li>
            <li>not sure this is any better than no deodorant at all.</li>
            <li>I usually use unscented because most fragrances in deodorant irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>Its not really bad, but there are definitely some days where I smell really really gross.  </li>
            <li>This stuff was fantastic right until the temp started getting into the 80&#x27;s, then it&#x27;s pretty much useless.</li>
            <li>Zero problems, it still has maybe faded some over that time, but clearly I still smell like Cedarwood, not sweat.</li>
            <li>Sorta tacky like 1990&#x27;s old spice.</li>
            <li>Rash developed after 2 days of use.  </li>
            <li>Seller Selling 2 Year Old Stock!!!&lt;br /&gt;Date</li>
            <li>The journey continues for natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>and I found out that the Old Spice deodorant that I was using had aluminum.</li>
            <li>It aint natural to chemically prevent yourself from sweating,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that the deodorant doesn&#x27;t last long and that you would have to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>came detached from the knob adjuster on delivery, has been mildly annoying to use, but the scent is nice and it lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t sweat that much, but I definitely noticed that this product wouldn&#x27;t work after a certain point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR; Goes on clear, then turns foamy white and takes 20 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li>My husband tried other non-antiperspirants and they could not keep him smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff as a &amp;#34;healthy alternative&amp;#34; on the daily but on a really hot day or a night on the town I wear regular stuff.</li>
            <li>I have used Old Spice (various flavors) for years but wanted something that didn&#x27;t have a strong smell and/or would coordinate with various other product</li>
            <li>and I would smell pretty gross within an hour (similar to how the solid crystal types of deoderants worked for me).  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s subtle and only someone very close (think intimate) will really notice the scent.  </li>
            <li>so i dont why it doesnt hold but for deodorants i will be switching back to my old brand...</li>
            <li>I have to reapply this multiple times a day, whereas if I use Degree or Old Spice, it lasts me all day.</li>
            <li>I have low expectations for natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>Having switched to deodorant only and no longer using anti-perspirant 7 years ago, sweating is par for the course and natural as well.  </li>
            <li>I discovered that I had a tumor that developed under my left armpit.  </li>
            <li>I also travel extensively for my job and never had any issues with soft or melting deodorant.  </li>
            <li>and yes just like some of the other reviews if you&#x27;re a real stinky person</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how dry it keeps me!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This one happened to work great for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!</li>
            <li> product smells amazing!</li>
            <li> Every Man Jack has outstanding products and this deodorant is one of the best!</li>
            <li> This deodorant works great and also smells good.</li>
            <li> Pleasant surprise -</li>
            <li> Keeps the teenager smelling good even after school gym.</li>
            <li> I thought he might need an anti-perspirant to combat that adolescent after gym bouquet, but he wisely doesn&#x27;t want to use anything with aluminum.</li>
            <li> In fact, he tells me he&#x27;s known for smelling good.</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> It has a lighter scent though which is good and</li>
            <li> it smells really good</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t bike, it works fairly well, but be forewarned if you bike or jog, or go to the gym during lunch</li>
            <li> This smells good but not an over powering smell.</li>
            <li> Seems good to me.  </li>
            <li> Well, it smells good.</li>
            <li> The best of all of the aluminum free deos sticks I have tried.</li>
            <li> and I was radiating B/O within the hour, works best if fresh out of shower.</li>
            <li> We both love them!</li>
            <li> This deodorant is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I dont think its anything amazing</li>
            <li> All in all a nice scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not smelled many good perfumes.</li>
            <li> Kind of makes me wonder if this is just some kind of shampoo stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it will last 4 or 5hrs at night for me when its cooler, very nice scent and its everyman jack which is awesome stuff anyways..</li>
            <li> Great product lasts long and smells great!</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant on the market.</li>
            <li> smell that great, too powerful as well.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d give this a go because I&#x27;m searching for a good aluminum free deodorant.</li>
            <li> Works great it last all day &amp; smells nice prevents BO!</li>
            <li> Huge fan of this!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I smell like a walking gym locker.</li>
            <li> So while this has worked for others the search for many of us continues...</li>
            <li> more could you want from a stick of deodorant?</li>
            <li> love Every Man</li>
            <li> This stuff is just ok.</li>
            <li> Effectivness is ok.</li>
            <li> I came across this brand with an aftershave that i love</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;ll want more power than this can offer..</li>
            <li> I was just wondering if maybe there was something better.</li>
            <li> I love Every Man Jack shaving products.</li>
            <li> I love their shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is just ok.</li>
            <li> Not my favorite, but definitely not horrible.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s definitely more than one occasion</li>
            <li> Much better than most</li>
            <li> but this sure beats rubbing a crystal on your pits and thinking that will work (hippies!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t give much protection</li>
            <li> I love the cedar scent.</li>
            <li> I tried to stick with it and apply alot more of it</li>
            <li> Better then Drakkar.</li>
            <li> Better than axe.</li>
            <li> I think the cedarwood is 10 times better smelling, in fact it&#x27;s one of my favorite smelling deodorants of all time.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells</li>
            <li> I love their shave cream</li>
            <li> This one (cedarwood) reminds me of old spice, wonderful smell, it&#x27;s a clear gel with great ingredients</li>
            <li> I love that it is made with non-toxic products and its aluminum free!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sweet, light scent that is pleasant and has an almost exotic quality about it.  </li>
            <li> When I get too hot, I don&#x27;t think I smell so good.</li>
            <li> This one is easily one of my favorites when I want to smell confident and well...manly.  </li>
            <li> This seems to work OK and does nto have a strong odor.  </li>
            <li> It has a great masculine smell (the cedar wood scent) and persists all day for me.  </li>
            <li> If I do a workout in the afternoon I can&#x27;t count on it, but one can&#x27;t count on much after a good workout anyway...time for a shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Choose this deodorant if you&#x27;re looking for something good for your health and if reapplying doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> This deodorant smells great, is not to strong or citrusy, and does not irritate my sensitive pits.</li>
            <li> Smells good at first, and I was happy to use something &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, but DOES NOT LAST.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> My BO must be too strong for it.</li>
            <li> He says this works just fine.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this product as the brand appeals to me, and the ingredients are mainly extracts and oils, how nice!</li>
            <li> find this to work great for a standard day of work</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s aluminium free, it&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;clingy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This deodorant is fabulous.</li>
            <li> And of course its aluminum free</li>
            <li> I enjoy this brand and this scent.  </li>
            <li> Great smelling deodorant, ive noticed if you use alot it kinda turned white in my arm pit..</li>
            <li> you are one who is switching from lets say Old Spice give it a good month or two before giving up.</li>
            <li> Smells great, but it does not work for long.</li>
            <li> feels higher quality than most deodorants.</li>
            <li> I feel cool and comfortable with it</li>
            <li> It works great as long as the temperatures don&#x27;t get over 85 degrees.</li>
            <li> It has a nice sexy smell too it, but if you are a larger guy and sweat a lot like myself, try something else.</li>
            <li> Just keep yourself clean</li>
            <li> I am a clean person and don&#x27;t have BO issues</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely been the best one so far for me.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good aluminum free deodorant, look no further.  </li>
            <li> Works very well for me, good duration and good smell, fresh, not very strong, protects all day, I live in the tropic, this product is good for hot weather, no product stains on my shirts.</li>
            <li> From the very pleasant smell to the long lasting protection, you truly cannot get a better deal then this.</li>
            <li> (though how good could rubbing metal into your arm pits daily be?)</li>
            <li> , EMJ&#x27;s product line has fast become my favorite men&#x27;s care</li>
            <li> I shower every day and have been using this twice a day, and by noon, I can already smell myself pretty easily.</li>
            <li> mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> soft, light, sexy scent.  </li>
            <li> But I agree that many will most likely have to reapply midday through.</li>
            <li> smells fresh, great company, just don&#x27;t rub it on wet armpits</li>
            <li> Much better off with the main stream deodorants.</li>
            <li> The cedar wood deodorant smells pretty good, and if you use it twice a day and aren&#x27;t very active, I am sure it would be passable.</li>
            <li> The shower gel is pretty good and smells the same.</li>
            <li> That stuff works great, but it has no scent, so if I want to add a little scent, I use this.</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic, very woody and earthy smelling.  </li>
            <li> But honestly, this product requires like 15-20 minutes for the white foam to subside and somewhat absorb.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials Deodorant, Fresh Scent</li>
            <li> This one is by far the most feminine scent they make.  </li>
            <li> The cedarwood was recommended by many users because of the smell and I completely agree.</li>
            <li> Keeps me fresh, rather suttle.</li>
            <li> Better than old spice.</li>
            <li> I also tried Naturally Fresh Liquid Roller  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for those who enjoy a fruity, citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ) Citrus:  A light, bright and slightly sweet smelling orange scent that is surprisingly not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> When I first smelled it fresh out of the package, I cringed.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s only effective for about 7 hours, which means I start to smell overwhelmingly like armpit around 3pm (and by 7pm I&#x27;m embarrassed to be out in public).  </li>
            <li> Great stuff, doesn&#x27;t make my white t under shirts yellow and worn out looking.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent while it lasts, which is only a few hours.</li>
            <li> I am not overweight and don&#x27;t even sweat very much.</li>
            <li> this product say it smells very masculine and unique.</li>
            <li> And for a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorant it smells pretty chemically.</li>
            <li> Might buy again, but most likely not.</li>
            <li> First, it does nothing as a deodorant.</li>
            <li> Reapplying doesn&#x27;t exactly fix the smell, but does improve the situation.  </li>
            <li> I believe this may be intentional as this product has cotton extract in it to theoretically wick away sweat (however I don&#x27;t know for sure).  </li>
            <li> I will not buy the products again and will stick to the much more inexpensive and effective brand of Secret.</li>
            <li> , I use Certain Dri about twice a week to reduce sweating, and that product is 12% aluminum chloride I believe.</li>
            <li> Nothing too powerful or too weak.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty natural.</li>
            <li> Still has Propanediol aka Propylene glycol in it and probably too much sodium.</li>
            <li> and it works really well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell too much cedar wood</li>
            <li> I would only recommend Sandalwood to those comfortable with their masculinity and perhaps for the enjoyment of your partner.  </li>
            <li> I really do like this company but the deodorant just cant handle 8 hour protection.</li>
            <li> I have been trying for quite some time to find a deodorant which is aluminum free AND doesn&#x27;t irritate my underarms (such as Tom&#x27;s).  </li>
            <li> the junk that&#x27;s normally sweat out of the body has to stay stuck in the lymph nodes!</li>
            <li> and I am willing to give up the aluminum and toxins found in most deodorants for a little body odor and two applications a day if it is gym day.</li>
            <li> Bought at the local grocery store, I swear this stuff actually makes my B/O more intense.</li>
            <li> The foaming action... when I first put this on in the morning after showering, it does foam up.  </li>
            <li> I love Every Man Jack products but the deodorant falls very short, especially for its price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the actual effectiveness of this product is variant from person to person but this is healthier for me and doesnt stain my clothes like the big name brand deodorants.</li>
            <li> It is a decent product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for deodorants that not only smell good but are long lasting for some time now,  after using this for a week</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for winter, switch to the stronger stuff in the summer.</li>
            <li> Not terrible, but a little.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really care that it is made with all natural components</li>
            <li> , overall, Cedarwood is amazing, definitely #1 in my book, while Citrus is a close second.  </li>
            <li> I really like the smell, and this is the only aluminum free deodorant that I have found that actually works.  </li>
            <li> At the end of a normal day, I will have a hint of B.O. if I do a smell check.  </li>
            <li> I had BO in 5 hrs after using it and use other non-alumium products just fine.</li>
            <li> Their other products are fantastic though.</li>
            <li> My husband was skeptical to go without the &amp;#34;antiperspirant&amp;#34; portion of a deodorant, but he is really enjoying this aluminum free, geared towards men- brand.</li>
            <li> not sure this is any better than no deodorant at all.</li>
            <li> I usually use unscented because most fragrances in deodorant irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> Its not really bad, but there are definitely some days where I smell really really gross.  </li>
            <li> This stuff was fantastic right until the temp started getting into the 80&#x27;s, then it&#x27;s pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> Zero problems, it still has maybe faded some over that time, but clearly I still smell like Cedarwood, not sweat.</li>
            <li> Sorta tacky like 1990&#x27;s old spice.</li>
            <li> Rash developed after 2 days of use.  </li>
            <li> Seller Selling 2 Year Old Stock!!!&lt;br /&gt;Date</li>
            <li> The journey continues for natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> and I found out that the Old Spice deodorant that I was using had aluminum.</li>
            <li> It aint natural to chemically prevent yourself from sweating,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that the deodorant doesn&#x27;t last long and that you would have to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> came detached from the knob adjuster on delivery, has been mildly annoying to use, but the scent is nice and it lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t sweat that much, but I definitely noticed that this product wouldn&#x27;t work after a certain point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR; Goes on clear, then turns foamy white and takes 20 minutes to dry.</li>
            <li> My husband tried other non-antiperspirants and they could not keep him smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff as a &amp;#34;healthy alternative&amp;#34; on the daily but on a really hot day or a night on the town I wear regular stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used Old Spice (various flavors) for years but wanted something that didn&#x27;t have a strong smell and/or would coordinate with various other product</li>
            <li> and I would smell pretty gross within an hour (similar to how the solid crystal types of deoderants worked for me).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s subtle and only someone very close (think intimate) will really notice the scent.  </li>
            <li> so i dont why it doesnt hold but for deodorants i will be switching back to my old brand...</li>
            <li> I have to reapply this multiple times a day, whereas if I use Degree or Old Spice, it lasts me all day.</li>
            <li> I have low expectations for natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Having switched to deodorant only and no longer using anti-perspirant 7 years ago, sweating is par for the course and natural as well.  </li>
            <li> I discovered that I had a tumor that developed under my left armpit.  </li>
            <li> I also travel extensively for my job and never had any issues with soft or melting deodorant.  </li>
            <li> and yes just like some of the other reviews if you&#x27;re a real stinky person</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how dry it keeps me!</li>
            <li> found some other natural deodorant</li>
            <li> Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a natural product that is not full of garbage and chemicals then I would definitely recommend this one</li>
            <li> Goes on clear, then turns into a deep white and gets a little foamy.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t last too long...</li>
            <li> long lasting sweat and odor control..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long, though.  </li>
            <li> and I frequently have skin issues up and down my sides.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hard scent to describe, it&#x27;s not musky, not quite woodsy, but there&#x27;s definitely a...signature scent in there, that really works for me and compliments</li>
            <li> Stands tall against other major brands.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how efficacious this necessarily is, but the foam goes away after I dry out and does not bother me in the least.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it definitely doesn&#x27;t irritate my underarms which is important to me - but if it gets any worse in strength of scent, I might have to try some others which might last a little longer throughout the day.</li>
            <li> if maybe i just got a bad stick because all other reviews are really good</li>
            <li> I usually go through deodorant relatively quickly and this seems to last a bit longer (a couple months) compared to other brands I had previously used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually use Gillette clinical strength, but wanted to try something a little more boutique... left my skin very raw.</li>
            <li> and it also gave me a pretty bad rash (although it did keep me smelling fresh).  </li>
            <li> After long use it would start to cause pain upon application.</li>
            <li> The stick of deodorant lasts a long time for me.  </li>
            <li> hidden under white sticker on back...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the quest to find a long lasting natural deodorant, but at least this one works</li>
            <li> I was a little leery of this product by seeing the other reviewers, especially with the criticism of the product not lasting long.  </li>
            <li> but will not last long under heavy activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do notice after extensive exercise I smell a little, so re</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this product get a bad rep for not lasting long in a lot of the other reviews, so lets be clear on this much.</li>
            <li> Yes, I know that when you put a gel liquid onto your skin, of course it is going to spread onto other things if you do not give it a minute to dry.</li>
            <li> its cheaper at bad bath and beyond which is way cheapper then most health food store.</li>
            <li> It smells great for a few hours and later makes you smell disgusting.  </li>
            <li> Not too wet, not too crumbly.</li>
            <li> Also as deodorant goes its not really up to the task.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I am NOT but there are days that I have had to do yard work and definitely needed to re-apply.</li>
            <li> Only for about half a day or a little over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this along with a slew of other deodorants</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy again, not only is it expensive but it only last about two hours after application.</li>
            <li> So I normally don&#x27;t leave poor reviews</li>
            <li> This does not happen with other deodorants or body powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This might work for some people, like women, but is weaker than any other deodorant Ive ever bought.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this and a couple other EMJ deodorants from a men&#x27;s sampler outlet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other deodorant before.</li>
            <li> Somedays I get stinky, other days not.</li>
            <li> Found this out the hard way by trusting this to last 12 hours, well during my work out</li>
            <li> Oh, and it smears down my torso</li>
            <li> It will take your body a little while to adjust to not having Aluminum or other chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But that doesn&#x27;t mean it will give you all day protection, especially if you workout.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous natural alternative to all of the nasty chemically ones on the market.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, like everyone else said, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> I have been using traditional deodorants from major brands for a while now (mostly Old Spice), up until a month ago when I started getting a very bad insatiable itch with swelling in my arm pits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was the aluminum or some other ingredient</li>
            <li> but after a few days of using this deodorant, I smell like I haven&#x27;t showered in weeks.</li>
            <li> My husband usually stinks after a few hours with other natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all too slick and messy for my liking.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I found that it doesn&#x27;t actually function as a deodorant, so I gave up on it.</li>
            <li> im not sure</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!</li>
            <li> I can usually reapply, but not always.  </li>
            <li> Not sure yet but will give this 5 stars if it does not stain my t shirts like the others do.</li>
            <li> I actually get sick of it by the end of a long, sweaty day.</li>
            <li> Finding a natural deodorant that works is seemingly impossible.</li>
            <li> I do notice that if I go to the gym and work out hard or go running I will smell.  </li>
            <li> Until my girlFRiend had enough, the reasons why i didnt wear it because it just plain out bad for you.</li>
            <li> Subtle, manly scent that lasts the day.  </li>
            <li> This is just overall a bad deodorant.</li>
            <li> Smells sorta allright, but kinda not good either.</li>
            <li> But by the end of the day I swear I smell worse than if I wouldn&#x27;t have worn anything.</li>
            <li> I was confused by some of the reviews as they mention sweating.  </li>
            <li> So... not a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Other users have commented that the smell is bad, and that it doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Previous to this, I had been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine Unscented and developed a terrible rash.  </li>
            <li> This product fails on two levels.</li>
            <li> stinks.  </li>
            <li> Reapplication leads to a coated, sticky feeling in your pits which is also unpleasant.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a Deodorant that doesn&#x27;t contain all that bad stuff</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing product.</li>
            <li> I hate to do this, but I&#x27;m taking away a star.  </li>
            <li> Even went through 3 sticks until I realized that I truly hated the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Terrible, just terrible.</li>
            <li> The rest of their products seem to work, but this is the worst deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

            <li> Smells great, but it does not work for long. My BO must be too strong for it.</li>
            <li> Huge fan of this! No aluminum, smells great.</li>
            <li> Works very well for me, good duration and good smell, fresh, not very strong, protects all day, I live in the tropic, this product is good for hot weather, no product stains on my shirts. Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! So good- I get compliments!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff.  Maybe if the scent were 10% stronger.  I put this everywhere.  Neck, pits, forearms.  The smell does last a while.  Not greasy.  It is a deodorant and not an antiperspirant, so you will still sweat.  Just reapply on your lunch break.</li>
            <li> Works great it last all day &amp; smells nice prevents BO!</li>
            <li> Burned my underarm. Tossed</li>
            <li> This deodorant is AMAZING. From the very pleasant smell to the long lasting protection, you truly cannot get a better deal then this. Every Man Jack has outstanding products and this deodorant is one of the best!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a deodorant that didn&#x27;t have aluminum in it. I was pleasantly surprised how dry it keeps me!</li>
            <li> feels higher quality than most deodorants.</li>
            <li> Bought at the local grocery store, I swear this stuff actually makes my B/O more intense. It has a nice sexy smell too it, but if you are a larger guy and sweat a lot like myself, try something else. I put this stuff on one day and I was radiating B/O within the hour, works best if fresh out of shower.</li>
            <li> I stopped wearing deodorant between the ages 16-22. Until my girlFRiend had enough, the reasons why i didnt wear it because it just plain out bad for you. so i looked for months came opon this product. its awsome, the smell is perfect, it lasts at my desk job for about 5-6 hours. THATS WITHOUT CAKING IN ON. thk you for this wonderful product. i havent bought it on amazon yet but soon. its cheaper at bad bath and beyond which is way cheapper then most health food store.</li>
            <li> Finding a natural deodorant that works is seemingly impossible. I&#x27;ve tried this along with a slew of other deodorants and I&#x27;m still looking for something that will actually last a regular workday. The product smells great and goes on perfectly. Not too wet, not too crumbly. But by the end of the day I swear I smell worse than if I wouldn&#x27;t have worn anything. If I go to the gym? Forget about it. I&#x27;m sure I smell like a walking gym locker. Reapplication leads to a coated, sticky feeling in your pits which is also unpleasant. So while this has worked for others the search for many of us continues...</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy again, not only is it expensive but it only last about two hours after application. I&#x27;ll go back to degree</li>
            <li> This stuff was fantastic right until the temp started getting into the 80&#x27;s, then it&#x27;s pretty much useless. Highly recommend for winter, switch to the stronger stuff in the summer.</li>
            <li> Smells great, does the job. Keeps the teenager smelling good even after school gym. I thought he might need an anti-perspirant to combat that adolescent after gym bouquet, but he wisely doesn&#x27;t want to use anything with aluminum. He says this works just fine. In fact, he tells me he&#x27;s known for smelling good. That&#x27;s my boy.</li>
            <li> I have been using traditional deodorants from major brands for a while now (mostly Old Spice), up until a month ago when I started getting a very bad insatiable itch with swelling in my arm pits. I&#x27;m not sure if it was the aluminum or some other ingredient (though how good could rubbing metal into your arm pits daily be?) but it was unbearable. I found this non-aluminum deodorant and I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Smells good&lt;br /&gt;-Keeps me dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more could you want from a stick of deodorant?</li>
            <li> Excellent product!! It carries the same fragrance as the body wash. It does the job of a deodorant. That is all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this product get a bad rep for not lasting long in a lot of the other reviews, so lets be clear on this much. I don&#x27;t really care that it is made with all natural components, I use Certain Dri about twice a week to reduce sweating, and that product is 12% aluminum chloride I believe. So I only care about how well the product functions, and how it smells.&lt;br /&gt;Every women friends I&#x27;ve had test smell this product say it smells very masculine and unique. Check.&lt;br /&gt;For a summer job I lifeguard outside in 80-95 degree weather for a 10 hour shift. Zero problems, it still has maybe faded some over that time, but clearly I still smell like Cedarwood, not sweat. Not to say I don&#x27;t sweat during that time, I just don&#x27;t smell like sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shower twice a day and use the Every Man Jack shampoo/conditioner once a day. Just keep yourself clean and I doubt you&#x27;ll have a problem. This deodorant goes this distance.</li>
            <li> came detached from the knob adjuster on delivery, has been mildly annoying to use, but the scent is nice and it lasts most of the day. also washes from the underarm nicely/easily in the shower</li>
            <li> So I normally don&#x27;t leave poor reviews but I have my reasons for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Every Man Jack products and have been using this deodorant for multiple months on and off. Even went through 3 sticks until I realized that I truly hated the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice mild fragrance. Nothing too powerful or too weak.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty natural. No aluminum, propylene glycol, parabens, phthalates etc...&lt;br /&gt;No animal testing or animal products etc...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. After long use it would start to cause pain upon application. A burning tingling sensation... Tingling would not be present the second I put a different brand on.&lt;br /&gt;2. Goes on clear, then turns into a deep white and gets a little foamy. This was my biggest problem because if you tried to put clothing on, get into bed, give someone a hug (yea, she was pissed!), or cuddle with your girlfriend in your arm on the couch (fairly upset as well!) it would get EVERYWHERE. Yes, I know that when you put a gel liquid onto your skin, of course it is going to spread onto other things if you do not give it a minute to dry. But honestly, this product requires like 15-20 minutes for the white foam to subside and somewhat absorb.&lt;br /&gt;3. Wouldn&#x27;t last too long... I really don&#x27;t sweat that much, but I definitely noticed that this product wouldn&#x27;t work after a certain point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR; Goes on clear, then turns foamy white and takes 20 minutes to dry. Burns skin after a while.</li>
            <li> This stuff is just ok. Still has Propanediol aka Propylene glycol in it and probably too much sodium. Smells sorta allright, but kinda not good either. Sorta tacky like 1990&#x27;s old spice. And for a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorant it smells pretty chemically. It has a lighter scent though which is good and probably the only thing that keeps me using it. Effectivness is ok. Might buy again, but most likely not.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great.  Unfortunately, I found that it doesn&#x27;t actually function as a deodorant, so I gave up on it.</li>
            <li> I came across this brand with an aftershave that i love and i instantly started replacing my products as they were running out with this brand.. but im not a fan of the deodorant.. im not sure if maybe i just got a bad stick because all other reviews are really good but it does not last at all... it smells really good but i find myself applying 3 times a day because the smell does not hold at all for me... im not a person that sweats from my armpits allot so i dont why it doesnt hold but for deodorants i will be switching back to my old brand... everything else i have tried with this brand has been really great though.</li>
            <li> The cedar wood deodorant smells pretty good, and if you use it twice a day and aren&#x27;t very active, I am sure it would be passable. However, I am a cyclist and bike commute to work. I shower every day and have been using this twice a day, and by noon, I can already smell myself pretty easily. If I don&#x27;t bike, it works fairly well, but be forewarned if you bike or jog, or go to the gym during lunch, you&#x27;ll want more power than this can offer..</li>
            <li> Best natural deodorant on the market.</li>
            <li> At the end of a 9-hour work day my armpits stink if I use this deodorant. And I have a desk job. I am not overweight and don&#x27;t even sweat very much. This stuff just doesn&#x27;t work. I have been using the Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials Deodorant, Fresh Scent and it works really well. I was just wondering if maybe there was something better. If there is, this isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> I love Every Man Jack shaving products. Bought this assuming quality was the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t smell that great, too powerful as well. I actually get sick of it by the end of a long, sweaty day. Also as deodorant goes its not really up to the task. This stuff mixes with BO and I stink like some horrid depraved creature. Oh, and it smears down my torso and I frequently have skin issues up and down my sides. This does not happen with other deodorants or body powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will try the Mint and Citrus though, the brand is still quality in my eyes.</li>
            <li> It gets 2 stars because it&#x27;s all-natural but the rest has a lot to be desired. I am a clean person and don&#x27;t have BO issues but after a few days of using this deodorant, I smell like I haven&#x27;t showered in weeks. It&#x27;s all too slick and messy for my liking. I love Every Man Jack products but the deodorant falls very short, especially for its price.</li>
            <li> Makes me want to sit closer to him. Sometimes I borrow it.  Wonderful woodsy scent.  NO ALUMINUM.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a Deodorant that doesn&#x27;t contain all that bad stuff this is the place.&lt;br /&gt;If you are one who is switching from lets say Old Spice give it a good month or two before giving up. It will take your body a little while to adjust to not having Aluminum or other chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;I find this to work great for a standard day of work - I have a desk job. If I do a workout in the afternoon I can&#x27;t count on it, but one can&#x27;t count on much after a good workout anyway...time for a shower.</li>
            <li> This product fails on two levels. First, it does nothing as a deodorant. Secondly, it smells nothing like Cedar. I will not buy the products again and will stick to the much more inexpensive and effective brand of Secret.</li>
            <li> This smells good but not an over powering smell. I don&#x27;t smell too much cedar wood like I was expecting. It was a gift to a friend and he loves it!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best scented deodorant I&#x27;ve tried yet.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean it will give you all day protection, especially if you workout.  At the end of a normal day, I will have a hint of B.O. if I do a smell check.  Not terrible, but a little.  I use it in conjunction with Crystal Rock deodorant.  That stuff works great, but it has no scent, so if I want to add a little scent, I use this.</li>
            <li> This product works great without aluminum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for deodorants that not only smell good but are long lasting for some time now,  after using this for a week it&#x27;s definitely been the best one so far for me. Great product lasts long and smells great!</li>
            <li> I love their shampoo. This is just ok. I dont think its anything amazing but I would buy it again if it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> My husband was skeptical to go without the &amp;#34;antiperspirant&amp;#34; portion of a deodorant, but he is really enjoying this aluminum free, geared towards men- brand.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in this product.  Purchased it because it was supposed to not cause underarm rash.  Rash developed after 2 days of use.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!</li>
            <li> Seller Selling 2 Year Old Stock!!!&lt;br /&gt;Date hidden under white sticker on back...&lt;br /&gt;I want 2015 stock, not 2013 stock!!!&lt;br /&gt;All the fragrance is gone! I don&#x27;t smell any Cedarwood !</li>
            <li> This might work for some people, like women, but is weaker than any other deodorant Ive ever bought.  There is a reason everything else on the market contains aluminium, because it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im not sure this is any better than no deodorant at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this and a couple other EMJ deodorants from a men&#x27;s sampler outlet and I have to say, EMJ&#x27;s product line has fast become my favorite men&#x27;s care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried Cedarwood, Sandalwood and Citrus.  My reviews follow for your convenience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, all of these will last throughout the day.  That being said, if you&#x27;re a gym enthusiast, nightowl, etc - you&#x27;ll want to shower and reapply.  Because it&#x27;s aluminium free, it&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;clingy&amp;#34; as some products, so it tends to fade by the time night falls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Cedarwood: Subtle, manly scent that lasts the day.  This one is easily one of my favorites when I want to smell confident and well...manly.  It&#x27;s a hard scent to describe, it&#x27;s not musky, not quite woodsy, but there&#x27;s definitely a...signature scent in there, that really works for me and compliments my pheromones well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Citrus:  A light, bright and slightly sweet smelling orange scent that is surprisingly not overpowering.  When I first smelled it fresh out of the package, I cringed.  I thought, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m going to put a dreamcicle under my arms!&amp;#34;  Pleasant surprise - it&#x27;s subtle and only someone very close (think intimate) will really notice the scent.  Highly recommended for those who enjoy a fruity, citrus scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Sandalwood:  This one is by far the most feminine scent they make.  That being said, it&#x27;s still not &amp;#34;girlie&amp;#34; at all.  It&#x27;s a sweet, light scent that is pleasant and has an almost exotic quality about it.  Think, &amp;#34;gentleman&#x27;s club&amp;#34; soft, light, sexy scent.  Not my favorite, but definitely not horrible.  There&#x27;s definitely more than one occasion I&#x27;ll wear this one to. (And women definitely appreciate the scent!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, overall, Cedarwood is amazing, definitely #1 in my book, while Citrus is a close second.  I would only recommend Sandalwood to those comfortable with their masculinity and perhaps for the enjoyment of your partner.  Not the type I&#x27;d take to the gym, but your mileage may vary on that.the gym, but your mileage may vary on that.</li>
            <li> Much better than most</li>
            <li> Does the job for me. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is fabulous. My husband usually stinks after a few hours with other natural deodorants. This one lasts ALL DAY! Fabulous natural alternative to all of the nasty chemically ones on the market. Buy this! You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It is perhaps best if it is applied every 3 or 4 hours!</li>
            <li> NOTE: non aluminum based deodorants will not preform like their counterpart products will but this sure beats rubbing a crystal on your pits and thinking that will work (hippies!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells amazing! and works great! but will not last long under heavy activity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure the actual effectiveness of this product is variant from person to person but this is healthier for me and doesnt stain my clothes like the big name brand deodorants. I dont mind reapplying it every now and then when needed.</li>
            <li> Sides of the plastic will scratch you!  Product needs improvement and needs users to test the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this deodorant for over a year and i love it.</li>
            <li> Terrible, just terrible. The journey continues for natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> Other users have commented that the smell is bad, and that it doesn&#x27;t work.  These are subjective because everyone&#x27;s chemistry is different and what they like the smell of. I really like the smell, and this is the only aluminum free deodorant that I have found that actually works.  If you are comparing this to an antiperspirant then you are looking in the wrong the place, it does not stop perspiration, but it does stop the smell in a safe way without all the chemicals and aluminum that harms the body.  If you are looking for a good aluminum free deodorant, look no further.  Great choice!</li>
            <li> I usually use unscented because most fragrances in deodorant irritate my skin. I figured I&#x27;d give this a go because I&#x27;m searching for a good aluminum free deodorant. However, this irritated my skin so, it&#x27;s a no go. Their other products are fantastic though.</li>
            <li> Smells good at first, and I was happy to use something &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, but DOES NOT LAST. I have to reapply this multiple times a day, whereas if I use Degree or Old Spice, it lasts me all day. The rest of their products seem to work, but this is the worst deodorant I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> long lasting sweat and odor control..Stands tall against other major brands.</li>
            <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t give much protection</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading about harmful ingredients on deodorants and I found out that the Old Spice deodorant that I was using had aluminum. I threw that one away and did my research on deodorants and found Every Man Jack. After reading the mix reviews, I decided to make my purchase. The cedarwood was recommended by many users because of the smell and I completely agree. It&#x27;s true that the deodorant doesn&#x27;t last long and that you would have to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choose this deodorant if you&#x27;re looking for something good for your health and if reapplying doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, doesn&#x27;t make my white t under shirts yellow and worn out looking. Keeps me fresh, rather suttle. I do notice after extensive exercise I smell a little, so re applying it is neccesary. All in all a nice scent.</li>
            <li> This is my favourite deodorant stick. I love the cedar scent. wish they had an antiperspirant also</li>
            <li> My husband loves this and it smells great!  He doesn&#x27;t have to use a lot and the smell last all day!</li>
            <li> This is just overall a bad deodorant. It does not work as deodorant. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other deodorant before. I really wanted to love this product as the brand appeals to me, and the ingredients are mainly extracts and oils, how nice! And of course its aluminum free which is why I picked it up to begin with. I tried to stick with it and apply alot more of it but it just does not work as deodorant. You will smell like cedarwood and sweat all day, not just like cedarwood.</li>
            <li> I feel cool and comfortable with it but the B.O. keeps coming back in 2 hours. I think its not doing a great job in that area.</li>
            <li> This deodorant works great and also smells good. I&#x27;ve recommended it to others, and they now use this brand. I will continue to purchase this brand.</li>
            <li> Better than old spice. Better then Drakkar. Better than axe. You see where im going? I&#x27;ve not smelled many good perfumes. I just want something that works. This does , kinda. I fricken stink by the end of the day no matter what. But you know ..the citrus scent is the BEST.</li>
            <li> I have low expectations for natural deodorant. Now I remember at wholefoods smelling both the orange one and the cedarwood. I think the cedarwood is 10 times better smelling, in fact it&#x27;s one of my favorite smelling deodorants of all time. Unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t last too long. Somedays I get stinky, other days not. But I agree that many will most likely have to reapply midday through. I&#x27;m still on the quest to find a long lasting natural deodorant, but at least this one works okay and the smell is awesome. Stay away from those anti-persperants with aluminum! It aint natural to chemically prevent yourself from sweating, the junk that&#x27;s normally sweat out of the body has to stay stuck in the lymph nodes! Yikes!</li>
            <li> You probably use deodorant every day, after a few years all that aluminum slicing up the pores in your armpits really adds up. That&#x27;s the best way to look at it, the over all. I use this stuff as a &amp;#34;healthy alternative&amp;#34; on the daily but on a really hot day or a night on the town I wear regular stuff. smells fresh, great company, just don&#x27;t rub it on wet armpits cause it gets frothy.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this brand and this scent.  I was confused by some of the reviews as they mention sweating.  Having switched to deodorant only and no longer using anti-perspirant 7 years ago, sweating is par for the course and natural as well.  Why did I switch?  I discovered that I had a tumor that developed under my left armpit.  It was benign and the doctor recommended I stop using anti-perspirant after explaining how the aluminum worked.  After some time of not using anti-perspirant, the tumor went away.  That was enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up Every Man Jack sometime ago at a local grocery and continue to use this brand.  The scent is not overpowering and my wife likes the smell.  I do not have to reapply throughout the course of the day.  I also travel extensively for my job and never had any issues with soft or melting deodorant.  It goes with me everywhere I travel in my dop kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think people confuse deodorant for anti-perspirant and wonder why they feel sweat.</li>
            <li> It is a decent product. I love the way it smells and yes just like some of the other reviews if you&#x27;re a real stinky person then this is probably not going to work for you. Fortunately I am NOT but there are days that I have had to do yard work and definitely needed to re-apply. Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a natural product that is not full of garbage and chemicals then I would definitely recommend this one</li>
            <li> Since everyone&#x27;s chemestry is different, I can only say that this did not work for me. I had BO in 5 hrs after using it and use other non-alumium products just fine. It did smell good, just wish it worked for me!</li>
            <li> Seems good to me.  I have used Old Spice (various flavors) for years but wanted something that didn&#x27;t have a strong smell and/or would coordinate with various other product stinks.  This seems to work OK and does nto have a strong odor.  I have not used this yet in the summer so that would be the acid test.  The shower gel is pretty good and smells the same.</li>
            <li> I really do like this company but the deodorant just cant handle 8 hour protection. it has to be applied over and over sand over again . I just shouldnt have to carry a stick a d around all day.&lt;br /&gt;I found some other natural deodorant so I chucked this one.</li>
            <li> On time, good quality!</li>
            <li> Hubby smells awesome!</li>
            <li> The ingredients are the reason I purchased this. It works great as long as the temperatures don&#x27;t get over 85 degrees. When I get too hot, I don&#x27;t think I smell so good.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product.  I love their shave cream but the deodorant is simply defective.  It smells great for a few hours and later makes you smell disgusting.  Very disappointing product. Much better off with the main stream deodorants.</li>
            <li> Great smelling deodorant, ive noticed if you use alot it kinda turned white in my arm pit.. for me this deodorant is what i use before i go out in the evening cause it wont last all day sweating outside but it will last 4 or 5hrs at night for me when its cooler, very nice scent and its everyman jack which is awesome stuff anyways.. this adds to my shampoo,bodywash,hair paste</li>
            <li> I find it that it does not last all day.</li>
            <li> My husband tried other non-antiperspirants and they could not keep him smelling fresh. This one (cedarwood) reminds me of old spice, wonderful smell, it&#x27;s a clear gel with great ingredients and he is very happy (and so are our noses). I have started using the citrus myself. We both love them!</li>
            <li> The scent is fantastic, very woody and earthy smelling.  It doesn&#x27;t last long, though.  Only for about half a day or a little over.</li>
            <li> I only use straight-up deodorants because antiperspirants gives me a rash. This deodorant smells great, is not to strong or citrusy, and does not irritate my sensitive pits. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s only effective for about 7 hours, which means I start to smell overwhelmingly like armpit around 3pm (and by 7pm I&#x27;m embarrassed to be out in public).  Reapplying doesn&#x27;t exactly fix the smell, but does improve the situation.  Unless you take a midday shower, you might want to stick with another stick.</li>
            <li> Smells great!  My wife loves the smell!  And my son is now using it too.  I love that it is made with non-toxic products and its aluminum free!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite.  I usually use Gillette clinical strength, but wanted to try something a little more boutique... left my skin very raw.</li>
            <li> Well, it smells good. I picked it up for that reason. Unfortunately, like everyone else said, it doesn&#x27;t last long at all. In fact, if you add water to it, it sort of foams up. Kind of makes me wonder if this is just some kind of shampoo stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, it lasts for about an hour or so, and if you happen to sweat into it, it foams kinda. So... not a great purchase.</li>
            <li> Been using this for several years now. Lasts all day. The best of all of the aluminum free deos sticks I have tried. No irritation.</li>
            <li> I was a little leery of this product by seeing the other reviewers, especially with the criticism of the product not lasting long.  I have been trying for quite some time to find a deodorant which is aluminum free AND doesn&#x27;t irritate my underarms (such as Tom&#x27;s).  However, my experience has been great.  Here&#x27;s my thoughts/experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The deodorant smells great! It has a great masculine smell (the cedar wood scent) and persists all day for me.  I do notice that if I go to the gym and work out hard or go running I will smell.  However at work, I have no issues with the longevity of the deodorant.  If I will be especially sweaty, I will reapply it and there are no issues.  Of note, this is not an antiperspirant and you will still sweat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The foaming action... when I first put this on in the morning after showering, it does foam up.  I believe this may be intentional as this product has cotton extract in it to theoretically wick away sweat (however I don&#x27;t know for sure).  I don&#x27;t know how efficacious this necessarily is, but the foam goes away after I dry out and does not bother me in the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) The stick of deodorant lasts a long time for me.  I usually go through deodorant relatively quickly and this seems to last a bit longer (a couple months) compared to other brands I had previously used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous to this, I had been using Tom&#x27;s of Maine Unscented and developed a terrible rash.  I tried Trader Joes Unscented and I would smell pretty gross within an hour (similar to how the solid crystal types of deoderants worked for me).  I also tried Naturally Fresh Liquid Roller  and it also gave me a pretty bad rash (although it did keep me smelling fresh).  For me, this one worked. I do know people&#x27;s body chemistries are different, so try different kinds and see what works for you. This one happened to work great for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;So I hate to do this, but I&#x27;m taking away a star.  After using this deodorant for a while, its starting to not work as well for me (I don&#x27;t know if its just variation in the bars or what).  Its not really bad, but there are definitely some days where I smell really really gross.  Just something to keep in mind.  I can usually reapply, but not always.  Otherwise, it definitely doesn&#x27;t irritate my underarms which is important to me - but if it gets any worse in strength of scent, I might have to try some others which might last a little longer throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent while it lasts, which is only a few hours. I work 12 hours a day then go to gym afterwords, I found before I head to gym to reapply and no body odor is present. Found this out the hard way by trusting this to last 12 hours, well during my work out I discovered that I should have reapplied it. Oh well, there is give and take in this world and I am willing to give up the aluminum and toxins found in most deodorants for a little body odor and two applications a day if it is gym day. Not sure yet but will give this 5 stars if it does not stain my t shirts like the others do. just wish the odor protection lasted somewhat longer with one application.</li>
