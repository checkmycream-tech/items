            <li>I have found that this works well as an in between or a rinse to your shampoo-conditioner, stand alone, or best of all, beach/pool companion!</li>
            <li>Lisa Rachel is Great!</li>
            <li>I am transitioning and I have beautiful 3B type hair and this product</li>
            <li>Great Product, Great Buy, Great Seller, Thank You,</li>
            <li>Great shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy that for some this product seems to &amp;</li>
            <li>Great Stuff.</li>
            <li>great product, will be purchasing more!!</li>
            <li>The fragrance isn&#x27;t as enticing as the Wen, but it is pleasant.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo is good, but I don&#x27;t need the irritation of a faulty dispenser.</li>
            <li>The manageability of your hair isn&#x27;t as good, I have fly-aways with this.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea if Lisa Rachel is any good since the product we received was Hair One.  </li>
            <li>But this is a good product.</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s good product, but pricey.</li>
            <li>The price is good too -</li>
            <li>Really good for the price.</li>
            <li>but I was very pleased to discover Pantene</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves thinner hair feeling really healthy and nourished.</li>
            <li>but, make sure you follow the directions on the bottle!  </li>
            <li>So I tried Wen, and I LOVE it!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried WEN, but if this is better, then I don&#x27;t want to!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This Shampoo &amp; Conditioner is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I started out using Pantene&#x27;s for 2 months, which I really liked.</li>
            <li>My problem is that there is nowhere that you can walk in and buy it, and honestly, sometimes I just couldn&#x27;t afford the $ to buy it.  </li>
            <li>Even after this experience, I still really liked the idea of using a conditioning cleanser to lessen damage on my hair</li>
            <li>WEN by far is best, so I will stay with that brand.</li>
            <li>and I have to say that my hair looks pretty darned good! :-)  </li>
            <li>okay..</li>
            <li>My hair looked okay after using it..</li>
            <li>Looking forward to seeing how much more hair can improve with each use. :-)</li>
            <li>I am a WEN user for about a year now, and I love the product.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time, my hair looked like a birds nest.  </li>
            <li>one\\&quot;, who most claim works \\&quot;just as well\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Seeing the comparision(s) to WEN here I decided to give this one a shot because this one was more affordable.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;m a Wen Girl...  </li>
            <li>Yes, I will buy this again and again, but I&#x27;ll keep a jar of the Wen for weekly luxury!  :)</li>
            <li>I love wen</li>
            <li>my hair is just to damaged  and wen works better for me.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioning cleanser.  </li>
            <li>But I love this product, specifically the olive oil &amp; aloe conditoner.</li>
            <li>I know this is more affordable than WEN.</li>
            <li>I love the Lisa Rachel line and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I have tried SO many products, it seems just about everything out there.</li>
            <li>No insane clumps of hair falling out.</li>
            <li>Better than Wen.  </li>
            <li>So, make sure you have about an hour to spend washing your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this stuff isn&#x27;t any better than Hair One...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to go two or even three days before washing it.  </li>
            <li>My best friend of over 20 years  recently said my hair looks better than it ever has.</li>
            <li>Better control than I have ever had.  </li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>I like this better.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioning wash</li>
            <li>I like this, but the price isn&#x27;t really all that great in comparison to WEN.  </li>
            <li>I just love it.</li>
            <li>OK if use wen  this one is pretty good  when it comes to living  </li>
            <li>Leaves your hair soft with a beautiful sheen.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought they were identical products, but after using them both, the Lisa Rachel product is definitely superior.  </li>
            <li>There are many, many people with complaints about WEN, Lisa Rachel and Hair One all causing their hair to come out in huge amounts.</li>
            <li>it smelled pretty good, and made my hair tangle free.  </li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>Loved how my hair felt, but it got so greasy so fast that I had to wash my hair every day</li>
            <li>Other than the impossibility of using it as packaged, the product itself does a wonderful job and makes a noticeable difference on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have tried other cleansing conditioners, but this seems to feel the cleanest and best to my hair/scalp.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a clean feel.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets damaged easily</li>
            <li>I love the smell and its a great shampoo and condition when traveling that way you don&#x27;t have to carry two different bottles of shampoo and cream rinse.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell better than WEN and the price is right.</li>
            <li>I have thinning fine gray hair,.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m now a huge fan.</li>
            <li>I just sucked it up and bought a huge bottle of Wen.</li>
            <li>(except Herbal Essence sulfate free conditioner...lol...</li>
            <li>I was so thankful to have a great conditioner to help repair it, but I definitely will be returning this product.</li>
            <li>works similar not quite as good  but smells much better.</li>
            <li>Yes, I tried WEN and was excited to get started using it.</li>
            <li>which I&#x27;m pretty sure defeats the purpose of the product.</li>
            <li>I do not have to use a hot iron any more after every shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t clean quite like the Pantene in that it isn&#x27;t as creamy..</li>
            <li>Wen for me is waay better therefore worth the higher prices.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I will use it again even though the bottle is still amost full.</li>
            <li>Not a fan of the fragrance, but not bad.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price</li>
            <li>Well, at first, when my hair was wet, I kind of liked it...</li>
            <li>I like this product, I love the smell and overall performance of this product, but I DO wish it detangled more.</li>
            <li>If it doesn&#x27;t I&#x27;m going back and buying every bottle left lol!</li>
            <li>However, with my very first use I noticed a lot of hair coming out of my head in the shower</li>
            <li>hair is very, very healthy; despite constant hair dye jobs!!</li>
            <li>This product is pretty darn close!  </li>
            <li>I love it, it works so well in my hair and it smells good (to me at least).</li>
            <li>my hair was soft, untangled, smooth and mosturized!</li>
            <li>it was pretty close to being 1/2-3/4 full.</li>
            <li>Soft, touchable, I can style it, great movement when I shake my head, if the wind blows my hair falls back where it should, if the weather drizzles I don&#x27;t have a fuzz ball for hair</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny, soft, and feeling healthy.  </li>
            <li>I am very unsure if most of these reviews are real..</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like this product, but it is better than normal shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have super curly hard to manage hair, but I feel like it&#x27;s been great since I switched to this.</li>
            <li>makes my hair feel soft, easy to use, no harsh ingredients, the smell is decent, but could be better, wish I could buy abigger botttle</li>
            <li>I tried this again and followed the directions EXACTLY, this time</li>
            <li>This one is a close second to WEN, and in my opinion, is able to do what shampoo and conditioners don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first sulfate-free shmapoo</li>
            <li>Would love to see them use a different container.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t exactly like the way it&#x27;s smelled.</li>
            <li>I do like to have fresh hair out of the shower, but can get by with a good solid rinse followed by combing  the cleanser through my hair rather than doing the cleansing/conditioning ritual daily.  </li>
            <li>And I really like the way it cleans and contitions!</li>
            <li>my hair feels soft and clean .</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the expensive versions like \\&quot;ovations\\&quot; or \\&quot;wen\\&quot; to find out that you just have to use a lot of product to get a good result.</li>
            <li>Why people spend so much money when theres much cheaper products with the same result, is beyond me :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen other reviews where folks don&#x27;t think the product cleanses well, and I&#x27;ve experienced that, too, but only when I don&#x27;t follow the instructions to take the time to really scrub my scalp and comb the product through my hair.</li>
            <li>I can blow dry my hair on the lowest setting and I feel like I&#x27;ve got healthy hair again.  </li>
            <li>so I was looking for a gentle shampoo and considered trying the WEN brand.</li>
            <li>Is there really even a Lisa Rachel product or is it really Hair One?  </li>
            <li>Wish they would consider selling it in Aus, tried hair one and didnt like it as much because it made my scalp very itchy.</li>
            <li>Oh, and a side note, it really didn&#x27;t do much to improve the condition of the hair that it didn&#x27;t cause to fall out.</li>
            <li>I also find that I am not using as much of this as I did with WEN.</li>
            <li>For the first time I feel I have normal hair</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>It has made it so much easier to come my hair after washing it.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a highter rating, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>That makes washing my hair more of ritual over the usual 2 seconds of scrubbing, rinsing, conditioning, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have really dry, fine, curly hair and</li>
            <li>I work out and use alot of oil based products like joboba oil, sweet almond oil on a regular basis, so I need a cleanser that cleans, but does not strip my hair.</li>
            <li>let it stay in for about 3 min rinse and add just a little more and really scrub my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may just be my particular scalp issues, but this one just wont&#x27; work for me...</li>
            <li>OK, I&#x27;m a big enough person to admit a &amp;#34;boo boo&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li>I really like how it smells and my hair feels soft and silky!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend people try Lisa Rachel.</li>
            <li>My curls came out okay, but I did think my hair looked a little duller than it had using the Pantene..</li>
            <li>and I see more of my little coilies and curls popping out everywhere.</li>
            <li>This has absolutely zero difference as far as effectiveness, than Wen.</li>
            <li>Product works okay, but it takes a long time to do your hair when you follow the instructions on the back.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, just below my shoulders, and just starting to have a few grays here and there, so that hair is more coarse.  </li>
            <li>But when It dried, it actually left kind of a film on my hair and hands.  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>It works just as well, if not better than the Wen product and is much more affordable.</li>
            <li>Exactly the same thing happened with this product!</li>
            <li>I gave this a shot and WOW!</li>
            <li>, my hair isnt even fully natural and its all curly!</li>
            <li>It leave my hair soft, however I still use a little regualr shampoo to really get my hair clean</li>
            <li>My hair right now feels dry.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine and to use shampoo/conditioner leaves it too limp.  </li>
            <li>My hair is slightly softer, especially right after washing, but even with following the instructions to a T, it was definitely not a mind blowing experience.</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>Unfortunatley, when I tried this one, whole different story..</li>
            <li>Made my hair too soft.</li>
            <li>It works, but, no where near my WEN...</li>
            <li>I would buy again and it leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I let my 7 yr old daughter have it</li>
            <li>It left my hair very silky.</li>
            <li>my hair still needed conditioner to make it soft with out conditioner it is all dryed out</li>
            <li>It comes out soft and managable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying quite a few brands of the cleansing conditioners like Wen, only at a better price, to see how I like them..</li>
            <li>With Wen, I tried many different formulas based on Wen&#x27;s recommendations, I found I had to also use a heavy conditioner after using Wen and</li>
            <li>Skeptical at first but worked great and much less than Wen.</li>
            <li>I have Black (of African descent) virgin hair and it leaves it manageable, clean and soft!!</li>
            <li>Lisa Rachel is less expensive and does the same wonderful thing for the texture of my hair, but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>If you wash your hair everyday this product is fine, but if like me you wash your hair every third day than I would not recommend this particular&lt;br /&gt;cleanser with olive oil.  </li>
            <li>My hair has a really glossy shine to it and the dry ends improved dramatically.  </li>
            <li>The pump barely dispenses the product.  </li>
            <li>Any product that says &amp;#34;the more you use the better!!&amp;#34; on the bottle is frustrating.</li>
            <li>Price was a little high but figured it was highly recommended I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, unfortunately we dont have any products like this in Australia and my hair absolutely hates traditional foamy shampoos and using the no poo method still doesnt have the same results as using a cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li>This product has made my hair normal, its normally very dry, frizzy and unmanagable, highly recommend to anyone who has dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>The other product that I used before was very pricey.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a gentle shampoo for weak, damaged or dry hair.</li>
            <li>(I normally wash it every other day).  </li>
            <li>I came across Lisa Rachel, I saw some bad and some good reviews.  </li>

            <li> I like this, but the price isn&#x27;t really all that great in comparison to WEN.  </li>
            <li> I just love it.</li>
            <li> OK if use wen  this one is pretty good  when it comes to living  </li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft with a beautiful sheen.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought they were identical products, but after using them both, the Lisa Rachel product is definitely superior.  </li>
            <li> There are many, many people with complaints about WEN, Lisa Rachel and Hair One all causing their hair to come out in huge amounts.</li>
            <li> it smelled pretty good, and made my hair tangle free.  </li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> Loved how my hair felt, but it got so greasy so fast that I had to wash my hair every day</li>
            <li> Other than the impossibility of using it as packaged, the product itself does a wonderful job and makes a noticeable difference on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried other cleansing conditioners, but this seems to feel the cleanest and best to my hair/scalp.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a clean feel.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets damaged easily</li>
            <li> I love the smell and its a great shampoo and condition when traveling that way you don&#x27;t have to carry two different bottles of shampoo and cream rinse.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell better than WEN and the price is right.</li>
            <li> I have thinning fine gray hair,.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m now a huge fan.</li>
            <li> I just sucked it up and bought a huge bottle of Wen.</li>
            <li> (except Herbal Essence sulfate free conditioner...lol...</li>
            <li> I was so thankful to have a great conditioner to help repair it, but I definitely will be returning this product.</li>
            <li> works similar not quite as good  but smells much better.</li>
            <li> Yes, I tried WEN and was excited to get started using it.</li>
            <li> which I&#x27;m pretty sure defeats the purpose of the product.</li>
            <li> I do not have to use a hot iron any more after every shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t clean quite like the Pantene in that it isn&#x27;t as creamy..</li>
            <li> Wen for me is waay better therefore worth the higher prices.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will use it again even though the bottle is still amost full.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the fragrance, but not bad.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price</li>
            <li> Well, at first, when my hair was wet, I kind of liked it...</li>
            <li> I like this product, I love the smell and overall performance of this product, but I DO wish it detangled more.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t I&#x27;m going back and buying every bottle left lol!</li>
            <li> However, with my very first use I noticed a lot of hair coming out of my head in the shower</li>
            <li> hair is very, very healthy; despite constant hair dye jobs!!</li>
            <li> This product is pretty darn close!  </li>
            <li> I love it, it works so well in my hair and it smells good (to me at least).</li>
            <li> my hair was soft, untangled, smooth and mosturized!</li>
            <li> it was pretty close to being 1/2-3/4 full.</li>
            <li> Soft, touchable, I can style it, great movement when I shake my head, if the wind blows my hair falls back where it should, if the weather drizzles I don&#x27;t have a fuzz ball for hair</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny, soft, and feeling healthy.  </li>
            <li> I am very unsure if most of these reviews are real..</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like this product, but it is better than normal shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have super curly hard to manage hair, but I feel like it&#x27;s been great since I switched to this.</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel soft, easy to use, no harsh ingredients, the smell is decent, but could be better, wish I could buy abigger botttle</li>
            <li> I tried this again and followed the directions EXACTLY, this time</li>
            <li> This one is a close second to WEN, and in my opinion, is able to do what shampoo and conditioners don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first sulfate-free shmapoo</li>
            <li> Would love to see them use a different container.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t exactly like the way it&#x27;s smelled.</li>
            <li> I do like to have fresh hair out of the shower, but can get by with a good solid rinse followed by combing  the cleanser through my hair rather than doing the cleansing/conditioning ritual daily.  </li>
            <li> And I really like the way it cleans and contitions!</li>
            <li> my hair feels soft and clean .</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the expensive versions like \\&quot;ovations\\&quot; or \\&quot;wen\\&quot; to find out that you just have to use a lot of product to get a good result.</li>
            <li> Why people spend so much money when theres much cheaper products with the same result, is beyond me :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen other reviews where folks don&#x27;t think the product cleanses well, and I&#x27;ve experienced that, too, but only when I don&#x27;t follow the instructions to take the time to really scrub my scalp and comb the product through my hair.</li>
            <li> I can blow dry my hair on the lowest setting and I feel like I&#x27;ve got healthy hair again.  </li>
            <li> so I was looking for a gentle shampoo and considered trying the WEN brand.</li>
            <li> Is there really even a Lisa Rachel product or is it really Hair One?  </li>
            <li> Wish they would consider selling it in Aus, tried hair one and didnt like it as much because it made my scalp very itchy.</li>
            <li> Oh, and a side note, it really didn&#x27;t do much to improve the condition of the hair that it didn&#x27;t cause to fall out.</li>
            <li> I also find that I am not using as much of this as I did with WEN.</li>
            <li> For the first time I feel I have normal hair</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> It has made it so much easier to come my hair after washing it.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a highter rating, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> That makes washing my hair more of ritual over the usual 2 seconds of scrubbing, rinsing, conditioning, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry, fine, curly hair and</li>
            <li> I work out and use alot of oil based products like joboba oil, sweet almond oil on a regular basis, so I need a cleanser that cleans, but does not strip my hair.</li>
            <li> let it stay in for about 3 min rinse and add just a little more and really scrub my scalp and hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may just be my particular scalp issues, but this one just wont&#x27; work for me...</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;m a big enough person to admit a &amp;#34;boo boo&amp;#34;....</li>
            <li> I really like how it smells and my hair feels soft and silky!</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend people try Lisa Rachel.</li>
            <li> My curls came out okay, but I did think my hair looked a little duller than it had using the Pantene..</li>
            <li> and I see more of my little coilies and curls popping out everywhere.</li>
            <li> This has absolutely zero difference as far as effectiveness, than Wen.</li>
            <li> Product works okay, but it takes a long time to do your hair when you follow the instructions on the back.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, just below my shoulders, and just starting to have a few grays here and there, so that hair is more coarse.  </li>
            <li> But when It dried, it actually left kind of a film on my hair and hands.  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> It works just as well, if not better than the Wen product and is much more affordable.</li>
            <li> Exactly the same thing happened with this product!</li>
            <li> I gave this a shot and WOW!</li>
            <li> , my hair isnt even fully natural and its all curly!</li>
            <li> It leave my hair soft, however I still use a little regualr shampoo to really get my hair clean</li>
            <li> My hair right now feels dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine and to use shampoo/conditioner leaves it too limp.  </li>
            <li> My hair is slightly softer, especially right after washing, but even with following the instructions to a T, it was definitely not a mind blowing experience.</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive scalp</li>
            <li> Unfortunatley, when I tried this one, whole different story..</li>
            <li> Made my hair too soft.</li>
            <li> It works, but, no where near my WEN...</li>
            <li> I would buy again and it leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I let my 7 yr old daughter have it</li>
            <li> It left my hair very silky.</li>
            <li> my hair still needed conditioner to make it soft with out conditioner it is all dryed out</li>
            <li> It comes out soft and managable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying quite a few brands of the cleansing conditioners like Wen, only at a better price, to see how I like them..</li>
            <li> With Wen, I tried many different formulas based on Wen&#x27;s recommendations, I found I had to also use a heavy conditioner after using Wen and</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first but worked great and much less than Wen.</li>
            <li> I have Black (of African descent) virgin hair and it leaves it manageable, clean and soft!!</li>
            <li> Lisa Rachel is less expensive and does the same wonderful thing for the texture of my hair, but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> If you wash your hair everyday this product is fine, but if like me you wash your hair every third day than I would not recommend this particular&lt;br /&gt;cleanser with olive oil.  </li>
            <li> My hair has a really glossy shine to it and the dry ends improved dramatically.  </li>
            <li> The pump barely dispenses the product.  </li>
            <li> Any product that says &amp;#34;the more you use the better!!&amp;#34; on the bottle is frustrating.</li>
            <li> Price was a little high but figured it was highly recommended I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, unfortunately we dont have any products like this in Australia and my hair absolutely hates traditional foamy shampoos and using the no poo method still doesnt have the same results as using a cleansing conditioner.</li>
            <li> This product has made my hair normal, its normally very dry, frizzy and unmanagable, highly recommend to anyone who has dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> The other product that I used before was very pricey.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a gentle shampoo for weak, damaged or dry hair.</li>
            <li> (I normally wash it every other day).  </li>
            <li> I came across Lisa Rachel, I saw some bad and some good reviews.  </li>
            <li> only downside is the size, as i have very long hair, so a bottle does not last me very long.</li>
            <li> I am black and combing my hair after washing (since I have gone natural) can be a chore.  </li>
            <li> after using it per the directions, this product left my hair dry, stringy and tangled.</li>
            <li> I have long thick frizzy hair and my hair was so heavy and weighed down after using and it actually seemed more brittle than it was before.</li>
            <li> It is not a normal shedding process, it will only continue.</li>
            <li> Since it is sulfate free, it doesn&#x27;t make suds, so it is difficult to work into your hair.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t long until I was a WEN addict.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> The only down side is that I wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> but it is extremely fine so it can be hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my already limp tresses whilst doing the job of giving it some moisture.</li>
            <li> I have african american tight kinky hair, so I need a product that cleanses and moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Now, if I&#x27;m a little short of money, I don&#x27;t have to worry about going back to my birds nest until I can order my WEN!  </li>
            <li> I bought this with the highest hopes that it would help out with my dry, damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Had to literally turn it upside down and let it eventually come out and into an open container that I can then access the product from.  </li>
            <li> Even after removing the top and trying to squeeze the product from the bottle, it was almost impossible.  </li>
            <li> Works well on my hair which is very dry.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because when I received my last order one bottle was not full</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful with shampoos/conditioners..</li>
            <li> I wet my head use up to 40 pumps of this work it up like a shampoo</li>
            <li> I am a previous Wen user and after getting tired of paying so much for the Wen cleansing conditioner, I decided to give Lisa Rachel a try.</li>
            <li> Not good for naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I put it on, rubbed it in, let it sit on my hair while I finished my shower, added a little water and continued to rub it into my hair, but it just never really got creamy feeling like the Pantene (and now the Herbal Essence)...</li>
            <li> I feel like I have much less hair loss due to knots after using this for a bit.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was a sucker to think that this product would not do the same thing as WEN, but it does.</li>
            <li> Only negative is that, about 2/3 of the way through the bottle, the pump stopped working.  </li>
            <li> I would be forced to go back to shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My scalp has become less flaky as well.</li>
            <li> my hair was still a mess.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try a paraban/sulfate-free shampoo, but am on a tight budget.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin and dry/damaged from years of dying it blonde, as well as heat styling (blow dryer, straighteners, curling irons, etc.)</li>
            <li> I tried the tea tree oil conditioner and it dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> I tried Wen a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> It requires a 2 minute \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; time and that is very hard if your hands and arms are not very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one did the job just as well, if not better for 1/3 the price.  </li>
            <li> I put it up on a shelf and returned to my usual shampoo/conditioner routine and guess what?</li>
            <li> If this works why try stuff that costs an insane amount more?</li>
            <li> No more friz.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re supposed to use approximately 25 pumps of this each time you wash your hair, which means I blew through half the bottle in about a week.</li>
            <li> My hair felt dirty after cleansing, so I went back to buying anything that promised to mosturize or repair my hair.  </li>
            <li> $10 shampoo could at least come with an operable pump on the dispenser.  </li>
            <li> And it is less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying less expensive alternatives to WEN.  </li>
            <li> I live way up North and the elements here are brutal to the hair.</li>
            <li> Very VERY thick.  </li>
            <li> and I mean A LOT!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, especially for an expensive item.  </li>
            <li> When i found WEN, I was initially not impressed.  </li>
            <li> I was trying to find something cheaper, since Wen is so expensive.  </li>
            <li> Sorry WEN, but our time together has come to an end.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> It was also too expensive.  </li>
            <li> If you purchase it and notice dramatic hair loss, RETURN IT!</li>
            <li> and it gets all the crazy knotts out of my curly frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> It was very difficult to get the rest out because of its thickness.  </li>
            <li> But the hassle of returning it is annoying</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This has absolutely zero difference as far as effectiveness, than Wen. Why people spend so much money when theres much cheaper products with the same result, is beyond me :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying quite a few brands of the cleansing conditioners like Wen, only at a better price, to see how I like them.. I started out using Pantene&#x27;s for 2 months, which I really liked. When it was gone, I started using this one.. I have a sensitive scalp so I have to be careful with shampoos/conditioners.. but I was very pleased to discover Pantene did not bother me at all... Unfortunatley, when I tried this one, whole different story.. My head itched and I realized I had dandruff flakes!! I&#x27;ve never had dandruff in my life!!!! I used it for a week, same itchy, flaky scalp condition, so I&#x27;ve moved on to Herbal Essence cleasning conditioner..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may just be my particular scalp issues, but this one just wont&#x27; work for me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells okay..actually, doesn&#x27;t have a lot of smell to it.. It didn&#x27;t clean quite like the Pantene in that it isn&#x27;t as creamy.. I put it on, rubbed it in, let it sit on my hair while I finished my shower, added a little water and continued to rub it into my hair, but it just never really got creamy feeling like the Pantene (and now the Herbal Essence)... My hair looked okay after using it.. I have gray, curly hair that&#x27;s shoulder length.. My curls came out okay, but I did think my hair looked a little duller than it had using the Pantene.. And of course, the itchyness makes me suspect there may be sulpher in this??? It&#x27;s only my guess, but I just know something in it was causing itchy, flacky scalp syndrom!</li>
            <li> OK, I&#x27;m a big enough person to admit a &amp;#34;boo boo&amp;#34;....I tried this again and followed the directions EXACTLY, this time and I have to say that my hair looks pretty darned good! :-)  My hair has a really glossy shine to it and the dry ends improved dramatically.  Looking forward to seeing how much more hair can improve with each use. :-)</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the fragrance, but not bad. Works well on my hair which is very dry. Try it.</li>
            <li> Not good for naturally curly hair.  Made my hair too soft.</li>
            <li> I love it, it works so well in my hair and it smells good (to me at least). I&#x27;d definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> This product did not work out for me at all. I have long thick frizzy hair and my hair was so heavy and weighed down after using and it actually seemed more brittle than it was before. I don&#x27;t think I will use it again even though the bottle is still amost full. It basically felt like I washed my hair with hand lotion.</li>
            <li> I am a WEN user for about a year now, and I love the product.  My hair is thin and dry/damaged from years of dying it blonde, as well as heat styling (blow dryer, straighteners, curling irons, etc.) When i found WEN, I was initially not impressed.  My hair felt dirty after cleansing, so I went back to buying anything that promised to mosturize or repair my hair.  Nothing worked. Most of the time, my hair looked like a birds nest.  Then, after watching a presentation on QVC of WEN cleansing conditioner, I decided that I was not using it correctly, and tried again.  WOW!  What a difference!  my hair was soft, untangled, smooth and mosturized! it wasn&#x27;t long until I was a WEN addict.  My problem is that there is nowhere that you can walk in and buy it, and honestly, sometimes I just couldn&#x27;t afford the $ to buy it.  I would be forced to go back to shampoo and conditioner.  Soooo...after doing some research online, I decided to try \\&quot;hair one\\&quot;, who most claim works \\&quot;just as well\\&quot;.  So, I tried it.  It works, but, no where near my WEN...then I discovered Lisa Rachel conditioner, which I  decided to try as well.  This one is a close second to WEN, and in my opinion, is able to do what shampoo and conditioners don&#x27;t. I now keep Lisa Rachel around and switch up often with my WEN.  Sometimes, I will even mix them!  Now, if I&#x27;m a little short of money, I don&#x27;t have to worry about going back to my birds nest until I can order my WEN!  If you have been wanting to try WEN or if WEN is just not affordable for you, try this...but, make sure you follow the directions on the bottle!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Skeptical at first but worked great and much less than Wen.</li>
            <li> Very VERY thick.  The pump barely dispenses the product.  Even after removing the top and trying to squeeze the product from the bottle, it was almost impossible.  Had to literally turn it upside down and let it eventually come out and into an open container that I can then access the product from.  Other than the impossibility of using it as packaged, the product itself does a wonderful job and makes a noticeable difference on my hair.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li> So I tried Wen, and I LOVE it!  I was trying to find something cheaper, since Wen is so expensive.  I came across Lisa Rachel, I saw some bad and some good reviews.  I figured I would just try it for myself.  Well, at first, when my hair was wet, I kind of liked it...it smelled pretty good, and made my hair tangle free.  But when It dried, it actually left kind of a film on my hair and hands.  Wen doesn&#x27;t do that...it&#x27;s more of a clean feel.  My hair right now feels dry.  I really don&#x27;t like this product, but it is better than normal shampoo and conditioner.  (except Herbal Essence sulfate free conditioner...lol...that&#x27;s what I used to use before Wen)  But anyways, my husband and my kids will be using this, my hubby likes it, I guess I will just pay the money for Wen.</li>
            <li> My hair gets damaged easily so I was looking for a gentle shampoo and considered trying the WEN brand. Seeing the comparision(s) to WEN here I decided to give this one a shot because this one was more affordable.  It&#x27;s my first sulfate-free shmapoo and I&#x27;m now a huge fan. I have Black (of African descent) virgin hair and it leaves it manageable, clean and soft!! It&#x27;s definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re looking for a gentle shampoo for weak, damaged or dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and its a great shampoo and condition when traveling that way you don&#x27;t have to carry two different bottles of shampoo and cream rinse.  Price was a little high but figured it was highly recommended I would give it a try.  I would buy again and it leaves hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife and she loves it. We have purchased this product before and my wife won&#x27;t buy anything else</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves thinner hair feeling really healthy and nourished. We&#x27;re repeat customers on this one.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd bottle of this item that I have purchased, and the 2nd time the pump just quit.  That&#x27;s the reason this is the LAST bottle I buy.  Very disappointing, especially for an expensive item.  $10 shampoo could at least come with an operable pump on the dispenser.  The shampoo is good, but I don&#x27;t need the irritation of a faulty dispenser.</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m a Wen Girl...  This product is pretty darn close!  And it is less expensive.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t as enticing as the Wen, but it is pleasant.  The manageability of your hair isn&#x27;t as good, I have fly-aways with this.  But it cleans, conditions and softens just as well as the Wen.  And it costs a third of what Wen does!  Yes, I will buy this again and again, but I&#x27;ll keep a jar of the Wen for weekly luxury!  :)</li>
            <li> I love wen but this is a close second. Not bad for the price and it gets all the crazy knotts out of my curly frizzy hair. This is now the fourth bottle I&#x27;ve ordered. I gave it 3 stars because when I received my last order one bottle was not full it was pretty close to being 1/2-3/4 full. But the hassle of returning it is annoying so I&#x27;ll use what I did receive; however I may search out a different product.</li>
            <li> I have no idea if Lisa Rachel is any good since the product we received was Hair One.  Is there really even a Lisa Rachel product or is it really Hair One?  Maybe it was the seller of this product that did the swap without any explanation.</li>
            <li> Ordered Lisa Rachel Olive Oil &amp; Aloe - received an off brand - not happy.&lt;br /&gt;Still waiting for Lisa Rachel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> It leave my hair soft, however I still use a little regualr shampoo to really get my hair clean</li>
            <li> makes my hair feel soft, easy to use, no harsh ingredients, the smell is decent, but could be better, wish I could buy abigger botttle</li>
            <li> If you wash your hair everyday this product is fine, but if like me you wash your hair every third day than I would not recommend this particular&lt;br /&gt;cleanser with olive oil.  It made my bangs greasy looking and feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pris</li>
            <li> OK if use wen  this one is pretty good  when it comes to living  works similar not quite as good  but smells much better. I let my 7 yr old daughter have it she loves it  my hair is just to damaged  and wen works better for me. But this is a good product.</li>
            <li> I am so frugal and wanted to save money. This is supposed to work like Wen, but there is no comparison. Don&#x27;t even bother. I just sucked it up and bought a huge bottle of Wen.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioning cleanser.  My hair is fine and to use shampoo/conditioner leaves it too limp.  It cleans my hair and conditions it all at the same time!</li>
            <li> I like this product, I love the smell and overall performance of this product, but I DO wish it detangled more. I have afro-kinky hair and I see more of my little coilies and curls popping out everywhere. My scalp has become less flaky as well. My hair is also retaining moisture like never before. I can&#x27;t compare this to Wen yet, but I DO think it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- ultimately, the lack of slip resulted in dreaded hair. I tried combing this stuff through and I would lose quite a bit of hair. I DID get my Wen and all I&#x27;ll say is that the two are NOT the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying less expensive alternatives to WEN.  This one did the job just as well, if not better for 1/3 the price.  It left my hair very silky.</li>
            <li> I am a previous Wen user and after getting tired of paying so much for the Wen cleansing conditioner, I decided to give Lisa Rachel a try. It works just as well, if not better than the Wen product and is much more affordable. The only down side is that I wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it was like wen my hair still needed conditioner to make it soft with out conditioner it is all dryed out</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> I have never used WEN products so I can&#x27;t compare. But I love this product, specifically the olive oil &amp; aloe conditoner. I tried the tea tree oil conditioner and it dried my hair out. I have african american tight kinky hair, so I need a product that cleanses and moisturizes. I work out and use alot of oil based products like joboba oil, sweet almond oil on a regular basis, so I need a cleanser that cleans, but does not strip my hair. My advice is: read the directions on the bottle. I HIGHLY recommend people try Lisa Rachel. I know this is more affordable than WEN.</li>
            <li> I love this product, unfortunately we dont have any products like this in Australia and my hair absolutely hates traditional foamy shampoos and using the no poo method still doesnt have the same results as using a cleansing conditioner. I love the Lisa Rachel line and will be ordering more. Wish they would consider selling it in Aus, tried hair one and didnt like it as much because it made my scalp very itchy. This product has made my hair normal, its normally very dry, frizzy and unmanagable, highly recommend to anyone who has dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the highest hopes that it would help out with my dry, damaged hair. I have a lot of hair but it is extremely fine so it can be hard to find a product that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my already limp tresses whilst doing the job of giving it some moisture. I have tried SO many products, it seems just about everything out there. Yes, I tried WEN and was excited to get started using it. However, with my very first use I noticed a lot of hair coming out of my head in the shower and I mean A LOT! It freaked me out but thought since I hadn&#x27;t washed in a couple days that may be the reason or heck maybe I was going through a &amp;#34;shedding&amp;#34; period. Anyway, I used it again with the next wash and the same thing happened. What the what? I put it up on a shelf and returned to my usual shampoo/conditioner routine and guess what? No insane clumps of hair falling out. About a month later I thought I&#x27;d give it another try and tons of hair loss again. That was the end of WEN for me. Even after this experience, I still really liked the idea of using a conditioning cleanser to lessen damage on my hair so I thought I would give Lisa Rachel a try. Exactly the same thing happened with this product! Tons of hair loss in the shower, like enough to clog the drain. I don&#x27;t know what is in this product that causes this to happen but after doing research online, I can tell you that I am not alone. There are many, many people with complaints about WEN, Lisa Rachel and Hair One all causing their hair to come out in huge amounts. Maybe I was a sucker to think that this product would not do the same thing as WEN, but it does. Learn from my mistake. Oh, and a side note, it really didn&#x27;t do much to improve the condition of the hair that it didn&#x27;t cause to fall out. I&#x27;m happy that for some this product seems to &amp;#34;work miracles&amp;#34; but it does not do this for all. If you purchase it and notice dramatic hair loss, RETURN IT! It is not a normal shedding process, it will only continue. Isay this from personal experience as well as those of others that have actually filed formal complaints and lobbied to get a hair loss warning label put on these products. Buyer Beware!</li>
            <li> Used Wen for 3 years. Yes it&#x27;s good product, but pricey. I gave this a shot and WOW! I live way up North and the elements here are brutal to the hair. I am blond, 40, and get salon coloring. This gets out product build-up, conditions scalp well, and leaves my hair shiny bouncy and frizz-free, as I also have curly hair. I love the smell better than WEN and the price is right. I also find that I am not using as much of this as I did with WEN. I will buy again. Sorry WEN, but our time together has come to an end.</li>
            <li> This Shampoo &amp; Conditioner is amazing.  Better than Wen.  I have really dry, fine, curly hair and this product tames the monster. With Wen, I tried many different formulas based on Wen&#x27;s recommendations, I found I had to also use a heavy conditioner after using Wen and my hair was still a mess.  With Lisa Rachel Olive Oil &amp; Aloe, that&#x27;s it.  No extra conditioner this product tames my horrid hair.  Soft, touchable, I can style it, great movement when I shake my head, if the wind blows my hair falls back where it should, if the weather drizzles I don&#x27;t have a fuzz ball for hair (my hair soaks up the Olive Oil &amp; Aloe and there is no room for the atmospheric moisture).  For the first time I feel I have normal hair (well, actually tamed hair).  I love this product!</li>
            <li> I have thinning fine gray hair,. I wet my head use up to 40 pumps of this work it up like a shampoo let it stay in for about 3 min rinse and add just a little more and really scrub my scalp and hair. It comes out soft and managable.</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair soft with a beautiful sheen.  I really like it.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff. Both my husband and I use it and we have different hair types. I feel like I have much less hair loss due to knots after using this for a bit. I have super curly hard to manage hair, but I feel like it&#x27;s been great since I switched to this. I have tried other cleansing conditioners, but this seems to feel the cleanest and best to my hair/scalp. The price is good too - I haven&#x27;t tried the $40 bottles as of yet. If this works why try stuff that costs an insane amount more?</li>
            <li> Product works okay, but it takes a long time to do your hair when you follow the instructions on the back. So, make sure you have about an hour to spend washing your hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, you end up having to use about 20 pumps of the product if your hair is shoulder length or longer. Since it is sulfate free, it doesn&#x27;t make suds, so it is difficult to work into your hair. It requires a 2 minute \\&quot;scrubbing\\&quot; time and that is very hard if your hands and arms are not very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I could get the same result using a leave-in conditioner like \\&quot;Aussie&#x27;s 3-minute miracle\\&quot;, without all of the extra work and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy this again and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy the expensive versions like \\&quot;ovations\\&quot; or \\&quot;wen\\&quot; to find out that you just have to use a lot of product to get a good result.</li>
            <li> Any product that says &amp;#34;the more you use the better!!&amp;#34; on the bottle is frustrating. You&#x27;re supposed to use approximately 25 pumps of this each time you wash your hair, which means I blew through half the bottle in about a week. I also didn&#x27;t notice anything different enough in my hair to justify continuing to use it every day, which I&#x27;m pretty sure defeats the purpose of the product.</li>
            <li> Sorry but this stuff isn&#x27;t any better than Hair One...Wen for me is waay better therefore worth the higher prices.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to give a highter rating, but so far so good. I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> My hair is slightly softer, especially right after washing, but even with following the instructions to a T, it was definitely not a mind blowing experience.</li>
            <li> I tried Wen a few years ago.  Loved how my hair felt, but it got so greasy so fast that I had to wash my hair every day (I normally wash it every other day).  It was also too expensive.  Lisa Rachel is less expensive and does the same wonderful thing for the texture of my hair, but doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling greasy.  I&#x27;ve been able to go two or even three days before washing it.  My best friend of over 20 years  recently said my hair looks better than it ever has. I would have to agree.  No more friz. Better control than I have ever had.  Only negative is that, about 2/3 of the way through the bottle, the pump stopped working.  It was very difficult to get the rest out because of its thickness.  Would love to see them use a different container. I&#x27;m reordering as soon as I finish this review.</li>
            <li> I love this.  It has made it so much easier to come my hair after washing it.  I can see the bit difference since I start using this.  I am black and combing my hair after washing (since I have gone natural) can be a chore.  But since I start using this, it goes through with no problem.  I am sold.</li>
            <li> Really good for the price. The other product that I used before was very pricey. I like this better.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Great Buy, Great Seller, Thank You,</li>
            <li> I have never used wen but I have used salon grafix from Walmart but I didn&#x27;t exactly like the way it&#x27;s smelled. I just bought this product at my local Ross for $6 and I have only used it once but so far it&#x27;s pretty awesome. I really like how it smells and my hair feels soft and silky! Hopefully my hat won&#x27;t look oily in the morning! If it doesn&#x27;t I&#x27;m going back and buying every bottle left lol!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioning wash my hair feels soft and clean . Will buy it again</li>
            <li> great product, will be purchasing more!! does not leave hair feeling greasy (like some of these types of products do). only downside is the size, as i have very long hair, so a bottle does not last me very long. i use this product for 2 days, then will use a shampoo/deep conditioner on the third day. hair is very, very healthy; despite constant hair dye jobs!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a paraban/sulfate-free shampoo, but am on a tight budget.  I tried Lisa Rachel and Hair One.  At first I thought they were identical products, but after using them both, the Lisa Rachel product is definitely superior.  It leaves my hair shiny, soft, and feeling healthy.  I do not have to use a hot iron any more after every shampoo.  I can blow dry my hair on the lowest setting and I feel like I&#x27;ve got healthy hair again.  My hair is fine, just below my shoulders, and just starting to have a few grays here and there, so that hair is more coarse.  I definitely had to learn to follow the directions just as they read and I do use what seems like a lot.  That makes washing my hair more of ritual over the usual 2 seconds of scrubbing, rinsing, conditioning, but it&#x27;s well worth it.  I don&#x27;t do the cleansing drill every day.  I do like to have fresh hair out of the shower, but can get by with a good solid rinse followed by combing  the cleanser through my hair rather than doing the cleansing/conditioning ritual daily.  I&#x27;ve seen other reviews where folks don&#x27;t think the product cleanses well, and I&#x27;ve experienced that, too, but only when I don&#x27;t follow the instructions to take the time to really scrub my scalp and comb the product through my hair.</li>
            <li> I like this, but the price isn&#x27;t really all that great in comparison to WEN.  WEN by far is best, so I will stay with that brand.</li>
            <li> I am very unsure if most of these reviews are real.. after using it per the directions, this product left my hair dry, stringy and tangled. I was so thankful to have a great conditioner to help repair it, but I definitely will be returning this product. I&#x27;ve never tried WEN, but if this is better, then I don&#x27;t want to!</li>
            <li> I have found that this works well as an in between or a rinse to your shampoo-conditioner, stand alone, or best of all, beach/pool companion!</li>
            <li> So I dont know where to start..... I love it! I am transitioning and I have beautiful 3B type hair and this product just brought out my curl pattern so well, my hair isnt even fully natural and its all curly! I just love it. And I really like the way it cleans and contitions! I sooo recommend this product! Lisa Rachel is Great!</li>
