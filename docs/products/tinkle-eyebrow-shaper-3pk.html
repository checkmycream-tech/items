    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was so happy when I found these on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>So great!</li>
            <li>Just one word...&#x27;awesome&#x27;!!</li>
            <li>I bought these two years ago and I&#x27;m still very happy with them.</li>
            <li>They work great!!</li>
            <li>Best on the market as the clip advertised.</li>
            <li>One of the best things I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>but while some do work perfectly, others don&#x27;t work at all; you never know what you&#x27;re going to get from these.  </li>
            <li>Sephora carries an excellent eyebrow shaver but it costs close to 15 bucks!!</li>
            <li>This is the best!  </li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price too.</li>
            <li>awesome!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
            <li>Very good pricing</li>
            <li>Incredibly flimsy and wouldn&#x27;t shave off any hair, regardless of what direction I tried.</li>
            <li>Great shaper - great price!!</li>
            <li>They are good, yes!</li>
            <li>This is a great product but</li>

            <li>These work great.</li>

            <li>but the price of the razors are great and convenient.</li>

            <li>I really love the razors (not the brand name) and they are great!</li>
            <li>they are good...</li>
            <li>This is a good product to helping to keep your eye brows shaped correctly.</li>
            <li>It is good but doesn&#x27;t cut how I hoped.</li>
            <li>It still does a good job.</li>
            <li>I really good price.</li>
            <li>Each razor lasts a good while so</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>This product works perfectly and I love how easy they are to use.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and was very gentle and it removed all the hair perfectly.</li>

            <li>and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>I would recommend The Tinkle eyebrow shaper for more than just eyebrows!</li>
            <li>Will buy more from Amazon at that price!  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great and easy to use and they won&#x27;t cut your skin.</li>
            <li>These are really good, not dull at all and get the job done perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great price for the 3 pack and the product isn&#x27;t cheap like the ones in the hair stores.</li>
            <li>Amazing for shaving the peach fuzz off your face and maintaining your brows between trips to the spa.</li>
            <li>Nervous to buy in bulk because I don&#x27;t know which kind</li>
            <li>and she liked them to get the hairs off her face</li>
            <li>BUT it works SO well to get rid of peach fuzz kind of hair.</li>
            <li>Tried them, I liked them</li>
            <li>it has nice</li>
            <li>These are great to shape brows and clean up hair around the face.</li>
            <li>Cheap and effective!</li>
            <li>They arrived really quickly and work great.</li>
            <li>These work ok but break very easily.</li>
            <li>in mind that they are disposable so they are good for 6-12 full uses</li>
            <li>These shapers made the arch very precise.</li>
            <li>Great item but kind of high, plus shipping cost more than the itwm</li>
            <li>Thank you. :)</li>
            <li>My favorite eyebrow tool.</li>
            <li>and I love using tinkle razors to get in there and get the job done.  </li>
            <li>This is nothing more than a razor in a colored plastic handle.</li>
            <li>Our daughters love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>The others don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;ll be much more resilient.</li>
            <li>love them.  </li>
            <li>,I&#x27;m glad they came in a set of 3.</li>
            <li>And I love them.</li>
            <li>I just love these eyebrow razors.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>These are awesome, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>had to buy more than one pack because it&#x27;s an &amp;#</li>
            <li>You get a cleaner more defined line than with tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>These do an okay job.  </li>
            <li>and I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>even watched a youtube video to make sure I was using it correctly.</li>
            <li>Fabulous!</li>
            <li>I did, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>love this thing.</li>
            <li>i love these and will be buying more.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>leaving a lot more than it took off.</li>
            <li>but maybe I need more practice</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have found this product.</li>
            <li>Came just in-time to shape-up my lovely eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Great company, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>My wife loved them at first, no cuts and a close shave.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for any fine facial hair.</li>
            <li>They are only good for a couple of uses, but do a good job.</li>
            <li>I just received this product Sunday and it has been great so far!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try these, especially with the great reviews!</li>
            <li>I am so in love with these and this is also great for the brows and any unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>The length of this shaper is perfect for creating the natural looking straight eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I still think, many months later, that they are a great product.</li>
            <li>Easily and painlessly removed peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and works great!</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>These seem to work fine.</li>
            <li>They work fine for me.</li>
            <li>Received quickly!</li>
            <li>They are quick and they don&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li>The best part is that you can just put one in your purse for those little emergencies.</li>
            <li>However, these were a HUGE improvement over the others I ordered.</li>
            <li>these are great for removing unwanted hair, especially facial hair.</li>
            <li>They are also great for upper lip too!  </li>
            <li>The package arrived promptly and was wrapped securely for mailing.</li>
            <li>34;add-on&amp;#34; product... cheap gimmic as well as a cheap product.....</li>
            <li>look like cheap item from the dollar store.</li>
            <li>and my facialist confirmed shaving the face causes it to break out.</li>
            <li>I did not have any issues with the shipping, and the transaction went smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and don&#x27;t cut at all.</li>
            <li>you brush the razor against your face lightly and it miraculously removes unwanted peach fuzz, side burns, moustache, etc.  </li>
            <li>Yes the product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re perfect for detailed hair removal in various areas of the body without too much irritation.</li>
            <li>understand that they don&#x27;t want you to slice open your face, but honestly this should be a \\&quot;use at your own risk\\&quot; product with no protective</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on smooth and you look fresh faced!</li>
            <li>It is easy to control and quick to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are excellent razors that are small and inconspicuous.</li>
            <li>Use it on facial hair and more! :)</li>
            <li>Was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I found the blades dulled fairly quickly but they were so cheap it didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>this brand is the best that I have come across so far for removing facial hair.  </li>
            <li>feel very save when using and it is shave very smooth</li>
            <li>The blades on these shapers are too large for me to use confidently.</li>
            <li>Once you get used to using these you&#x27;ll really get better shaped eyebrows than you could with tweezers.</li>
            <li>Not too sharp which is great since I use it to shave my face.</li>
            <li>This works great for both eyebrows and shaving other areas around the face,  and the neck.</li>
            <li>Be sure to buy several packs and hand out to your girlfriends, they will love you.  </li>
            <li>I also shape my eyebrows quickly.</li>
            <li>I love these razors and actually need to get more.</li>
            <li>I ordered two packages and two broke on the very first use.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty cheap and it works.  </li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t been able to get this item to work at all.  </li>
            <li>Cheap and not really for real eye brows, good luck</li>
            <li>I literally just threw them away because it wasn&#x27;t even worth the effort to return them.</li>
            <li>For the price though, it&#x27;s still worth the gamble to me.</li>
            <li>This is a highly effective and simple tool to use.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your 3 dollars on it, you would be better of buying a lotto ticket with the money.  </li>
            <li>cheap cap doesn&#x27;t fit, not nearly as sharp....</li>
            <li>I have the right angle when I shave my face, and I have even tried doing it after a shower to make my skin softer.</li>
            <li>I anticipate it&#x27;ll be another two years before I need to buy new ones, easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fun and easy to use and the hair just falls right off, leaving me with a soft complexion.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it would work on thicker hair, but on my fine facial hair it worked fine.</li>
            <li>this is a good facila hair trimmer but as far as eyebrow concerned its razor a little large than it should be ,,which makes eybrow shaping a risky job ,, but if someone wants it for other areas on face then its perfect ..</li>
            <li>Many good YouTube videos on how to use these for your eyebrows and other facial hair.</li>
            <li>The slightly bigger size is nice, however the blade is very inconsistent.</li>
            <li>Ive purchased quite a few brands in search for the best facial razor..  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, haha not much else to say</li>
            <li>It arrived very fast.</li>
            <li>I havent used it very much</li>
            <li>We will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>I really like them worth the price.</li>
            <li>First they are sharper.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that it works great to exfoliate my skin cells, but doesn&#x27;t do much to get rid of tiny blonde hairs on my cheeks or hairline.</li>
            <li>: I finally had to order more of these.</li>
            <li>They are the first eyebrow shapers I&#x27;ve ever bought, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare them with.</li>
            <li>I guess if you want to scrape some dead skin cells off your face they&#x27;d be good for that.</li>
            <li>Also Flamingo has a few good eyebrow razors.</li>
            <li>It is simple and clean and well worth the price .!</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t last very long, but otherwise it&#x27;s been great</li>
            <li>Love these, easy to use and very sharp!</li>
            <li>Good, cheap basic facial razor, but no better then the kind you can get from the dollar store.</li>
            <li>shaper also trim my facial hair and works very well without cutting (of course, don&#x27;t press the razor too hard).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product and great price.</li>
            <li>the other one worked nicely for a coupe of weeks until it dulled out.</li>
            <li>They have a stainless steel cover that is permanently glued over the top of the actual razor, making them dull.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>These are pretty much you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li>It is a good purchase, and seems to last long.  </li>
            <li>The angles tip makes it easy to work with and the blade is large enough to do any job you need</li>
            <li>But they are great in removing facial hair on the lower half of my face.</li>
            <li>They made my face nice and smooth, and the hair hasn&#x27;t grown back abnormally thick or quickly.</li>
            <li>They are a fast and precise way to get rid of hairs which are outside the shape we are creating.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C89J96/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 I really advise not buying from that page.  </li>
            <li>These did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt or leave any marks, and it makes the skin really smooth after you get rid of the tiny hairs.</li>
            <li>Which of course creates too much friction and damages the skin.</li>
            <li>Gentle on the skin with no irritation.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Definitely a must have for women who want a baby smooth face.</li>
            <li>These work so much better than any other eyebrow shapers I have ever used .</li>
            <li>Better than some of the other Razors I bought</li>
            <li>Odd name, but the best little beauty tool around!!</li>
            <li>I feel like they are too long to accurately shape my brows, so I don&#x27;t use them for that.</li>
            <li>These little razors are pretty and easy to hold</li>
            <li>But, the razors on this listing I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They are made cheap and not high quality.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this</li>
            <li>I really love these little guys.</li>
            <li>What can I say, I love these little gems.  </li>
            <li>so it feels a little like its dragging, but for the most part it does what it is meant for</li>
            <li>sharp and easy to use  has plasticprotective cap for wach razor.</li>
            <li>the blade is just a little too long to really do a good job on eyebrows.</li>
            <li>They work just fine but seem to dull quickly, like after one or two uses.</li>
            <li>the noxema brand i normally buy.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed these the first time I used them because it did remove hair but after a couple uses on my cheeks/ upper lip I started getting little flesh colored bumps</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t create new hair grown at all.</li>
            <li>Next time I will order the large pkg.!</li>
            <li>I really like this eyebrow razor because it works really well, however, my second razor broke like nothing.</li>
            <li>Gets rid of facial hair fast and is much easier to trim your eyebrows with this than tweezers.</li>
            <li>I love this little tool and use it once a week!</li>
            <li>and my face is actually very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>and wow!</li>
            <li>They make your skin feel so soft afterwards!</li>
            <li>and cheaply made wont even shave peach fuzz much less anything else.</li>
            <li>first one I got out of the package broke in half on the first use.</li>
            <li>Little slow on shipping, but a great product</li>
            <li>I used to find them at the Korean market by my old house, but since I moved, there is no where by me that sells them.  </li>
            <li>I had no trouble with these.</li>
            <li>thus far</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and waxing irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li>i use this on my face &amp; neck (below the cheekbones only) thanks to a Michelle Money video on youtube.  </li>
            <li>It saves me so much money for facial waxing.</li>
            <li>She loved it, and certainly got results, so maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but it&#x27;s not working for me!</li>
            <li>Its not a sharp razor at all!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a white 20 year old female with with darker hair, particularly the mustache area and sideburns.</li>
            <li>I used one of them for the first time the other night on some peach fuzz and can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>This is my second time I&#x27;ve purchased these eyebrow razors, and so far no complaints!</li>
            <li>so glad i changed it to one because they do not work, very dull and they need to stop selling them.</li>
            <li>It removes all the little hairs from your face is a non-invasive way so that you have a fresh canvas for your makeup.</li>
            <li>but they were so huge making it hard to do my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>The packages look the same, and the razors themselves look nearly identical.</li>
            <li>The reason is the blade isn&#x27;t sharp enough so that one has to scrape the fine hair off one&#x27;s face or any other body part.</li>
            <li>They hurt..... not real sharp....</li>
            <li>zit left my skin soft and not stubbly, red, or irritated.</li>
            <li>The blade is quiet wide and it only works in a certain angle</li>
            <li>I probably &amp;#34;tinkle&amp;#34; once every 10 days or so and the blades stay sharp for a long time (I&#x27;m still on my first one after 3 months).</li>
            <li>but I find it very difficult to actually use in that they are so similar to a straight razor that it is very easy to cut oneself.</li>
            <li>This little facial shavers do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to, shave a woman&#x27;s baby hairs on her face.</li>
            <li>I was a little leary at first, as I didn&#x27;t want to shave and have the hair come back in darker or thicker.</li>
            <li>They also get dull quickly</li>
            <li>highly recommended if you like clean brows and dont mind the shaved look or if u hate the pain of shaving! :)</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I was so happy when I found these on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> So great!</li>
            <li> Just one word...&#x27;awesome&#x27;!!</li>
            <li> I bought these two years ago and I&#x27;m still very happy with them.</li>
            <li> They work great!!</li>
            <li> Best on the market as the clip advertised.</li>
            <li> One of the best things I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> but while some do work perfectly, others don&#x27;t work at all; you never know what you&#x27;re going to get from these.  </li>
            <li> Sephora carries an excellent eyebrow shaver but it costs close to 15 bucks!!</li>
            <li> This is the best!  </li>
            <li> Amazon has the best price too.</li>
            <li> awesome!</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
            <li> Very good pricing</li>
            <li> Incredibly flimsy and wouldn&#x27;t shave off any hair, regardless of what direction I tried.</li>

            <li> They are good, yes!</li>

            <li> I really love the razors (not the brand name) and they are great!</li>
            <li> they are good...</li>
            <li> This is a good product to helping to keep your eye brows shaped correctly.</li>
            <li> It is good but doesn&#x27;t cut how I hoped.</li>
            <li> It still does a good job.</li>
            <li> I really good price.</li>
            <li> Each razor lasts a good while so</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly and I love how easy they are to use.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and was very gentle and it removed all the hair perfectly.</li>

            <li> and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> I would recommend The Tinkle eyebrow shaper for more than just eyebrows!</li>
            <li> Will buy more from Amazon at that price!  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re great and easy to use and they won&#x27;t cut your skin.</li>
            <li> These are really good, not dull at all and get the job done perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great price for the 3 pack and the product isn&#x27;t cheap like the ones in the hair stores.</li>
            <li> Amazing for shaving the peach fuzz off your face and maintaining your brows between trips to the spa.</li>
            <li> Nervous to buy in bulk because I don&#x27;t know which kind</li>
            <li> and she liked them to get the hairs off her face</li>
            <li> BUT it works SO well to get rid of peach fuzz kind of hair.</li>
            <li> Tried them, I liked them</li>
            <li> it has nice</li>
            <li> These are great to shape brows and clean up hair around the face.</li>
            <li> Cheap and effective!</li>
            <li> They arrived really quickly and work great.</li>
            <li> These work ok but break very easily.</li>
            <li> in mind that they are disposable so they are good for 6-12 full uses</li>
            <li> These shapers made the arch very precise.</li>
            <li> Great item but kind of high, plus shipping cost more than the itwm</li>
            <li> Thank you. :)</li>
            <li> My favorite eyebrow tool.</li>
            <li> and I love using tinkle razors to get in there and get the job done.  </li>
            <li> This is nothing more than a razor in a colored plastic handle.</li>
            <li> Our daughters love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> The others don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;ll be much more resilient.</li>
            <li> love them.  </li>
            <li> ,I&#x27;m glad they came in a set of 3.</li>
            <li> And I love them.</li>
            <li> I just love these eyebrow razors.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> These are awesome, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> had to buy more than one pack because it&#x27;s an &amp;#</li>
            <li> You get a cleaner more defined line than with tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> These do an okay job.  </li>
            <li> and I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love them.  </li>
            <li> even watched a youtube video to make sure I was using it correctly.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!</li>
            <li> I did, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> love this thing.</li>
            <li> i love these and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> leaving a lot more than it took off.</li>
            <li> but maybe I need more practice</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have found this product.</li>
            <li> Came just in-time to shape-up my lovely eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Great company, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> My wife loved them at first, no cuts and a close shave.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for any fine facial hair.</li>
            <li> They are only good for a couple of uses, but do a good job.</li>
            <li> I just received this product Sunday and it has been great so far!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these, especially with the great reviews!</li>
            <li> I am so in love with these and this is also great for the brows and any unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> The length of this shaper is perfect for creating the natural looking straight eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I still think, many months later, that they are a great product.</li>
            <li> Easily and painlessly removed peach fuzz.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and works great!</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> These seem to work fine.</li>
            <li> They work fine for me.</li>
            <li> Received quickly!</li>
            <li> They are quick and they don&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> The best part is that you can just put one in your purse for those little emergencies.</li>
            <li> However, these were a HUGE improvement over the others I ordered.</li>
            <li> these are great for removing unwanted hair, especially facial hair.</li>
            <li> They are also great for upper lip too!  </li>
            <li> The package arrived promptly and was wrapped securely for mailing.</li>
            <li> 34;add-on&amp;#34; product... cheap gimmic as well as a cheap product.....</li>
            <li> look like cheap item from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> and my facialist confirmed shaving the face causes it to break out.</li>
            <li> I did not have any issues with the shipping, and the transaction went smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and don&#x27;t cut at all.</li>
            <li> you brush the razor against your face lightly and it miraculously removes unwanted peach fuzz, side burns, moustache, etc.  </li>
            <li> Yes the product is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re perfect for detailed hair removal in various areas of the body without too much irritation.</li>
            <li> understand that they don&#x27;t want you to slice open your face, but honestly this should be a \\&quot;use at your own risk\\&quot; product with no protective</li>
            <li> Makeup goes on smooth and you look fresh faced!</li>
            <li> It is easy to control and quick to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are excellent razors that are small and inconspicuous.</li>
            <li> Use it on facial hair and more! :)</li>
            <li> Was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I found the blades dulled fairly quickly but they were so cheap it didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> this brand is the best that I have come across so far for removing facial hair.  </li>
            <li> feel very save when using and it is shave very smooth</li>
            <li> The blades on these shapers are too large for me to use confidently.</li>
            <li> Once you get used to using these you&#x27;ll really get better shaped eyebrows than you could with tweezers.</li>
            <li> Not too sharp which is great since I use it to shave my face.</li>
            <li> This works great for both eyebrows and shaving other areas around the face,  and the neck.</li>
            <li> Be sure to buy several packs and hand out to your girlfriends, they will love you.  </li>
            <li> I also shape my eyebrows quickly.</li>
            <li> I love these razors and actually need to get more.</li>
            <li> I ordered two packages and two broke on the very first use.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty cheap and it works.  </li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t been able to get this item to work at all.  </li>
            <li> Cheap and not really for real eye brows, good luck</li>
            <li> I literally just threw them away because it wasn&#x27;t even worth the effort to return them.</li>
            <li> For the price though, it&#x27;s still worth the gamble to me.</li>
            <li> This is a highly effective and simple tool to use.  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your 3 dollars on it, you would be better of buying a lotto ticket with the money.  </li>
            <li> cheap cap doesn&#x27;t fit, not nearly as sharp....</li>
            <li> I have the right angle when I shave my face, and I have even tried doing it after a shower to make my skin softer.</li>
            <li> I anticipate it&#x27;ll be another two years before I need to buy new ones, easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fun and easy to use and the hair just falls right off, leaving me with a soft complexion.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it would work on thicker hair, but on my fine facial hair it worked fine.</li>
            <li> this is a good facila hair trimmer but as far as eyebrow concerned its razor a little large than it should be ,,which makes eybrow shaping a risky job ,, but if someone wants it for other areas on face then its perfect ..</li>
            <li> Many good YouTube videos on how to use these for your eyebrows and other facial hair.</li>
            <li> The slightly bigger size is nice, however the blade is very inconsistent.</li>
            <li> Ive purchased quite a few brands in search for the best facial razor..  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, haha not much else to say</li>
            <li> It arrived very fast.</li>
            <li> I havent used it very much</li>
            <li> We will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> I really like them worth the price.</li>
            <li> First they are sharper.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that it works great to exfoliate my skin cells, but doesn&#x27;t do much to get rid of tiny blonde hairs on my cheeks or hairline.</li>
            <li> : I finally had to order more of these.</li>
            <li> They are the first eyebrow shapers I&#x27;ve ever bought, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare them with.</li>
            <li> I guess if you want to scrape some dead skin cells off your face they&#x27;d be good for that.</li>
            <li> Also Flamingo has a few good eyebrow razors.</li>
            <li> It is simple and clean and well worth the price .!</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t last very long, but otherwise it&#x27;s been great</li>
            <li> Love these, easy to use and very sharp!</li>
            <li> Good, cheap basic facial razor, but no better then the kind you can get from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> shaper also trim my facial hair and works very well without cutting (of course, don&#x27;t press the razor too hard).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product and great price.</li>
            <li> the other one worked nicely for a coupe of weeks until it dulled out.</li>
            <li> They have a stainless steel cover that is permanently glued over the top of the actual razor, making them dull.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> These are pretty much you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> It is a good purchase, and seems to last long.  </li>
            <li> The angles tip makes it easy to work with and the blade is large enough to do any job you need</li>
            <li> But they are great in removing facial hair on the lower half of my face.</li>
            <li> They made my face nice and smooth, and the hair hasn&#x27;t grown back abnormally thick or quickly.</li>
            <li> They are a fast and precise way to get rid of hairs which are outside the shape we are creating.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C89J96/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 I really advise not buying from that page.  </li>
            <li> These did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt or leave any marks, and it makes the skin really smooth after you get rid of the tiny hairs.</li>
            <li> Which of course creates too much friction and damages the skin.</li>
            <li> Gentle on the skin with no irritation.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Definitely a must have for women who want a baby smooth face.</li>
            <li> These work so much better than any other eyebrow shapers I have ever used .</li>
            <li> Better than some of the other Razors I bought</li>
            <li> Odd name, but the best little beauty tool around!!</li>
            <li> I feel like they are too long to accurately shape my brows, so I don&#x27;t use them for that.</li>
            <li> These little razors are pretty and easy to hold</li>
            <li> But, the razors on this listing I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> They are made cheap and not high quality.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this</li>
            <li> I really love these little guys.</li>
            <li> What can I say, I love these little gems.  </li>
            <li> so it feels a little like its dragging, but for the most part it does what it is meant for</li>
            <li> sharp and easy to use  has plasticprotective cap for wach razor.</li>
            <li> the blade is just a little too long to really do a good job on eyebrows.</li>
            <li> They work just fine but seem to dull quickly, like after one or two uses.</li>
            <li> the noxema brand i normally buy.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed these the first time I used them because it did remove hair but after a couple uses on my cheeks/ upper lip I started getting little flesh colored bumps</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t create new hair grown at all.</li>
            <li> Next time I will order the large pkg.!</li>
            <li> I really like this eyebrow razor because it works really well, however, my second razor broke like nothing.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of facial hair fast and is much easier to trim your eyebrows with this than tweezers.</li>
            <li> I love this little tool and use it once a week!</li>
            <li> and my face is actually very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> and wow!</li>
            <li> They make your skin feel so soft afterwards!</li>
            <li> and cheaply made wont even shave peach fuzz much less anything else.</li>
            <li> first one I got out of the package broke in half on the first use.</li>
            <li> Little slow on shipping, but a great product</li>
            <li> I used to find them at the Korean market by my old house, but since I moved, there is no where by me that sells them.  </li>
            <li> I had no trouble with these.</li>
            <li> thus far</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and waxing irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> i use this on my face &amp; neck (below the cheekbones only) thanks to a Michelle Money video on youtube.  </li>
            <li> It saves me so much money for facial waxing.</li>
            <li> She loved it, and certainly got results, so maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but it&#x27;s not working for me!</li>
            <li> Its not a sharp razor at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a white 20 year old female with with darker hair, particularly the mustache area and sideburns.</li>
            <li> I used one of them for the first time the other night on some peach fuzz and can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> This is my second time I&#x27;ve purchased these eyebrow razors, and so far no complaints!</li>
            <li> so glad i changed it to one because they do not work, very dull and they need to stop selling them.</li>
            <li> It removes all the little hairs from your face is a non-invasive way so that you have a fresh canvas for your makeup.</li>
            <li> but they were so huge making it hard to do my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> The packages look the same, and the razors themselves look nearly identical.</li>
            <li> The reason is the blade isn&#x27;t sharp enough so that one has to scrape the fine hair off one&#x27;s face or any other body part.</li>
            <li> They hurt..... not real sharp....</li>
            <li> zit left my skin soft and not stubbly, red, or irritated.</li>
            <li> The blade is quiet wide and it only works in a certain angle</li>
            <li> I probably &amp;#34;tinkle&amp;#34; once every 10 days or so and the blades stay sharp for a long time (I&#x27;m still on my first one after 3 months).</li>
            <li> but I find it very difficult to actually use in that they are so similar to a straight razor that it is very easy to cut oneself.</li>
            <li> This little facial shavers do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to, shave a woman&#x27;s baby hairs on her face.</li>
            <li> I was a little leary at first, as I didn&#x27;t want to shave and have the hair come back in darker or thicker.</li>
            <li> They also get dull quickly</li>
            <li> highly recommended if you like clean brows and dont mind the shaved look or if u hate the pain of shaving! :)</li>
            <li> They are sharp enough to do the job but not so sharp that I cut myself, as long as I hold it at the right angle.</li>
            <li> hard to get it at the right angle.</li>
            <li> not sharp and seemed too hard to really trim eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Other than having them done professionally</li>
            <li> The blades are way too long to use for eyebrows like other reviewers have said, unless your intent is to remove your eyebrows completely!</li>
            <li> but these razors last a long time so no worries</li>
            <li> they come very sharp and stay sharp for a while - a 3 pack should last a few months depending how many times you need to use them (a few times a week).  </li>
            <li> This whole Tinkle thing is really confusing me.</li>
            <li> but i used it one time and it seems to work, but i leaves a rough feeling above eyebrows.</li>
            <li> They are a lot bigger than I expected, and they shave well.</li>
            <li> Your husband, boyfriend, or significant other is secretly pissed off that you have a mustache.</li>
            <li> only one out of the 3 were sharp and usable....</li>
            <li> Plus they come in a three-pack, so it&#x27;ll be a very long time until you need to replace.</li>
            <li> I use it dry</li>
            <li> After you pluck your eyebrows you always have those few short hairs that are just too short to pluck.</li>
            <li> It did not live up to the reviews I read.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased a few packs of these in the past because overall I think it&#x27;s a decent product.  </li>
            <li> I am not impressed and think that the lady who I saw on the blog video was full of it.</li>
            <li> the shapers are not very high tech and the razor is also not the highest of quality, BUT it does the job!</li>
            <li> I would try to shape the hair at one end of my eyebrow, only to have hair on the other end removed as well!</li>
            <li> you just need to be a bit careful.</li>
            <li> my pink &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34; fell apart on me.</li>
            <li> rough- like the blades on disposable razors rather than the blades one puts in non-disposables.</li>
            <li> a sheer waste of money, willl NOT recommend to anyone.  </li>
            <li> Blades are longer than expected.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have time to get a facial wax or use hair removal creams, this little razor will do the trick!  </li>
            <li> I found the blade on this to be just a little too long for brow defining/shaping.  </li>
            <li> I use them for other areas and they work extremely well.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;razors&amp;#34; aren&#x27;t sharp at alll...</li>
            <li> It works well, feels sharp, but doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> These are not as sharp as some other brands I have tried</li>
            <li> The razor is not at all sharp.</li>
            <li> It also meant that the razor was very rough and just irritated my skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because those little battery operated razors I&#x27;d buy to tame the baby hair at my sideburns or the baby hairs above my lip were always dying, and I had lost patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the quality of the plastic (less flimsy than other brands I&#x27;ve tried), but the name &amp;#34;eyebrow shaper&amp;#34; is a misnomer.</li>
            <li> Not worth the plastic used.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had read a lot of recommendations for this product, so I didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d let me down.</li>
            <li> Can typically be found at Ulta for 3.00 for a 3 pack and there is no shipping involved.  </li>
            <li> 1 razor lasted about a month or a month and a half - shaving my face and neck once a week.</li>
            <li> I want to send them an email and let them know they sent me less than 3 razors.</li>
            <li> I was getting my face threaded once or twice a month, and these little things do the trick in just a couple minutes and at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> The eyebrow shaper works well and requires little cleaning after each use.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried different brands and these are the worse</li>
            <li> Waste of a few dollars.</li>
            <li> pay a few dollars moreand</li>
            <li> At my age I need to knock a few whiskers off my chin everyday.</li>
            <li> Shipping and handling were far to expensive.</li>
            <li> I used these for my face and it gets all the hair off as well as dead skin.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> The blade is sharp but not straight edge razor sharp, so although you could cut yourself it is quite unlikely unless you are careless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only dislike is that the blade is to long, it makes me come in from an angle which is alittle annoying and takes longer than if i could lay it flat.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money , they are so dull.</li>
            <li> The blade on one usually lasts me about 3-6 months, Depending on how often I use it.</li>
            <li> No more plucking.</li>
            <li> this is no better than a razor.</li>
            <li> Not really great, but if you are on a tight budget, it&#x27;ll work.</li>
            <li> These are surprisingly dull.</li>
            <li> I got it too late</li>
            <li> This razor comes with a stainless steel safety cover glued over the blade, which is supposed to stop you from cutting yourself, but it just makes the blade almost useless.  </li>
            <li> Waxing and creams were so painful to my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have thick eyebrows</li>
            <li> and I am never able to find them in stores!</li>
            <li> I mean, I guess.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and eye brows and no more hairs on my chinny-chin-chin!</li>
            <li> I will keep trying, but disappointed, so far.</li>
            <li> Then my wife tells me they are not good product.</li>
            <li> , the blade itself is , not really surprisingly, a bit cheap/</li>
            <li> not sure if they&#x27;re fake or just leftovers?</li>
            <li> I have lots of stray hairs around my eyebrow area that are too thin to pluck</li>
            <li> Might just be my skin but horribly broken out now</li>
            <li> I still like how it came in on time and nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> hello, it is a worthless item, did not take out a single hair from my chin,</li>
            <li> completely useless product.</li>
            <li> I wouldnt purchase them again sadly.</li>
            <li> It took of the peach fuzz, but was very irritating to my face.</li>
            <li> Wrong!  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to everyone whose tired of plucking!!</li>
            <li> Yes the name is bad.  </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed about that</li>
            <li> Im extremely disappointed in these and would NOT buy again. :(</li>
            <li> sadly disappointed .</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to a T and this product made the sides of my face break out into a terrible, painful razor burn!  </li>
            <li> Awful product!</li>
            <li> so dull they dont work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Little slow on shipping, but a great product</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t been able to get this item to work at all.  I will keep trying, but disappointed, so far.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product but it way overpriced here. Can typically be found at Ulta for 3.00 for a 3 pack and there is no shipping involved.  This is the most expensive online place I&#x27;ve seen them..</li>
            <li> These are really nice for shaping and getting rid of unwanted hair anywhere on your face! The blade on one usually lasts me about 3-6 months, Depending on how often I use it. Love these handy tools!</li>
            <li> Great company, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These are great and work well and I am never able to find them in stores!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Many good YouTube videos on how to use these for your eyebrows and other facial hair.</li>
            <li> the blade is just a little too long to really do a good job on eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I purchased these eyebrow razors to use as seam rippers.  I sew alot and occasionally find it necessary to unsew.  These work great.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Thank you. :)</li>
            <li> these are great for removing unwanted hair, especially facial hair. They are only good for a couple of uses, but do a good job.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyebrow tool. Great product.</li>
            <li> After you pluck your eyebrows you always have those few short hairs that are just too short to pluck. They get quite bothersome. But if you have one of these then it solves that problem. It is easy to control and quick to use. I recommend everyone having one of these on hand!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these for my eyebrows but for my upper lip and cheeks to whisk off that peach fuzz that clings to my foundations and BB creams</li>
            <li> feel very save when using and it is shave very smooth</li>
            <li> The blade is a bit longer than I realized but they work well you just need to be a bit careful.</li>
            <li> I really like this eyebrow razor because it works really well, however, my second razor broke like nothing. I was really disappointed about that but the price of the razors are great and convenient.</li>
            <li> I was so happy when I found these on Amazon!  I used to find them at the Korean market by my old house, but since I moved, there is no where by me that sells them.  I have lots of stray hairs around my eyebrow area that are too thin to pluck and I love using tinkle razors to get in there and get the job done.  They are also great for upper lip too!  The best part is that you can just put one in your purse for those little emergencies.</li>
            <li> I mean, I guess. Cheap and not really for real eye brows, good luck</li>
            <li> These work ok but break very easily. I ordered two packages and two broke on the very first use. They also get dull quickly</li>
            <li> they are what they are</li>
            <li> This is nothing more than a razor in a colored plastic handle.</li>
            <li> Our daughters love this product.  One of our children was introduced to it on a makeup tutorial online.  It is a good purchase, and seems to last long.  We will buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> My only dislike is that the blade is to long, it makes me come in from an angle which is alittle annoying and takes longer than if i could lay it flat.</li>
            <li> I bought these after they were recommended by Michelle Money. Love them!  I use them to remove the unsightly hair that grows on my face. They work great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is plastic, the blade is about 1 1/2&amp;#34; inches and comes with a plastic cover. The blade is sharp but not straight edge razor sharp, so although you could cut yourself it is quite unlikely unless you are careless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that they are disposable so they are good for 6-12 full uses and then it&#x27;s probably time to throw them away.</li>
            <li> Use these every week. So great!</li>
            <li> This whole Tinkle thing is really confusing me. I&#x27;ve ordered two different packs, this and another on Amazon  - both had the name Tinkle on the packaging. The packages look the same, and the razors themselves look nearly identical. However, these were a HUGE improvement over the others I ordered. I had no trouble with these. They made my face nice and smooth, and the hair hasn&#x27;t grown back abnormally thick or quickly. 1 razor lasted about a month or a month and a half - shaving my face and neck once a week. I love them. The others didn&#x27;t go so well, first one I got out of the package broke in half on the first use. The others don&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;ll be much more resilient. This is the link http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C89J96/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1 I really advise not buying from that page.  Nervous to buy in bulk because I don&#x27;t know which kind I&#x27;ll get. But, the razors on this listing I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> These work so much better than any other eyebrow shapers I have ever used . It is simple and clean and well worth the price .!</li>
            <li> Very sharp and works great!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to a T and this product made the sides of my face break out into a terrible, painful razor burn!  It&#x27;s like taking a serrated knife to your face!  Awful product!</li>
            <li> i was going to order 4 of these but im so glad i changed it to one because they do not work, very dull and they need to stop selling them. i&#x27;ve tried different brands and these are the worse and i had to throw them away.</li>
            <li> I really love these little guys. They&#x27;re perfect for detailed hair removal in various areas of the body without too much irritation. Cheap and effective!</li>
            <li> They are good, yes! they are good... I really like them worth the price. I think you should give them a try.</li>
            <li> This little facial shavers do exactly what they&#x27;re supposed to, shave a woman&#x27;s baby hairs on her face. I don&#x27;t know how it would work on thicker hair, but on my fine facial hair it worked fine. I found the blades dulled fairly quickly but they were so cheap it didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Great item but kind of high, plus shipping cost more than the itwm</li>
            <li> Work perfect..great quality and price</li>
            <li> i have been using tinkle&#x27;s since college.  love them.  they come very sharp and stay sharp for a while - a 3 pack should last a few months depending how many times you need to use them (a few times a week).  The angles tip makes it easy to work with and the blade is large enough to do any job you need</li>
            <li> I get these for my wife.. when she behaves&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for removing unwanted facial hair from a females face&lt;br /&gt;Cheap&lt;br /&gt;Colorful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;None thus far</li>
            <li> Just one word...&#x27;awesome&#x27;!!</li>
            <li> These are pretty much you get what you paid for. Not really great, but if you are on a tight budget, it&#x27;ll work.</li>
            <li> I bought them for someone else and she liked them to get the hairs off her face,I&#x27;m glad they came in a set of 3.</li>
            <li> This was a product that I saw recommended on Kandee Johnson&#x27;s beauty blog. I bought it because those little battery operated razors I&#x27;d buy to tame the baby hair at my sideburns or the baby hairs above my lip were always dying, and I had lost patience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are excellent razors that are small and inconspicuous. I keep one in the car just in case I&#x27;m putting on lipstick and see a stray eyebrow hair that I didn&#x27;t deal with earlier, or whatever. They&#x27;re great and easy to use and they won&#x27;t cut your skin. Plus they come in a three-pack, so it&#x27;ll be a very long time until you need to replace. I bought these two years ago and I&#x27;m still very happy with them. I anticipate it&#x27;ll be another two years before I need to buy new ones, easy.</li>
            <li> saw these advertised in a youtube clip I was watching. They work great!! Best on the market as the clip advertised.</li>
            <li> Michelle Money recommended these on her youtube channel to help remove facial hair, so that&#x27;s what I use these for. And I love them. I probably &amp;#34;tinkle&amp;#34; once every 10 days or so and the blades stay sharp for a long time (I&#x27;m still on my first one after 3 months). They arrived really quickly and work great. Except, ironically, as eyebrow shapers. I feel like they are too long to accurately shape my brows, so I don&#x27;t use them for that. But they are great in removing facial hair on the lower half of my face. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with these and this is also great for the brows and any unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> These little razors are pretty and easy to hold but I find it very difficult to actually use in that they are so similar to a straight razor that it is very easy to cut oneself.</li>
            <li> not sharp and seemed too hard to really trim eyebrows.</li>
            <li> These have and thought that I was ordering four packets of these but it was only one. They can in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I just love these eyebrow razors. I use them for other areas and they work extremely well. I will purchase them again.</li>
            <li> These did absolutely nothing for me. I literally just threw them away because it wasn&#x27;t even worth the effort to return them. I guess if you want to scrape some dead skin cells off your face they&#x27;d be good for that.</li>
            <li> Be sure to buy several packs and hand out to your girlfriends, they will love you.  So easy to use and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these, especially with the great reviews! However, they didn&#x27;t work. No hair came off of me. I tried &amp;#34;dry,&amp;#34; shaving cream, and just water. All my hairs were still there. Its not a sharp razor at all! When i went to try it again my pink &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34; fell apart on me. They are made cheap and not high quality.  Im extremely disappointed in these and would NOT buy again. :(</li>
            <li> These are great to shape brows and clean up hair around the face. doesn&#x27;t create new hair grown at all.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t last very long, but otherwise it&#x27;s been great</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s meant to do! I use it all the time, I love it! :) It&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
            <li> One of the best things I&#x27;ve ever bought. I&#x27;m a white 20 year old female with with darker hair, particularly the mustache area and sideburns. These &amp;#34;razors&amp;#34; aren&#x27;t sharp at alll...you can run your finger across the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34;..it won&#x27;t do anything.! BUT it works SO well to get rid of peach fuzz kind of hair. It doesn&#x27;t hurt or leave any marks, and it makes the skin really smooth after you get rid of the tiny hairs. They last forever too.</li>
            <li> These are awesome, especially for the price. They are a necessity for every woman, I am so glad I bought them!</li>
            <li> I have a fuzzy face. I was researching facial hair removal (the white hair does not respond to laser). I found this product being demonstrated on You Tube. I gave it a try and I LOVE it! Next time I will order the large pkg.!</li>
            <li> The blade is quiet wide and it only works in a certain angle</li>
            <li> I like the quality of the plastic (less flimsy than other brands I&#x27;ve tried), but the name &amp;#34;eyebrow shaper&amp;#34; is a misnomer. The blades are way too long to use for eyebrows like other reviewers have said, unless your intent is to remove your eyebrows completely! I would try to shape the hair at one end of my eyebrow, only to have hair on the other end removed as well!</li>
            <li> I have purchased a few packs of these in the past because overall I think it&#x27;s a decent product.  I do find that when I have gone to use some of them, they don&#x27;t work at all.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the placement of the blade or the sharpness of some versus others but while some do work perfectly, others don&#x27;t work at all; you never know what you&#x27;re going to get from these.  For the price though, it&#x27;s still worth the gamble to me.</li>
            <li> Good, cheap basic facial razor, but no better then the kind you can get from the dollar store. The slightly bigger size is nice, however the blade is very inconsistent. In my pack of 3, 2 of them had knicks/bends that caused irritations every time I used them.</li>
            <li> This is a good product to helping to keep your eye brows shaped correctly. The package arrived promptly and was wrapped securely for mailing.</li>
            <li> They work just fine but seem to dull quickly, like after one or two uses.</li>
            <li> It is good but doesn&#x27;t cut how I hoped.</li>
            <li> completely useless product. The reason is the blade isn&#x27;t sharp enough so that one has to scrape the fine hair off one&#x27;s face or any other body part. Which of course creates too much friction and damages the skin. Waste of a few dollars. Sephora carries an excellent eyebrow shaver but it costs close to 15 bucks!! Also Flamingo has a few good eyebrow razors.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even tweeze anymore. Once you get used to using these you&#x27;ll really get better shaped eyebrows than you could with tweezers. I recommend applying moisturizer to your eyebrows before using.</li>
            <li> had to buy more than one pack because it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; product... cheap gimmic as well as a cheap product..... Then my wife tells me they are not good product. They hurt..... not real sharp....</li>
            <li> Not too sharp which is great since I use it to shave my face. It still does a good job.</li>
            <li> I found the blade on this to be just a little too long for brow defining/shaping.  I will be looking for another similiar item with a shorter blade though this will do in the meantime.  You get a cleaner more defined line than with tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the blade itself is , not really surprisingly, a bit cheap/rough- like the blades on disposable razors rather than the blades one puts in non-disposables.</li>
            <li> Peach fuzz on the face?  I have tried waxing but my skin breaks out.  This is a highly effective and simple tool to use.  I use it dry and I did try using it with my face cleanser but the blade is not such that it can remove the facial cleanser and peach fuzz together.  I use it on my face and eye brows and no more hairs on my chinny-chin-chin! (or elsewhere for that matter).</li>
            <li> ibought these as they were cheaper then the noxema brand i normally buy. dont waste your money , they are so dull. and cheaply made wont even shave peach fuzz much less anything else. look like cheap item from the dollar store. pay a few dollars moreand get the noxema brand , these im gonna throw in the trash there so dull they dont work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I just received this product Sunday and it has been great so far! Gets rid of facial hair fast and is much easier to trim your eyebrows with this than tweezers. I would recommend to anyone and you can&#x27;t complain about the price.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed these the first time I used them because it did remove hair but after a couple uses on my cheeks/ upper lip I started getting little flesh colored bumps and I&#x27;ve never had a pimple on my cheeks in my life. Now I can&#x27;t get rid of them. Might just be my skin but horribly broken out now and my facialist confirmed shaving the face causes it to break out. Bummed! Throwing away!</li>
            <li> I have been using these for about a year now and they save me time and money. I have alot of peach fuzz all over my face, and a somewhat noticeable &amp;#34;moustache&amp;#34;. I was getting my face threaded once or twice a month, and these little things do the trick in just a couple minutes and at a fraction of the cost. They are sharp enough to do the job but not so sharp that I cut myself, as long as I hold it at the right angle. I was a little leary at first, as I didn&#x27;t want to shave and have the hair come back in darker or thicker. It hasn&#x27;t done either of those and my face is actually very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> It did not live up to the reviews I read.  It took of the peach fuzz, but was very irritating to my face.</li>
            <li> I keep these on hand.  At my age I need to knock a few whiskers off my chin everyday. I also shape my eyebrows quickly.</li>
            <li> This product works perfectly and I love how easy they are to use. Gentle on the skin with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Not worth the plastic used.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> sharp and easy to use  has plasticprotective cap for wach razor.</li>
            <li> It works well, feels sharp, but doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> I had read a lot of recommendations for this product, so I didn&#x27;t think it&#x27;d let me down. Wrong!  Incredibly flimsy and wouldn&#x27;t shave off any hair, regardless of what direction I tried. I&#x27;ll stick with my Noxzema razors.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wax my upper lip anymore.  My skin is sensitive and waxing irritated my skin.  These are the answer.</li>
            <li> This item is a piece of junk.  It does not work at all.  Do not waste your 3 dollars on it, you would be better of buying a lotto ticket with the money.  I did not have any issues with the shipping, and the transaction went smoothly.  That is the only reason I am giving this item 2 stars, otherwise I would have rated it 1 star.</li>
            <li> The length of this shaper is perfect for creating the natural looking straight eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;This shaper also trim my facial hair and works very well without cutting (of course, don&#x27;t press the razor too hard).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product and great price.</li>
            <li> This was a mistake to get this product.&lt;br /&gt;They sent me just 2 Razors instead of 3. I want to send them an email and let them know they sent me less than 3 razors.</li>
            <li> I stop tweezing my eyebrows and started using this!! It&#x27;s amazing, gets the job done, it perfectly cuts the hair! I recommend this product to everyone whose tired of plucking!!</li>
            <li> These are really good, not dull at all and get the job done perfectly.</li>
            <li> This would have got a 5 star but they were so huge making it hard to do my eyebrows. I still like how it came in on time and nothing was broken. Works fine.</li>
            <li> These do an okay job.  Other than having them done professionally, these are the only tools I&#x27;ve tried to keep my brows in check.  They&#x27;ll do in a rush!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for any fine facial hair. I followed the directions and was very gentle and it removed all the hair perfectly. zit left my skin soft and not stubbly, red, or irritated.</li>
            <li> Obviously you can get these in the hair stores for like .99 cents. These are a bit different. First they are sharper. And the blade is longer. Great price for the 3 pack and the product isn&#x27;t cheap like the ones in the hair stores. It came within 3 days.</li>
            <li> Great product, worked like a charm.  Very good pricing and I was pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Love them.  Use them for my nose hairs… ha ha ha.  Easy to clean and don&#x27;t cut at all.</li>
            <li> Love them Awesome product. Easy to use. I really good price. Better than some of the other Razors I bought</li>
            <li> These are surprisingly dull. They have a stainless steel cover that is permanently glued over the top of the actual razor, making them dull.&lt;br /&gt;I understand that they don&#x27;t want you to slice open your face, but honestly this should be a \\&quot;use at your own risk\\&quot; product with no protective guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even watched a youtube video to make sure I was using it correctly. I have the right angle when I shave my face, and I have even tried doing it after a shower to make my skin softer. All I can say is that it works great to exfoliate my skin cells, but doesn&#x27;t do much to get rid of tiny blonde hairs on my cheeks or hairline.</li>
            <li> I love this little tool and use it once a week! It removes all the little hairs from your face is a non-invasive way so that you have a fresh canvas for your makeup. Makeup goes on smooth and you look fresh faced!</li>
            <li> I would recommend The Tinkle eyebrow shaper for more than just eyebrows! Use it on facial hair and more! :)</li>
            <li> We use these when performing permanent eyebrows. They are a fast and precise way to get rid of hairs which are outside the shape we are creating. They are inexpensive and disposable which is great when using one per client.</li>
            <li> only one out of the 3 were sharp and usable....the other one worked nicely for a coupe of weeks until it dulled out. I wouldnt purchase them again sadly.</li>
            <li> this is a good facila hair trimmer but as far as eyebrow concerned its razor a little large than it should be ,,which makes eybrow shaping a risky job ,, but if someone wants it for other areas on face then its perfect ..</li>
            <li> Fabulous! No more plucking.</li>
            <li> it gets the hair gone and makes me look like i went to get them done</li>
            <li> hello, it is a worthless item, did not take out a single hair from my chin, even i tried to put soap still nothing came out.&lt;br /&gt;it a sheer waste of money, willl NOT recommend to anyone.  thanks</li>
            <li> They do the job well for the price. I used one of them for the first time the other night on some peach fuzz and can&#x27;t complain. Didn&#x27;t have any problems and cleaning it was easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/1/2014 update: I finally had to order more of these. I still think, many months later, that they are a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried similar products but they cut my skin. This is the best!  Not trying anything else again! 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> this brand is the best that I have come across so far for removing facial hair.  Amazon has the best price too.</li>
            <li> What i wanted. Blades are longer than expected.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. I am very cross with his product . Shipping and handling were far to expensive. I will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> What can I say, I love these little gems.  Great for getting unwanted &amp;#34;stragglers&amp;#34; off the face.</li>
            <li> I used these for my face and it gets all the hair off as well as dead skin. I love these razors and actually need to get more.</li>
            <li> Odd name, but the best little beauty tool around!!</li>
            <li> Great shaper - great price!!</li>
            <li> Your husband, boyfriend, or significant other is secretly pissed off that you have a mustache. Get rid if it. I did, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> These are not the same as ones I buy locally....cheap cap doesn&#x27;t fit, not nearly as sharp....not sure if they&#x27;re fake or just leftovers? Trash...</li>
            <li> Saw this demonstrated on YouTube by a tv actress.  She loved it, and certainly got results, so maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but it&#x27;s not working for me!</li>
            <li> love this thing. the length is a bit longer than the one i had last time but it works just as well. highly recommended if you like clean brows and dont mind the shaved look or if u hate the pain of shaving! :)</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t have time to get a facial wax or use hair removal creams, this little razor will do the trick!  you brush the razor against your face lightly and it miraculously removes unwanted peach fuzz, side burns, moustache, etc.  the shapers are not very high tech and the razor is also not the highest of quality, BUT it does the job!</li>
            <li> These are not as sharp as some other brands I have tried so it feels a little like its dragging, but for the most part it does what it is meant for</li>
            <li> I used this on my brows, back of my neck and face. Works well for the price. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This works great for both eyebrows and shaving other areas around the face,  and the neck. Definitely a must have for women who want a baby smooth face.</li>
            <li> Tried them, I liked them</li>
            <li> It arrived very fast. It helped me get my desired shape without any pain. (I used an eyebrow stencil) These shapers made the arch very precise.</li>
            <li> I purchased these after hearing a review about tinkle eyebrow shapers. These seem to work fine. They are the first eyebrow shapers I&#x27;ve ever bought, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare them with. I just felt it was a bit deceptive that they weren&#x27;t actually &amp;#34;tinkle&amp;#34;. The package said &amp;#34; brow shaper by Annie&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Ive purchased quite a few brands in search for the best facial razor..  These are my favorite and the prices is excellent!!</li>
            <li> I am not impressed and think that the lady who I saw on the blog video was full of it. I never just buy things after seeing a blog but I did it this time and wish I didn&#x27;t. Hope no one else makes this mistake!</li>
            <li> My wife loved them at first, no cuts and a close shave. But now she is under the impression that the hair is growing back faster.</li>
            <li> Amazing for shaving the peach fuzz off your face and maintaining your brows between trips to the spa. Must have!</li>
            <li> This is my second time I&#x27;ve purchased these eyebrow razors, and so far no complaints! Does the job.. I have thick eyebrows so it&#x27;s a struggle but these razors last a long time so no worries.. Will definitely be purchasing these again!</li>
            <li> Great product. Was not disappointed. Thank you</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. Easily and painlessly removed peach fuzz. Still undecided how the hair grows back…… Makeup does go on smoother.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty cheap and it works.  I use it for the times that I skip going to get my waxes.</li>
            <li> and plucking so when i found these everything just came out awesome! i love these and will be buying more. I&#x27;ve only still after months still been using only one of them.</li>
            <li> I got it too late but finally i got it lol&lt;br /&gt;Its very nice item&lt;br /&gt;On it has nice okay</li>
            <li> The razor is not at all sharp.</li>
            <li> This razor comes with a stainless steel safety cover glued over the blade, which is supposed to stop you from cutting yourself, but it just makes the blade almost useless.  It also meant that the razor was very rough and just irritated my skin.  It didn&#x27;t take off even the finest peach fuzz on my face, and I would definitely recommend plucking rather than shaving for your eyebrows.  I would recommend getting a brand that doesn&#x27;t use a cover.</li>
            <li> i use this on my face &amp; neck (below the cheekbones only) thanks to a Michelle Money video on youtube.  The eyebrow shaper works well and requires little cleaning after each use.  i can&#x27;t attest to the effectiveness of it as an eyebrow shaper, but it works great on the neck &amp; face to get rid of any unwanted hairs and create a smoother base for foundation application.</li>
            <li> for what I wanted (on my face) this is no better than a razor. don&#x27;t waste your time. hard to get it at the right angle.</li>
            <li> The blades on these shapers are too large for me to use confidently.</li>
            <li> I havent used it very much but i used it one time and it seems to work, but i leaves a rough feeling above eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it was recommended as a facial hair remover. this did not meet my expectations. did not remove all facial hair. leaving a lot more than it took off. and what  it did take off was prickly two days later. sadly disappointed .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, haha not much else to say</li>
            <li> They are a lot bigger than I expected, and they shave well. The only problem I had with it was the packaging, the product was somewhat opened like it might have been damaged during the shipping</li>
            <li> Great product! Received quickly!</li>
            <li> Not quite what I thought but maybe I need more practice</li>
            <li> Worked great. Price was great too. Will buy more from Amazon at that price!  Use it to get rid of any unwanted facial hair from my chin or jaw line to my upper lip and eyebrows. Wonderful smooth skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have found this product. It saves me so much money for facial waxing. It&#x27;s fun and easy to use and the hair just falls right off, leaving me with a soft complexion. I also used it on my arms and wow! I will definitely be saving on shave cream as well. Highly recommend this</li>
            <li> I purchased these after Michelle Money recommended them.  I must say that her recommendation was spot on.  I really love the razors (not the brand name) and they are great!</li>
            <li> They work fine for me. Although, the could stand to be a bit sharper. Came just in-time to shape-up my lovely eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Yes the name is bad.  Yes the product is fantastic.  I heard about this on a youtube makeup guru video and decided to give it a try.  Works wonders to get rid of unwanted facial hair and to trim up your eyebrows.  Waxing and creams were so painful to my sensitive skin I had to find another way and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with these.  Got an extra pack for my mother and she loves them as well.  Each razor lasts a good while so a pack of 3 at this price is a steal.  I just wish I could find them in stores.</li>
            <li> Love these, easy to use and very sharp!</li>
            <li> These things are amazing!!! They are quick and they don&#x27;t hurt! They make your skin feel so soft afterwards!</li>
