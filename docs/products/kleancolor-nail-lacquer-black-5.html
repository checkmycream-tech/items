            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed using all of these colors for stamping nail designs.</li>
            <li>Also, removing it has become more than a chore.</li>
            <li>t most stores they sell them for $1</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Get a better brand like OPI.</li>
            <li>it dries quick and looks good on nails but chips easily</li>
            <li>On the bright side the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an awesome lacquer, just don&#x27;t get it wet, use your nails for anything, or type...</li>
            <li>Applies easily and stays on.  </li>
            <li>Very bold color on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>It chips really easily.</li>
            <li>I bought this to repair some black lacquer items that had been scratched and it worked perfectly!</li>
            <li>It has a great strong black color, and it goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this color</li>
            <li>best black color out there!!</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and looks nice, could have been a bigger bottle for the price</li>
            <li>Came quick, but klumpy klumpy klumpy</li>
            <li>good quality polish, not old and gooey.</li>
            <li>Great shiny black.  </li>
            <li>For that, it is the best I have tried, crisp, vibrant black stamping.</li>
            <li>It is just as good as Konad special black polish.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t chip very much.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>After adding a ton of thinner to it, this quickly became one of my favorite polishes and have since bought Kleancolor in a number of other colors.</li>
            <li>I love this polish for stamping, it is dark and crisp and the price is right, shipping is always fast.</li>
            <li>And if you need to talk to their customer service, they are very helpful.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t use this color for anything else but stamping so</li>
            <li>It was really globby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This nail polish covers in one coat, its really pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has stained my nails (even though I applied a clear bottom coat first) and has stained my fingers from it removal.</li>
            <li>I have since bought 8 more bottles of black</li>
            <li>Omg this is such a lovely back</li>
            <li>When you put it on your nails, no matter how much is on the brush it will end up on your fingers and make it look like a 2 year old painted them.</li>
            <li>It applies evenly and is a great plain black.</li>
            <li>has a little strong odor</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surely gonna buy the same black when I run out</li>
            <li>Never heard of this brand before but was looking for basic black to paint glitters on top of, bought this cause of the price.</li>
            <li>it chips in the more weird places, dries fairly quick though.</li>
            <li>The nail polish seemed old.</li>
            <li>Needs 2 layers in order to be completely opaque.</li>
            <li>but if you get a few it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>only thing negative about this is Its not very shiny on its own</li>
            <li>Even when using an OPI base Coat and OPI Top Coat it chips quite easily.</li>
            <li>i found this kleancolor brand at my small local dollar store for duhh $1 in houston texas and at Ranch Market in houston too its an asian supermarket has a huge collection</li>
            <li>This was the first black finger nail polish I did not have to go over multiple times.</li>
            <li>There was dried nail polish caked around the top of it, and it was thick like it was getting old.</li>
            <li>This is the first bottle of black nail polish I&#x27;ve purchased that doesn&#x27;t require a second coat to be opaque enough to wear out.</li>
            <li>Very neat little brush made applying a cinch for me.</li>

            <li> Very neat little brush made applying a cinch for me.</li>
            <li> it last a long time</li>
            <li> dosent last long after about a day or 2 of applying it starts to chip off</li>
            <li> Who knows how long it going to take before</li>
            <li> It was thick and gooey and it really smelled toxic.</li>
            <li> Dries fast so not good for stamping though.</li>
            <li> so I could do my white nail art on the black.</li>
            <li> I decided to pick up silver, black and white from Kleancolor.</li>
            <li> Was very thick and didn&#x27;t really go on evenly.</li>
            <li> but dont do anything rough with them</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product not worth shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> Not worth the buy.....</li>
            <li> ,It looks kinda dull,so I would suggest using a top coat.also,it did not stain nor ruin my nails,even when I did not use a base coat.</li>
            <li> Black is so almost everything one could wear</li>
            <li> I use black nail polish a lot</li>
            <li> Black was a needed color</li>
            <li> For you nail stamping nuts, Kleancolor Black is \\&quot;awesome\\&quot; for stamping.  </li>
            <li> Anytime I  need to stamp with a black color, I find myself reaching for Kleancolor black over Konad.  </li>
            <li> I needed a black polish for stamping that wouldn&#x27;t break my bank.</li>
            <li> When I got my bottle it looked like it had been used previously.</li>
            <li> I can say that the smell is no more stronger than any other bottle of polish that I use.</li>
            <li> I was missing.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste money on this.</li>
            <li> This is very thick and takes a while to dry.</li>
            <li> used it to fix a scratch on an ottoman and a broken ceramic that was black.</li>
            <li> Applying is hard, but if you take your time and use patience it looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> The polish was so thick and globby looking.</li>
            <li> but it was so thick</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve been desperate for black for a while, so I&#x27;m living even with my pickiness.</li>
            <li> and I was unable to use it.</li>
            <li> This is weird.</li>
            <li> This was really thick and almost impossible to put on and even worse it was almost impossible to take off...</li>
            <li> When I got it, I was shocked how thick it was!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!!!!</li>
            <li> To go along with that this polish also has a bad smell to it.</li>
            <li> Not a fan at all :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed when I found out that you could get these on Shopmissa.com for a dollar.</li>
            <li> Came out like crap on the nails.</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in the item.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is terrible it chips off after about 2 hours.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s really amazing it last a long time</li>
            <li> Great shiny black.  Applies easily and stays on.  Looks great under the sparkly products that are popular now.</li>
            <li> Black is so almost everything one could wear</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this color so I could do my white nail art on the black. The polish was so thick and globby looking. Came out like crap on the nails. very disappointed. I do not recommend this product not worth shipping and handling. Not worth the buy.....</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle of nail polish hoping to use it for halloween but it was so thick and I was unable to use it. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this!!!!!</li>
            <li> The nail polish seemed old. It was mushy and lumpy, and stained my nailed. I was very disappointed in the item.</li>
            <li> good quality polish, not old and gooey. Goes on smooth and looks nice, could have been a bigger bottle for the price but oh well</li>
            <li> Omg this is such a lovely back u can just about do everything with this color I&#x27;m surely gonna buy the same black when I run out</li>
            <li> Chips off so easily even with a good top and bottom coat!!! When you remove it even with a good remover it like gets all over and stains your fingers..I dont think you should buy this!!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for how this works as a nail polish, I order specifically for stamping purposes. For that, it is the best I have tried, crisp, vibrant black stamping. Love it.</li>
            <li> This does not stay on well at all. Even when using an OPI base Coat and OPI Top Coat it chips quite easily. Not a fan at all :(</li>
            <li> Love this polish. Works great for nail art and stamping.</li>
            <li> Bought this to repair a screwhole in my guitar...Worked great. Very neat little brush made applying a cinch for me.</li>
            <li> got it today and I am happy was well rapt I am def ordering some more I use black nail polish a lot</li>
            <li> almost all my polish is Kleancolor.  Black was a needed color I was missing.  Dries fast so not good for stamping though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome lacquer, just don&#x27;t get it wet, use your nails for anything, or type...it chips in the more weird places, dries fairly quick though. When you put it on your nails, no matter how much is on the brush it will end up on your fingers and make it look like a 2 year old painted them. I like it and I&#x27;m ok with kind of touching it up every once in awhile, I&#x27;ve been desperate for black for a while, so I&#x27;m living even with my pickiness. Buy at your own risk!</li>
            <li> Chips within 2nd day on being on nail</li>
            <li> I use nail polish as a background color for rhinestone covered whistles which I sell on etsy. I have several hundred bottles of nail polish so I know nail polish lol. Never heard of this brand before but was looking for basic black to paint glitters on top of, bought this cause of the price. When I got it, I was shocked how thick it was! After adding a ton of thinner to it, this quickly became one of my favorite polishes and have since bought Kleancolor in a number of other colors. You only need 1 coat for the polish to appear as it does in the bottle! That simply never happens! I have since bought 8 more bottles of black and I&#x27;m writing this review before I buy 3 more. I really like this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This is very thick and takes a while to dry. To go along with that this polish also has a bad smell to it. I would not be purchasing any more of this polish anymore. On the bright side the delivery was fast.</li>
            <li> Color chips off very easily. It is not worth the money spent. The color can even be wiped off by a napkin.</li>
            <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t think I could ask for much more. This is the first bottle of black nail polish I&#x27;ve purchased that doesn&#x27;t require a second coat to be opaque enough to wear out. It applies evenly and is a great plain black. I plan on using this shade as a stamping polish as soon as I get my stamper in the mail!</li>
            <li> Goes on very nicely. Needs 2 layers in order to be completely opaque. Doesn&#x27;t chip very much. I was disappointed when I found out that you could get these on Shopmissa.com for a dollar. You would have to pay the 4$ shipping but if you get a few it&#x27;s well worth it. This is still a great deal but better prices are available elsewhere.</li>
            <li> it dries quick and looks good on nails but chips easily so its an ok nail polish. but dont do anything rough with them</li>
            <li> I bought this to repair some black lacquer items that had been scratched and it worked perfectly! A great buy.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color and fast shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping great price</li>
            <li> This nail polish is terrible it chips off after about 2 hours.</li>
            <li> Applying is hard, but if you take your time and use patience it looks amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with purchase Recommend it</li>
            <li> I love this polish for stamping, it is dark and crisp and the price is right, shipping is always fast. And if you need to talk to their customer service, they are very helpful.</li>
            <li> Very bold color on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! It has amazing color pay off,even after just one coat,great consistentcey, is super smooth,dries fast, great packaging,an its a great price!!The only thing negative about this is Its not very shiny on its own,It looks kinda dull,so I would suggest using a top coat.also,it did not stain nor ruin my nails,even when I did not use a base coat.To me, it did not smell toxic in my opinion,it just smelled like a regular nail polish. All in all its a Great product an im very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Awesome formula love it! GReat to stamp with!!</li>
            <li> For you nail stamping nuts, Kleancolor Black is \\&quot;awesome\\&quot; for stamping.  It is just as good as Konad special black polish.  Anytime I  need to stamp with a black color, I find myself reaching for Kleancolor black over Konad.  I really don&#x27;t use this color for anything else but stamping so I can&#x27;t comment on how it applies as a regular nail polish and if it stains.  I can say that the smell is no more stronger than any other bottle of polish that I use.</li>
            <li> Came quick, but klumpy klumpy klumpy</li>
            <li> best black color out there!! especially for konad stamping! has a little strong odor but i dont mind. I regret buying online bc i found this kleancolor brand at my small local dollar store for duhh $1 in houston texas and at Ranch Market in houston too its an asian supermarket has a huge collection i guess bc it comes from china also for $1</li>
            <li> cheap and poor customer service</li>
            <li> This was the first black finger nail polish I did not have to go over multiple times. It was awesome</li>
            <li> This was really thick and almost impossible to put on and even worse it was almost impossible to take off... DONT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> used it to fix a scratch on an ottoman and a broken ceramic that was black.</li>
            <li> I needed a black polish for stamping that wouldn&#x27;t break my bank. I decided to pick up silver, black and white from Kleancolor. All these colors work so well with stamping because they have a bit of a thicker formula. I&#x27;ve enjoyed using all of these colors for stamping nail designs.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product. It was thick and gooey and it really smelled toxic. Also, removing it has become more than a chore. It has stained my nails (even though I applied a clear bottom coat first) and has stained my fingers from it removal. Who knows how long it going to take before the gray/black leaves my fingers and my nails.</li>
            <li> very cheap for the good quality. t most stores they sell them for $1 but i dont mind the price. not a problem at all with me.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It has a great strong black color, and it goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is weird. When I got my bottle it looked like it had been used previously. There was dried nail polish caked around the top of it, and it was thick like it was getting old. It was really globby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NICE THING ABOUT THIS: This nail polish covers in one coat, its really pigmented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAD THING: It chips really easily.</li>
            <li> It dried at fairly fast. Was very thick and didn&#x27;t really go on evenly. I wouldn&#x27;t waste money on this. Get a better brand like OPI.</li>
            <li> dosent last long after about a day or 2 of applying it starts to chip off</li>
