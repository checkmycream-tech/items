            <li> but i think it smelled like toilet water.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> These a lot smaller than I expected,</li>
            <li> I will say that each bar are real small but will be a real way to try all the types out.</li>
            <li> Would be nicer in a box, the plastic is very loose not like in the picture.</li>
            <li> The picture makes them appear much larger, but they are quite small.</li>
            <li> I suppose since you are getting a variety to sample the other scents.  </li>
            <li> They are small bars, about 1 and 1/2&amp;#34; or so.</li>
            <li> Was going to use as a small gift, but think I&#x27;ll have to repackage or other... disappointing.</li>

            <li> As expected and smell nice.</li>
            <li> They beautiful soaps and smell wonderful; however, I wish they were regular bath size bars.</li>
            <li> I was hoping these soaps would be a lot larger then they were when they arrived. They are good for a stocking stuffer or a little side gift.</li>
            <li> I like them very much.  I am enjoying using the soap.  It was a good buy for me.  Thank you</li>
            <li> The soaps are very nice, but much smaller that I really wanted.  They did work well with the project I was doing, I just used two.</li>
            <li> I purchased tis soap set for my mother and she is happy with it.I will say that each bar are real small but will be a real way to try all the types out.Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Bought this set of soap to bring my order total up to required amount for free shipping, so wasn&#x27;t really expecting much. Well I will be ordering them again since it turned out to be a really nice little set of soaps. They are small bars, about 1 and 1/2&amp;#34; or so. They fit right in the palm of your hand, so are not clumsy like large bars of soap. They are an assortment of scents and all are nice. Some a little earthy and some really sweet. Some of the soaps have exfoliating grains in them. This set of soaps would make a nice little gift.</li>
            <li> I purchased several if these soap sets. I keep a couple around the house so I had a hostess gift to give if we visit a friend, and I used another package to fill an apothecary jar in my guest bathroom. They have a subtle color and mild but pleasant fragrance. Each soap is about 1 inch square, so they&#x27;re pretty petite.</li>
            <li> Would be nicer in a box, the plastic is very loose not like in the picture. Also, there is no info , would not give as a gift.</li>
            <li> When I have given this as a gift, I notice it in the recipient&#x27;s guest bath/powder room wrapped as a decoration rather than in actual use.  I suspect bigger soaps would get actual use.</li>
            <li> These soaps were receive quickly. The picture makes them appear much larger, but they are quite small. The dimensions are written so it was just an oversight on my part. The soaps are lovely and we made them word despite their size.</li>
            <li> Nicely packaged, pretty soaps, and they smell as nice as they look. They also lather up well and feel luxurious for the bath!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Pre de Provence but will not order from this particular vendor because the Title says it contains 7 bars and the Description says 5 bars !!!</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Packaging is cheap, soaps are small. Was going to use as a small gift, but think I&#x27;ll have to repackage or other... disappointing.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s review: ....These a lot smaller than I expected, but I guess I hoped they would actually be bigger.  The price is fair I suppose since you are getting a variety to sample the other scents.  I am in LOVE with these soaps.  So far the White Gardenia is my favorite of all but that one is not included in this variety, I&#x27;ve ordered it before. These are literally about 1.5 &amp;#34; by 1.5&amp;#34; by 0.5&amp;#34; I bought these for the guest bathroom but now I&#x27;m not so sure since they are so tiny, perhaps I&#x27;ll have the kids use them.</li>
            <li> It was just what we had been looking for. Very pleased with order and shipping . I would recommend this product to friends and family</li>
            <li> I thought i would really love this soap but i think it smelled like toilet water.  It did lather nice .</li>
