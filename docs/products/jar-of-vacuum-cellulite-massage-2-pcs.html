            <li>After years of struggling with cellulite I proudly say that the nightmare is almost over!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great for working with cellulite, just put some oil on your skin and move jars all over the problem area.</li>
            <li>I love these cups!!</li>
            <li>Amazing, since this is basically the price of a coffee and vela sessions are hundreds of dollars each for just one!  </li>
            <li>Great!! :)</li>
            <li>Good on sore muscles.</li>

            <li>Good quality suction cups.</li>
            <li>This is a good starter until you get u to it.</li>
            <li>I then tried using it on my arms and had good results there too.</li>
            <li>It felt SOOOO good.</li>
            <li>, I think it&#x27;s a fair price for what it does.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll have to find stronger suctioned cups if you want a good lift on the quads.</li>
            <li>so it was good and slippery.</li>
            <li>but again requires good hand strength.</li>
            <li>Good quality ,you control the suction.</li>
            <li>The best product ever been made to fight cellulite, esp if you know how to use it right !</li>
            <li>I love these cups,they&#x27;re convenient and easy to use, perfect size for a quick cupping massage after shower the best</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and easy to work with.</li>
            <li>On the positive side they are a great conversation piece!</li>
            <li>I tried Google searches to find out the best way to use, the best parts of the body to start with, how often, how much time per session, best oils/lotions to use, average length of use until results are seen.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t understand the instructions, but before I have been using this kind of jars.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the so much needed anti-cellulite maintenance.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>it is really great stuff if you use it right.</li>
            <li>Was pretty awesome, my mom liked it very much.</li>
            <li>I recommend using some type of oil before you start your massage to make it slide around better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the price</li>
            <li>Maybe others had better luck with them.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much better, I still using, I need more time to see the cellulite.</li>
            <li>but i recommend the ones that are with the pump, vacuumed sealed they do a much better job of holding on to your skin.</li>
            <li>its ok it is durable but have not see results yet.</li>
            <li>so maybe it needs more time</li>
            <li>Going to buy more soon as payday comes around</li>
            <li>I love the cupping</li>
            <li>Must Get It :))</li>
            <li>For the price, I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise its ok.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Anyways, after about a month, I started noticing more cellulite.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and Im sure</li>
            <li>always felt better.</li>
            <li>It felt like my skin had more elasticity.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you read up a bit on how you should use the cup correctly.</li>
            <li>Interesting effects on the appearance of cellulite as well.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure if you keep using them you will see results.</li>
            <li>, I wish I have more of them</li>
            <li>I have had vela sessions and to me, this feels comparable and has even better results.  </li>
            <li>Love these for massages.</li>
            <li>Actually pretty good for the price</li>
            <li>I applied so much pressure a couple times that I got bruises, but that&#x27;s ok, because I&#x27;ve already seen good results (</li>
            <li>At the first it hurt a bit, but this because of the lack of elasticity of your skin and where the problem is more severe, it gets better with time!</li>
            <li>Very good massage vacuum cup, improve the circulation and cream absorption.</li>
            <li>Recieved this product early and it works great.</li>
            <li>Loved it really helps with cerulation</li>
            <li>Have n&#x27;t seen a significant reduction in my cellulite, but I love the massage I get from this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been the best $6 I&#x27;ve ever spent!.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and it really works!</li>
            <li>Do I think they&#x27;ll make my thighs smooth and free of all cellulite?</li>
            <li>Great suction especially with use of the Juniper oil.</li>
            <li>I bought it for light massage to increase blood flow.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>It ok for a stater, but for me I ended up ordering a more professional kit that I was able to control the suction.</li>
            <li>but right now it okay</li>
            <li>Perfect for small areas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with what I see so far.</li>
            <li>First I was very excited about this jar for massage.</li>
            <li>However, the suction is also making my spider veins more apparent, but I hope to combat this with more cardio.</li>
            <li>I love it a lot, because it doesn&#x27;t take too much time (literally 5-10 min for both legs and butt)</li>
            <li>The only good thing is that the seller was prompt with the delivery, however that is not part of the rating of this product.</li>
            <li>purchased this product based on the good reviews it had, and the low cost..</li>
            <li>It would be good to also have the bigger size silicon cup and beginners may want to start with that.</li>
            <li>It took a couple uses to figure out the best method, but now my whole routine takes less then 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>it is simple but so handy and useful!</li>
            <li>we so enjoy them , they are wonderfull for head aches an back aches to ,and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>5 minutes just isn&#x27;t long enough to see the best results.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and work fine</li>
            <li>Great for working out little pockets of sinew.</li>
            <li>As far as helping with the cellulite, it is ok.</li>
            <li>Been trying it every day right when im taking a shower dont know what stage my cellulite is</li>
            <li>I use it with baby oil, right after the shower.</li>
            <li>I have it for 3 years and it still same good quality as new.</li>
            <li>so more than likely I&#x27;m returning it.  </li>
            <li>They hurt at first, but just keep using them.</li>
            <li>I think these actually work better on severe cellulite</li>
            <li>When I first started this</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says, massage cellulite.</li>
            <li>stuff really works!</li>
            <li>It arrived exactly as description said.</li>
            <li>the first 3-4 weeks</li>
            <li>You will see results pretty soon.</li>
            <li>less \\&quot;dimples\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very pleased.</li>
            <li>So these cups have a long history in Russia &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>i used them many times but the problem is that after using u will have a blue spots on yoyr skeen its a normal reaction, but as they say beauty needs secrefying ;)</li>
            <li>Plus its good only for flat surface.</li>
            <li>They work great after sitting in my hot towel cabby for 4-5 minutes, without warming them though they are very hard and do not get or hold suction very well.</li>
            <li>and I felt like they certainly relieved some tension</li>
            <li>these are great little suckers, they are ok for what they are supposed to do</li>
            <li>my skin(legs) looks smooth and the cellulite is finally disappearing!!!!</li>
            <li>this product really works</li>
            <li>Your skin will feel much tighter, too, in the areas where you use these cups.</li>
            <li>As pictured.....works very well....</li>
            <li>and i recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>I dont have much at all, but what I do have it bothers me.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and it is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>You have to really keep it up to see progress.</li>
            <li>this tool works fairly well is very time consuming and should be completed at least twice a week for results</li>
            <li>Works good but expect some bruises at first at least until you get used to it!</li>
            <li>Other sellers are trying to sell for much more money, rediculous prices.  </li>
            <li>They are kind of small for hip work.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, the plastic has just the right flexibility and the edges are not sharp.</li>
            <li>The more you use it the less bruises will you get, as the cellulite is breaking down.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just trust me, the more you use it, the less it will hurt.</li>
            <li>Super simple solution!</li>
            <li>and when I had got bigger I got more cellulite on the back of my thigh</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s a matter of how much suction you are using and how sensitive you are.  </li>
            <li>I have had professional massages before and it was hurtful even on my arms ( and I am a very slim girl).</li>
            <li>waste your time, just get some electric massager which will do better job times faster.</li>
            <li>Better to be used with baby oil and a few drops of orange oil</li>
            <li>Works just be constant and realistic !!</li>
            <li>This item is more than I expected!!!!</li>
            <li>Bought this very hopeful it would work, barely works.</li>
            <li>I apply Weleda Birch Cellulite Oil first, and then rub the vacuum over my problem areas.  </li>
            <li>As soon as you try to move it along natural curves</li>
            <li>(It doesn&#x27;t surprised me, I knew it since I purchased)</li>
            <li>Cellulite naturally hurts.</li>
            <li>Just stick with it and make sure you massage for at least 10-15 minutes on each area.</li>
            <li>Like it  leave my skin soft</li>
            <li>and so far is working.</li>
            <li>I like the way it vacuum your skin, I really like the product</li>
            <li>The Nivea works very well and allows enough lubrication to pull the cups over my problem areas without much resistance (other than what the suction is supposed to provide) or pain.</li>
            <li>Now I am trying a new method and have to include my butt and back of my thighs.</li>
            <li>If you have major cellulite, just do squats, but if you do squats/lunges and still have some not so toned/smooth skin, this should work.</li>
            <li>I got these (you only need one, really) to help with loose skin following weight loss.</li>
            <li>did not buy it on amazon, but let me tell you it is the same as vacuum massage you would get in professional salon.</li>
            <li>It sucks very strong, but It hurt a little bit.  </li>
            <li>It hurts a lot at first, because the un-even fatty tissues are torn up, but with the use the pain diminishes and then goes away.</li>
            <li>I especially like to rub it across my chest and back, as I have allergies and the vacuum action seems to be helping some.  </li>
            <li>These little things work much better!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Too little for too much space</li>
            <li>I had pain in my neck and thanks to this little friend</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is an amazing product and it really works!</li>
            <li> Do I think they&#x27;ll make my thighs smooth and free of all cellulite?</li>
            <li> Great suction especially with use of the Juniper oil.</li>
            <li> I bought it for light massage to increase blood flow.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It ok for a stater, but for me I ended up ordering a more professional kit that I was able to control the suction.</li>
            <li> but right now it okay</li>
            <li> Perfect for small areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with what I see so far.</li>
            <li> First I was very excited about this jar for massage.</li>
            <li> However, the suction is also making my spider veins more apparent, but I hope to combat this with more cardio.</li>
            <li> I love it a lot, because it doesn&#x27;t take too much time (literally 5-10 min for both legs and butt)</li>
            <li> The only good thing is that the seller was prompt with the delivery, however that is not part of the rating of this product.</li>
            <li> purchased this product based on the good reviews it had, and the low cost..</li>
            <li> It would be good to also have the bigger size silicon cup and beginners may want to start with that.</li>
            <li> It took a couple uses to figure out the best method, but now my whole routine takes less then 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> it is simple but so handy and useful!</li>
            <li> we so enjoy them , they are wonderfull for head aches an back aches to ,and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> 5 minutes just isn&#x27;t long enough to see the best results.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and work fine</li>
            <li> Great for working out little pockets of sinew.</li>
            <li> As far as helping with the cellulite, it is ok.</li>
            <li> Been trying it every day right when im taking a shower dont know what stage my cellulite is</li>
            <li> I use it with baby oil, right after the shower.</li>
            <li> I have it for 3 years and it still same good quality as new.</li>
            <li> so more than likely I&#x27;m returning it.  </li>
            <li> They hurt at first, but just keep using them.</li>
            <li> I think these actually work better on severe cellulite</li>
            <li> When I first started this</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says, massage cellulite.</li>
            <li> stuff really works!</li>
            <li> It arrived exactly as description said.</li>
            <li> the first 3-4 weeks</li>
            <li> You will see results pretty soon.</li>
            <li> less \\&quot;dimples\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very pleased.</li>
            <li> So these cups have a long history in Russia &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> i used them many times but the problem is that after using u will have a blue spots on yoyr skeen its a normal reaction, but as they say beauty needs secrefying ;)</li>
            <li> Plus its good only for flat surface.</li>
            <li> They work great after sitting in my hot towel cabby for 4-5 minutes, without warming them though they are very hard and do not get or hold suction very well.</li>
            <li> and I felt like they certainly relieved some tension</li>
            <li> these are great little suckers, they are ok for what they are supposed to do</li>
            <li> my skin(legs) looks smooth and the cellulite is finally disappearing!!!!</li>
            <li> this product really works</li>
            <li> Your skin will feel much tighter, too, in the areas where you use these cups.</li>
            <li> As pictured.....works very well....</li>
            <li> and i recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> I dont have much at all, but what I do have it bothers me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and it is very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> You have to really keep it up to see progress.</li>
            <li> this tool works fairly well is very time consuming and should be completed at least twice a week for results</li>
            <li> Works good but expect some bruises at first at least until you get used to it!</li>
            <li> Other sellers are trying to sell for much more money, rediculous prices.  </li>
            <li> They are kind of small for hip work.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended, the plastic has just the right flexibility and the edges are not sharp.</li>
            <li> The more you use it the less bruises will you get, as the cellulite is breaking down.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just trust me, the more you use it, the less it will hurt.</li>
            <li> Super simple solution!</li>
            <li> and when I had got bigger I got more cellulite on the back of my thigh</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s a matter of how much suction you are using and how sensitive you are.  </li>
            <li> I have had professional massages before and it was hurtful even on my arms ( and I am a very slim girl).</li>
            <li> waste your time, just get some electric massager which will do better job times faster.</li>
            <li> Better to be used with baby oil and a few drops of orange oil</li>
            <li> Works just be constant and realistic !!</li>
            <li> This item is more than I expected!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this very hopeful it would work, barely works.</li>
            <li> I apply Weleda Birch Cellulite Oil first, and then rub the vacuum over my problem areas.  </li>
            <li> As soon as you try to move it along natural curves</li>
            <li> (It doesn&#x27;t surprised me, I knew it since I purchased)</li>
            <li> Cellulite naturally hurts.</li>
            <li> Just stick with it and make sure you massage for at least 10-15 minutes on each area.</li>
            <li> Like it  leave my skin soft</li>
            <li> and so far is working.</li>
            <li> I like the way it vacuum your skin, I really like the product</li>
            <li> The Nivea works very well and allows enough lubrication to pull the cups over my problem areas without much resistance (other than what the suction is supposed to provide) or pain.</li>
            <li> Now I am trying a new method and have to include my butt and back of my thighs.</li>
            <li> If you have major cellulite, just do squats, but if you do squats/lunges and still have some not so toned/smooth skin, this should work.</li>
            <li> I got these (you only need one, really) to help with loose skin following weight loss.</li>
            <li> did not buy it on amazon, but let me tell you it is the same as vacuum massage you would get in professional salon.</li>
            <li> It sucks very strong, but It hurt a little bit.  </li>
            <li> It hurts a lot at first, because the un-even fatty tissues are torn up, but with the use the pain diminishes and then goes away.</li>
            <li> I especially like to rub it across my chest and back, as I have allergies and the vacuum action seems to be helping some.  </li>
            <li> These little things work much better!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Too little for too much space</li>
            <li> I had pain in my neck and thanks to this little friend</li>
            <li> Im not a lazy person to do this personal beauty things at night, I mean is easy to do it while you watching the tv, reading your emails but, is too small.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased this product and so far i&#x27;m seeing a little bit of improvement.</li>
            <li> So I have been using these daily for at least 10 minutes - 30 max in both circular and straight motions towards my heart.</li>
            <li> First off, for all of you who gave it 1 star because it hurts, that&#x27;s just ridiculous.</li>
            <li> tried RF and ultra sound - expensive and ineffective.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it a 4 star is because it can hurt quite a bit, and if you aren&#x27;t careful, you will bruise yourself.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long, but I&#x27;m already seeing a noticeable improvement in my stomach area.</li>
            <li> I agree with the one review on here that said these cups made their cellulite worse because they did the exact same thing to me</li>
            <li> First of all, those who probably tried these jars a couple of times and now screaming -ayayay, common!</li>
            <li> Not only it helps to improve yor cellulitis appearance, it also helps with a number of other issues.</li>
            <li> I have a mild case of cellulite and it seems to have broken it up a little bit and redistributed it.</li>
            <li> and I followed the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> My rump used to be firm, the back of my thighs did not have any cellulite.</li>
            <li> For example you always want to drag the cup toward your heart.</li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve only used them a few times, I can already tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> I only tried it for a few days</li>
            <li> Used a few times after watching YouTube video tutorials  since the packaging isnt in english.</li>
            <li> You have to get deep under your skin in order to break all uneven parts underneath of it, that you accumulated over years of your life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use it few times only and it seams  to have an effect .</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I use it in the shower with baby oil.</li>
            <li> and my hands get tired when using these, so your hands definitely will too if you&#x27;re not trained to use them constantly.</li>
            <li> They seem to be working but have taken a little longer to see results than expected.</li>
            <li> The only downside is when using an oil based massage oil, it can be hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles, hardly visable and only because I am looking for them.  </li>
            <li> They left pretty ugly bruisers, but it helped.</li>
            <li> I received these last week and have used them at least once a day since then.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to hurt because it&#x27;s breaking down the tissue.</li>
            <li> Although I am considered thin, I had developed angry red wrinkles above my stomach(two of them, about an inch and a half apart running across my abs).  </li>
            <li> and i followed as directed and even used them with massage oil and instead of making my cellulite less visible</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe reviews half the time I read them, But I have to say I see a difference.</li>
            <li> Made a slight change, not not noticeable.</li>
            <li> One complaint is that the cups are not absolutely clear so you cannot observe changes in skin color.</li>
            <li> Its small and you need a lot of time and effort to cover even not large area of your body.</li>
            <li> , it arrived a little ahead of time</li>
            <li> Or you might have to use them for a few weeks before you notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I have just a tiny spot on my thigh, I am thin and I exercise, but one spot has bugged me, so I decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> in just a few weeks I will notice the cellulite disappearing.</li>
            <li> I used these everyday before bed for about 10-15 mins on each area.</li>
            <li> I usually apply the oil on my belly while lying down in bed, then put the cups on and slide them around for a while...</li>
            <li> It does leave bruising and redness because it&#x27;s breaking down fat, but what I didn&#x27;t like was that, since the cups are so small, your hands slide off because of the oil or cream you use.</li>
            <li> I just really wish it hadn&#x27;t mad the cellulite spread.</li>
            <li> It was quite painful using these cup for the first couple of times but as time went on the pain improved and it was easier to do the massage.</li>
            <li> The cup is hard to squeeze so you get little suction while its placed on your skin,</li>
            <li> but there are no sure shots for cellulite and for this price you have very little to lose if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> It would help if instructions came with this -- not really sure if I am using it correctly.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if I am using it</li>
            <li> Im not sure that it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Im usually in the gym for an hour.</li>
            <li> Once you get past that part it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a month I have no more dimples</li>
            <li> People, especially women, get a lot of &amp;#34;nuts&amp;#34; in our bodies and it is painful to break them loose.</li>
            <li> they made it worse like it was spread to other places on my body where i didn&#x27;t have cellulite before.</li>
            <li> They are very stiff and take some hand strength to use.  </li>
            <li> Hard to say.</li>
            <li> to hard to do with my hands</li>
            <li> This product is a bit hard to use, though, because after 2 minutes of using, my hand hurts (since you need to squeeze really hard as the plastic is thick).</li>
            <li> remember how my grandma used the same cups (but they were glass cups) and fire to remove air from them as a treatment for severe cold and flu: she put cups on our backs and let it stay for a while.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s at least a 30% improvement.</li>
            <li> But do I think they&#x27;ll improve the way they look by at least 80%?</li>
            <li> I want to note I have also been doing specific strength training and cardio exercises that target cellulite, as well as cutting out almost all carbs and all sugars except those derived from fruits &amp; veggies.  </li>
            <li> This product is very small to cover all your skin</li>
            <li> only problem is that it hurts really bad.</li>
            <li> Your hands will get tired - I&#x27;m a massage therapist</li>
            <li> I have heard reviews that cupping can make this worse</li>
            <li> I have already noticed a change in how the cellulite feels under my skin; its as if it is smoothing out and being broken up by the suction of the cups.</li>
            <li> must warn you that it is a little painful</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this as I didn&#x27;t know if this would work.</li>
            <li> It you use it wrong you could harm your body.  </li>
            <li> It is helping with both detox and appearance, but also with pain spots and adhesions along the outer thigh - the infamous IT band.</li>
            <li> I was unable to find any site that could give me just the basics, so they are sitting on my dresser.</li>
            <li> I have a bad back, horrible posture, and sit at a computer all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this cup because I have bad leg pain, I have a job</li>
            <li> I stand all day, plus bad circulation runs on both sides of my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> While I have never used massage for cellulite, I have read about how vigorous and even painful the massages must be to see any results.</li>
            <li> Also it helps oils (I use it with base oil+essentials) get into skin, which helps too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But it gets annoying to use it.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very good massage vacuum cup, improve the circulation and cream absorption.</li>
            <li> Good on sore muscles.</li>
            <li> I love these cups,they&#x27;re convenient and easy to use, perfect size for a quick cupping massage after shower the best</li>
            <li> Recieved this product early and it works great. I would recommend this product to my friends and family.  Highly recommend</li>
            <li> we so enjoy them , they are wonderfull for head aches an back aches to ,and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to try this as I didn&#x27;t know if this would work. I have been using this for quite a while now and see great improvement in my skin. Combining the massage with exercise will greatly help in the way your skin looks and feels. It was quite painful using these cup for the first couple of times but as time went on the pain improved and it was easier to do the massage. I recommend using some type of oil before you start your massage to make it slide around better. I am still using these cups and hope that my cellulite disappears entirely.</li>
            <li> Just got it today! It definitely helps my muscles loosen up.</li>
            <li> Super simple solution! I love it a lot, because it doesn&#x27;t take too much time (literally 5-10 min for both legs and butt), I can see how my blood begins to circulate and I feel like my cellulite is giving up! Also it helps oils (I use it with base oil+essentials) get into skin, which helps too.&lt;br /&gt;I tried RF and ultra sound - expensive and ineffective. These little things work much better!&lt;br /&gt;I remember how my grandma used the same cups (but they were glass cups) and fire to remove air from them as a treatment for severe cold and flu: she put cups on our backs and let it stay for a while. They left pretty ugly bruisers, but it helped. So these cups have a long history in Russia &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Works just be constant and realistic !! 👍✨</li>
            <li> it is really great stuff if you use it right. did not buy it on amazon, but let me tell you it is the same as vacuum massage you would get in professional salon.</li>
            <li> Too little for too much space</li>
            <li> For the price~ it&#x27;s a winner!  I like this item.  I will use it often.  Other sellers are trying to sell for much more money, rediculous prices.  I LOVE the price, it arrived a little ahead of time and I believe it will help with cellulite.</li>
            <li> It would help if instructions came with this -- not really sure if I am using it correctly. It comes from an Eastern European country - works well....I think -- but I&#x27;m not sure if I am using it they way I should</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and it really works!</li>
            <li> Works Great! Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It works! I use it every day, in the shower with baby oil. At the first it hurt a bit, but this because of the lack of elasticity of your skin and where the problem is more severe, it gets better with time! Now it feels so good my skin(legs) looks smooth and the cellulite is finally disappearing!!!! I definitely recoment it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they work at all and I followed the directions carefully. Maybe others had better luck with them.</li>
            <li> My skin feels much better, I still using, I need more time to see the cellulite.</li>
            <li> This is a great size cupp.  I use them all the time. They are perfect to use on myself. Great deal.</li>
            <li> i used them many times but the problem is that after using u will have a blue spots on yoyr skeen its a normal reaction, but as they say beauty needs secrefying ;)</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for about 2 weeks and I see some change.  I especially like to rub it across my chest and back, as I have allergies and the vacuum action seems to be helping some.  As far as helping with the cellulite, it is ok. I apply Weleda Birch Cellulite Oil first, and then rub the vacuum over my problem areas.  Some days I don&#x27;t have time to do this, so I hope with continued use the problem areas will look smoother.</li>
            <li> The cup is hard to squeeze so you get little suction while its placed on your skin, so more than likely I&#x27;m returning it.  The only good thing is that the seller was prompt with the delivery, however that is not part of the rating of this product.</li>
            <li> Im not sure that it does what it is supposed to do. I tried it on myself , I didnt care for product</li>
            <li> Was pretty awesome, my mom liked it very much.</li>
            <li> I agree with the one review on here that said these cups made their cellulite worse because they did the exact same thing to me and i followed as directed and even used them with massage oil and instead of making my cellulite less visible they made it worse like it was spread to other places on my body where i didn&#x27;t have cellulite before. These cups may work for others but they are definitely NOT for me. I will NOT be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> these are great little suckers, they are ok for what they are supposed to do but i recommend the ones that are with the pump, vacuumed sealed they do a much better job of holding on to your skin.</li>
            <li> this product really works</li>
            <li> There is a noticeable difference in skin tautness and firmness after just 5-7 mins on any area! When used with topical pain relieving products, it improves efficacy.</li>
            <li> its ok it is durable but have not see results yet. Been trying it every day right when im taking a shower dont know what stage my cellulite is so maybe it needs more time</li>
            <li> Perfect for small areas. Works well for acumassage too. Easy to handle. Going to buy more soon as payday comes around</li>
            <li> The manufacture of this product is realley trying to help people with cellulite. They would not have to go throught liffo sucktion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the cellulite cups for 2 weeks but there&#x27;s at least a 30% improvement. I use it on my toosh and thighs daily for about 20 minutes and it works. They hurt at first, but just keep using them. Your hands will get tired - I&#x27;m a massage therapist and my hands get tired when using these, so your hands definitely will too if you&#x27;re not trained to use them constantly. I&#x27;m very pleased with what I see so far. Do I think they&#x27;ll make my thighs smooth and free of all cellulite? No. But do I think they&#x27;ll improve the way they look by at least 80%? Yeah, actually. Your skin will feel much tighter, too, in the areas where you use these cups. You might see an improvement as soon as you use them or it might not be until the next day. Or you might have to use them for a few weeks before you notice any difference. Hard to say. Go online and do some research on how to use these before attempting it. I think these actually work better on severe cellulite and I would give them 5 stars but they hurt sometimes.</li>
            <li> It works, it&#x27;s labor intensive but if you want to luck great in shorts or a bathing suit this will help achieve it.</li>
            <li> I have two kids and when I had got bigger I got more cellulite on the back of my thigh and I&#x27;m not even big and so embarrassed couldn&#x27;t even wear short dress or short. Then I bought the cups and said IMA try them hope it work. Been already 4weeks and my cellulite are going away!! I love the cupping I just wish I would have done it ealry but its a good product.. Must Get It :))</li>
            <li> to hard to do with my hands</li>
            <li> Gave me big purple suction marks all over my tighs that took over a week to fade.</li>
            <li> I love it! it is simple but so handy and useful! I had pain in my neck and thanks to this little friend it was heeled!</li>
            <li> Love! need I say more!!!</li>
            <li> Good quality suction cups. Very easy to use. I use almond oil with them in the shower. They seem to be working but have taken a little longer to see results than expected. Its been 3 weeks since beginning to use them and I&#x27;m just now seeing some benefits. I have a mild case of cellulite and it seems to have broken it up a little bit and redistributed it. For the price, I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t understand the instructions, but before I have been using this kind of jars. Great price for what you get.</li>
            <li> Great suction especially with use of the Juniper oil. The only downside is when using an oil based massage oil, it can be hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li> Have n&#x27;t seen a significant reduction in my cellulite, but I love the massage I get from this product. It is a good-buy.</li>
            <li> First I was very excited about this jar for massage. But it gets annoying to use it. Its small and you need a lot of time and effort to cover even not large area of your body. Plus its good only for flat surface. As soon as you try to move it along natural curves it falls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise its ok. I used it for about a year. Don&#x27;t wait to see any result please. It will not help you to get rid if cellulite. It was not my goal. I bought it for light massage to increase blood flow.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your time, just get some electric massager which will do better job times faster.</li>
            <li> Loved it really helps with cerulation</li>
            <li> As pictured.....works very well....though can&#x27;t say the cellulite has vanished.</li>
            <li> it seems to work very good. i like using it when taking a bath or when i watch something on bed, i just start rubbing my legs with it.</li>
            <li> It ok for a stater, but for me I ended up ordering a more professional kit that I was able to control the suction. This is a good starter until you get u to it.</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s great and easy to work with. Perfect for the so much needed anti-cellulite maintenance. A quality product.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s actually working. And I said &amp;#34;I think&amp;#34; because my cellulite has defiantly improved, but I also do Pilates and use coffee soap so I guess the three of them are doing the job. This product is a bit hard to use, though, because after 2 minutes of using, my hand hurts (since you need to squeeze really hard as the plastic is thick).</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and work fine</li>
            <li> For me it is working but do not expect a miracle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these cups every day for five minutes a leg for the last two months. When I started, I only had cellulite on the sides of my thighs.  Very deep cellulite which I&#x27;ve had for 15 years(since I was a teenager).  This made sense in theory, so I decided to give it my all. I did not try any creams or lotions with it. Anyways, after about a month, I started noticing more cellulite. My rump used to be firm, the back of my thighs did not have any cellulite. It seems the fat was redistributed. Now I am trying a new method and have to include my butt and back of my thighs. This may work for some but not for others.  I have heard reviews that cupping can make this worse but I see reviews here that do appear to be valid(not just one product review but from actual customers) so I wonder what the difference is. When I first started this I did a lot of research on the internet and could actually not find anyone saying this worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving the product 3 stars because I found something it helps with-wrinkles. I have a bad back, horrible posture, and sit at a computer all day. Although I am considered thin, I had developed angry red wrinkles above my stomach(two of them, about an inch and a half apart running across my abs).  I started using this on them about 30 seconds each line, and they are GONE. Redness, gone. Wrinkles, hardly visable and only because I am looking for them.  These are well made cups and the price is unbeatable and very fair. I just really wish it hadn&#x27;t mad the cellulite spread.</li>
            <li> Great product! It&#x27;s help me a lot! I love it and i recommend it highly! Great ! Great! Great!! :)</li>
            <li> I have just a tiny spot on my thigh, I am thin and I exercise, but one spot has bugged me, so I decided to give this a try. The only reason I give it a 4 star is because it can hurt quite a bit, and if you aren&#x27;t careful, you will bruise yourself. I noticed a difference in a matter of days. I use it with baby oil, right after the shower. I will continue to use and I already have recommended this product to a friend who now uses it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe reviews half the time I read them, But I have to say I see a difference. I workout 5 days a week, I do cardio for 20 mins and weights Im usually in the gym for an hour. without working out I DONT think you will see a difference. I do the cupping 5mins on each leg and I have noticed tightness and Im sure in just a few weeks I will notice the cellulite disappearing. I dont have much at all, but what I do have it bothers me.</li>
            <li> This item is alright.  I am a massage therapist and got these to use during massage for the back, its called cupping. They work great after sitting in my hot towel cabby for 4-5 minutes, without warming them though they are very hard and do not get or hold suction very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this cup because I have bad leg pain, I have a job were I stand all day, plus bad circulation runs on both sides of my family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this cup massager, I was very pleased. It did feel good to use sometimes, but it was sometimes painful to use on my legs, but  after I was done massaging my legs always felt better. You have to get used to the suction. It seemed to loosen up my skin and fat. It felt like my skin had more elasticity. I then tried using it on my arms and had good results there too. Then I got my boyfriend to give me a back massage with it, and OMG. It felt SOOOO good. No pain at all, it just felt amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So over all I do recommend this product, I think it&#x27;s a fair price for what it does. Just make sure you read up a bit on how you should use the cup correctly. It you use it wrong you could harm your body.  For example you always want to drag the cup toward your heart.</li>
            <li> Great for scar mobilization.  Interesting effects on the appearance of cellulite as well.  I dont read russian but that is what it is advertized for.</li>
            <li> I bought these along with their \\&quot;Fitness Cafe\\&quot; anti-cellulite oil. I was very pleased with the quality, looks like I&#x27;m gonna get some years of use outta them. I usually apply the oil on my belly while lying down in bed, then put the cups on and slide them around for a while...I applied so much pressure a couple times that I got bruises, but that&#x27;s ok, because I&#x27;ve already seen good results (less \\&quot;dimples\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very pleased.</li>
            <li> I got these (you only need one, really) to help with loose skin following weight loss. Although I&#x27;ve only used them a few times, I can already tell a difference.  It is helping with both detox and appearance, but also with pain spots and adhesions along the outer thigh - the infamous IT band. Highly recommended, the plastic has just the right flexibility and the edges are not sharp.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long, but I&#x27;m already seeing a noticeable improvement in my stomach area. The skin is smoother, and I don&#x27;t see cellulite there anymore. There&#x27;s still cellulite on my butt and thighs, but I&#x27;m working on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that it hurts really bad. You&#x27;re supposed to massage for ten minutes in each area you want to work on, but I can only stand about five or six minutes before I need to stop.</li>
            <li> I received these last week and have used them at least once a day since then. It took a couple uses to figure out the best method, but now my whole routine takes less then 10 minutes. I use Nivea&#x27;s Good-Bye Cellulite serum instead of an oil. The Nivea works very well and allows enough lubrication to pull the cups over my problem areas without much resistance (other than what the suction is supposed to provide) or pain. [[ASIN:B002UUT43W Nivea Good-bye Cellulite Skin Firming Serum Q10 plus, 2.5-Ounce Tube]]  I have already noticed a change in how the cellulite feels under my skin; its as if it is smoothing out and being broken up by the suction of the cups. However, the suction is also making my spider veins more apparent, but I hope to combat this with more cardio. I do not yet SEE a difference in my cellulite, but do feel a difference when I massage my problem areas from before I used the cups. The cellulite feels like it is softening and breaking up underneath my skin.  I want to note I have also been doing specific strength training and cardio exercises that target cellulite, as well as cutting out almost all carbs and all sugars except those derived from fruits &amp; veggies.  I will be updating this review with my progress and hope to SEE results in about 6 weeks or so.</li>
            <li> Works good but expect some bruises at first at least until you get used to it!</li>
            <li> The instructions on the container are sparse. I tried Google searches to find out the best way to use, the best parts of the body to start with, how often, how much time per session, best oils/lotions to use, average length of use until results are seen. I was unable to find any site that could give me just the basics, so they are sitting on my dresser. On the positive side they are a great conversation piece!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says, massage cellulite. I only tried it for a few days and I&#x27;m sure if you keep using them you will see results. It does leave bruising and redness because it&#x27;s breaking down fat, but what I didn&#x27;t like was that, since the cups are so small, your hands slide off because of the oil or cream you use. Therefore, I choose to return them and will order the aspire fat girl slim lean machine and give that a try.</li>
            <li> I like the way it vacuum your skin, I really like the product, I wish I have more of them but right now it okay</li>
            <li> After years of struggling with cellulite I proudly say that the nightmare is almost over!&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product based on the good reviews it had, and the low cost..Let me tell you I do not regret it one bit! It&#x27;s been the best $6 I&#x27;ve ever spent!. I use them while watching TV, in the shower ir whenever I can. I think consistency it&#x27;s key!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using the cups for almost 2 weeks once a day (and riding my bike 3 times a week). I could say my cellulite issue is 75% corrected, It&#x27;s unbelievable!&lt;br /&gt;I must warn you that it is a little painful BUT you can control the suction also, I would recommend to use with some type of lubricant (cream, oil, etc).&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really works! My husband noticed the difference so I guess the change is visible.</li>
            <li> This product is very small to cover all your skin (It doesn&#x27;t surprised me, I knew it since I purchased) It sucks very strong, but It hurt a little bit.  I think this is how suppose to work.  Im not a lazy person to do this personal beauty things at night, I mean is easy to do it while you watching the tv, reading your emails but, is too small. That&#x27;s how I felt.</li>
            <li> It arrived exactly as description said. Used a few times after watching YouTube video tutorials  since the packaging isnt in english.</li>
            <li> I have it for 3 years and it still same good quality as new. No need to hassle with fire. Best usage for me: in the bath or with oil.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and it is very inexpensive. It would be good to also have the bigger size silicon cup and beginners may want to start with that. One complaint is that the cups are not absolutely clear so you cannot observe changes in skin color. It is import to lift the cup and think of restoring sliding surfaces. This works well with the butt and hamstrings but you&#x27;ll have to find stronger suctioned cups if you want a good lift on the quads.</li>
            <li> I love these cups!! I have had vela sessions and to me, this feels comparable and has even better results.  Amazing, since this is basically the price of a coffee and vela sessions are hundreds of dollars each for just one!  I have been using the cups for one week and I definitely see results already - my skin is smoother and tighter. I have gotten bruises from the cups but I would get that from vela too - it&#x27;s a matter of how much suction you are using and how sensitive you are.  To me, bruises are a sign that it&#x27;s working, so I just go for it. Like other reviewers, I use it in the shower with baby oil. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great for working out little pockets of sinew. If you have major cellulite, just do squats, but if you do squats/lunges and still have some not so toned/smooth skin, this should work. You need an oil or slippy lotion or cream or it will be friction city.</li>
            <li> Love these for massages.</li>
            <li> this tool works fairly well is very time consuming and should be completed at least twice a week for results</li>
            <li> First off, for all of you who gave it 1 star because it hurts, that&#x27;s just ridiculous. It&#x27;s going to hurt because it&#x27;s breaking down the tissue. Once you get past that part it doesn&#x27;t hurt anymore. Cellulite naturally hurts. If I push on the cellulite on my thighs it hurts and will even bruise sometimes. After using this product for a month I have no more dimples and I can push on my thighs without it hurting. Also, be prepared to get bruises. The more you use it the less bruises will you get, as the cellulite is breaking down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first 3-4 weeks I used these everyday before bed for about 10-15 mins on each area. I used lots of oil so it was good and slippery. After the 3-4 weeks I only used them 1-2 times a week just for maintenance and my cellulite hasn&#x27;t returned. This is the only product that has helped me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have patience and give it a try. Just stick with it and make sure you massage for at least 10-15 minutes on each area. 5 minutes just isn&#x27;t long enough to see the best results.</li>
            <li> It does work. You have to really keep it up to see progress. It hurts a lot at first, because the un-even fatty tissues are torn up, but with the use the pain diminishes and then goes away. You can regulate suction (and intensity with it) by pressing on the jar. Not only it improves our looks, but the health of our blood vessels, skin and mussels as well.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased this product and so far i&#x27;m seeing a little bit of improvement. I only been using it for a couple of weeks, but I do see results!</li>
            <li> Am still using it, and I have seen some changes.</li>
            <li> Like it  leave my skin soft</li>
            <li> Bought this very hopeful it would work, barely works. Made a slight change, not not noticeable. Get what u pay for</li>
            <li> First of all, those who probably tried these jars a couple of times and now screaming -ayayay, common! If the procedure hurts, it&#x27;s working! People, especially women, get a lot of &amp;#34;nuts&amp;#34; in our bodies and it is painful to break them loose. I have had professional massages before and it was hurtful even on my arms ( and I am a very slim girl). You have to get deep under your skin in order to break all uneven parts underneath of it, that you accumulated over years of your life. Just trust me, the more you use it, the less it will hurt. You will start liking the feeling of blood streaming in your body! I feel great after every procedure! My skin improves dramatically. Just give it a rest, do it for  2 weeks to a month and then rest for 4 months. I recommend these jars to everyone! Not only it helps to improve yor cellulitis appearance, it also helps with a number of other issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use it few times only and it seams  to have an effect .</li>
            <li> They are very stiff and take some hand strength to use.  I wish I had looked further into this and maybe bought bigger cups.  They are kind of small for hip work.  Actually pretty good for the price but again requires good hand strength.</li>
            <li> i use this simle product during my shower with a baby oil.i can see result.it is magic.i i bought another one to my sister&lt;br /&gt;love it</li>
            <li> I used them a couple times a week on my back after I had pinched a nerve and I felt like they certainly relieved some tension, I recommend them!</li>
            <li> Great for working with cellulite, just put some oil on your skin and move jars all over the problem area. You will see results pretty soon.</li>
            <li> The best product ever been made to fight cellulite, esp if you know how to use it right ! Better to be used with baby oil and a few drops of orange oil</li>
            <li> I have tried different ideas to help with my cellulite. This is the best solution and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> While I have never used massage for cellulite, I have read about how vigorous and even painful the massages must be to see any results. So I have been using these daily for at least 10 minutes - 30 max in both circular and straight motions towards my heart. I have been using a bit of olive oil for the massage and will try again for another 20 days or so with Nivea cellulite/firming body lotion instead. I have already been massaging daily for over 20 days and haven&#x27;t seen a change. I work out doing both cardio and strength training and have never been overweight in my life, just have cellulite that I would like to improve if possible. For the price, I&#x27;d recommend trying but there are no sure shots for cellulite and for this price you have very little to lose if it doesn&#x27;t work for you.</li>
            <li> This item is more than I expected!!!! Good quality ,you control the suction. I&#x27;ve been using it to treat cellulite and so far is working. Love it!</li>
