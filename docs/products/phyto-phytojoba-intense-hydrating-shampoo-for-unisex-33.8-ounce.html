            <li>Best Shampoo on the market.  </li>
            <li>Very happy with results.</li>
            <li>,i found this product and i am very happy with</li>
            <li>Otherwise great shampoo!</li>
            <li>Phyto does my hair best!</li>
            <li>The Phytojoba smells wonderful and lathers/cleanses my hair in that perfect balance that doesn&#x27;t feel like it stripped my hair and still manages to leave it soft too.</li>
            <li>Love This Stuff!</li>
            <li>Kind of like a tropical banana smoothie.</li>
            <li>This shampoo cleans and moisturizes my hair effectively while smelling heavenly.</li>
            <li>For best results, use with the Phytojoba Intense Hydrating Masque.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended excellent products.</li>
            <li>It is so watery you have to use a lot of it because most just pours out of your hand.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been a Phyto user, specifically Phytojoba user, for many years now.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>The one of the many great things about Phyto products is that they work so well right away, and the full benefits and improvement to hair increases over time.</li>
            <li>The price is good too, considering you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is excellent for both relaxed and not relaxed hair, for caucasian and black hair; I love it, my boyfriend (who used to think that soap was sufficient) loves it, my children like to come and and use it too.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li>Great fragrance of coconut, silky texture, detangles, rinses light simply</li>
            <li>I bought this particular shampoo because of the large size and very good price - it will last for quite sometime.</li>
            <li>Consequently we use it up pretty fast and it is nice to be able to get it in a larger container.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is very hydrating and in this summers heat it is well appreciated!!</li>
            <li>This is a good, gentle shampoo for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>would not recommend purchasing this product and certainly will not again.</li>
            <li>Phytojoba Intense Hydrating Shampoo and the corresponding Phytojoba Intesnse Hydrating Mask are the products that helped me grow my hair from ear to arm pit length, and I was a fool to ever stop using them -</li>
            <li>mostly water...not like other phyto shampoos</li>
            <li>I have owned this shampoo before, purchased from a salon, and it is normally crystal clear, however this one has a pearly look to it and does not leave my dry ultra fine hair feeling any better than any other off the shelf shampoo.  </li>
            <li>The large bottle makes it so much easier to use with wet hands.</li>
            <li>Makes hair sleek and soft.  </li>
            <li>I switch using this and some T-gel for a complete hair health.</li>
            <li>the bottle is pretty heavy and the shampoo is very runny</li>
            <li>Not what I expected, I do not even think it&#x27;s the real thing.</li>
            <li>and i love them.my hair has been dry and dull for a while</li>

            <li> Not too long ago, I decided I was going to &amp;</li>
            <li> The shampoo that I received was clearly NOT the shampoo that is made my Phyto.  </li>
            <li> it.a little goes a long way,i have long hair</li>
            <li> so be careful not to pour it all out!</li>
            <li> My relaxed hair was dry and breaking, dull and lifeless.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to someone who has thick dry hair.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am a fool no more.</li>
            <li> Buying the liter instead of the individual bottles will save money AND reduce the number of times I need to have that annoying discussion about how store-bought brands are NOT the same!  </li>
            <li> I was offered another one, as a replacement when I complained, but why would I accept another just like it?  </li>
            <li> #34;save money&amp;#34; on hair care and use &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; less expensive products.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is very thin and does not seem like the phyto products I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> Terrible waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Best Shampoo on the market.  Makes my hair shine like Orion&#x27;s belt.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected, I do not even think it&#x27;s the real thing. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Makes hair sleek and soft.  Would recommend this product to someone who has thick dry hair. Very happy with results.</li>
            <li> mostly water...not like other phyto shampoos and I use the products all the time.  Terrible waste of money.  Will not order again.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for years and now my husband can&#x27;t use anything else.  Consequently we use it up pretty fast and it is nice to be able to get it in a larger container.</li>
            <li> I am convinced this is NOT the product it&#x27;s supposed to be.  I have owned this shampoo before, purchased from a salon, and it is normally crystal clear, however this one has a pearly look to it and does not leave my dry ultra fine hair feeling any better than any other off the shelf shampoo.  I was offered another one, as a replacement when I complained, but why would I accept another just like it?  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I truly thought that ALL vendors on Amazon were legit.  The shampoo that I received was clearly NOT the shampoo that is made my Phyto.  It is so watery you have to use a lot of it because most just pours out of your hand.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend purchasing this product and certainly will not again.</li>
            <li> Product does not have the same consistency or smell as what I purchase from my hairdresser.  There&#x27;s no tamper resistant cap so perhaps it&#x27;s been diluted.</li>
            <li> I have been a Phyto user, specifically Phytojoba user, for many years now. Not too long ago, I decided I was going to &amp;#34;save money&amp;#34; on hair care and use &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; less expensive products. What a mistake! My relaxed hair was dry and breaking, dull and lifeless. Back to Phytojoba I went. I bought this particular shampoo because of the large size and very good price - it will last for quite sometime. The one of the many great things about Phyto products is that they work so well right away, and the full benefits and improvement to hair increases over time. This shampoo is excellent for both relaxed and not relaxed hair, for caucasian and black hair; I love it, my boyfriend (who used to think that soap was sufficient) loves it, my children like to come and and use it too. Phytojoba Intense Hydrating Shampoo and the corresponding Phytojoba Intesnse Hydrating Mask are the products that helped me grow my hair from ear to arm pit length, and I was a fool to ever stop using them - I am a fool no more. Highly recommended excellent products.</li>
            <li> This is a good, gentle shampoo for everyday use.  I like it because it does not strip hair or cause frizzies.</li>
            <li> I have used Phyto products before and i love them.my hair has been dry and dull for a while,i found this product and i am very happy with it.a little goes a long way,i have long hair and i noticed that my hair is cleaner and has a shine.</li>
            <li> Smells Divine! Kind of like a tropical banana smoothie. But not so girly that my husband won&#x27;t use it. Does not come with a pump however. the bottle is pretty heavy and the shampoo is very runny so be careful not to pour it all out! Otherwise great shampoo!</li>
            <li> Great fragrance of coconut, silky texture, detangles, rinses light simply</li>
            <li> My husband is always giving me flack about the cost of my hair products.  Buying the liter instead of the individual bottles will save money AND reduce the number of times I need to have that annoying discussion about how store-bought brands are NOT the same!  :)  Overall I&#x27;m very pleased!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very hydrating and in this summers heat it is well appreciated!! The price is good too, considering you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> Love This Stuff! The large bottle makes it so much easier to use with wet hands.</li>
            <li> Phyto is the only brand I use for my shampoo/conditioner needs. The Phytojoba smells wonderful and lathers/cleanses my hair in that perfect balance that doesn&#x27;t feel like it stripped my hair and still manages to leave it soft too. I switch using this and some T-gel for a complete hair health.</li>
            <li> This shampoo cleans and moisturizes my hair effectively while smelling heavenly. For best results, use with the Phytojoba Intense Hydrating Masque.</li>
            <li> Phyto does my hair best!</li>
            <li> The package came and it had been opened before.  The shampoo is very thin and does not seem like the phyto products I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
