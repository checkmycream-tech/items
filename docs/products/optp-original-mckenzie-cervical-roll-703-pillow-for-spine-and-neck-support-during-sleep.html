            <li>Works great for my &amp;#34;military neck&amp;#34; problem</li>
            <li>This is a great cervical pillow.</li>
            <li>Very effective.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice cervical roll.  </li>
            <li>A definatly good investment.</li>
            <li>My neck has never felt so good.</li>
            <li>Seems good but too soon to tell.</li>
            <li>good purchase.  </li>
            <li>but it is good for your neck.</li>
            <li>so how good could it be?</li>
            <li>It keeps my head at the correct and most ideal height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked so good</li>
            <li>Also comes w good additional info.</li>
            <li>so it does give into the weight of one&#x27;s neck, but that ends up being a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I think the diameter is good but</li>
            <li>the build quality is good, but I think the value is not quite there</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;m good with it.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>McKenzie Cervical Roll, is a good length for sleeping, and if you flop or flip over while sleeping.</li>
            <li>My daughter has a neck pillow that i tried &amp; loved.</li>
            <li>I suppose it is good for the job?  </li>
            <li>Well made, and the foam is of good quality, but it&#x27;s a bit pricey at $18.  </li>
            <li>My husband is very happy with this  OPTP Original McKenzie Cervical Roll.  </li>
            <li>very pleased</li>
            <li>This has been a great aide and it has also helped me in creating a better sleeping posture with my head.</li>
            <li>Love it solved neck pain in the morning, great sleep.  </li>
            <li>just right for the perfect support.</li>
            <li>Your Own Neck&amp;#34; from Amazon for great understanding on the cause of many neck pain issues.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This is a great item for those of us with cervical disk problems, and easy to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li>The first night I used it, I wasn&#x27;t completely happy with it, but I continued to use it and, within a couple of nights, I was really happy with it and sleeping well!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It smells quite strongly of chemicals, but secures my neck superbly for a comfortable night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>Amazing aid to sleep.</li>
            <li>he tried it for a couple nights and then ordered his own.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I found these online.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s a nice unobtrusive size that can be tucked inside your pillow (or not) and has a washable, unzippable cover.</li>
            <li>It fits nicely under my neck and helps with the neck pain that I have been having.  </li>
            <li>Your Own Neck&amp;#34; by Robin McKenzie (recommend) and this pillow was mentioned in the book, so I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because I wanted to have something handy rather than rolling up a towel for support every time as recommended by my doctor, but this just collapses.  </li>
            <li>Ideal fix to make an aging parent more comfortable in her recliner.</li>
            <li>After learning about it from &amp;#34;Treat your own Neck&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I really like this cervical pillow, perfect diameter for me since it has \\&quot;give\\&quot;(unlike</li>
            <li>Kindly advise as to how I can do so.  </li>
            <li>It is the perfect size, and has given my neck so much support.</li>
            <li>in all, I am so happy that I bought this OPTP Original McKenzie Cervical Roll.</li>
            <li>This particular one works great for him, though!</li>
            <li>It does great alone, and I switch to a full pillow when I roll over onto my side.</li>
            <li>perfect fit and right degree of firmness for my neck.  </li>
            <li>I have neck issues and using this allows me to get a good nights sleep, pain free</li>
            <li>The pillow is in as good a shape as it was when I originally bought it.  </li>
            <li>maybe cotton batting or fiber fill would be more suitable for a neck support pillow.</li>
            <li>helps tremendously!!</li>
            <li>I have used this for 3 nights, and so far it is very good.</li>
            <li>I love these cervical rolls...</li>
            <li>I love it, this has eliminated my sore necks.</li>
            <li>I love them and got one since I travel all the time.</li>
            <li>However, be sure to remember to take it out of the case when you leave the motel.</li>
            <li>I put it in with the pillow, and I love it.</li>
            <li>My husband used it and it makes his neck feels better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to change the cover before you use it</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>A miracle has happened today because I actually love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then 2 or 3 years ago I started needing more neck support.</li>
            <li>Now, I find it&#x27;s substantially more comfortable for me with some kind of a pillow</li>
            <li>I just have not been able to find a pillow that I love or even like that:&lt;br /&gt;A.</li>
            <li>It was better than nothing</li>
            <li>I knew there had to be a better solution.</li>
            <li>memory foam/foam rubber idea was just not working any more.</li>
            <li>My neck feels better and better every morning.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to cut it into 2 or 3 equal pieces so it fits perfectly under my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it supports the neck for a more restful nights sleep.</li>
            <li>the roll works perfect and is proper firmness for my needs.</li>
            <li>I love the product.  </li>
            <li>A towel rolled up would be better than this.</li>
            <li>I love this roll.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been a fan of the contour, memory foam type pillows as a side-sleeper, but this works perfect for both side and back sleeping.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it several weeks now and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, really love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient for travel as well :)</li>
            <li>Ok, I used it once and don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li>my neck is better and hubby says I do not snore now.  </li>
            <li>I found that two pillow or a cervical foam pillow helps much more.</li>
            <li>Nice, comfortable neck roll.</li>
            <li>its ok but after some use it flattens and won&#x27;t sit into place.</li>
            <li>But, it sure did.</li>
            <li>I have tried many pillows, tractions, supports to alleviate neck pain.  </li>
            <li>I did learn I need a low profile pillow (5&#x27;4&amp;#34; woman) and the best option for me</li>
            <li>I suppose it&#x27;s better than nothing at all, but I feel like a fool for spending my money on this.  </li>
            <li>My wife and I both use them and are completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use it any more.</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I initially rotated 3 pillows and both cervical rolls to find the best combination for me.</li>
            <li>I put it inside my pillowcase at the edge of my orthopedic pillow to give a better support for my neck during side sleeping.  </li>
            <li>I felt better after sleeping with it and as an added benefit it knocked out my snoring.</li>
            <li>Much better comfort.  </li>
            <li>Much better that Tempur-like pillows.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>This encased version is a bit firmer and more uniform</li>
            <li>so works better than my&lt;br /&gt;version.</li>
            <li>They are absolutely perfect for under the neck and curve of the back.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Really love this pillow.</li>
            <li>and I am confident that I shall be satisfied this time, as well.</li>
            <li>Perfect for that part of neck that does not get enough pillow support.</li>
            <li>, hope it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>I sleep with it in my pillow every night just like the physical therapist told me and it works great!</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>more neck pain when you use this</li>
            <li>No discernible support, regardless of what and how many pillows I stack beneath it.</li>
            <li>Thanks !!!!</li>
            <li>Time will tell if this is a great product or just a decent one.</li>
            <li>The very first one has been the best so far</li>
            <li>The first one I bought was a year ago, and it is still in good shape.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best for people who sleep on their backs, however, with some minor adjustments, a side-sleeper can work with it.  </li>
            <li>Excellent, just as expected.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to sleep more comfortably after having 2 herniated discs.</li>
            <li>Had another one already and this one does not stay in place any better and isn&#x27;t quite as comfortable.</li>
            <li>Using this cervical roll as prescribed provides much more comfortable sleep.  </li>
            <li>Very helpful for nick good for travel</li>
            <li>This neck roll really works well for keeping your head at a good angle to prevent snoring.  </li>
            <li>seams durable and with the right pillow is effective</li>
            <li>Fits in any pillow, can be used without a pillow and is super easy to stuff into my carryon for trips!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted at how comfortable this roll pillow has become and at how much support I feel by using it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use...works immediately</li>
            <li>The cover removes easily for washing.  </li>
            <li>Stuffs easily into my travel suitcase, fits with any size pillow (reg or king).</li>
            <li>Easy to add to my feather pillow for cervical support</li>
            <li>It is lightweight and would be easy for travel.  </li>
            <li>Easy to find on line.</li>
            <li>Easy to take in a suitcase on trips</li>
            <li>Obviously it depends on what is causing your problem if this is right for you or not, but for me it works great!</li>
            <li>have had the original roll and it is way better than this cheap knock off.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, McKenzie&#x27;s book on self-treating your own neck pain was a great help</li>
            <li>Light and slender for easy packing to take along on trips.</li>
            <li>it may be fine others and</li>
            <li>It works fine for that purpose.</li>
            <li>The roll works fine.</li>
            <li>Very strong chemical smell from foam at first.</li>
            <li>Perfect little roll.</li>
            <li>If I had any time available I&#x27;d return it.</li>
            <li>It lets me sleep comfortably.</li>
            <li>Firm and perfect size</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still getting used to it, but I like the look of the washable case, and it fits nicely in my existing pillows and provides extra support for my neck better than the MANY foam pillows I have tried over the years.</li>
            <li>I found the dimensions and firmness comfortable but could not stand the chemical smell of the foam.</li>
            <li>Remember, it just has to fit under the neck -</li>
            <li>Could not get comfortable with it.</li>
            <li>I had nights of sleeplessness because I could not find a way to get my neck to find a comfortable angle.</li>
            <li>That sleeve is important because it allows you to slide the foam roll into the pillow case with the pillow.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find this comfortable to use with any pillow that I have.</li>
            <li>Slip inside your pillowcase and enjoy.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I used it on a recent trip and it fit perfectly into the pillowcase and worked very well.</li>
            <li>I actually love this thing because you put it right inside the pillowcase with the pillow.</li>
            <li>Hasn&#x27;t been very useful.</li>
            <li>I also highly recommend McKenzie&#x27;s Treat Your Own Neck book.</li>
            <li>There is another one, however, (which I don&#x27;t think says original on it)  that he had purchased from a drugstore</li>
            <li>very satisfied with the cervical roll,  i have osteo arthritis and the pillow has helped considerably with neck pain and headaches,</li>
            <li>It takes 3 to 6 months to get your original posture of neck</li>
            <li>I was certainly satisfied with the first</li>
            <li>Great neck support, not to big, just right</li>
            <li>- it is just right!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s taken me forever to find something just the right size!</li>
            <li>No, it doesn&#x27;t smell wonderful when you place your nose next to the bare foam, but it is not at all noticeable when placed inside the pillow case as instructed.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, McKenzie&#x27;s original lumbar roll is great while driving or sitting in a chair.</li>
            <li>While this neck pillow hasn&#x27;t eliminated the pain entirely, I CAN say I didn&#x27;t ever think my neck would feel this good</li>
            <li>He slides it into his pillowcase on top of his pillow and it helps so much.</li>
            <li>Not only are you more comfortable, but better breathing is facilitated as well.  </li>
            <li>good replacement for same item</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy a real one it will be much better for your neck.</li>
            <li>Dry mouth is at a minimum, and CPAP is more effective.</li>
            <li>Fits nicely in the pillow and definitely relieved the symptoms from my herniated disc (very mild symptoms of numbness in fingers).</li>
            <li>As recommended by a McKenzie-certified PT, this roll has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>It has helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li>Fortunately for me, on doctor’s orders I saw a therapist who recommended this product at my first session.</li>
            <li>Even on hot days it is comfortable.</li>
            <li>I had a similar good experience with McKenzie&#x27;s book on treating your own back pain.</li>
            <li>It relieves the pressure and is very good especially if you are having difficulty with your back or neck.  </li>
            <li>It is really helps my neck to be free of pain.</li>
            <li>I rarely use it</li>
            <li>It alleviated some kinks I was getting from sleeping with an old foam mattress.</li>
            <li>Rarely even use it now.</li>
            <li>recommend anyone with upper back or neck issues to consider this product as it provides a level of support that most pillows (even good quality ones) don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Simple design yet effective.</li>
            <li>Added note...be sure to use a soft pillow.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t find it useful.</li>
            <li>but this is worth trying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>So nice to wake up in the morning and finally feel relaxed.</li>
            <li>Really, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this roll.</li>
            <li>For the price it is certainly worth trying</li>
            <li>The tags on the end had to go right away.</li>
            <li>fits just right.</li>
            <li>I should have returned it right away but was in the process of moving</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s exactly right.</li>
            <li>This roll is just the right size to pack in a suitcase and it is lightweight.</li>
            <li>You can put it right in your pillow so it does not slide around</li>
            <li>It fits right into my neck allowing the pillow to support my head.  </li>
            <li>The roll is the right length and diameter, but the density of the foam is of no therapeutic use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right height for my neck.</li>
            <li>This one fits just right for me.  </li>
            <li>Not thick enough to do and good.</li>
            <li>This is the single most important purchase I have ever made.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable and just the right size for under the neck when sleeping on my back.  </li>
            <li>amazing how having your neck properly supported can affect how fast you fall asleep and stay asleep.  </li>
            <li>I like this roll very much.  </li>
            <li>This one looks like my original but it is bigger in circumference making it not as comfortable.</li>
            <li>It flexible, soft &amp; comfortable.</li>
            <li>Perhaps more later</li>
            <li>First the pillow smells.</li>
            <li>When I first saw it I was skeptical, but after trying it I was convinced it was an awesome purchase.</li>
            <li>I bought several for most of my family and my spare bedrooms.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Exactly what my PT used in therapy.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly like the one the therapist used</li>
            <li>This cervical roll has really helped my neck and sleep!  </li>
            <li>the material is a bit crisp -</li>
            <li>I had one of these from 20 years ago from a car accident and it was looking pretty worn.  </li>
            <li>They both help to keep the spine in correct alignment whether sleeping or sitting, which I&#x27;ve learned is key to minimizing pain and maintaining a healthy spine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different pillows to enhance my sleep and none of which helped.</li>
            <li>I will most likely return it</li>
            <li>When it first arrives it&#x27;s a bit shrunken</li>
            <li>Last thing: no horrible chemical smell.</li>
            <li>If so you may want to ask a physical therapist or you doctor if the Cervical Roll will help you sleep better as it has me.</li>
            <li>Most mornings my pain level is reduced by two points on a scale of one to ten since using this cervical roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The foam does smell when it first arrives</li>
            <li>It is soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I bought this and the first night</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Mostly in my lower back, where I have a degenerated disc.</li>
            <li>I wore my first one out.</li>
            <li>I can tell when it needs to be replaced as I wake up with a headaches more than 2 days in a row that started in the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>No relief really!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>: I have the roll on top of a Sleep Innovations Contour Memory Foam Pillow, and they&#x27;re about the same firmness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>zippercover or case is not hard or crispy or plastic-like, and it&#x27;s quite handy and possibly sweat-proof.  </li>
            <li>Recommended by a Physical Therapist, sleeping with this roll has made a significant difference to my once frequent, severe headaches from cervical disc degeneration, and has provided better sleep.</li>
            <li>roll!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard however to find pillowcases to fit it nicely.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m able to sleep better than I have for at least a year.  </li>
            <li>Been through this before, should take a couple of weeks to really start feeling the benefit, but my case is a little more advanced than most.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to get to bed to feel the positive effects of this</li>
            <li>I use this as a lower back roll on a somewhat shallow bench in my kitchen, and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It is great to use for therapy if trying to put the curve back in your neck due to an accident, and it is great for putting behind your neck when watching TV.</li>
            <li>I will use it in my neck exercise routine, but I certainly didn&#x27;t buy it for that, so wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it if I&#x27;d have known.</li>
            <li>It is a little smaller than the Jackson Roll, but still provides great support.</li>
            <li>Very good for sleeping on the back if you have neck issues or unable to find a comfortable position on your existing pillow.</li>
            <li>removed it from the plastic out bag, simply stuck the whole thing inside a pillow case and positioned it comfortably under my neck.</li>
            <li>Just as described, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>very helpful to wake up without neck pain.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t helped me as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>this pillow suits me very well.</li>
            <li>Upon opening, I noticed a really noxious smell.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really like it.  </li>
            <li>Cervical rolls should be much firmer than this.</li>
            <li>This roll has been very helpful.</li>
            <li>It really helps support and lessen pain and stretching</li>
            <li>It really does help to ease my neck pain thus allowing me to float off to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Did the job very well.</li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>and it works very well to support my neck.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, however it helps keep my neck supported at night, which keeps me from having headaches and neck aches.  </li>
            <li>The roll helps my neck so much regardless of the type of pillow I&#x27;m using.  </li>
            <li>It has really made a difference in how I sleep.</li>
            <li>Use it every night has really helped my breathing or snoring</li>
            <li>I wish it had a bit of memory foam just to make it comfortable enough to just use without having to slide it into the pillowcase</li>
            <li>Works very well and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Has really helped me sleep with a neck injury</li>
            <li>This really helps to fix your neck pain.</li>
            <li>It really works for me.</li>
            <li>Really helped my neck when I was away in Italy.  </li>
            <li>This product has really helped my neck pain.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I found a lot of the reviews promising but for me it was no go.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look like much, but really does the job.</li>
            <li>I have military neck--no curve in my neck at all--and I&#x27;d been using those pillows that have a curve to them to provide better neck support.</li>
            <li>It really helps with my neck pain that I&#x27;ve every morning when I woke up.</li>
            <li>I have arthritis in my neck, and really need the support.  </li>
            <li>this cervical roll was a life saver for me, thanks so much</li>
            <li>I sleep with this under my neck and it has helped relieve much of my neck pain.</li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>I really like this pillow.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not much substance here.  </li>
            <li>I have bulging disks in my neck and this product really helps.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable sleeping on your back, but it didn&#x27;t stop my snoring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Together they are the perfect combination of softness (down pillow) and firm but not hard (neck roll) support.  </li>
            <li>I have been using various pillows and rolls throughout the night, never getting a good sleep due to the rotation of pillows.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Didn&#x27;t have any odor or chemical smell that I was expecting, like so many of the other pillows I&#x27;ve bought or read reviews about.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought one of these and it is definitely not the ORIGINAL McKenzie roll.</li>
            <li>The price was cheaper than what my Physical Therapist sold me my original one for.</li>
            <li>It is amazing to see what a small roll or neck pillow can do my neck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good density and size for me and feels neither too soft or hard.  </li>
            <li>I sleep better an wake up in less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I accidently left it at a hotel recently, so I bought two more to replace it ...</li>
            <li>It stil has too much of an odor for me to use for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>But it has definitely benefited me more than a regular pillow.</li>
            <li>My recent episode of neck pain was lasting more than 3 weeks and chiropractic neck cracking was not helping.</li>
            <li>Within 48 hours of using this product and some basic physical therapy exercises - I was 60% better.</li>
            <li>It was so light, I didn&#x27;t think there was anything inside at all, surely not a pillow-type thing, but I opened the box and sure enough -</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>arrived fast but its very soft -- it would work for someone who wants a soft neck pillow - I wanted something firmer</li>
            <li>This takes a little getting used to, but it is so much better than the rolled up towel my therapist recommended.  </li>
            <li>My husband was skeptical and when I told him how great it was</li>
            <li>More firm than I like  and had to air it out for weeks because of chemical smell.</li>
            <li>But I kept trying and after a few days I love it.</li>
            <li>My new normal is now a seven or eight hours of undisturbed sleep and no neck pain.  </li>
            <li>This is just what I needed - just the right size for cervical support while sleeping on my back.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it had a firm center \\&quot;rod\\&quot; similar to an Elasto-Gel,  for a bit more support when my neck on occasion needs a bit more support and stretch.</li>
            <li>The softer your pillow, the higher up you&#x27;ll need to move the neck roll so that you actually achieve a decent degree of extension.</li>
            <li>Really helps to support my neck comfortably, however it&#x27;s a little softer than I would like.</li>
            <li>I was pleased that the stitching was solid enough to not damage when I ripped the tags off individually - no rough cut edges that way.</li>
            <li>Im seeking a new one but firmer.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without these.</li>
            <li>Am hoping with additional use and the change in how I sleep it will become my new &amp;#34;Best Friend&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Second it is not sturdy at all, it flattens too much when placed under my neck and doesn&#x27;t give much support.</li>
            <li>Very soft.  </li>
            <li>The roll is very soft.  </li>
            <li>love the fact that the cover actually zips closed and covers the foam insert completely.</li>
            <li>Really enjoyed this in the beginning but got flat sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described and has been a big help in my recovery from cervical spine surgery.</li>
            <li>first time I used it, I could only handle it for about an hour.</li>
            <li>I might try one of the other models that the reviews said \\&quot;break down\\&quot; and \\&quot;too soft\\&quot; to see if they are any better, but I definitely cannot use this for anything.</li>
            <li>My chiropractor adjusts my neck so that my head sits more centrally over my back and shoulders, otherwise my head leans out over my chest and pulls on my neck and spine, causing back pain.</li>
            <li>Some cervical rolls are too big (fat), large in diameter, and they raise your head up too high.  </li>
            <li>; I was looking at new pillows, and now with this, I don&#x27;t need to change the old ones.</li>
            <li>I purchased this so that I would be able to sleep without my chin in my chest from the average sized pillow, while at the same time trying to keep the correct angle under my neck.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed to make my neck a little worse, but now it is great.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little bit uneasy and uncomfortable but with further use it will be wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Easy soft not strong.</li>
            <li>Honestly my neck had grown accustomed to my old neck roll which had flattened far too much (different manufacturer) and getting used to this new pillow is causing some serious discomfort.</li>
            <li>it did not support her neck at all, her head was to far off of the pillow to help.</li>
            <li>This works well when sleeping on my back, but when I roll over on my side it really hurts my neck.  </li>
            <li>The sponge is too soft that you won&#x27;t even notice that you are using a pillow.</li>
            <li>The outside cover of this has too much of a smelly odor for me to use.  </li>
            <li>Tried to air it for 3 days by keeping the foam roll outside the cover but the smell remained as intense as ever.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really helping maintain proper head, neck, and shoulder alignment while I sleep.</li>
            <li>Soft, yet form.</li>
            <li>I use CPAP, with nasal pillows, and this cervical pillow has had an unexpected benefit.</li>
            <li>The weight of her body on the rest of the blanket keeps it in place when she gets restless at night and so far, she hasn&#x27;t fallen off the bed again.</li>
            <li>this is way too soft..</li>
            <li>It is too soft and does not offer any support.  </li>
            <li>This is the only one that really helps my neck.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable, firm support.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps the company sells a soft washable cover, but why not just have one come with instead of charging for a separate item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>BY FAR... WAYYYYY TO SOFT.</li>
            <li>I believe it really helps but find in the a.m. my entire spine hurts, (however after doing my stretches the pain subsides rapidly)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit in my pillowcases as the McKenzie book suggested, did not help my neck pain, will try again in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I find it a bit too soft.</li>
            <li>I use it occasionally when my neck is really sore and it helps.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered the same roll before because it really works.</li>
            <li>If also have a @3rd.one that is too soft, so as far as the softness or hardness</li>
            <li>Now, I can&#x27;t sleep on my old pillow.</li>
            <li>I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for my neck after recent surgery.</li>
            <li>Get about one new one year and use the more worn ones for travel, other homes, the sofa, recliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saves me from headaches as a result of a stiff neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li>Works as it needs to though its not as firm as other cervical rolls that I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Gives extra support for your cervical area and fits nicely into pillowcases.</li>
            <li>The roll&#x27;s foam is very low density and far too soft.</li>
            <li>Sleeping time used to be the absolute worst neck time, now it is the best.  </li>
            <li>it really was not thick enough to raise my neck up high enough--i ended up rolling two towels into a roll and holding them tight with zip ties...</li>
            <li>Size is right, but it is a little soft to truly support the neck.</li>
            <li>Foam is firm but not hard like a pool noodle and not useless like a ball of cotton.</li>
            <li>I put it inside my pillowcase, right at the bottom edge, sleep with a down pillow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a hard time getting it in the right position since that whole sleeve came unraveled.</li>
            <li>I have used the same McKenzie Cervical Roll for the last two years due originally to a pinched nerve in my neck.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Not so comfortable if you sleep on the side, however, you can adjust by adding an extra pillow (very small) under your ear when you turn to the side.</li>
            <li>My husband was having a hard time sleeping comfortably through the night after being diagnosed with cervical stenosis.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard, made of cheap sponge and hurts my neck.</li>
            <li>Purchased this because it was developed by McKenzie, the back exercise expert.  </li>
            <li>I have old whiplash injuries and need my neck to be supported in the proper position while sleeping.  </li>
            <li>Soft, yet sturdy enough for support of the neck.</li>
            <li>not firm enough for neck support</li>
            <li>After nearly a year&#x27;s use, the foam support is softening and so a 2nd purchase has been made.</li>
            <li>Besides, I do not really need it in bed, so it fills my purposes very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Snoring - for my anatomy, the roll is too soft to induce enough extension in my neck to help with snoring.  </li>
            <li>I sleep better, and my headaches have dramatically decreased.</li>
            <li>It is stiff but that is ok with me as it willwear down in time.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had near constant neck pain for the last year and a half due to posture and sitting at a desk all day every day, and was becoming resigned to it being a part of my life.</li>
            <li>I purchased several memory foam and special shaped pillows to no avail...and in comes this little roll and solves the issue!  </li>
            <li>Despite these results, the pillow was a little too large and was not a little lumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I sleep on both my side and back, and had for a long time had trouble repositioning pillow to a comfortable place when I would change positions.  </li>
            <li>Thought this would be more firm but it mashes down and pokes up on the ends--annoying!  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll have one extra for when the first half gets old and flat.</li>
            <li>First couple nights were a little akward.</li>
            <li>I do have to position it either all the way to the left toward the other side of the bed or all the way to the right (hanging off the bed) because it is too long for me</li>
            <li>I rarely sleep with it, rather I use it for the first 10-20 minutes lying in bed at night, and then I usually switch to a thin, flat pillow right before I fall asleep.</li>
            <li>My solution is that I am going to cut it into either 3 equal pieces (that way I&#x27;ll end up with 2 replacements for when this one gets flat or old or whatever)</li>
            <li>The first was too firm and aggravated my problem with recovery from cervical fusion relieving compressed nerves.  </li>
            <li>Stiff, noisy and very much in the way.</li>
            <li>it was pretty stiff.</li>
            <li>Love it no more stiff neck problems</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to bring with you on travel - although I have left it behind in the hotel</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want anything too large in diameter or to firm.</li>

            <li> My neck has never felt so good.</li>
            <li> Seems good but too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> good purchase.  </li>
            <li> but it is good for your neck.</li>
            <li> so how good could it be?</li>
            <li> It keeps my head at the correct and most ideal height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked so good</li>
            <li> Also comes w good additional info.</li>
            <li> so it does give into the weight of one&#x27;s neck, but that ends up being a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I think the diameter is good but</li>
            <li> the build quality is good, but I think the value is not quite there</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;m good with it.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> McKenzie Cervical Roll, is a good length for sleeping, and if you flop or flip over while sleeping.</li>
            <li> My daughter has a neck pillow that i tried &amp; loved.</li>
            <li> I suppose it is good for the job?  </li>
            <li> Well made, and the foam is of good quality, but it&#x27;s a bit pricey at $18.  </li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with this  OPTP Original McKenzie Cervical Roll.  </li>
            <li> very pleased</li>
            <li> This has been a great aide and it has also helped me in creating a better sleeping posture with my head.</li>
            <li> Love it solved neck pain in the morning, great sleep.  </li>
            <li> just right for the perfect support.</li>
            <li> Your Own Neck&amp;#34; from Amazon for great understanding on the cause of many neck pain issues.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a great item for those of us with cervical disk problems, and easy to pack for travel.  </li>
            <li> The first night I used it, I wasn&#x27;t completely happy with it, but I continued to use it and, within a couple of nights, I was really happy with it and sleeping well!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smells quite strongly of chemicals, but secures my neck superbly for a comfortable night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> Amazing aid to sleep.</li>
            <li> he tried it for a couple nights and then ordered his own.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled when I found these online.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s a nice unobtrusive size that can be tucked inside your pillow (or not) and has a washable, unzippable cover.</li>
            <li> It fits nicely under my neck and helps with the neck pain that I have been having.  </li>
            <li> Your Own Neck&amp;#34; by Robin McKenzie (recommend) and this pillow was mentioned in the book, so I gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because I wanted to have something handy rather than rolling up a towel for support every time as recommended by my doctor, but this just collapses.  </li>
            <li> Ideal fix to make an aging parent more comfortable in her recliner.</li>
            <li> After learning about it from &amp;#34;Treat your own Neck&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I really like this cervical pillow, perfect diameter for me since it has \\&quot;give\\&quot;(unlike</li>
            <li> Kindly advise as to how I can do so.  </li>
            <li> It is the perfect size, and has given my neck so much support.</li>
            <li> in all, I am so happy that I bought this OPTP Original McKenzie Cervical Roll.</li>
            <li> This particular one works great for him, though!</li>
            <li> It does great alone, and I switch to a full pillow when I roll over onto my side.</li>
            <li> perfect fit and right degree of firmness for my neck.  </li>
            <li> I have neck issues and using this allows me to get a good nights sleep, pain free</li>
            <li> The pillow is in as good a shape as it was when I originally bought it.  </li>
            <li> maybe cotton batting or fiber fill would be more suitable for a neck support pillow.</li>
            <li> helps tremendously!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for 3 nights, and so far it is very good.</li>
            <li> I love these cervical rolls...</li>
            <li> I love it, this has eliminated my sore necks.</li>
            <li> I love them and got one since I travel all the time.</li>
            <li> However, be sure to remember to take it out of the case when you leave the motel.</li>
            <li> I put it in with the pillow, and I love it.</li>
            <li> My husband used it and it makes his neck feels better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to change the cover before you use it</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> A miracle has happened today because I actually love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then 2 or 3 years ago I started needing more neck support.</li>
            <li> Now, I find it&#x27;s substantially more comfortable for me with some kind of a pillow</li>
            <li> I just have not been able to find a pillow that I love or even like that:&lt;br /&gt;A.</li>
            <li> It was better than nothing</li>
            <li> I knew there had to be a better solution.</li>
            <li> memory foam/foam rubber idea was just not working any more.</li>
            <li> My neck feels better and better every morning.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to cut it into 2 or 3 equal pieces so it fits perfectly under my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it supports the neck for a more restful nights sleep.</li>
            <li> the roll works perfect and is proper firmness for my needs.</li>
            <li> I love the product.  </li>
            <li> A towel rolled up would be better than this.</li>
            <li> I love this roll.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been a fan of the contour, memory foam type pillows as a side-sleeper, but this works perfect for both side and back sleeping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it several weeks now and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, really love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient for travel as well :)</li>
            <li> Ok, I used it once and don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s working for me.</li>
            <li> my neck is better and hubby says I do not snore now.  </li>
            <li> I found that two pillow or a cervical foam pillow helps much more.</li>
            <li> Nice, comfortable neck roll.</li>
            <li> its ok but after some use it flattens and won&#x27;t sit into place.</li>
            <li> But, it sure did.</li>
            <li> I have tried many pillows, tractions, supports to alleviate neck pain.  </li>
            <li> I did learn I need a low profile pillow (5&#x27;4&amp;#34; woman) and the best option for me</li>
            <li> I suppose it&#x27;s better than nothing at all, but I feel like a fool for spending my money on this.  </li>
            <li> My wife and I both use them and are completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use it any more.</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I initially rotated 3 pillows and both cervical rolls to find the best combination for me.</li>
            <li> I put it inside my pillowcase at the edge of my orthopedic pillow to give a better support for my neck during side sleeping.  </li>
            <li> I felt better after sleeping with it and as an added benefit it knocked out my snoring.</li>
            <li> Much better comfort.  </li>
            <li> Much better that Tempur-like pillows.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> This encased version is a bit firmer and more uniform</li>
            <li> so works better than my&lt;br /&gt;version.</li>
            <li> They are absolutely perfect for under the neck and curve of the back.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> Really love this pillow.</li>
            <li> and I am confident that I shall be satisfied this time, as well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for that part of neck that does not get enough pillow support.</li>
            <li> , hope it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> I sleep with it in my pillow every night just like the physical therapist told me and it works great!</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> more neck pain when you use this</li>
            <li> No discernible support, regardless of what and how many pillows I stack beneath it.</li>
            <li> Thanks !!!!</li>
            <li> Time will tell if this is a great product or just a decent one.</li>
            <li> The very first one has been the best so far</li>
            <li> The first one I bought was a year ago, and it is still in good shape.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best for people who sleep on their backs, however, with some minor adjustments, a side-sleeper can work with it.  </li>
            <li> Excellent, just as expected.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to sleep more comfortably after having 2 herniated discs.</li>
            <li> Had another one already and this one does not stay in place any better and isn&#x27;t quite as comfortable.</li>
            <li> Using this cervical roll as prescribed provides much more comfortable sleep.  </li>
            <li> Very helpful for nick good for travel</li>
            <li> This neck roll really works well for keeping your head at a good angle to prevent snoring.  </li>
            <li> seams durable and with the right pillow is effective</li>
            <li> Fits in any pillow, can be used without a pillow and is super easy to stuff into my carryon for trips!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted at how comfortable this roll pillow has become and at how much support I feel by using it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use...works immediately</li>
            <li> The cover removes easily for washing.  </li>
            <li> Stuffs easily into my travel suitcase, fits with any size pillow (reg or king).</li>
            <li> Easy to add to my feather pillow for cervical support</li>
            <li> It is lightweight and would be easy for travel.  </li>
            <li> Easy to find on line.</li>
            <li> Easy to take in a suitcase on trips</li>
            <li> Obviously it depends on what is causing your problem if this is right for you or not, but for me it works great!</li>
            <li> have had the original roll and it is way better than this cheap knock off.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, McKenzie&#x27;s book on self-treating your own neck pain was a great help</li>
            <li> Light and slender for easy packing to take along on trips.</li>
            <li> it may be fine others and</li>
            <li> It works fine for that purpose.</li>
            <li> The roll works fine.</li>
            <li> Very strong chemical smell from foam at first.</li>
            <li> Perfect little roll.</li>
            <li> If I had any time available I&#x27;d return it.</li>
            <li> It lets me sleep comfortably.</li>
            <li> Firm and perfect size</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still getting used to it, but I like the look of the washable case, and it fits nicely in my existing pillows and provides extra support for my neck better than the MANY foam pillows I have tried over the years.</li>
            <li> I found the dimensions and firmness comfortable but could not stand the chemical smell of the foam.</li>
            <li> Remember, it just has to fit under the neck -</li>
            <li> Could not get comfortable with it.</li>
            <li> I had nights of sleeplessness because I could not find a way to get my neck to find a comfortable angle.</li>
            <li> That sleeve is important because it allows you to slide the foam roll into the pillow case with the pillow.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this comfortable to use with any pillow that I have.</li>
            <li> Slip inside your pillowcase and enjoy.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I used it on a recent trip and it fit perfectly into the pillowcase and worked very well.</li>
            <li> I actually love this thing because you put it right inside the pillowcase with the pillow.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t been very useful.</li>
            <li> I also highly recommend McKenzie&#x27;s Treat Your Own Neck book.</li>
            <li> There is another one, however, (which I don&#x27;t think says original on it)  that he had purchased from a drugstore</li>
            <li> very satisfied with the cervical roll,  i have osteo arthritis and the pillow has helped considerably with neck pain and headaches,</li>
            <li> It takes 3 to 6 months to get your original posture of neck</li>
            <li> I was certainly satisfied with the first</li>
            <li> Great neck support, not to big, just right</li>
            <li> - it is just right!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken me forever to find something just the right size!</li>
            <li> No, it doesn&#x27;t smell wonderful when you place your nose next to the bare foam, but it is not at all noticeable when placed inside the pillow case as instructed.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, McKenzie&#x27;s original lumbar roll is great while driving or sitting in a chair.</li>
            <li> While this neck pillow hasn&#x27;t eliminated the pain entirely, I CAN say I didn&#x27;t ever think my neck would feel this good</li>
            <li> He slides it into his pillowcase on top of his pillow and it helps so much.</li>
            <li> Not only are you more comfortable, but better breathing is facilitated as well.  </li>
            <li> good replacement for same item</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy a real one it will be much better for your neck.</li>
            <li> Dry mouth is at a minimum, and CPAP is more effective.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in the pillow and definitely relieved the symptoms from my herniated disc (very mild symptoms of numbness in fingers).</li>
            <li> As recommended by a McKenzie-certified PT, this roll has helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> It has helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li> Fortunately for me, on doctor’s orders I saw a therapist who recommended this product at my first session.</li>
            <li> Even on hot days it is comfortable.</li>
            <li> I had a similar good experience with McKenzie&#x27;s book on treating your own back pain.</li>
            <li> It relieves the pressure and is very good especially if you are having difficulty with your back or neck.  </li>
            <li> It is really helps my neck to be free of pain.</li>
            <li> I rarely use it</li>
            <li> It alleviated some kinks I was getting from sleeping with an old foam mattress.</li>
            <li> Rarely even use it now.</li>
            <li> recommend anyone with upper back or neck issues to consider this product as it provides a level of support that most pillows (even good quality ones) don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Simple design yet effective.</li>
            <li> Added note...be sure to use a soft pillow.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t find it useful.</li>
            <li> but this is worth trying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> So nice to wake up in the morning and finally feel relaxed.</li>
            <li> Really, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this roll.</li>
            <li> For the price it is certainly worth trying</li>
            <li> The tags on the end had to go right away.</li>
            <li> fits just right.</li>
            <li> I should have returned it right away but was in the process of moving</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s exactly right.</li>
            <li> This roll is just the right size to pack in a suitcase and it is lightweight.</li>
            <li> You can put it right in your pillow so it does not slide around</li>
            <li> It fits right into my neck allowing the pillow to support my head.  </li>
            <li> The roll is the right length and diameter, but the density of the foam is of no therapeutic use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right height for my neck.</li>
            <li> This one fits just right for me.  </li>
            <li> Not thick enough to do and good.</li>
            <li> This is the single most important purchase I have ever made.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and just the right size for under the neck when sleeping on my back.  </li>
            <li> amazing how having your neck properly supported can affect how fast you fall asleep and stay asleep.  </li>
            <li> I like this roll very much.  </li>
            <li> This one looks like my original but it is bigger in circumference making it not as comfortable.</li>
            <li> It flexible, soft &amp; comfortable.</li>
            <li> Perhaps more later</li>
            <li> First the pillow smells.</li>
            <li> When I first saw it I was skeptical, but after trying it I was convinced it was an awesome purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought several for most of my family and my spare bedrooms.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my PT used in therapy.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly like the one the therapist used</li>
            <li> This cervical roll has really helped my neck and sleep!  </li>
            <li> the material is a bit crisp -</li>
            <li> I had one of these from 20 years ago from a car accident and it was looking pretty worn.  </li>
            <li> They both help to keep the spine in correct alignment whether sleeping or sitting, which I&#x27;ve learned is key to minimizing pain and maintaining a healthy spine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different pillows to enhance my sleep and none of which helped.</li>
            <li> I will most likely return it</li>
            <li> When it first arrives it&#x27;s a bit shrunken</li>
            <li> Last thing: no horrible chemical smell.</li>
            <li> If so you may want to ask a physical therapist or you doctor if the Cervical Roll will help you sleep better as it has me.</li>
            <li> Most mornings my pain level is reduced by two points on a scale of one to ten since using this cervical roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The foam does smell when it first arrives</li>
            <li> It is soft and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I bought this and the first night</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Mostly in my lower back, where I have a degenerated disc.</li>
            <li> I wore my first one out.</li>
            <li> I can tell when it needs to be replaced as I wake up with a headaches more than 2 days in a row that started in the back of my neck.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> No relief really!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> : I have the roll on top of a Sleep Innovations Contour Memory Foam Pillow, and they&#x27;re about the same firmness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> zippercover or case is not hard or crispy or plastic-like, and it&#x27;s quite handy and possibly sweat-proof.  </li>
            <li> Recommended by a Physical Therapist, sleeping with this roll has made a significant difference to my once frequent, severe headaches from cervical disc degeneration, and has provided better sleep.</li>
            <li> roll!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard however to find pillowcases to fit it nicely.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m able to sleep better than I have for at least a year.  </li>
            <li> Been through this before, should take a couple of weeks to really start feeling the benefit, but my case is a little more advanced than most.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get to bed to feel the positive effects of this</li>
            <li> I use this as a lower back roll on a somewhat shallow bench in my kitchen, and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> It is great to use for therapy if trying to put the curve back in your neck due to an accident, and it is great for putting behind your neck when watching TV.</li>
            <li> I will use it in my neck exercise routine, but I certainly didn&#x27;t buy it for that, so wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it if I&#x27;d have known.</li>
            <li> It is a little smaller than the Jackson Roll, but still provides great support.</li>
            <li> Very good for sleeping on the back if you have neck issues or unable to find a comfortable position on your existing pillow.</li>
            <li> removed it from the plastic out bag, simply stuck the whole thing inside a pillow case and positioned it comfortably under my neck.</li>
            <li> Just as described, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> very helpful to wake up without neck pain.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t helped me as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> this pillow suits me very well.</li>
            <li> Upon opening, I noticed a really noxious smell.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like it.  </li>
            <li> Cervical rolls should be much firmer than this.</li>
            <li> This roll has been very helpful.</li>
            <li> It really helps support and lessen pain and stretching</li>
            <li> It really does help to ease my neck pain thus allowing me to float off to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Did the job very well.</li>
            <li> Very helpful.</li>
            <li> and it works very well to support my neck.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, however it helps keep my neck supported at night, which keeps me from having headaches and neck aches.  </li>
            <li> The roll helps my neck so much regardless of the type of pillow I&#x27;m using.  </li>
            <li> It has really made a difference in how I sleep.</li>
            <li> Use it every night has really helped my breathing or snoring</li>
            <li> I wish it had a bit of memory foam just to make it comfortable enough to just use without having to slide it into the pillowcase</li>
            <li> Works very well and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Has really helped me sleep with a neck injury</li>
            <li> This really helps to fix your neck pain.</li>
            <li> It really works for me.</li>
            <li> Really helped my neck when I was away in Italy.  </li>
            <li> This product has really helped my neck pain.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I found a lot of the reviews promising but for me it was no go.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like much, but really does the job.</li>
            <li> I have military neck--no curve in my neck at all--and I&#x27;d been using those pillows that have a curve to them to provide better neck support.</li>
            <li> It really helps with my neck pain that I&#x27;ve every morning when I woke up.</li>
            <li> I have arthritis in my neck, and really need the support.  </li>
            <li> this cervical roll was a life saver for me, thanks so much</li>
            <li> I sleep with this under my neck and it has helped relieve much of my neck pain.</li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> I really like this pillow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not much substance here.  </li>
            <li> I have bulging disks in my neck and this product really helps.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable sleeping on your back, but it didn&#x27;t stop my snoring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Together they are the perfect combination of softness (down pillow) and firm but not hard (neck roll) support.  </li>
            <li> I have been using various pillows and rolls throughout the night, never getting a good sleep due to the rotation of pillows.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t have any odor or chemical smell that I was expecting, like so many of the other pillows I&#x27;ve bought or read reviews about.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought one of these and it is definitely not the ORIGINAL McKenzie roll.</li>
            <li> The price was cheaper than what my Physical Therapist sold me my original one for.</li>
            <li> It is amazing to see what a small roll or neck pillow can do my neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good density and size for me and feels neither too soft or hard.  </li>
            <li> I sleep better an wake up in less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I accidently left it at a hotel recently, so I bought two more to replace it ...</li>
            <li> It stil has too much of an odor for me to use for more than a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> But it has definitely benefited me more than a regular pillow.</li>
            <li> My recent episode of neck pain was lasting more than 3 weeks and chiropractic neck cracking was not helping.</li>
            <li> Within 48 hours of using this product and some basic physical therapy exercises - I was 60% better.</li>
            <li> It was so light, I didn&#x27;t think there was anything inside at all, surely not a pillow-type thing, but I opened the box and sure enough -</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> arrived fast but its very soft -- it would work for someone who wants a soft neck pillow - I wanted something firmer</li>
            <li> This takes a little getting used to, but it is so much better than the rolled up towel my therapist recommended.  </li>
            <li> My husband was skeptical and when I told him how great it was</li>
            <li> More firm than I like  and had to air it out for weeks because of chemical smell.</li>
            <li> But I kept trying and after a few days I love it.</li>
            <li> My new normal is now a seven or eight hours of undisturbed sleep and no neck pain.  </li>
            <li> This is just what I needed - just the right size for cervical support while sleeping on my back.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it had a firm center \\&quot;rod\\&quot; similar to an Elasto-Gel,  for a bit more support when my neck on occasion needs a bit more support and stretch.</li>
            <li> The softer your pillow, the higher up you&#x27;ll need to move the neck roll so that you actually achieve a decent degree of extension.</li>
            <li> Really helps to support my neck comfortably, however it&#x27;s a little softer than I would like.</li>
            <li> I was pleased that the stitching was solid enough to not damage when I ripped the tags off individually - no rough cut edges that way.</li>
            <li> Im seeking a new one but firmer.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without these.</li>
            <li> Am hoping with additional use and the change in how I sleep it will become my new &amp;#34;Best Friend&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Second it is not sturdy at all, it flattens too much when placed under my neck and doesn&#x27;t give much support.</li>
            <li> Very soft.  </li>
            <li> The roll is very soft.  </li>
            <li> love the fact that the cover actually zips closed and covers the foam insert completely.</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed this in the beginning but got flat sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and has been a big help in my recovery from cervical spine surgery.</li>
            <li> first time I used it, I could only handle it for about an hour.</li>
            <li> I might try one of the other models that the reviews said \\&quot;break down\\&quot; and \\&quot;too soft\\&quot; to see if they are any better, but I definitely cannot use this for anything.</li>
            <li> My chiropractor adjusts my neck so that my head sits more centrally over my back and shoulders, otherwise my head leans out over my chest and pulls on my neck and spine, causing back pain.</li>
            <li> Some cervical rolls are too big (fat), large in diameter, and they raise your head up too high.  </li>
            <li> ; I was looking at new pillows, and now with this, I don&#x27;t need to change the old ones.</li>
            <li> I purchased this so that I would be able to sleep without my chin in my chest from the average sized pillow, while at the same time trying to keep the correct angle under my neck.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed to make my neck a little worse, but now it is great.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little bit uneasy and uncomfortable but with further use it will be wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Easy soft not strong.</li>
            <li> Honestly my neck had grown accustomed to my old neck roll which had flattened far too much (different manufacturer) and getting used to this new pillow is causing some serious discomfort.</li>
            <li> it did not support her neck at all, her head was to far off of the pillow to help.</li>
            <li> This works well when sleeping on my back, but when I roll over on my side it really hurts my neck.  </li>
            <li> The sponge is too soft that you won&#x27;t even notice that you are using a pillow.</li>
            <li> The outside cover of this has too much of a smelly odor for me to use.  </li>
            <li> Tried to air it for 3 days by keeping the foam roll outside the cover but the smell remained as intense as ever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helping maintain proper head, neck, and shoulder alignment while I sleep.</li>
            <li> Soft, yet form.</li>
            <li> I use CPAP, with nasal pillows, and this cervical pillow has had an unexpected benefit.</li>
            <li> The weight of her body on the rest of the blanket keeps it in place when she gets restless at night and so far, she hasn&#x27;t fallen off the bed again.</li>
            <li> this is way too soft..</li>
            <li> It is too soft and does not offer any support.  </li>
            <li> This is the only one that really helps my neck.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable, firm support.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps the company sells a soft washable cover, but why not just have one come with instead of charging for a separate item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> BY FAR... WAYYYYY TO SOFT.</li>
            <li> I believe it really helps but find in the a.m. my entire spine hurts, (however after doing my stretches the pain subsides rapidly)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit in my pillowcases as the McKenzie book suggested, did not help my neck pain, will try again in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I find it a bit too soft.</li>
            <li> I use it occasionally when my neck is really sore and it helps.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered the same roll before because it really works.</li>
            <li> If also have a @3rd.one that is too soft, so as far as the softness or hardness</li>
            <li> Now, I can&#x27;t sleep on my old pillow.</li>
            <li> I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for my neck after recent surgery.</li>
            <li> Get about one new one year and use the more worn ones for travel, other homes, the sofa, recliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saves me from headaches as a result of a stiff neck and shoulders.</li>
            <li> Works as it needs to though its not as firm as other cervical rolls that I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Gives extra support for your cervical area and fits nicely into pillowcases.</li>
            <li> The roll&#x27;s foam is very low density and far too soft.</li>
            <li> Sleeping time used to be the absolute worst neck time, now it is the best.  </li>
            <li> it really was not thick enough to raise my neck up high enough--i ended up rolling two towels into a roll and holding them tight with zip ties...</li>
            <li> Size is right, but it is a little soft to truly support the neck.</li>
            <li> Foam is firm but not hard like a pool noodle and not useless like a ball of cotton.</li>
            <li> I put it inside my pillowcase, right at the bottom edge, sleep with a down pillow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time getting it in the right position since that whole sleeve came unraveled.</li>
            <li> I have used the same McKenzie Cervical Roll for the last two years due originally to a pinched nerve in my neck.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Not so comfortable if you sleep on the side, however, you can adjust by adding an extra pillow (very small) under your ear when you turn to the side.</li>
            <li> My husband was having a hard time sleeping comfortably through the night after being diagnosed with cervical stenosis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard, made of cheap sponge and hurts my neck.</li>
            <li> Purchased this because it was developed by McKenzie, the back exercise expert.  </li>
            <li> I have old whiplash injuries and need my neck to be supported in the proper position while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> Soft, yet sturdy enough for support of the neck.</li>
            <li> not firm enough for neck support</li>
            <li> After nearly a year&#x27;s use, the foam support is softening and so a 2nd purchase has been made.</li>
            <li> Besides, I do not really need it in bed, so it fills my purposes very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Snoring - for my anatomy, the roll is too soft to induce enough extension in my neck to help with snoring.  </li>
            <li> I sleep better, and my headaches have dramatically decreased.</li>
            <li> It is stiff but that is ok with me as it willwear down in time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had near constant neck pain for the last year and a half due to posture and sitting at a desk all day every day, and was becoming resigned to it being a part of my life.</li>
            <li> I purchased several memory foam and special shaped pillows to no avail...and in comes this little roll and solves the issue!  </li>
            <li> Despite these results, the pillow was a little too large and was not a little lumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I sleep on both my side and back, and had for a long time had trouble repositioning pillow to a comfortable place when I would change positions.  </li>
            <li> Thought this would be more firm but it mashes down and pokes up on the ends--annoying!  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll have one extra for when the first half gets old and flat.</li>
            <li> First couple nights were a little akward.</li>
            <li> I do have to position it either all the way to the left toward the other side of the bed or all the way to the right (hanging off the bed) because it is too long for me</li>
            <li> I rarely sleep with it, rather I use it for the first 10-20 minutes lying in bed at night, and then I usually switch to a thin, flat pillow right before I fall asleep.</li>
            <li> My solution is that I am going to cut it into either 3 equal pieces (that way I&#x27;ll end up with 2 replacements for when this one gets flat or old or whatever)</li>
            <li> The first was too firm and aggravated my problem with recovery from cervical fusion relieving compressed nerves.  </li>
            <li> Stiff, noisy and very much in the way.</li>
            <li> it was pretty stiff.</li>
            <li> Love it no more stiff neck problems</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to bring with you on travel - although I have left it behind in the hotel</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want anything too large in diameter or to firm.</li>
            <li> My main problem with the Jackson Roll was that it was a little too big.  </li>
            <li> The slight medicicinal smell from the freshly opened package was a little off-putting, but if it helps deter the growth of bacteria, I consider that a plus.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t go flat within an hour;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What kind of moron would fold this pillow in HALF and squeeze it into tight plastic packaging so it would fit in the box.  </li>
            <li> Often, I have awakened with my mouth dry, which tells me I sleep with my mouth open.</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes I can hear my heartbeat in my ear very clearly.  </li>
            <li> I have neck problems due to combination of minor arthritis and major fibromyalgia.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to put into a comfortable position for someone who is small and really not suited for a large person.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not) - I&#x27;ve convinced at least 5 family/friends to buy one from raving about it so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always fighting with pillows(even expensive pillows) to get that comfortable support for the neck area.</li>
            <li> just in case they ever stop making them, I am set for a long while.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just too long for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected ...</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than I expected.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t curve my neck too much, long in length</li>
            <li> Zippered cover instead of velcro, covering is not soft (like cotton or flannel) but is synthetic...</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long at all for it to plump up and the dent to disappear.</li>
            <li> The booklet that came with the pillow makes me want to investigate other McKenzie back and body aid pillows.</li>
            <li> I wish it were smaller like my other ones.  </li>
            <li> Like any other pillow, it is not made to last forever</li>
            <li> A few years ago I was having sleeping problems related to back pain and a chiropractor suggested that I use a Jackson Roll (another brand of cervical rolls).  </li>
            <li> It gave me a stiff neck and after two nights, returned it and went to medical supply and got a different one.  </li>
            <li> I have used this type of products for years and was excited to see if lots less expensive than in the medical type stores.</li>
            <li> Just lately started seeing a Chiropractor for lower back issues; he showed me a roll similar to this and recommended using it under my lower back to sleep.</li>
            <li> It is made of foam, so eventually it breaks down in the middle and you will have to replace it.</li>
            <li> The foam inside is not super high-quality but is similar to the one I had before that</li>
            <li> The only critique I have against it is that the cover could be a little softer -</li>
            <li> I could feel my back moving and adjusting and it made me a little bit sore in some places.</li>
            <li> I use it when my neck needs that little extra support.</li>
            <li> Frustrated, I finally started doing some research online to see what&#x27;s available now since my</li>
            <li> The only negative is I don&#x27;t like being stuck with the blue cover.  </li>
            <li> solid, firm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the ergonomical pillows that are supposed to do the same thing, but they have never fit me well.  </li>
            <li> It is just firm enough.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, when the box arrived, I thought it was empty.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be firmer for the support</li>
            <li> The pillows seem a bit softer than expected.</li>
            <li> Took a few nights to get used to, but it was starting to help.  </li>
            <li> NOT WHAT I EXPECTED</li>
            <li> I did not really believe it would help.</li>
            <li> it hasa harder time staying in the pillow.</li>
            <li> But I was still having trouble sleeping and having massive headaches all the time, and the google-fu told me to try this.</li>
            <li> Firm but not hard, small in height</li>
            <li> so I tried lots of different feather, feather and down, and 100% down pillows.</li>
            <li> Took the protective sleeve off to wash it, however the zipper snagged on the tags that are attached, which were sewn right into the seam, and the whole thing unraveled and now the sleeve is worthless.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend the roll to anyone having a stiff neck or back problems.</li>
            <li> I have several bulging discs in my neck and this little pillow helps a lot!</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to chemicals and am disappointed in myself for not asking exactly what &amp;#34;low density foam&amp;#34; this pillow was made from before spending the money.</li>
            <li> I have issue with my neck for past several years, any time i sleep</li>
            <li> and she advised me to return it due to it not at all being up to snuff.</li>
            <li> I’ve suffered neck pain on and off for years due to incorrect computer and cell phone posture.  </li>
            <li> I wish there were other choices.</li>
            <li> When my (other product) memory foam cushion lost its&#x27; firmness, I researched reviews on Amazon and bought this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I ever slept on other pillows.</li>
            <li> The cervical roll is too small as I thought the roll would&#x27;ve been much larger.  </li>
            <li> It is of no use for me very hard and way to big for a female</li>
            <li> Too big, too hard, etc.</li>
            <li> It provides moderate support without being rock hard.  </li>
            <li> I have tried it both inside of the pillow case and outside, but it is just too hard with no give at all.</li>
            <li> Mushy and unsupportive, so not worth any money.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m old enough to my neck injury to know progress is usually painful - and there&#x27;s a big difference between problem pain and adjustment pain.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth what I paid.  </li>
            <li> This simple tool has changed my life, or at least the health of my neck.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable as I expected.</li>
            <li> One less star because the suppler was late with the delivery after we paid for extra.</li>
            <li> I use it inside the pillow case but under my down pillow as suggest by the PT.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;ll cut it just in half</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like that it was shipped folded in half.  </li>
            <li> but it expands in less than an hour.</li>
            <li> Mine was also folded in half in the box.</li>
            <li> I was concerned when it came out of the package because it was folded in half and was compressed at the fold.</li>
            <li> What a mess.</li>
            <li> Received it bent in 1/2 in a b box, does not have the round shape to it and noticed that you must of changed softer material  or less of foam that is used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first few nights of use felt a bit awkward, but after that I got used to it.</li>
            <li> My ligaments got stretched and the bones are out of place and its a difficult process to get everything back where it needs to be.</li>
            <li> Now the middle of the pillow is broken down.  </li>
            <li> Gives a little.</li>
            <li> I roll it in her little fleece blanket that she sleeps on - on the outer edge, lengthwise</li>
            <li> and I can overlook this little issue.  </li>
            <li> I wish it were a little softer.</li>
            <li> and I wake up in the morning with little or no pain.</li>
            <li> Just give it a little time, if it was recommended by a therapist or anyone who knows whereof</li>
            <li> I am wishing I would have bought a memory foam or something a little thicker.  </li>
            <li> But it is very small and really long.  </li>
            <li> but every morning I&#x27;d wake up with huge knots in my hair from the stupid piece of foam.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not comfortable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I took it off and after a few days in a room with an air filter I wrapped the inside foam roll(without the cover) inside a flannel pillowcase.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks now and it has made a difference.</li>
            <li> This is too firm for me to use with a pillow while sleeping.</li>
            <li> It is firm, which I need.</li>
            <li> What a waste of my money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> Remember, your body will need a few days to adjust to anything like this.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S FIRM, IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT...</li>
            <li> but after a few washings, the smell disappears.</li>
            <li> This thing seems plenty firm.  </li>
            <li> It is firm, but not too firm.  </li>
            <li> Not really an all night pillow, at least for me, but</li>
            <li> It unilaterally compresses the carotids enough that you can feel the other carotid compensate with increase in flow.  </li>
            <li> The neck roll is to stiff for my mom.  </li>
            <li> no cricks in the mornings or stiff neck.</li>
            <li> It stabilizes the curvature of the neck and keeps you from getting a stiff neck as you are sleeping.  </li>
            <li> Not too big so that it makes matters worse; not too small so that it is ineffective</li>
            <li> Too small and stiff for me.  </li>
            <li> (wife pushes me onto my side due to snoring) and this roll is not good for side sleeping.  </li>
            <li> A little too hard for me.</li>
            <li> Really helps at night with my bad neck.</li>
            <li> I am a small framed person and</li>
            <li> , I found it to be much to small in diameter.</li>
            <li> and it is now past the return date.  </li>
            <li> too small for my comfort</li>
            <li> Way to small for anything</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a cervical roll for about 10 years and the difference it has made in my sleep is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> No more waking up with headaches.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> However this one has very firm foam.  </li>
            <li> I use it behind my neck while reading or watching TV and behind my back while I&#x27;m on my computer.</li>
            <li> However, after using it, his neck also has a strong terrible smell.</li>
            <li> I had a bad fall and my physical therapist reccomended using this for under my neck when I was lying down.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it is too fat and too hard.</li>
            <li> but the towel was a bit too hard after it compressed with my sleeping on it after an hour or so.</li>
            <li> Too hard to sleep on.</li>
            <li> Roll was too hard to use.</li>
            <li> really hard to get used to</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t like it because it is too hard for her.</li>
            <li> I have herniated disc in neck &amp; was hoping for support, but this is just too hard &amp; hurts me.</li>
            <li> As for the unpleasant odor described by several reviewers, I didn&#x27;t find it to be a problem.  </li>
            <li> I have a little blind, paraplegic dog who shares my bed</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s because of off-gassing CHEMICALS that are not good for you.</li>
            <li> Recently, I was desperate and researching an expensive pillow purchase.  </li>
            <li> My neck pain went from awful to zero the first night I used it.</li>
            <li> but it was very hard to keep the towel folded so i searched on amazon and found this Gem.</li>
            <li> Very hard to get used to.  </li>
            <li> The cervical roll is too hard, which makes it difficult to sleep through the night.</li>
            <li> It was too hard and uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Often makes my neck hurt worse.  </li>
            <li> My pain has decreased somewhat since using this product.</li>
            <li> The pain originated at night and continued throughout the day, some days worse than others.  </li>
            <li> I have been having cervicogenic headaches from sitting at a desk all day and poor posture.</li>
            <li> I pulled it out of the pillowcase and threw it on the floor in the middle of the night because it was annoying.</li>
            <li> and it was very hard and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Very hard uncomfortable pillow.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found it too uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I found this item uncomfortable to sleep on.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it wasn&#x27;t too expensive</li>
            <li> Yoga pillows and bolsters are quite expensive</li>
            <li> I tried it as a neck roll in bed and it was too uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> - I have tried the expensive memory foam cervical pillows with very poor results there.</li>
            <li> even after I sliced it open and removed some of the filling so that it wasn&#x27;t so puffy but that still didn&#x27;t help and I still hated it), down alternative (horrible), and on and on.</li>
            <li> I am one unhappy customer.  </li>
            <li> My neck and head ache and feel numb when I wake up in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t sleep on it, too uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> It is so hard it feels like it is cutting off my blood at my jugular vein!!!</li>
            <li> but this stupid box does not let me rate it without putting some meaningless junk here.</li>
            <li> Bad purchase.</li>
            <li> the pillow smells badly.</li>
            <li> no, I didn&#x27;t read the dimensions, so my bad ...</li>
            <li> but kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am SO disappointed.  </li>
            <li> But Amazon had to ruin the product with their stupid shipping strategy.  </li>
            <li> Some may like it, but I am very disappointed with it and will not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have horrible neck problems.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband is very happy with this  OPTP Original McKenzie Cervical Roll.  There is another one, however, (which I don&#x27;t think says original on it)  that he had purchased from a drugstore and it was very hard and uncomfortable.  This particular one works great for him, though!</li>
            <li> Experienced immediate relief from morning neck and shoulder ache after just a couple of nights use.</li>
            <li> The neck roll is to stiff for my mom.  She had a stroke and I was looking for a roll to cushion her head and give it some support.  it did not support her neck at all, her head was to far off of the pillow to help.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not comfortable.</li>
            <li> Just as described, fast shipping. Very strong chemical smell from foam at first. I either got used to it or the smell disipated. Fits perfectly in neck for support.</li>
            <li> This pillow alleviates my neck pain.  Great for traveling too!</li>
            <li> Mushy and unsupportive, so not worth any money.  If I had any time available I&#x27;d return it. Bad purchase.</li>
            <li> ...exactly what I needed!</li>
            <li> solid, firm. Gives a little. Honestly my neck had grown accustomed to my old neck roll which had flattened far too much (different manufacturer) and getting used to this new pillow is causing some serious discomfort. I&#x27;m old enough to my neck injury to know progress is usually painful - and there&#x27;s a big difference between problem pain and adjustment pain. Been through this before, should take a couple of weeks to really start feeling the benefit, but my case is a little more advanced than most.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that the cover actually zips closed and covers the foam insert completely. The tags on the end had to go right away. Stiff, noisy and very much in the way. I was pleased that the stitching was solid enough to not damage when I ripped the tags off individually - no rough cut edges that way. Time will tell if this is a great product or just a decent one. The slight medicicinal smell from the freshly opened package was a little off-putting, but if it helps deter the growth of bacteria, I consider that a plus.</li>
            <li> I love these cervical rolls... I have neck issues and using this allows me to get a good nights sleep, pain free</li>
            <li> Still getting used to sleeping with it.</li>
            <li> It lets me sleep comfortably.</li>
            <li> These work great for any neck problems.  I use mine every night and just bought one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> very helpful to wake up without neck pain.</li>
            <li> This roll is perfect for my needs. I didn&#x27;t want anything too large in diameter or to firm. I have TMJ &amp; chronic neck pain and this item was ideal for what I was looking for. It flexible, soft &amp; comfortable. I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I have issue with my neck for past several years, any time i sleep i always wake up with a neck pain. I have tried all sorts of pillows including the Mediflow water pillow but nothing helped. My chiropractor recommended me to fold a towel and put it under my neck for additional neck support while sleeping but it was very hard to keep the towel folded so i searched on amazon and found this Gem. It is amazing to see what a small roll or neck pillow can do my neck. Never had any pain in my neck since i bought it. I have tried all sorts of neck massagers, tru medic TENS muscle stimulator etc before sleeping. They relaxed me and made me sleepy but didn&#x27;t help me with the neck pain after waking up.</li>
            <li> This works well when sleeping on my back, but when I roll over on my side it really hurts my neck.  So, eh.... nah.  Not using it anymore.</li>
            <li> The sponge is too soft that you won&#x27;t even notice that you are using a pillow. Don&#x27;t waste your money. This is not a memory foam pillow.</li>
            <li> I love it, this has eliminated my sore necks. Get It!!!</li>
            <li> This has improved my quality of sleep enormously.  My husband was skeptical and when I told him how great it was he tried it for a couple nights and then ordered his own.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Needed this for my auto  accident I was in this summer. Received it bent in 1/2 in a b box, does not have the round shape to it and noticed that you must of changed softer material  or less of foam that is used.</li>
            <li> I had a bad fall and my physical therapist reccomended using this for under my neck when I was lying down.  It relieves the pressure and is very good especially if you are having difficulty with your back or neck.  A definatly good investment.</li>
            <li> Firm and perfect size</li>
            <li> Excellent. Helpful for neck issues.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t helped me as much as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I must have missed any info concerning the stiffness/firmness of this product. NO support at all I&#x27;ll look for a firmer roll.</li>
            <li> fits just right. very pleased</li>
            <li> I like this roll very much.  It is really helps my neck to be free of pain.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one. I love them and got one since I travel all the time. One for home and one for travel.</li>
            <li> Like it ----does the job</li>
            <li> I have used the same McKenzie Cervical Roll for the last two years due originally to a pinched nerve in my neck.  The pillow is in as good a shape as it was when I originally bought it.  I accidently left it at a hotel recently, so I bought two more to replace it ... just in case they ever stop making them, I am set for a long while.  The pillow provides great support for the curve of my neck.  I&#x27;ve tried the ergonomical pillows that are supposed to do the same thing, but they have never fit me well.  I am a small framed person and this pillow suits me very well.</li>
            <li> Would like it to be firmer</li>
            <li> This is a great item for those of us with cervical disk problems, and easy to pack for travel.  One less star because the suppler was late with the delivery after we paid for extra.</li>
            <li> Very soft.  I use it (on my P/T&#x27;s advice) inside my pillow at the bottom (closest my shoulder) as I sleep to support my neck.  After 3 weeks, I &#x27;m still getting used to it, but I think it may be helping me not toss at night.  Perhaps more later</li>
            <li> Thanks !!!! And Great Job!!!!!</li>
            <li> The outside cover of this has too much of a smelly odor for me to use.  I took it off and after a few days in a room with an air filter I wrapped the inside foam roll(without the cover) inside a flannel pillowcase.  It stil has too much of an odor for me to use for more than a few minutes.  I will use it in my neck exercise routine, but I certainly didn&#x27;t buy it for that, so wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it if I&#x27;d have known.</li>
            <li> I expected it not to be so soft. I rarely use it</li>
            <li> Quality for what it is</li>
            <li> I am using this as a lower back support in my desk chair. It is just firm enough.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected. I&#x27;m still getting used to it, but I like the look of the washable case, and it fits nicely in my existing pillows and provides extra support for my neck better than the MANY foam pillows I have tried over the years.</li>
            <li> seams durable and with the right pillow is effective</li>
            <li> Excellent, just as expected.</li>
            <li> Ordered this at the suggestion of my doc who is having me do the McKenzie exercises for my back and neck. Upon opening, I noticed a really noxious smell. I let it air out in the sun for three days before using it and wrapped it in a waterproof hypoallergenic pillow case before sleeping on it. The pillow worked GREAT for me neck but unfortunately the chemical smell was overwhelming. I am very sensitive to chemicals and am disappointed in myself for not asking exactly what &amp;#34;low density foam&amp;#34; this pillow was made from before spending the money. It&#x27;s polyurethane - totally TOXIC. It is made in the USA so I&#x27;m assuming some of the nastier chemicals were left out but be warned, this pillow SMELLS and it&#x27;s because of off-gassing CHEMICALS that are not good for you. For anyone looking to reduce toxins in the bedroom, DO NOT BUY THIS PILLOW.</li>
            <li> Just the correct size. It works great. My neck has never felt so good.</li>
            <li> Great neck saver.  I always take this when staying in a motel.  The pillows they have will put your neck in a crimp.  Just slide this inside the pillow case.  However, be sure to remember to take it out of the case when you leave the motel.</li>
            <li> Amazing aid to sleep. Has helped immensely with the pinched nerve issue</li>
            <li> Wonderful neck support. Place it against the edge of regular pillow and instantly transform it to a cervical pillow. Use it alone for the times you need extra neck stretching. Light and slender for easy packing to take along on trips. Only wish it comes in a shorter version for carry-on luggage.</li>
            <li> I should be making a commission on these (but I&#x27;m not) - I&#x27;ve convinced at least 5 family/friends to buy one from raving about it so much. I only wish I&#x27;d bought one sooner myself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had near constant neck pain for the last year and a half due to posture and sitting at a desk all day every day, and was becoming resigned to it being a part of my life. While this neck pillow hasn&#x27;t eliminated the pain entirely, I CAN say I didn&#x27;t ever think my neck would feel this good again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few nights of use felt a bit awkward, but after that I got used to it. I even pack it in my suitcase as a necessity when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS PILLOW. I also highly recommend McKenzie&#x27;s Treat Your Own Neck book.</li>
            <li> First the pillow smells. Second it is not sturdy at all, it flattens too much when placed under my neck and doesn&#x27;t give much support.</li>
            <li> I found the dimensions and firmness comfortable but could not stand the chemical smell of the foam. Tried to air it for 3 days by keeping the foam roll outside the cover but the smell remained as intense as ever.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helping maintain proper head, neck, and shoulder alignment while I sleep.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really like it.  Often makes my neck hurt worse.  Maybe it is too fat and too hard.</li>
            <li> Very good product for neck support.</li>
            <li> Seems good but too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> The roll&#x27;s foam is very low density and far too soft. I took it to my chiropractor to get her opinion on it and she advised me to return it due to it not at all being up to snuff. Cervical rolls should be much firmer than this.</li>
            <li> good purchase.  I put it in with the pillow, and I love it.</li>
            <li> My husband was having a hard time sleeping comfortably through the night after being diagnosed with cervical stenosis. This roll has been very helpful. He slides it into his pillowcase on top of his pillow and it helps so much.</li>
            <li> When I first saw it I was skeptical, but after trying it I was convinced it was an awesome purchase. I have been using it for a few weeks now and it has made a difference.</li>
            <li> the pillow smells badly. but it is good for your neck. My husband used it and it makes his neck feels better. However, after using it, his neck also has a strong terrible smell. It&#x27;s better to change the cover before you use it</li>
            <li> Love it. It really helps support and lessen pain and stretching</li>
            <li> I’ve suffered neck pain on and off for years due to incorrect computer and cell phone posture.  Recently, I was desperate and researching an expensive pillow purchase.  Fortunately for me, on doctor’s orders I saw a therapist who recommended this product at my first session. Thankfully it was delivered before the second session and this product worked.  For years, I would wake up every two hours sometimes in pain or simply to adjust the pillow.  My new normal is now a seven or eight hours of undisturbed sleep and no neck pain.  I bought several for most of my family and my spare bedrooms.  This is the single most important purchase I have ever made.</li>
            <li> I have chronic neck pain from degenerative disc disease and wanted to try an inexpensive support pillow.  Chose this one because it allows you to use your regular pillow along with it in the same pillow case.  Together they are the perfect combination of softness (down pillow) and firm but not hard (neck roll) support.  It really does help to ease my neck pain thus allowing me to float off to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its amazing how having your neck properly supported can affect how fast you fall asleep and stay asleep.  Not only are you more comfortable, but better breathing is facilitated as well.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The roll itself had an offensive odor and I could not use it.</li>
            <li> This is too firm for me to use with a pillow while sleeping. I&#x27;ve been told it will soften with use but I&#x27;ve found it too uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Very good pillow. Would buy again. Soft, yet form. Did the job very well. This is the second one we have.</li>
            <li> This was perfect. It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 3 nights, and so far it is very good. It is firm, which I need. I am still getting used to the firmness, and am considering using a softer, flatter pillow in conjunction with this neck roll. I use CPAP, with nasal pillows, and this cervical pillow has had an unexpected benefit. Often, I have awakened with my mouth dry, which tells me I sleep with my mouth open. But the way I side-sleep with this pillow,seems to help prevent my lower jaw from opening. Dry mouth is at a minimum, and CPAP is more effective.</li>
            <li> no comment for this comment section. but this stupid box does not let me rate it without putting some meaningless junk here.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my PT used in therapy.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> This was suggested to me by a physical therapist. I use it inside the pillow case but under my down pillow as suggest by the PT. It provides great neck support. It alleviated some kinks I was getting from sleeping with an old foam mattress.</li>
            <li> I have a little blind, paraplegic dog who shares my bed and she has on occasion managed to fall off the bed.  I bought this to prevent it happening again.  I roll it in her little fleece blanket that she sleeps on - on the outer edge, lengthwise and it does the trick.  The weight of her body on the rest of the blanket keeps it in place when she gets restless at night and so far, she hasn&#x27;t fallen off the bed again.</li>
            <li> I have ordered two of these; I will likely be purchasing these as gifts for friends who have neck problems.  I&#x27;m delighted at how comfortable this roll pillow has become and at how much support I feel by using it.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me.  It&#x27;s meant for a back sleeper, which I am not.</li>
            <li> A miracle has happened today because I actually love this thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY STORY:&lt;br /&gt;I have always been a back sleeper using NO PILLOW.  Then 2 or 3 years ago I started needing more neck support. Now, I find it&#x27;s substantially more comfortable for me with some kind of a pillow so I tried lots of different feather, feather and down, and 100% down pillows. I tried Tempur, My P\\\ow (H A T E D it even after I sliced it open and removed some of the filling so that it wasn&#x27;t so puffy but that still didn&#x27;t help and I still hated it), down alternative (horrible), and on and on. I just have not been able to find a pillow that I love or even like that:&lt;br /&gt;A. Doesn&#x27;t go flat within an hour;&lt;br /&gt;B. Doesn&#x27;t curl up around my head like earmuffs; and&lt;br /&gt;C. Supports my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I tried creating my own neck support gizmo by cutting a 3&amp;#34; x 6&amp;#34;-ish piece of memory foam from a mattress topper. It was better than nothing but every morning I&#x27;d wake up with huge knots in my hair from the stupid piece of foam. I knew there had to be a better solution. Frustrated, I finally started doing some research online to see what&#x27;s available now since my memory foam/foam rubber idea was just not working any more. I read hundreds of reviews for all kinds of cervical pillows/rolls and decided to try this one. Even though I did my homework, I wasn&#x27;t holding out hope that this would be my salvation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, when the box arrived, I thought it was empty. It was so light, I didn&#x27;t think there was anything inside at all, surely not a pillow-type thing, but I opened the box and sure enough - there it was. Hmmm... no weight whatsoever to this thing so how good could it be? Well, ha ha on me because it is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Nice presentation in the plastic bag and the blue zipper cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t have any odor or chemical smell that I was expecting, like so many of the other pillows I&#x27;ve bought or read reviews about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The zippercover or case is not hard or crispy or plastic-like, and it&#x27;s quite handy and possibly sweat-proof.  I&#x27;ll find out in a month when it gets to be 100° here in L.A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed it from the plastic out bag, simply stuck the whole thing inside a pillow case and positioned it comfortably under my neck. It keeps my head at the correct and most ideal height.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE CONS:&lt;br /&gt;I have only one: I do have to position it either all the way to the left toward the other side of the bed or all the way to the right (hanging off the bed) because it is too long for me and I don&#x27;t want it encasing my ears. My solution is that I am going to cut it into either 3 equal pieces (that way I&#x27;ll end up with 2 replacements for when this one gets flat or old or whatever) or I&#x27;ll cut it just in half so I&#x27;ll have one extra for when the first half gets old and flat. Remember, it just has to fit under the neck - it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s a sandbag keeping water from seeping into the house and it is not one of those door jamb sealers. It&#x27;s for cradling the neck which this does perfectly - it&#x27;s just too long for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am so happy that I bought this OPTP Original McKenzie Cervical Roll. My neck feels better and better every morning. Can&#x27;t wait to cut it into 2 or 3 equal pieces so it fits perfectly under my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised.  Very helpful.</li>
            <li> The pillow was recommended by my physical therapist while I was undergoing treatment for a problem in my neck. I couldn&#x27;t get one locally and so ordered this one. It is exactly like the one the therapist used and it works very well to support my neck. You will need a another case to slip over it so you can wash it. The case on it is washable but I don&#x27;t relish having to pull that foam in and out of it.</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed this in the beginning but got flat sooner than expected. I expected it to be firmer for the support but kinda disappointed. Rarely even use it now. Im seeking a new one but firmer.</li>
            <li> this is way too soft.. i&#x27;ll roll up a towel instead!!</li>
            <li> it really was not thick enough to raise my neck up high enough--i ended up rolling two towels into a roll and holding them tight with zip ties...</li>
            <li> very satisfied with the cervical roll,  i have osteo arthritis and the pillow has helped considerably with neck pain and headaches,</li>
            <li> AMAZING PRODUCT!!! I have used this type of products for years and was excited to see if lots less expensive than in the medical type stores. this is great under the edge of my pillow for my neck. it supports the neck for a more restful nights sleep. no cricks in the mornings or stiff neck.</li>
            <li> Ordered the Cervical Roll,  but received the Lumbar Roll in error. Will be returning item.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to sleep more comfortably after having 2 herniated discs. the roll works perfect and is proper firmness for my needs. I was using a rolled up towel at the recommendation of the PT I was going to but the towel was a bit too hard after it compressed with my sleeping on it after an hour or so. I would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I started having neck problems about a year ago, and bought this product upon the recommendation of my physical therapist. I use it on a nightly basis, and it helps to support my neck.  My pain has decreased somewhat since using this product. This is my second one to buy. I plan on using it at our vacation home. The first one I bought was a year ago, and it is still in good shape.  I only wish they made one for a king size pillow.</li>
            <li> Purchased this because it was developed by McKenzie, the back exercise expert.  Had another one already and this one does not stay in place any better and isn&#x27;t quite as comfortable.</li>
            <li> A chiropractor recommended this product for my headaches and neck pain/tightness.  It helps me quite a bit.  It is the only cervical roll I&#x27;ve ever owned, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, however it helps keep my neck supported at night, which keeps me from having headaches and neck aches.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This cervical roll has really helped my neck and sleep!  I have been using various pillows and rolls throughout the night, never getting a good sleep due to the rotation of pillows.  Since I received this product I have not had to change to another roll or pillow all night.  The only critique I have against it is that the cover could be a little softer - the material is a bit crisp - but the roll does the job and I can overlook this little issue.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I am one unhappy customer.  This is a cervical neck roll that I NEED for support under my neck.  What kind of moron would fold this pillow in HALF and squeeze it into tight plastic packaging so it would fit in the box.  I NEED the support in the middle of the pillow.  Now the middle of the pillow is broken down.  What a waste of my money.  I am SO disappointed.  This is my 6th OPTP McKenzie Cervical Roll.  I love the product.  But Amazon had to ruin the product with their stupid shipping strategy.  What a mess.</li>
            <li> As a person that sleeps on their side I was looking for something that would stabilize my head and should area.  This has been a great aide and it has also helped me in creating a better sleeping posture with my head.</li>
            <li> Had cervical fusion surgery. This product was recommended by therapist&lt;br /&gt;however, I found it to be much to small in diameter. Could not get comfortable with it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be without my Cerivical Roll helps my neck stay stable.</li>
            <li> This is great if you need relief from neck pain. It doesn&#x27;t feel restrictive the way the u-shaped ones do.</li>
            <li> This product is not worth what I paid.  It is too soft and does not offer any support.  I should have returned it right away but was in the process of moving and it is now past the return date.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  A towel rolled up would be better than this.</li>
            <li> Tried several pillows before this one.  This is the only one that really helps my neck.  I use it w/my memory foam pillow.</li>
            <li> The roll helps my neck so much regardless of the type of pillow I&#x27;m using.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The cervical roll is too hard, which makes it difficult to sleep through the night. I wish it were a little softer.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these.  One for my home and one for my RV.  This is the perfect cervical roll and I have recommeded it to several friends.  I had one of these from 20 years ago from a car accident and it was looking pretty worn.  I was thrilled when I found these online.</li>
            <li> I have used one of these cervical rolls under my neck for several years. Just lately started seeing a Chiropractor for lower back issues; he showed me a roll similar to this and recommended using it under my lower back to sleep. I ordered this, and so now I use two of these.</li>
            <li> I love this roll. It has definitely helped my neck pain. I am a side sleeper and it works great.</li>
            <li> This simple tool has changed my life, or at least the health of my neck. I was struggling and my Pilates instructor suggested this; I was looking at new pillows, and now with this, I don&#x27;t need to change the old ones. I got a second one for travel. It has really made a difference in how I sleep.</li>
            <li> I put it inside my pillowcase, right at the bottom edge, sleep with a down pillow.  It provides the support I did not realize I needed for my neck.  It has reduced my neck pain and stiffness and I never sleep without it.  It does take 2-3 days to get used to so give it a chance.  At first it seemed to make my neck a little worse, but now it is great.</li>
            <li> I was recommended by my physical therapist to purchase of one of these to put inside my pillowcase for pain in my cervical &amp; thoracic spine. The first night I used it, I wasn&#x27;t completely happy with it, but I continued to use it and, within a couple of nights, I was really happy with it and sleeping well!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend anyone with upper back or neck issues to consider this product as it provides a level of support that most pillows (even good quality ones) don&#x27;t. I&#x27;ve never been a fan of the contour, memory foam type pillows as a side-sleeper, but this works perfect for both side and back sleeping. I also use the McKenzie Lumbar roll for my desk chair, as I spend a great deal of my work day sitting. They both help to keep the spine in correct alignment whether sleeping or sitting, which I&#x27;ve learned is key to minimizing pain and maintaining a healthy spine.</li>
            <li> Use it every night has really helped my breathing or snoring</li>
            <li> Great product. Simple design yet effective. Foam is firm but not hard like a pool noodle and not useless like a ball of cotton. The cover unzips which is awesome.</li>
            <li> This takes a little getting used to, but it is so much better than the rolled up towel my therapist recommended.  I have greatly reduced my shoulder issues since using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different pillows to enhance my sleep and none of which helped. I purchased Robin&#x27;s book regarding neck pain and he recommended the cervical roll. So I bought the roll, have used at home and during my travels (hotels stay). The roll works great. Gives me the neck support that I need and I wake up in the morning with little or no pain. Added note...be sure to use a soft pillow.</li>
            <li> Easy to use...works immediately</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected ... no, I didn&#x27;t read the dimensions, so my bad ... but well made, and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a Physical Therapist, sleeping with this roll has made a significant difference to my once frequent, severe headaches from cervical disc degeneration, and has provided better sleep.</li>
            <li> too small for my comfort</li>
            <li> Not as big as I&#x27;d anticipated so I didn&#x27;t find it useful.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without these. Get about one new one year and use the more worn ones for travel, other homes, the sofa, recliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saves me from headaches as a result of a stiff neck and shoulders. I guess I&#x27;ve had about 7 of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.  Remember, your body will need a few days to adjust to anything like this. Just give it a little time, if it was recommended by a therapist or anyone who knows whereof they speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cost of materials, about 22 cents, but they got the patent, I suppose.</li>
            <li> Works as it needs to though its not as firm as other cervical rolls that I have used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;Gives extra support for your cervical area and fits nicely into pillowcases.</li>
            <li> A lot smaller than I expected. Not thick enough to do and good.</li>
            <li> Too hard to sleep on.</li>
            <li> I bought this for trip rather than some bulky neck pillows I have. It worked so good I think i will use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I am wishing I would have bought a memory foam or something a little thicker.  I didn&#x27;t like that it was shipped folded in half.  I will most likely return it</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed - just the right size for cervical support while sleeping on my back.  I have old whiplash injuries and need my neck to be supported in the proper position while sleeping.  It&#x27;s also foldable and I&#x27;ve used it in the car as a versatile pillow.  The cover removes easily for washing.  The foam inside is not super high-quality but is similar to the one I had before that lasted 8 years.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace another neck roll that I had.  It was the same size and shape.  However this one has very firm foam.  It gave me a stiff neck and after two nights, returned it and went to medical supply and got a different one.  Didn&#x27;t know they varied in terms of firmness.</li>
            <li> The pillows seem a bit softer than expected.</li>
            <li> i got this for my wife she loves it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife.  She puts it in her pillow case for support during sleep.  Buy the book &amp;#34;Treat Your Own Neck&amp;#34; from Amazon for great understanding on the cause of many neck pain issues.</li>
            <li> Very effective. Comfortable, firm support. Also comes w good additional info.</li>
            <li> Too small and stiff for me.  Might work well for others, just not my size.</li>
            <li> This came to be a great relief! It is not memory foam but regular foam so it does give into the weight of one&#x27;s neck, but that ends up being a good thing.  I had nights of sleeplessness because I could not find a way to get my neck to find a comfortable angle. I purchased several memory foam and special shaped pillows to no avail...and in comes this little roll and solves the issue!  I wish it had a bit of memory foam just to make it comfortable enough to just use without having to slide it into the pillowcase but so far so good. I like it!</li>
            <li> I needed something to support my neck while I sleep.  This is a perfect size.  I have used &amp;#34;neck&amp;#34; pillows and they are just too big and hurt my neck rather than helped it.  The price is very good too. The only negative is I don&#x27;t like being stuck with the blue cover.  I wish there were other choices.</li>
            <li> Finally, a neck roll I can sleep with!  Not too big so that it makes matters worse; not too small so that it is ineffective - it is just right!</li>
            <li> I wish the diameter was a bit wider.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Works very well and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Roll was too hard to use. Did not return as it was used once.</li>
            <li> My neck pain went from awful to zero the first night I used it. I&#x27;ve had it several weeks now and it works perfectly. Also, it&#x27;s a nice unobtrusive size that can be tucked inside your pillow (or not) and has a washable, unzippable cover. When it first arrives it&#x27;s a bit shrunken but it expands in less than an hour. It might seem smaller than you need but it&#x27;s exactly right. Last thing: no horrible chemical smell. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for nick good for travel</li>
            <li> I bought this item to use for traveling. I have a cervical support pillow on my bed, but it is too bulky to put in a suitcase. This roll is just the right size to pack in a suitcase and it is lightweight. I used it on a recent trip and it fit perfectly into the pillowcase and worked very well.</li>
            <li> Really helps at night with my bad neck.</li>
            <li> good replacement for same item</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t been very useful. Way to small for anything</li>
            <li> Fits in any pillow, can be used without a pillow and is super easy to stuff into my carryon for trips! Has really helped me sleep with a neck injury and I assume is helping with my recovery. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This really helps to fix your neck pain. It takes 3 to 6 months to get your original posture of neck but this is worth trying. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to get to bed to feel the positive effects of this roll!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard however to find pillowcases to fit it nicely.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  The McKenzie name speaks for itself.  I have a damage cervical spine and it is the only way I can sleep at night.</li>
            <li> Took a few nights to get used to, but it was starting to help.  Took the protective sleeve off to wash it, however the zipper snagged on the tags that are attached, which were sewn right into the seam, and the whole thing unraveled and now the sleeve is worthless.  That sleeve is important because it allows you to slide the foam roll into the pillow case with the pillow.  I&#x27;ve had a hard time getting it in the right position since that whole sleeve came unraveled.</li>
            <li> It may work well, but out the cellophane smelled horrid and was sent back.</li>
            <li> Size is right, but it is a little soft to truly support the neck.</li>
            <li> Just like the one I was shown at PT.</li>
            <li> I bought it to help with my snoring.  It keeps my head from bending forward thus restricting my breathing.  Wife says it helps so now I don&#x27;t have to sleep in the living room - 5 Stars.</li>
            <li> This neck roll really works well for keeping your head at a good angle to prevent snoring.  It&#x27;s best for people who sleep on their backs, however, with some minor adjustments, a side-sleeper can work with it.  The softer your pillow, the higher up you&#x27;ll need to move the neck roll so that you actually achieve a decent degree of extension.</li>
            <li> really hard to get used to</li>
            <li> Do you awake with headaches? Do your neck muscles seem strained while you are sleeping? If so you may want to ask a physical therapist or you doctor if the Cervical Roll will help you sleep better as it has me. I was lent one for several days and advised to make a purchase from the OPTP site... but Amazon was cheaper and without freight, so once again they earned my business. The booklet that came with the pillow makes me want to investigate other McKenzie back and body aid pillows.</li>
            <li> I love it! It was just what I needed after a day in pain!  I give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I have neck problems due to combination of minor arthritis and major fibromyalgia. When my (other product) memory foam cushion lost its&#x27; firmness, I researched reviews on Amazon and bought this. It really works for me. Most mornings my pain level is reduced by two points on a scale of one to ten since using this cervical roll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Firm but not hard, small in height so it doesn&#x27;t curve my neck too much, long in length so I can move my head from side to side without falling off the cervical roll&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons (why I rated it four stars instead of five): Zippered cover instead of velcro, covering is not soft (like cotton or flannel) but is synthetic...&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the company sells a soft washable cover, but why not just have one come with instead of charging for a separate item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, really love it.</li>
            <li> More firm than I like  and had to air it out for weeks because of chemical smell.</li>
            <li> Everything was great.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and has been a big help in my recovery from cervical spine surgery.</li>
            <li> Great neck support, not to big, just right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a cervical roll for about 10 years and the difference it has made in my sleep is unbelievable. I would recommend the roll to anyone having a stiff neck or back problems.</li>
            <li> I sleep with this product every night</li>
            <li> Did not like this at all and gave it to another person with neck problem and they didn&#x27;t like it either.  Can&#x27;t sleep on it, too uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> Tried to use this pillow alone, and in combination with another pillow, does not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Really helps to support my neck comfortably, however it&#x27;s a little softer than I would like.</li>
            <li> First couple nights were a little akward. But it has definitely benefited me more than a regular pillow. It&#x27;s convenient for travel as well :)</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in the pillow and definitely relieved the symptoms from my herniated disc (very mild symptoms of numbness in fingers).</li>
            <li> I bought a backup.  Their a great relief for my neck</li>
            <li> I found this item uncomfortable to sleep on. It caused pain in the neck instead off releaving pain.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s Ok, I used it once and don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s working for me. And for this material, it&#x27;s kinda price.</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT I EXPECTED BY FAR... WAYYYYY TO SOFT. SAYING THAT IT&#x27;S FIRM, IS AN UNDERSTATEMENT... I&#x27;ll keep searching!!</li>
            <li> having been using this roll for years. helps tremendously!! wouldn&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I am currently getting used to this neck roll.  At first I was a little bit uneasy and uncomfortable but with further use it will be wonderful.  Don&#x27;t give up on it with one or two nights.  It takes a bit of time to adjust to sleeping with the item.</li>
            <li> Very hard to get used to.  Does NOT keep it&#x27;s shape.</li>
            <li> Cervical Roll,  I believe it really helps but find in the a.m. my entire spine hurts, (however after doing my stretches the pain subsides rapidly) my neck is better and hubby says I do not snore now.  Am hoping with additional use and the change in how I sleep it will become my new &amp;#34;Best Friend&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit in my pillowcases as the McKenzie book suggested, did not help my neck pain, will try again in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these and it is definitely not the ORIGINAL McKenzie roll. It&#x27;s hard, made of cheap sponge and hurts my neck. It&#x27;s a rip off at any price.&lt;br /&gt;I have had the original roll and it is way better than this cheap knock off. Save your money and buy a real one it will be much better for your neck.</li>
            <li> Really helped my neck when I was away in Italy.  I would prefer a deeper neck roll.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped my neck pain. My recent episode of neck pain was lasting more than 3 weeks and chiropractic neck cracking was not helping. Within 48 hours of using this product and some basic physical therapy exercises - I was 60% better. It&#x27;s easy to bring with you on travel - although I have left it behind in the hotel pillow!&lt;br /&gt;Also - I have tried the expensive memory foam cervical pillows with very poor results there. Too big, too hard, etc. The roll works well with your existing pillows.</li>
            <li> Ordered for my wife to help with neck pain.</li>
            <li> The cervical roll has helped my husband to sleep for a bulging disc in neck.</li>
            <li> I sleep on both my side and back, and had for a long time had trouble repositioning pillow to a comfortable place when I would change positions.  Using this cervical roll as prescribed provides much more comfortable sleep.  As for the unpleasant odor described by several reviewers, I didn&#x27;t find it to be a problem.  No, it doesn&#x27;t smell wonderful when you place your nose next to the bare foam, but it is not at all noticeable when placed inside the pillow case as instructed.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this for neck pain, but it never worked for me. On the other hand, McKenzie&#x27;s book on self-treating your own neck pain was a great help and I saw improvements almost immediately upon doing his neck exercises. I had a similar good experience with McKenzie&#x27;s book on treating your own back pain. Those two books were a God-send. Can&#x27;t speak highly enough of them and the method and exercises. I wouldn&#x27;t bother with this cervical roll, though. It sits in my closet. I found that two pillow or a cervical foam pillow helps much more. On the other hand, McKenzie&#x27;s original lumbar roll is great while driving or sitting in a chair.</li>
            <li> Frankly for me it was like putting a pvc pipe under my neck! I found for &amp;#34;low density&amp;#34; foam it was pretty stiff. I found a lot of the reviews promising but for me it was no go. I think the diameter is good but maybe cotton batting or fiber fill would be more suitable for a neck support pillow. The head just doesn&#x27;t weigh enough to compress this at all. it may be fine others and the build quality is good, but I think the value is not quite there but if it&#x27;s made in USA then I&#x27;m good with it.</li>
            <li> It fits nicely under my neck and helps with the neck pain that I have been having.  You can put it right in your pillow so it does not slide around but I use it outside of the pillow and can adjust it easier that way.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I find it a bit too soft. I was hoping for a firmer pillow. It has not loosened my neck muscles as I was hoping. I will continue to use it for neckaches which is it&#x27;s best purpose. But I don&#x27;t use it every night because of its lack of firmness.</li>
            <li> I use it occasionally when my neck is really sore and it helps.  I would recommend this to anyone with neck issues.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and just the right size for under the neck when sleeping on my back.  I don&#x27;t even use another pillow (as the directions suggested inserting it in a pillow).  It does great alone, and I switch to a full pillow when I roll over onto my side.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my chiropractor, I use this at home every night. Stuffs easily into my travel suitcase, fits with any size pillow (reg or king). I wouldn&#x27;t be without it now. Just have to remember to get it out of the hotel pillow case.</li>
            <li> Easy to add to my feather pillow for cervical support</li>
            <li> Nice, comfortable neck roll. Even on hot days it is comfortable.</li>
            <li> its ok but after some use it flattens and won&#x27;t sit into place.</li>
            <li> My neighbor suggested I try the McKenzie roll. I did not really believe it would help. But, it sure did. I sleep better an wake up in less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have tried many pillows, tractions, supports to alleviate neck pain.  The pain originated at night and continued throughout the day, some days worse than others.  I did learn I need a low profile pillow (5&#x27;4&amp;#34; woman) and the best option for me is a water pillow I purchased on Amazon.  I bought the book, &amp;#34;Treat Your Own Neck&amp;#34; by Robin McKenzie (recommend) and this pillow was mentioned in the book, so I gave it a try.  I slipped it inside the pillowcase (as instructed) in front of the water pillow.  The support this provides for my neck feels very good and I&#x27;m able to sleep better than I have for at least a year.  Sleeping time used to be the absolute worst neck time, now it is the best.  This is a simple concept and it works.  It&#x27;s a good density and size for me and feels neither too soft or hard.  It is lightweight and would be easy for travel.  I plan to travel with it and use with whatever pillow is provided.</li>
            <li> I have ordered the same roll before because it really works. The foam does smell when it first arrives but after a few washings, the smell disappears. You can wash the foam and case separate in your washer. If you use bleach with your detergent in the wash, the foam will turn beige but it doesn&#x27;t impact the form of the foam.</li>
            <li> As recommended by a McKenzie-certified PT, this roll has helped tremendously. It doesn&#x27;t look like much, but really does the job. So nice to wake up in the morning and finally feel relaxed.</li>
            <li> This pillow has no support at all and doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me at all.  I bought it because I wanted to have something handy rather than rolling up a towel for support every time as recommended by my doctor, but this just collapses.  I suppose it&#x27;s better than nothing at all, but I feel like a fool for spending my money on this.  Mine was also folded in half in the box.</li>
            <li> The order came as promised.  The Cervical Roll is great.  It is soft and comfortable.  It stabilizes the curvature of the neck and keeps you from getting a stiff neck as you are sleeping.  My wife and I both use them and are completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> Just like the one from physical therapy</li>
            <li> Perfect for my messed up neck.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find this comfortable to use with any pillow that I have.</li>
            <li> Very hard uncomfortable pillow. I don&#x27;t even use it any more.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my wife. She doesn&#x27;t like it because it is too hard for her.</li>
            <li> Not too big, but supports my neck well. I even pack it when I travel.</li>
            <li> A little too hard for me.</li>
            <li> This roll reduced my neck pain at night pain by 95%. I am totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> My neck pain is definitely reduced since I started using this!. Continues to lessen, maybe it&#x27;ll go away entirely!</li>
            <li> Ideal fix to make an aging parent more comfortable in her recliner.</li>
            <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve found to relieve neck pain when I&#x27;m sleeping.</li>
            <li> I have tried every pillow going.  I have shoulder and neck issues.  I decided to give this a try.  I have it inside my pillowcase along one side.  It fits right into my neck allowing the pillow to support my head.  Love it.</li>
            <li> This is the second McKenzie cervical roll I&#x27;ve purchased.  The first was too firm and aggravated my problem with recovery from cervical fusion relieving compressed nerves.  Both are supposed to go inside the pillow case.  I use this one with a foam pillow and place it below the bottom edge of the pillow.  It provides moderate support without being rock hard.  It does tend to flatten during the night and move out of place so you may lose some benefit (reason for four stars).  I initially rotated 3 pillows and both cervical rolls to find the best combination for me.</li>
            <li> It is of no use for me very hard and way to big for a female</li>
            <li> The roll is the right length and diameter, but the density of the foam is of no therapeutic use.</li>
            <li> Sent it back, just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I havebeen using a cervical roll for quite a while now. The very first one has been the best so far but i dont know who makes it.  This one looks like my original but it is bigger in circumference making it not as comfortable. It is stiff but that is ok with me as it willwear down in time.  If also have a @3rd.one that is too soft, so as far as the softness or hardness this is probab y matter of taste. But the size is my issue.  I wish it were smaller like my other ones.  I also thonk because of the larger circumference it hasa harder time staying in the pillow.</li>
            <li> I have been having cervicogenic headaches from sitting at a desk all day and poor posture. I bought this and the first night I pulled it out of the pillowcase and threw it on the floor in the middle of the night because it was annoying. But I kept trying and after a few days I love it. And using this coupled with some pt exercises and a lumbar support on my desk chair have helped. No more waking up with headaches. Definitely sleep on your back or side if you have this same problem and this should help.</li>
            <li> This thing seems plenty firm.  I put it inside my pillowcase at the edge of my orthopedic pillow to give a better support for my neck during side sleeping.  I like how I can adjust it&#x27;s position just right for the perfect support.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I was having sleeping problems related to back pain and a chiropractor suggested that I use a Jackson Roll (another brand of cervical rolls).  I used a Jackson Roll from 2008-2012 almost every night.  My main problem with the Jackson Roll was that it was a little too big.  I felt better after sleeping with it and as an added benefit it knocked out my snoring. Despite these results, the pillow was a little too large and was not a little lumpy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After leaving it at a hotel on vacation, I need to buy another.  Instead of going with the Jackson Roll, I tried the McKenzie Cervical Roll.  This is the one I should have bought five years ago.  It is exactly what I needed.  It is a little smaller than the Jackson Roll, but still provides great support. Much better comfort.  Easier to sleep with all night.  Still no snoring.</li>
            <li> Very good for sleeping on the back if you have neck issues or unable to find a comfortable position on your existing pillow. Much better that Tempur-like pillows. Highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Not so comfortable if you sleep on the side, however, you can adjust by adding an extra pillow (very small) under your ear when you turn to the side.</li>
            <li> I am not using it as a cervical roll. I am using it to elevate my feet to prevent pressure sores on my heels. It works fine for that purpose. I was concerned when it came out of the package because it was folded in half and was compressed at the fold. It didn&#x27;t take long at all for it to plump up and the dent to disappear.</li>
            <li> This is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever bought. I have military neck--no curve in my neck at all--and I&#x27;d been using those pillows that have a curve to them to provide better neck support. But I was still having trouble sleeping and having massive headaches all the time, and the google-fu told me to try this. I was skeptical but it wasn&#x27;t too expensive so I figured, what the heck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I could only handle it for about an hour. I could feel my back moving and adjusting and it made me a little bit sore in some places. Mostly in my lower back, where I have a degenerated disc. But I used it every night, for an hour or longer, and within the week I was using it to sleep all night. Now, I can&#x27;t sleep on my old pillow. I don&#x27;t know how I ever slept on other pillows. I sleep better, and my headaches have dramatically decreased. I love this thing.</li>
            <li> This is my second pillow. I wore my first one out. It gives immediate relief to my neck pain and enables me to sleep.</li>
            <li> The roll works fine. After learning about it from &amp;#34;Treat your own Neck&amp;#34;, I had rolled up a towel and with that&lt;br /&gt;started feeling the benefits. This encased version is a bit firmer and more uniform so works better than my&lt;br /&gt;version.</li>
            <li> It really helps with my neck pain that I&#x27;ve every morning when I woke up.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable as I expected.</li>
            <li> Purchased these cervical rolls to use for postures done during Yoga and Egoscue.  They are absolutely perfect for under the neck and curve of the back.  Yoga pillows and bolsters are quite expensive so I was looking for a alternative. These do the job perfectly and I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Ordering and delivery went without a hitch. The roll is what it is meant to be. Soft, yet sturdy enough for support of the neck. Takes some getting use to using.</li>
            <li> not firm enough for neck support</li>
            <li> arrived fast but its very soft -- it would work for someone who wants a soft neck pillow - I wanted something firmer</li>
            <li> I love it it serve the purpose</li>
            <li> Really love this pillow. I always used to wake up woth neck pain but when I use this pillow I don&#x27;t have any issues. I take it with me when I travel and would buy it again!</li>
            <li> Had been using a rolled up towel, before finding the McKenzie Roll.  I really like this cervical pillow, perfect diameter for me since it has \\&quot;give\\&quot;(unlike the Elasto-Gel 3\\&quot; that I also purchased 2 wks earlier.&lt;br /&gt;The McKenzie Cervical Roll, is a good length for sleeping, and if you flop or flip over while sleeping. I just wish it had a firm center \\&quot;rod\\&quot; similar to an Elasto-Gel,  for a bit more support when my neck on occasion needs a bit more support and stretch.</li>
            <li> I actually love this thing because you put it right inside the pillowcase with the pillow. It stays where you need it to stay. It&#x27;s just the right height for my neck. I have horrible neck problems. My ligaments got stretched and the bones are out of place and its a difficult process to get everything back where it needs to be. This neck roll has been a big help because it gives me all the hours of each night to reshape my neck. Plus I do pettibon treatments which is like a neck and back form you lay on on the floor and a neck traction thing you hang on the door to stretch your neck. Easy to find on line. But this neck roll makes an awesome addition to improving my neck structure. It&#x27;s taken me forever to find something just the right size!</li>
            <li> My daughter has a neck pillow that i tried &amp; loved. I bought this pillow because it had the best reviews. It is so hard it feels like it is cutting off my blood at my jugular vein!!! I have herniated disc in neck &amp; was hoping for support, but this is just too hard &amp; hurts me. I have tried it both inside of the pillow case and outside, but it is just too hard with no give at all. Some may like it, but I am very disappointed with it and will not buy again. I might try one of the other models that the reviews said \\&quot;break down\\&quot; and \\&quot;too soft\\&quot; to see if they are any better, but I definitely cannot use this for anything.</li>
            <li> I use it behind my neck while reading or watching TV and behind my back while I&#x27;m on my computer.</li>
            <li> Husband gives it two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  Reliable as always.</li>
            <li> perfect fit and right degree of firmness for my neck.  After nearly a year&#x27;s use, the foam support is softening and so a 2nd purchase has been made. I was certainly satisfied with the first and I am confident that I shall be satisfied this time, as well.</li>
            <li> I use this as a lower back roll on a somewhat shallow bench in my kitchen, and it works perfectly.  I tried it as a neck roll in bed and it was too uncomfortable.  Besides, I do not really need it in bed, so it fills my purposes very well.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for over 15 years.  I have arthritis in my neck, and really need the support.  I can tell when it needs to be replaced as I wake up with a headaches more than 2 days in a row that started in the back of my neck.  Really, I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this roll.</li>
            <li> this cervical roll was a life saver for me, thanks so much</li>
            <li> As posted by others, it does take some getting used to.  For the price it is certainly worth trying and I think it does give my neck a bit of relief.</li>
            <li> I use it when my neck needs that little extra support.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this I have not once woken up with a \\&quot;crick in my neck\\&quot;.  I use it every night.  Obviously it depends on what is causing your problem if this is right for you or not, but for me it works great!</li>
            <li> This pillow provides the perfect support for your neck. Slip inside your pillowcase and enjoy. I am pleasantly surprised. A bonus that it was delivered usps on Sunday.</li>
            <li> It was too hard and uncomfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Perfect little roll. Perfect for that part of neck that does not get enough pillow support. I&#x27;m always fighting with pillows(even expensive pillows) to get that comfortable support for the neck area. I have several bulging discs in my neck and this little pillow helps a lot!</li>
            <li> I sleep with this under my neck and it has helped relieve much of my neck pain.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for my neck after recent surgery. This was recommended by my physical therapist and I am happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Met all expectations</li>
            <li> It smells quite strongly of chemicals, but secures my neck superbly for a comfortable night&#x27;s sleep. (I&#x27;m a side sleeper with persistent neck strain issues.)</li>
            <li> This help change the curve in my neck.  It worked great and was cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked so well that I need to find another one now because the curve in my neck has changed. If they had a bigger size I would order it.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be more firm but it mashes down and pokes up on the ends--annoying!  Did not help my neck at all.  It is already in the &amp;#34;unwanted, ineffective  ortho device bin.&amp;#34;  Planning to try the air inflatable one next, hope it&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> My neck and head ache and feel numb when I wake up in the morning.  No relief really!</li>
            <li> I sleep with it in my pillow every night just like the physical therapist told me and it works great!</li>
            <li> Works great for my &amp;#34;military neck&amp;#34; problem</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not pleased with this purchase.  The cervical roll is too small as I thought the roll would&#x27;ve been much larger.  I would like to return the item.  Kindly advise as to how I can do so.  Thanks.  Stacey Womble 917-674-9587</li>
            <li> This is a very nice cervical roll.  It is not too big!!!  Some cervical rolls are too big (fat), large in diameter, and they raise your head up too high.  This one fits just right for me.  It is firm, but not too firm.  I love it.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love it no more stiff neck problems</li>
            <li> Easy soft not strong. It okay</li>
            <li> I had been waking up in the morning with severe neck pain.  An occupational therapist recommended this product.  It has helped me tremendously.</li>
            <li> This cervical roll pillow does double duty - either under my neck or under the bend in my knees when i sleep on my back.</li>
            <li> I suppose it is good for the job?  But it is very small and really long.  It was difficult to put into a comfortable position for someone who is small and really not suited for a large person.</li>
            <li> This is a great cervical pillow. It supports and cradles your neck just as it should. It is made of foam, so eventually it breaks down in the middle and you will have to replace it. The price was cheaper than what my Physical Therapist sold me my original one for. Since 2011, I have now replaced mine 3 times. Like any other pillow, it is not made to last forever and you should anticipate having to replace it. It serves it purpose and I won&#x27;t and can&#x27;t sleep without it. I have a pinched nerve in my C5-6 vertebrae</li>
            <li> Love it solved neck pain in the morning, great sleep.  My wife still thinks I am a pain in the neck or somewhere else.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I really like this pillow. My chiropractor adjusts my neck so that my head sits more centrally over my back and shoulders, otherwise my head leans out over my chest and pulls on my neck and spine, causing back pain. I purchased this so that I would be able to sleep without my chin in my chest from the average sized pillow, while at the same time trying to keep the correct angle under my neck. This pillow does the trick. I rarely sleep with it, rather I use it for the first 10-20 minutes lying in bed at night, and then I usually switch to a thin, flat pillow right before I fall asleep. This pillow helps shape the curvature of my neck and helps it stay in alignment with my spine during the day, keeping my head positioned correctly and not leaning out over my chest. Not really an all night pillow, at least for me, but I like it enough for what it does for me that I&#x27;m giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is the best neck support you can buy, perfect diameter and firmness.&lt;br /&gt;No more neck pain when you use this</li>
            <li> I realize everyone is different, so this is my review as it fits my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much substance here.  The roll is very soft.  No discernible support, regardless of what and how many pillows I stack beneath it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t sleep without it.  Holds its shape and does the job.  I have bulging disks in my neck and this product really helps.  Easy to take in a suitcase on trips</li>
            <li> Well made, and the foam is of good quality, but it&#x27;s a bit pricey at $18.  It should be $12 or so for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping this roll would help me stop snoring, and help me with a herniated disc in my neck, and it has not helped with either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference on the firmness: I have the roll on top of a Sleep Innovations Contour Memory Foam Pillow, and they&#x27;re about the same firmness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snoring - for my anatomy, the roll is too soft to induce enough extension in my neck to help with snoring.  It&#x27;s comfortable sleeping on your back, but it didn&#x27;t stop my snoring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herniated disc - again, not enough extension for my anatomy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side sleeping - I tend to side sleep a lot (wife pushes me onto my side due to snoring) and this roll is not good for side sleeping.  Within a few minutes I can hear my heartbeat in my ear very clearly.  It unilaterally compresses the carotids enough that you can feel the other carotid compensate with increase in flow.  It compresses it enough that it may even be an stroke risk for a person with clotting issues like thrombophilia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not work for me, but it may work for others.</li>
            <li> What an awesome product. It is the perfect size, and has given my neck so much support. It is great to use for therapy if trying to put the curve back in your neck due to an accident, and it is great for putting behind your neck when watching TV. This has proven to be one of my best purchases.</li>
            <li> not helpful to my neck. I bought another one.</li>
