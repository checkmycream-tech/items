            <li>Pleased with the service, but not the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great I just love it and it came fast</li>
            <li>Most synthetic piece of hair ever.</li>
            <li>Love the length too.</li>
            <li>and this gives my hair more length.</li>
            <li>Besides the color issue i love them.</li>
            <li>This product was okay.</li>
            <li>But it is still okay to use if I want to have a longer hair look.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s more copper than anything.</li>
            <li>The hair was exactly what i wanted!!!</li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s a good product !</li>
            <li>i was so surprised at how good it looked!</li>
            <li>They were good for about a week , very soft and nice.</li>
            <li>Although it has wonderful material and great quality for a cheap price  it did arrive late and the seller was contacted but i would recommend this product if you are patient</li>
            <li>I decided to give them 5 stars because ignoring how long it takes for this product to come in, its very good for the price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good for costume hair, to use a couple times.</li>
            <li>A pretty good product, nevertheless.</li>
            <li>looks good, great for the price.it ended up being longer than i expected.</li>
            <li>This single weft was perfect!</li>
            <li>Overall very happy &amp; worth the price!</li>
            <li>best $$ ever spent.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed :)</li>
            <li>It also gets tangled really easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to put in without any problem.</li>
            <li>Easy fix.</li>
            <li>It tangles easy</li>
            <li>It tangles really easy</li>
            <li>easy to put on;</li>
            <li>Great buy and definitely will purchase again if needed :)</li>
            <li>However the product was neatly and nicely packaged and feels very real.</li>
            <li>but I still have them I liked them when I first got them.</li>
            <li>In order to have a full head of this hair, you need to have 5 or 6 or more of these hair pieces.  </li>
            <li>The color was fine.</li>
            <li>Recieved it quickly &amp; the quality is greatt!</li>
            <li>Super noticeable!  </li>
            <li>You really are getting a lot more than what you&#x27;re paying for!</li>
            <li>I wore it in humid heat at a party today and my hair looked fabulous the whole time, no one realized it wasn&#x27;t all my own hair.  </li>
            <li>i had a gut feeling that i should of gone with light brown from this seller</li>
            <li>the color was kind of purple not so much brown</li>
            <li>made it light brown do not buy</li>
            <li>so it feels secure and will stay in place.</li>
            <li>but it is really cheap.</li>
            <li>hey what can you expect for so cheap?</li>
            <li>The darkest color is still really light , I cut the extensions and curled them .</li>
            <li>The quality is good and the hair is really soft.</li>
            <li>But its okay not their fault I can still wear it just doesnt fit quite right</li>
            <li>I ordered Two of the dark brown and was super impressed with the color, lenghth and the feel of the extension.</li>
            <li>Feels real and it never tangles!!!</li>
            <li>If you are going to get extensions I strongly recommend getting ones that are REAL hair, they work so much better</li>
            <li>, I love the color which was exactly my color</li>
            <li>This is amazing most synthetic hair just shrivels up next to heat</li>
            <li>It was nice and pretty at first</li>
            <li>I opened right from the package, it was smooth and tangle free and clipped it in, with no problems.  </li>
            <li>They are a bit too shiny, shinier than normal hair (healthy or not), but it was easily fixable with a cosplay wig remedy.</li>
            <li>I love this wig because it&#x27;s soooo great and worth the little money it is</li>
            <li>True to color.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product for the price.</li>
            <li>the hair feels very silky, I love the color and the legnth of the hair  </li>
            <li>Plus I was surprised I didn&#x27;t even have to color it to match my own.</li>
            <li>The color was purplish red..not even close to my hair cool</li>
            <li>I love how the hair is so straight</li>
            <li>and I sure didn&#x27;t wanna pay that much for it either.</li>
            <li>Shouldn&#x27;t it be the full refund?</li>
            <li>So for the price not bad.</li>
            <li>These are beautiful, look like human hair, super soft and silky, and true to color!</li>
            <li>Other than the color its a great product.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super tangly</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t care for real hair all that much</li>
            <li>They are pretty true to size and color with the extensions having reddish undertones in the light, giving it an almost auburn look.</li>
            <li>Pretty good overall warning DO NOT USE HAIRSPRAY</li>
            <li>The item arrived sooner than expected, and that was good.</li>
            <li>deffinetly worth the price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soooo soft and so cheap!</li>
            <li>but hey, hopefully its worth the wait ^_^</li>
            <li>so I bought it to make it look more full and straight instead of going into a &amp;#34;v&amp;#34; like my natural hair does.  </li>
            <li>other than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>They are good quality and people can barely tell when I have them in, but I use them mostly to supplement my updo&#x27;s and my braids so that the difference in color will be harder to notice.</li>
            <li>The color isn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t the right color.</li>
            <li>Two of the clips broke right after I put them in.</li>
            <li>Was not the right color I ask for</li>
            <li>They are so soft and pretty :)</li>
            <li>They are very soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li>these extensions came really quickly and are super soft and full.  </li>
            <li>Just got it today only took ten days(: an i love it!!</li>
            <li>It does have a red tint to it, but the color is very accurate to the picture.</li>
            <li>Its really pretty</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more .</li>
            <li>Its really cheap, but soft.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t like the shine, you can run it in hot water.</li>
            <li>these are pretty think for five dollars</li>
            <li>The color was a pretty close match to what I saw here, but they do not at all &amp;#34;look and feel real&amp;#34; as described by the seller.</li>
            <li>However I had to order two more for the thickness to be believable, but because the price is low, it was no big deal.</li>
            <li>the golden brown color in the pic is MUCH DARKER in person.</li>
            <li>There are a lot more red tones to this &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; then appear in the image as well.</li>
            <li>(: aim surely going to buy another one later</li>
            <li>But I really hope they&#x27;re the right hair color &amp; will blend end with my hair.</li>
            <li>: Buy more than one because they are not that thick :)</li>
            <li>The only problem was the color was more burgundy, which wasn&#x27;t much of a problem because I bought this to add to my 70g set of extensions.</li>
            <li>It tangled pretty fast, and once it was tangled it was un usable, after it had been tangled</li>
            <li>Came in pretty fast too.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t need to do anything to them as long as I take care of them.</li>
            <li>I order these on Dec 19th and they came Jan 3rd, very good amount of time from Hong Kong since usually it takes longer</li>
            <li>I completely love them &amp; they are so long!</li>
            <li>They tangle so easily and its only 1 weft.</li>
            <li>overall I am very satisfied with my order and i would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it can be glued back at the seam, and made like new.</li>
            <li>I might just have to play around with it until I find a way to make it look realistic!</li>
            <li>Ordered straight extensions and they sent me curly ones.</li>
            <li>Very Silky</li>
            <li>And Much Longer Than Pictured</li>
            <li>Anyhow thanks</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s why I wear it at night time , you can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really complain for the price.</li>
            <li>The clips work really well and stay put.</li>
            <li>they look real</li>
            <li>It gets all tangled fast when you wear it</li>
            <li>the shipping is really fast</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The hair was very shiny no way you could pass that off as real hair</li>
            <li>i didnt really like it</li>
            <li>and you can do so much with them, but</li>
            <li>I was really nervous about purchasing these</li>
            <li>The hair is REAL .</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and these extentions are straight</li>
            <li>all I had to do was dust the extensions with some body powder and shake it out and gently brush through them.</li>
            <li>Really Lovedddd</li>
            <li>but this doesn&#x27;t go all the way around my head to look real.</li>
            <li>got up getting ready for school</li>
            <li>Everyone thought it was my real hair</li>
            <li>The clips are sturdy and stay in very well</li>
            <li>If you want to use extensions and have them look real, you have to layer them.</li>
            <li>With the price though I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>the problem i had is that it knotted with my real hair</li>
            <li>I got it today the shipping is fast .</li>
            <li>but u can&#x27;t really tell .</li>
            <li>Since its real hair I&#x27;ll just dye it.</li>
            <li>I only wish my hair blended in a little better but other then that I am very happy with my purchase, I would order it again in a second.</li>
            <li>Is a little shiny, much use something to make it more dull but the hair has a nice feel to it!</li>
            <li>The color has a reddish tint, which I am ok with due to my highlights.</li>
            <li>Though it comes in a beautiful color and it is soft like real hair, the extensions were wayyy too thin to work with my hair.</li>
            <li>They are soft but you can very much tell they are synthetic.</li>
            <li>Amazing product for an unbelievable price.</li>
            <li>It is a true brown shade and has no red tones to it.</li>
            <li>Feels and looks like real hair, very soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and looks like real hair.</li>
            <li>YES IT ARRIVED EARLY AND ITS SOFT..BUT!!</li>
            <li>The color is a little winey or reddish which I hopefully can alter but the hair and texture is much better than i would have thought for the terriic price</li>
            <li>I love the color , even though it didn&#x27;t match mine because it was a little reddish</li>
            <li>They are not dark brown more dark red and you can&#x27;t brush them without them ripping and they are full if stactic</li>
            <li>also they will need to be trimmed and layered to blend better if your hair is not already long enough or else</li>
            <li>The picture showed it being a good thickness, but it wasn&#x27;t, because of it being so thin</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s kind of thick</li>
            <li>The only thing I have had a problem with is the seam at the top on one section is already loose after trying them on.</li>
            <li>got all over my new straightner..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering again a new one for my sister.</li>
            <li>These were very soft, they clip on well, and you can straighten them</li>
            <li>it is exactly the same color my hair is.</li>
            <li>The first day I got it, I washed it and wore it, but the next day it was tangled.</li>
            <li>It was almost as long as my hair,but the color was really shiny and not dark more of a red tint with blonde colors through it.</li>
            <li>because I really liked the curly one (felt heavy and looked pretty although the clips need to be closer to the end of the extension because a piece of the black netting pokes out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super long I love it its thick.</li>
            <li>The dark brown is more of a auburn brown and has a ton of red tones in it.</li>
            <li>When I got they hair today I was real exited to open it.</li>
            <li>As a professional hair stylist I have dealt with clip in extensions a lot and client have told me they have paid beyond $200 for theirs and in my opinion</li>
            <li>so if you have naturally think/ corse hair you will need 2 of these.</li>
            <li>Similar products that features real hair cost about 90.00 $.</li>
            <li>but I had no trouble curling them on a low/med setting on my curling iron.</li>
            <li>I was surprised when the mailman brought it.</li>
            <li>today they got here early</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t blend well at all with short hair and it Doesnt look like real hair at ALL.</li>
            <li>This just arrived today, early, which is a plus</li>
            <li>thats pertty far</li>
            <li>only thing is it tangles so much</li>
            <li>Might make a good fake hair piece/dress-up prop for a pre-teen, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>its more red than brown... would compare it to a #6 on a hair extension color grid... but its thick enough to wear if you get your exact color... smells like a new dolls hair as well but again its synthetic</li>
            <li>, obviously the heat didn&#x27;t work too well, it curled a tiny bit but fell right away.</li>
            <li>And once I brushed it out with my hand, it was straight, long and very shiny.</li>
            <li>Only way I got them to look decent.</li>
            <li>Last time I checked, as long as I am not irate/abusive/slanderous in my posts, I reserve the right to leave them up.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really mind how long they took to get here.</li>
            <li>Item arrived sooner than expected and is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>So I ended up ordering new extensions from a different user.</li>
            <li>Let it air dry, If too much heat is applied it will melt.</li>
            <li>I ordered a Dark Brown color and it looks more of a Dark Auburn.</li>
            <li>They are long soft and thick I really love it</li>
            <li>Major plus, they are incredibly soft and look a lot like human hair!</li>
            <li>Way lighter than expected, and very shiny.</li>
            <li>It was pretty overly shiny, and a lot of people say you can baby powder it to remove the shine, but if you&#x27;re baby powdering dark hair</li>
            <li>Thin haired women will probably be okay with this product, however.</li>
            <li>no more so then when you super straighten your hair.</li>
            <li>but it is very soft and long.</li>
            <li>but other than that I really like it</li>
            <li>I was shocked how great the quality of the hair was especially for only paying $5.30 for it.</li>
            <li>They were long and soft.</li>
            <li>The picture shows that it&#x27;s held together with a large black band.</li>
            <li>it blends very well and does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>My real hair is probably 17&amp;#34; and these are supposedly 23&amp;#34; but I put them in my hair is down to my thigh</li>
            <li>/&gt;After leaving this review, the seller called my house and left a message complaining that I need to remove my review because I am being very rude, when I did nothing to initiate contact other than leave what I considered an honest review.  </li>
            <li>the hair is soft and long but it came with ONE track!</li>
            <li>The color really doesn&#x27;t match the picture, and they don&#x27;t stay in as tight as I would like them to.</li>
            <li>Bad purchase not the same color as natural hair good price also took long time to get to me ...</li>
            <li>If it creases up a little heat helps not too much cause you will burn it.</li>

            <li> I def recommend it :)</li>
            <li> but i still liked them and the length is accurate</li>
            <li> but i love it..</li>
            <li> Defiantly ordering more.</li>

            <li> They look like really healthy hair.</li>
            <li> overall great product!</li>
            <li> I will buy one more soo</li>
            <li> but I love the length.  </li>
            <li> Pleased with the service, but not the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great I just love it and it came fast</li>
            <li> Most synthetic piece of hair ever.</li>
            <li> Love the length too.</li>
            <li> and this gives my hair more length.</li>
            <li> Besides the color issue i love them.</li>
            <li> This product was okay.</li>
            <li> But it is still okay to use if I want to have a longer hair look.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s more copper than anything.</li>
            <li> The hair was exactly what i wanted!!!</li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s a good product !</li>
            <li> i was so surprised at how good it looked!</li>
            <li> They were good for about a week , very soft and nice.</li>
            <li> Although it has wonderful material and great quality for a cheap price  it did arrive late and the seller was contacted but i would recommend this product if you are patient</li>
            <li> I decided to give them 5 stars because ignoring how long it takes for this product to come in, its very good for the price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good for costume hair, to use a couple times.</li>
            <li> A pretty good product, nevertheless.</li>
            <li> looks good, great for the price.it ended up being longer than i expected.</li>
            <li> This single weft was perfect!</li>
            <li> Overall very happy &amp; worth the price!</li>
            <li> best $$ ever spent.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed :)</li>
            <li> It also gets tangled really easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to put in without any problem.</li>
            <li> Easy fix.</li>
            <li> It tangles easy</li>
            <li> It tangles really easy</li>
            <li> easy to put on;</li>
            <li> Great buy and definitely will purchase again if needed :)</li>
            <li> However the product was neatly and nicely packaged and feels very real.</li>
            <li> but I still have them I liked them when I first got them.</li>
            <li> In order to have a full head of this hair, you need to have 5 or 6 or more of these hair pieces.  </li>
            <li> The color was fine.</li>
            <li> Recieved it quickly &amp; the quality is greatt!</li>
            <li> Super noticeable!  </li>
            <li> You really are getting a lot more than what you&#x27;re paying for!</li>
            <li> I wore it in humid heat at a party today and my hair looked fabulous the whole time, no one realized it wasn&#x27;t all my own hair.  </li>
            <li> i had a gut feeling that i should of gone with light brown from this seller</li>
            <li> the color was kind of purple not so much brown</li>
            <li> made it light brown do not buy</li>
            <li> so it feels secure and will stay in place.</li>
            <li> but it is really cheap.</li>
            <li> hey what can you expect for so cheap?</li>
            <li> The darkest color is still really light , I cut the extensions and curled them .</li>
            <li> The quality is good and the hair is really soft.</li>
            <li> But its okay not their fault I can still wear it just doesnt fit quite right</li>
            <li> I ordered Two of the dark brown and was super impressed with the color, lenghth and the feel of the extension.</li>
            <li> Feels real and it never tangles!!!</li>
            <li> If you are going to get extensions I strongly recommend getting ones that are REAL hair, they work so much better</li>
            <li> , I love the color which was exactly my color</li>
            <li> This is amazing most synthetic hair just shrivels up next to heat</li>
            <li> It was nice and pretty at first</li>
            <li> I opened right from the package, it was smooth and tangle free and clipped it in, with no problems.  </li>
            <li> They are a bit too shiny, shinier than normal hair (healthy or not), but it was easily fixable with a cosplay wig remedy.</li>
            <li> I love this wig because it&#x27;s soooo great and worth the little money it is</li>
            <li> True to color.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product for the price.</li>
            <li> the hair feels very silky, I love the color and the legnth of the hair  </li>
            <li> Plus I was surprised I didn&#x27;t even have to color it to match my own.</li>
            <li> The color was purplish red..not even close to my hair cool</li>
            <li> I love how the hair is so straight</li>
            <li> and I sure didn&#x27;t wanna pay that much for it either.</li>
            <li> Shouldn&#x27;t it be the full refund?</li>
            <li> So for the price not bad.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful, look like human hair, super soft and silky, and true to color!</li>
            <li> Other than the color its a great product.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super tangly</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t care for real hair all that much</li>
            <li> They are pretty true to size and color with the extensions having reddish undertones in the light, giving it an almost auburn look.</li>
            <li> Pretty good overall warning DO NOT USE HAIRSPRAY</li>
            <li> The item arrived sooner than expected, and that was good.</li>
            <li> deffinetly worth the price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo soft and so cheap!</li>
            <li> but hey, hopefully its worth the wait ^_^</li>
            <li> so I bought it to make it look more full and straight instead of going into a &amp;#34;v&amp;#34; like my natural hair does.  </li>
            <li> other than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> They are good quality and people can barely tell when I have them in, but I use them mostly to supplement my updo&#x27;s and my braids so that the difference in color will be harder to notice.</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t the right color.</li>
            <li> Two of the clips broke right after I put them in.</li>
            <li> Was not the right color I ask for</li>
            <li> They are so soft and pretty :)</li>
            <li> They are very soft and easy to style.</li>
            <li> these extensions came really quickly and are super soft and full.  </li>
            <li> Just got it today only took ten days(: an i love it!!</li>
            <li> It does have a red tint to it, but the color is very accurate to the picture.</li>
            <li> Its really pretty</li>
            <li> Will definitely order more .</li>
            <li> Its really cheap, but soft.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like the shine, you can run it in hot water.</li>
            <li> these are pretty think for five dollars</li>
            <li> The color was a pretty close match to what I saw here, but they do not at all &amp;#34;look and feel real&amp;#34; as described by the seller.</li>
            <li> However I had to order two more for the thickness to be believable, but because the price is low, it was no big deal.</li>
            <li> the golden brown color in the pic is MUCH DARKER in person.</li>
            <li> There are a lot more red tones to this &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; then appear in the image as well.</li>
            <li> (: aim surely going to buy another one later</li>
            <li> But I really hope they&#x27;re the right hair color &amp; will blend end with my hair.</li>
            <li> : Buy more than one because they are not that thick :)</li>
            <li> The only problem was the color was more burgundy, which wasn&#x27;t much of a problem because I bought this to add to my 70g set of extensions.</li>
            <li> It tangled pretty fast, and once it was tangled it was un usable, after it had been tangled</li>
            <li> Came in pretty fast too.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t need to do anything to them as long as I take care of them.</li>
            <li> I order these on Dec 19th and they came Jan 3rd, very good amount of time from Hong Kong since usually it takes longer</li>
            <li> I completely love them &amp; they are so long!</li>
            <li> They tangle so easily and its only 1 weft.</li>
            <li> overall I am very satisfied with my order and i would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it can be glued back at the seam, and made like new.</li>
            <li> I might just have to play around with it until I find a way to make it look realistic!</li>
            <li> Ordered straight extensions and they sent me curly ones.</li>
            <li> Very Silky</li>
            <li> And Much Longer Than Pictured</li>
            <li> Anyhow thanks</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why I wear it at night time , you can&#x27;t really tell.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really complain for the price.</li>
            <li> The clips work really well and stay put.</li>
            <li> they look real</li>
            <li> It gets all tangled fast when you wear it</li>
            <li> the shipping is really fast</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The hair was very shiny no way you could pass that off as real hair</li>
            <li> i didnt really like it</li>
            <li> and you can do so much with them, but</li>
            <li> I was really nervous about purchasing these</li>
            <li> The hair is REAL .</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and these extentions are straight</li>
            <li> all I had to do was dust the extensions with some body powder and shake it out and gently brush through them.</li>
            <li> Really Lovedddd</li>
            <li> but this doesn&#x27;t go all the way around my head to look real.</li>
            <li> got up getting ready for school</li>
            <li> Everyone thought it was my real hair</li>
            <li> The clips are sturdy and stay in very well</li>
            <li> If you want to use extensions and have them look real, you have to layer them.</li>
            <li> With the price though I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li> the problem i had is that it knotted with my real hair</li>
            <li> I got it today the shipping is fast .</li>
            <li> but u can&#x27;t really tell .</li>
            <li> Since its real hair I&#x27;ll just dye it.</li>
            <li> I only wish my hair blended in a little better but other then that I am very happy with my purchase, I would order it again in a second.</li>
            <li> Is a little shiny, much use something to make it more dull but the hair has a nice feel to it!</li>
            <li> The color has a reddish tint, which I am ok with due to my highlights.</li>
            <li> Though it comes in a beautiful color and it is soft like real hair, the extensions were wayyy too thin to work with my hair.</li>
            <li> They are soft but you can very much tell they are synthetic.</li>
            <li> Amazing product for an unbelievable price.</li>
            <li> It is a true brown shade and has no red tones to it.</li>
            <li> Feels and looks like real hair, very soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very soft and looks like real hair.</li>
            <li> YES IT ARRIVED EARLY AND ITS SOFT..BUT!!</li>
            <li> The color is a little winey or reddish which I hopefully can alter but the hair and texture is much better than i would have thought for the terriic price</li>
            <li> I love the color , even though it didn&#x27;t match mine because it was a little reddish</li>
            <li> They are not dark brown more dark red and you can&#x27;t brush them without them ripping and they are full if stactic</li>
            <li> also they will need to be trimmed and layered to blend better if your hair is not already long enough or else</li>
            <li> The picture showed it being a good thickness, but it wasn&#x27;t, because of it being so thin</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s kind of thick</li>
            <li> The only thing I have had a problem with is the seam at the top on one section is already loose after trying them on.</li>
            <li> got all over my new straightner..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering again a new one for my sister.</li>
            <li> These were very soft, they clip on well, and you can straighten them</li>
            <li> it is exactly the same color my hair is.</li>
            <li> The first day I got it, I washed it and wore it, but the next day it was tangled.</li>
            <li> It was almost as long as my hair,but the color was really shiny and not dark more of a red tint with blonde colors through it.</li>
            <li> because I really liked the curly one (felt heavy and looked pretty although the clips need to be closer to the end of the extension because a piece of the black netting pokes out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super long I love it its thick.</li>
            <li> The dark brown is more of a auburn brown and has a ton of red tones in it.</li>
            <li> When I got they hair today I was real exited to open it.</li>
            <li> As a professional hair stylist I have dealt with clip in extensions a lot and client have told me they have paid beyond $200 for theirs and in my opinion</li>
            <li> so if you have naturally think/ corse hair you will need 2 of these.</li>
            <li> Similar products that features real hair cost about 90.00 $.</li>
            <li> but I had no trouble curling them on a low/med setting on my curling iron.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when the mailman brought it.</li>
            <li> today they got here early</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t blend well at all with short hair and it Doesnt look like real hair at ALL.</li>
            <li> This just arrived today, early, which is a plus</li>
            <li> thats pertty far</li>
            <li> only thing is it tangles so much</li>
            <li> Might make a good fake hair piece/dress-up prop for a pre-teen, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> its more red than brown... would compare it to a #6 on a hair extension color grid... but its thick enough to wear if you get your exact color... smells like a new dolls hair as well but again its synthetic</li>
            <li> , obviously the heat didn&#x27;t work too well, it curled a tiny bit but fell right away.</li>
            <li> And once I brushed it out with my hand, it was straight, long and very shiny.</li>
            <li> Only way I got them to look decent.</li>
            <li> Last time I checked, as long as I am not irate/abusive/slanderous in my posts, I reserve the right to leave them up.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really mind how long they took to get here.</li>
            <li> Item arrived sooner than expected and is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> So I ended up ordering new extensions from a different user.</li>
            <li> Let it air dry, If too much heat is applied it will melt.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Dark Brown color and it looks more of a Dark Auburn.</li>
            <li> They are long soft and thick I really love it</li>
            <li> Major plus, they are incredibly soft and look a lot like human hair!</li>
            <li> Way lighter than expected, and very shiny.</li>
            <li> It was pretty overly shiny, and a lot of people say you can baby powder it to remove the shine, but if you&#x27;re baby powdering dark hair</li>
            <li> Thin haired women will probably be okay with this product, however.</li>
            <li> no more so then when you super straighten your hair.</li>
            <li> but it is very soft and long.</li>
            <li> but other than that I really like it</li>
            <li> I was shocked how great the quality of the hair was especially for only paying $5.30 for it.</li>
            <li> They were long and soft.</li>
            <li> The picture shows that it&#x27;s held together with a large black band.</li>
            <li> it blends very well and does not weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> My real hair is probably 17&amp;#34; and these are supposedly 23&amp;#34; but I put them in my hair is down to my thigh</li>
            <li> /&gt;After leaving this review, the seller called my house and left a message complaining that I need to remove my review because I am being very rude, when I did nothing to initiate contact other than leave what I considered an honest review.  </li>
            <li> the hair is soft and long but it came with ONE track!</li>
            <li> The color really doesn&#x27;t match the picture, and they don&#x27;t stay in as tight as I would like them to.</li>
            <li> Bad purchase not the same color as natural hair good price also took long time to get to me ...</li>
            <li> If it creases up a little heat helps not too much cause you will burn it.</li>
            <li> a little tip for straightening though go through it fast with the flat iron  </li>
            <li> my only complaint is that the color is a little more reddish than my natural dark brown hair</li>
            <li> I bought this not knowing how it would really look with my hair (too shiny, too stiff etc.).  </li>
            <li> but if you want real human extentions and you want long lasting these are not the extentions for you.</li>
            <li> I laid them on the back of my toilet and never touched them</li>
            <li> but this hair as long as its only maybe level two or one of heat</li>
            <li> of dryer or flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick hair, so I guess I should&#x27;ve got two.</li>
            <li> My hairs rather thin, so I can&#x27;t wear a full 7 piece set.</li>
            <li> I ordered a dark brown and received a very light brown, when i contacted the seller and explained, they only said sorry colors in monitor are different hope you can understand.</li>
            <li> It is not really dark brown, it looks somewhat reddish, I guess I need a black instead of darkest brown.</li>
            <li> The length was extremely long for me, however, I had them cut.</li>
            <li> I have naturally long hair</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s really long.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s way too long.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s going to turn grey.</li>
            <li> Thought the track of hair would be wider, but the length of hair is long.  </li>
            <li> I would go to sally&#x27;s and see all the hair in the hair aisle and be extremely disappointed when I saw one I liked only to ask the price and find out it cost in the hundreds.</li>
            <li> its so long!</li>
            <li> They are EXTREMELY long!</li>
            <li> I got the other extensions way earlier than these.</li>
            <li> Very long and too shiny.  </li>
            <li> Very Very Very long.</li>
            <li> I have thin long hair and this product blends very well with my hair and gives it length and thickness!</li>
            <li> The dark brown is very reddish and not a true dark brown.  </li>
            <li> A dark brown looked red.</li>
            <li> I bought these extensions hoping for some extra length, but they ended up being too dark for my hair.</li>
            <li> The dark brown was a red color.</li>
            <li> I got two of the dark brown ones they werent even the same color as eachother</li>
            <li> They dont fall out or get loose in my hair.</li>
            <li> Wearing one huge thick weft of hair makes it plainly obvious they&#x27;re fake, so I had to use this only when I wore an updo or a braid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order it in black next time.</li>
            <li> My hairs a dark almost black brown, and I ordered the extension in dark brown, but it came a medium brown with red low lights.</li>
            <li> It was dead on the same color.</li>
            <li> so thats expected...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real looking at all</li>
            <li> A lot longer then i expected.</li>
            <li> A lot thicker than I expected after reading all the reviews.</li>
            <li> This came to me 2 weeks before expected time</li>
            <li> Has a decent amount of hair but the quality sucks!  </li>
            <li> Only reason I gave it one star is because the thickness is good other than that it&#x27;s awful!!!!</li>
            <li> I got the dark brown and it was waaay to dark, it also had a red tinge to it, like a dark auburn.</li>
            <li> The hair is a little shinier than I expected but doesn&#x27;t look super fake.  </li>
            <li> There are five clips holding on to the single black string.</li>
            <li> After a while they will get extremely tangled and you might just have to throw them out.</li>
            <li> Getting a lot of fallout and the clips are pretty uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Overall, not sure if i&#x27;m even going to try it on.</li>
            <li> then i read the other reviews...</li>
            <li> Got here sooner than expected took like a week and half.</li>
            <li> I would probably need two or three to camouflage with my real hair--and my hair is thick but not THAT thick.</li>
            <li> and I ordered dark brown</li>
            <li> It is not worth buying and plus it was tangled at the ends</li>
            <li> either I ordered dark brown and got a reddish brown color.</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown,  when I got it</li>
            <li> Kinda scary it does feel like real hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown and just opened it</li>
            <li> I order 23inch dark brown</li>
            <li> I thought I order dark brown</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and these extensions are pretty thick.</li>
            <li> Well thick enough for me.</li>
            <li> Now the color tho is really dark for a dark brown almost black...</li>
            <li> Not very helpful at all!!</li>
            <li> My Only complaint is the shine, which may not be a problem for some people but my hair being bleached once and dyed is a little damaged.</li>
            <li> Also, it is very rough in texture!</li>
            <li> So it took a month and a half to get to the states.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sewn together with one string of black thread.</li>
            <li> These extensions shipped to my location in about a week and a half.</li>
            <li> It goes down to my hips, only problem is that they are thin so I would have to buy another pair but other than that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a full head clip though, so buyers beware.  </li>
            <li> The hair falls out pretty bad, but i expected that for the price.</li>
            <li> took a little while to get though</li>
            <li> so i used a little piece then that piece was got ruined...</li>
            <li> I am gonna try and trim the ends a little</li>
            <li> Not worth the money or wait!</li>
            <li> but it makes it feel a little like when hair has split ends..</li>
            <li> After reading reviews i was a little concerned, however i recived package in one week.</li>
            <li> she says there a little heavy</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money again on this.</li>
            <li> orderd a dark brown color -i usually wear 1b</li>
            <li> after a few days of wear they went to heck,</li>
            <li> then it got stiff nappy</li>
            <li> Even for a synthetic, they are not great quality, and they feel very coarse and tangle very badly and easily.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have a small skull so its a little to big for me.</li>
            <li> but anyways after a week they got all bad i tried taking care of them as much as i can ..</li>
            <li> i dont even wear them no more.</li>
            <li> They do not curl worth crap or at all.</li>
            <li> Not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> Since its not human hair, they do tangle and look fake.</li>
            <li> Very thin not enough hair.</li>
            <li> Looks very uneven .</li>
            <li> I usually get my extensions from sally&#x27;s that are extremely expensive and aren&#x27;t as long.</li>
            <li> They are a little thin</li>
            <li> As soon as we took it out of the package it was an instant disappointment.</li>
            <li> They should at least say..</li>
            <li> but then i was like oh well to late now</li>
            <li> It is nowhere as thick as it appears in the image.</li>
            <li> but i stuck with my usual color!</li>
            <li> I have alot of hair and its thick so for the extensions to show its no good.</li>
            <li> The quality isn&#x27;t too bad if you do not mind constant care.  </li>
            <li> NO GOOD.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s blonde :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons- gets tangled so easily &amp; very hard to brush</li>
            <li> These extentions are very thick and have not sheded any hair on me yet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a tad thin</li>
            <li> Da hair is a waist of money its thin as hell get tangled and do a lot of shedding i will not be buying again</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 packs because they look so thin.</li>
            <li> these were too thin.</li>
            <li> too shiny and too thin.</li>
            <li> However, I didn&#x27;t even need to remove it from the package to see the poor quality.</li>
            <li> Wayyy to thin, prob should buy three and scissors to look somewhat legit.</li>
            <li> It is also thin and you will probably need two.</li>
            <li> Its horse hair that is brassy and not good!</li>
            <li> and the extension was extremely staticy and knotted. :(</li>
            <li> So it looks fake in my hair.</li>
            <li> I didnt like this product because the hair is obviously fake.</li>
            <li> WHO KNOW ABOUT WEARING FAKE HAIR</li>
            <li> When it was hipped one of the clips were broken!</li>
            <li> Horrible product it came with only 1 TRACK .</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> these look fake, and also they were way darker than shown</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sorry</li>
            <li> I figured why not try to use heat on it, because it was useless anyways</li>
            <li> but they are fake hair</li>
            <li> it had ill reddish hairs</li>
            <li> did not match my hair color , look weird when placed on hair because when you lift your head you see the hair underneath</li>
            <li> and i just dont like synthetic hair sorry .</li>
            <li> I have medium thickness hair and one made it look weird.</li>
            <li> The hair looks very fake and is difficult to untangle.</li>
            <li> you can todally see that it&#x27;s fake hair when you have it in because it doesnt fill out with the rest of my hair!</li>
            <li> For the price, if it tangles really bad after I wear it a bunch of times, I&#x27;ll just purchase another one.  </li>
            <li> I read a bad review of this after i ordered it and was worried.</li>

            <li> It really disappointed me!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, the extention was all tangled when I got it</li>
            <li> Damn thing fell apart and the texture of it is pathetic.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Its really pretty but the color is a bit off. A dark brown looked red. It also gets tangled really easily.</li>
            <li> Ordered straight extensions and they sent me curly ones. It&#x27;s okay because I really liked the curly one (felt heavy and looked pretty although the clips need to be closer to the end of the extension because a piece of the black netting pokes out.) Maybe double check with the buyer before placing an order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with these . Although the color was different from the picture it still blends with my hair well . It has a good thickness to it . Will definitely order more .</li>
            <li> Very Silky And Much Longer Than Pictured&lt;br /&gt;but..&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase two if you want a thicker fuller look&lt;br /&gt;and Yes, I am buying one more&lt;br /&gt;it matches my hair perfectly and for the price it is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is amazing most synthetic hair just shrivels up next to heat but this hair as long as its only maybe level two or one of heat it works! And holds shape so well! Im just amazed! Now the color tho is really dark for a dark brown almost black... But then again i guess thats my own fault i had a gut feeling that i should of gone with light brown from this seller but i stuck with my usual color! ;p but thats okay its still a beautiful color I&#x27;m going to dye my hair tomorrow to match it.</li>
            <li> Kids really love these.  Very nice quality.  They wanted to dye them to match their umbre, didn&#x27;t work, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to.  Anyhow thanks</li>
            <li> I just received my order and I can&#x27;t wait to wear them. The quality is good and the hair is really soft. The ship time was faster than I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful, look like human hair, super soft and silky, and true to color! Order 2 for thicker hair, you can also cut these to blend in your hair better.</li>
            <li> I order these on Dec 19th and they came Jan 3rd, very good amount of time from Hong Kong since usually it takes longer but it is very soft and long. It goes down to my hips, only problem is that they are thin so I would have to buy another pair but other than that, I love the color which was exactly my color and everything was good just the thiness was a problem.</li>
            <li> The dark brown is very reddish and not a true dark brown.  Had to toss it.</li>
            <li> They are amazing. I can curl/straighten them without any problem. Easy to put in without any problem. True to color.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and these extensions are pretty thick. So it looks fake in my hair.</li>
            <li> Got here sooner than expected took like a week and half. The way it was packaged tho left a crease in the hair. Easy fix. It&#x27;s super long I love it its thick. Well thick enough for me. It&#x27;s a bit shiny though , that&#x27;s why I wear it at night time , you can&#x27;t really tell. If it creases up a little heat helps not too much cause you will burn it. The color was fine. And they gave you extra clips just in case. Overall a good product. Can&#x27;t really complain for the price. You get what you pay for. I def recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I didnt like this product because the hair is obviously fake. It looks like plastic barbie hair. and it breaks off the clips very easy.</li>
            <li> The clips work really well and stay put. The hair is a little shinier than I expected but doesn&#x27;t look super fake.  It is a true brown shade and has no red tones to it. Overall a good product for the price. delivery took forever!!</li>
            <li> Item arrived sooner than expected and is exactly what I was looking for. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Damn thing fell apart and the texture of it is pathetic.</li>
            <li> Way lighter than expected, and very shiny. other than that it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. The length was extremely long for me, however, I had them cut. The color has a reddish tint, which I am ok with due to my highlights. Major plus, they are incredibly soft and look a lot like human hair! The only thing I have had a problem with is the seam at the top on one section is already loose after trying them on. I&#x27;m sure it can be glued back at the seam, and made like new. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend these for the price!</li>
            <li> These are so stringy and crappy. They tangle so easily and its only 1 weft. I hate it and regret ordering it.</li>
            <li> The hair is not human hair. It&#x27;s synthetic it gets tangled all the time this hair is trash. I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Pretty good overall warning DO NOT USE HAIRSPRAY YOU SILL RUIN THEM otherwise they look real</li>
            <li> When I got they hair today I was real exited to open it. When I did it was so alot thinner than I thought. The picture showed it being a good thickness, but it wasn&#x27;t, because of it being so thin you can todally see that it&#x27;s fake hair when you have it in because it doesnt fill out with the rest of my hair! I might just have to play around with it until I find a way to make it look realistic!</li>
            <li> YES IT ARRIVED EARLY AND ITS SOFT..BUT!! ITS TO SHINNY FOR THOUSE WHO KNOW ABOUT WEARING FAKE HAIR YOU CAN DEFENATLY TELL THIS IS CHEAP SINTHETIC HAIR!!!!! I TRIED THAT BABY POWDER &amp;#34;TRICK&amp;#34; AND IT DIDNT WORK THATS HOW SINTHETIC IT IS! BUT I GUES LIKE EVERYBODY SAY YOU GET WHAT YOU PAYED FOR!!!</li>
            <li> Has a decent amount of hair but the quality sucks!  It gets all tangled fast when you wear it so you look like you have a rats nest!</li>
            <li> the hair feels very silky, I love the color and the legnth of the hair  the shipping is really fast my item arrived a week earlier the only thing that i dont like is that the hair looks too shiny.</li>
            <li> It sheds but I like it</li>
            <li> I bought this not knowing how it would really look with my hair (too shiny, too stiff etc.).  I have naturally long hair and it&#x27;s kind of thick but it&#x27;s layered and my longest layer is sparse so I bought it to make it look more full and straight instead of going into a &amp;#34;v&amp;#34; like my natural hair does.  I opened right from the package, it was smooth and tangle free and clipped it in, with no problems.  It wasn&#x27;t too shiny..it matched my hair perfectly and it&#x27;s soft and beautiful.  For the price, if it tangles really bad after I wear it a bunch of times, I&#x27;ll just purchase another one.  It exceeded my expectations for the price.  I wore it in humid heat at a party today and my hair looked fabulous the whole time, no one realized it wasn&#x27;t all my own hair.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> the color was kind of purple not so much brown but i still liked them and the length is accurate</li>
            <li> Exceeded any expectations. Amazing product for an unbelievable price. You really are getting a lot more than what you&#x27;re paying for! Fast shipping. Blend amazingly. Clip in well. I have already repurchased another 4!</li>
            <li> Almost what I was expecting thank you for sending it so promptly.  It will work great for which I bought it for</li>
            <li> These extentions are very thick and have not sheded any hair on me yet. I completely love them &amp; they are so long!</li>
            <li> Just got it today only took ten days(: an i love it!! It tangles easy but c&#x27;mon its hair its goin to but i love it.. It&#x27;s beautiful (:</li>
            <li> I usually get my extensions from sally&#x27;s that are extremely expensive and aren&#x27;t as long. So this was a shock to me, I just got my piece and its literally perfect, and it was cheap. Defiantly ordering more.</li>
            <li> The hair was very shiny no way you could pass that off as real hair and I ordered dark brown but it being synthetic made it light brown do not buy</li>
            <li> my daughter loves them she says there a little heavy but she would buy them in again she would tell her Friends about them ...</li>
            <li> I was shocked how great the quality of the hair was especially for only paying $5.30 for it. As a professional hair stylist I have dealt with clip in extensions a lot and client have told me they have paid beyond $200 for theirs and in my opinion this one is so much more better and so much more cheaper. Plus I was surprised I didn&#x27;t even have to color it to match my own. It was dead on the same color. Super happy customer here :)</li>
            <li> They felt awful! It tangles really easy! Nothing like hair at all! It really disappointed me! Doesn&#x27;t blend well either!</li>
            <li> Bad purchase not the same color as natural hair good price also took long time to get to me ...</li>
            <li> these extensions came really quickly and are super soft and full.  They look like really healthy hair. my only complaint is that the color is a little more reddish than my natural dark brown hair so I am going to try to dye them.  overall great product!</li>
            <li> Piece of junk! When it was hipped one of the clips were broken! Sent two weeks later than it was suppose too! The hair was fried! Just nasty! And junk!</li>
            <li> It was nice and pretty at first then it got stiff nappy i didnt do nothing to it and it just ended up looking like it i didnt really like it i dont even wear them no more.</li>
            <li> It tangles really easy and once it gets tangled you can&#x27;t get it untangled. Let me know if there is a way or a method you use to untangle.</li>
            <li> this was for my daughter and it was just what she wanted. she would order again. took a little while to get though</li>
            <li> This extension get tangled very easily, to the point where at the end of the day they look like dreads. If you are going to get extensions I strongly recommend getting ones that are REAL hair, they work so much better and you can do so much with them, but if you have your heart set on these i recommend after every use you put them back in the plastic bag that they came in, brush them before you put them in and after you take them out. After a while they will get extremely tangled and you might just have to throw them out. They work very good when you curl them and they hold the curl for the day. but this product i do not recommend to any one.</li>
            <li> They dont look anything like the picture. It was balled up in the package when we opened it. As soon as we took it out of the package it was an instant disappointment. My daughter has been trying to get the tangles out ever since they got here.</li>
            <li> It was almost as long as my hair,but the color was really shiny and not dark more of a red tint with blonde colors through it. Its really cheap, but soft. So for the price not bad. In the pic it looked a lot darker</li>
            <li> Horrible product it came with only 1 TRACK . It is not worth buying and plus it was tangled at the ends</li>
            <li> I bought these extensions hoping for some extra length, but they ended up being too dark for my hair. They are good quality and people can barely tell when I have them in, but I use them mostly to supplement my updo&#x27;s and my braids so that the difference in color will be harder to notice. I thought they were going to be useless, but I&#x27;ve worn them quite a lot and am glad that I bought them.</li>
            <li> I purchased this around October and waited along time for it to get here and after 2 months I emailed the seller and found that the product was lost during shipping. But it was here within 5 days! I have thin long hair and this product blends very well with my hair and gives it length and thickness! It comes with a lot of clips which is great so it feels secure and will stay in place. Deffiently a great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Can anyone tell me if it&#x27;s just a one piece? Or is it like a 7 or 8 piece? I need help promto</li>
            <li> These extensions are for a mannequin head. If you don&#x27;t like the shine, you can run it in hot water. Only condition it, no shampoo. Let it air dry, If too much heat is applied it will melt. It can be heated at the lowest temp. of dryer or flat iron.</li>
            <li> The product is actually great. Feels and looks like real hair, very soft. I ordered a Dark Brown color and it looks more of a Dark Auburn. It takes about 3 weeks to arrive. Other than the color its a great product.</li>
            <li> I ordered a dark brown and received a very light brown, when i contacted the seller and explained, they only said sorry colors in monitor are different hope you can understand. Not very helpful at all!! Hair quality is nice, but what good is it if you don´t know what color your going to get!&lt;br /&gt;Will not purchase again!</li>
            <li> Its horse hair that is brassy and not good! Would not buy again. If you like horse hair its for you but if not do not buy!!</li>
            <li> It was nappy and couldn&#x27;t comb it so you should not buy this product</li>
            <li> I was really nervous about purchasing these but I had a leap of faith and clicked buy. The estimated delivery time was January 22-Febraury 6 and today is January 16 and I just received them (: Very happy with them, they&#x27;re super soft and absolutely gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Well the first couple days i absolutly LOVED them! Then i went to go see if i can straighten so i used a little piece then that piece was got ruined...got all over my new straightner.. terrible. I was so pissed off. Maybe they should put that information but anyways after a week they got all bad i tried taking care of them as much as i can .. they maybe at a low price but if you want real human extentions and you want long lasting these are not the extentions for you.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really mind how long they took to get here. When they did come, the packaging was kind of crappy, but nothing was damaged, there the perfect thickness in my opinion..BUT they SUCK. They do not curl worth crap or at all. I am not impressed. I just got these and THEY dont do the one thing there supposed to. Don&#x27;t buy these. They should at least say..THESE DONT CURL somewhere.</li>
            <li> these are pretty think for five dollars they kinda took a while probably 3 to 4 weeks to arrive. but they are amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will buy one more soo my hair can look thicker</li>
            <li> The color was purplish red..not even close to my hair cool and the extension was extremely staticy and knotted. :(</li>
            <li> these look fake, and also they were way darker than shown, i ended up haveing to give them to my cousin, perfect timing though i guess cause it was her bday</li>
            <li> The hair looks very fake and is difficult to untangle. The color isn&#x27;t right either I ordered dark brown and got a reddish brown color.</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown,  when I got it I was kinda dissatisfied because the color was a bit off like burgandy but it blends w my hair anyways. It&#x27;s super tangly but I love the length.  If you want extensions that will last don&#x27;t purchase these!</li>
            <li> The item arrived sooner than expected, and that was good. The color was a pretty close match to what I saw here, but they do not at all &amp;#34;look and feel real&amp;#34; as described by the seller. Even for a synthetic, they are not great quality, and they feel very coarse and tangle very badly and easily. Pleased with the service, but not the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After leaving this review, the seller called my house and left a message complaining that I need to remove my review because I am being very rude, when I did nothing to initiate contact other than leave what I considered an honest review.  Last time I checked, as long as I am not irate/abusive/slanderous in my posts, I reserve the right to leave them up.  I hope that someone else finds my experience helpful, as that is what reviews are intended for.</li>
            <li> So it took a month and a half to get to the states. But it&#x27;s really long. Kinda scary it does feel like real hair. The only problem is when I ran my fingers through it a big chunk of fell out of the clips. It&#x27;s sewn together with one string of black thread. It may be good for a 1-2 time use but I don&#x27;t see this thing lasting unless I can figure out how to sew it myself. The color is amazing it is exactly the same color my hair is. The picture shows that it&#x27;s held together with a large black band. It&#x27;s not though. There are five clips holding on to the single black string. It&#x27;s a tad thin so if you have naturally think/ corse hair you will need 2 of these. Straighten your hair and it will blend perfectly.</li>
            <li> I decided to give them 5 stars because ignoring how long it takes for this product to come in, its very good for the price! They get knotted up but what hair doesn&#x27;t! The hair is REAL . Therefor  you can straighten, curl, and wash this product. Similar products that features real hair cost about 90.00 $. This deal is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Buy more than one because they are not that thick :)</li>
            <li> I love how the hair is so straight and it adds a perfect length to your hair. Their is 5 clips to clip it in and its just perfect! Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better! You can even wash it! (: Perfect, Recommend!!!</li>
            <li> my extentions came in the mail yesterday. I have very curly hair and these extentions are straight so I only wear these when my hair is in a braid. it blends very well and does not weigh my hair down. however one of the clips already broke, but for the price i paid, I am really happy with what I got.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I was expecting</li>
            <li> looks good, great for the price.it ended up being longer than i expected. I am gonna try and trim the ends a little</li>
            <li> I have been yearning for extensions for like forever. I would go to sally&#x27;s and see all the hair in the hair aisle and be extremely disappointed when I saw one I liked only to ask the price and find out it cost in the hundreds. I honestly didn&#x27;t care for real hair all that much and I sure didn&#x27;t wanna pay that much for it either. seeing this product on amazon for 5 dollars and I took a chance and bought it. I was extremely happy when it arrived within 2 weeks seeing as how it ships from china and the packaging was sturdy and intact. I opened it eagerly and ran my fingers through them they were perfect. My Only complaint is the shine, which may not be a problem for some people but my hair being bleached once and dyed is a little damaged. all I had to do was dust the extensions with some body powder and shake it out and gently brush through them. they looked amazing after that. I looked that up on Google btw (people have powdered wigs for centuries). They are synthetic but I had no trouble curling them on a low/med setting on my curling iron. They are a little thin so if you have thicker or ethnic hair I would suggest getting 2 packages. also they will need to be trimmed and layered to blend better if your hair is not already long enough or else they will look stupid. overall I am very satisfied with my order and i would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I ordered Two of the dark brown and was super impressed with the color, lenghth and the feel of the extension. I only wish my hair blended in a little better but other then that I am very happy with my purchase, I would order it again in a second.</li>
            <li> Lied about the color.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed, the extention was all tangled when I got it and it wasn&#x27;t the right color. Never ordering again.</li>
            <li> Very long and too shiny.  Would wear for a party or Halloween that&#x27;s about all.</li>
            <li> Great I just love it and it came fast I was surprised when the mailman brought it. I&#x27;m ordering again a new one for my sister.</li>
            <li> Recieved it quickly &amp; the quality is greatt! Really Lovedddd This Product! Very happy with quality and duration , for synthetic hair really good stuff!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful. best $$ ever spent. .&lt;br /&gt;Pros- looks real ; cheap ; easy to put on; great delivery&lt;br /&gt;Cons- gets tangled so easily &amp; very hard to brush</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sorry but this doesn&#x27;t go all the way around my head to look real. The material is good but it should have 7 attachments 5 of them for the side of your head. NO GOOD.</li>
            <li> Great four a couple of months but deffinetly worth the price</li>
            <li> Though it comes in a beautiful color and it is soft like real hair, the extensions were wayyy too thin to work with my hair. I would probably need two or three to camouflage with my real hair--and my hair is thick but not THAT thick. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money again on this. Thin haired women will probably be okay with this product, however.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price. Gets tangled very easily but it is really cheap. I would buy again. Don&#x27;t expect to get it soon because shipping took awhile</li>
            <li> It is not really dark brown, it looks somewhat reddish, I guess I need a black instead of darkest brown.</li>
            <li> just got them today they got here early i ordered 3 of them i still have to cut the one strip to cover the rest of my head</li>
            <li> Da hair is a waist of money its thin as hell get tangled and do a lot of shedding i will not be buying again</li>
            <li> Worst hair!!! Only reason I gave it one star is because the thickness is good other than that it&#x27;s awful!!!!</li>
            <li> The hair is beautiful and the color matched my dark brown hair perfectly. However I had to order two more for the thickness to be believable, but because the price is low, it was no big deal. Happy I bought them.</li>
            <li> I forgot to review these but now my hairs a different color but I still have them I liked them when I first got them.</li>
            <li> Most synthetic piece of hair ever. If your African american don&#x27;t buy this. Please. Its barbie doll hair.</li>
            <li> Is a little shiny, much use something to make it more dull but the hair has a nice feel to it! Love the length too. its so long!</li>
            <li> I read all 162 reviews before buyin this product. After I ordered they took forever to get here. Two of the clips broke right after I put them in. I laid them on the back of my toilet and never touched them got up getting ready for school and they matted together!! I was so mad! Not worth the money or wait!</li>
            <li> orderd a dark brown color -i usually wear 1b but his was just wayyyyy off! its more red than brown... would compare it to a #6 on a hair extension color grid... but its thick enough to wear if you get your exact color... smells like a new dolls hair as well but again its synthetic so thats expected...</li>
            <li> I like this it goes good with hair and this gives my hair more length.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not real looking at all and you might have to cut it, it&#x27;s way too long.</li>
            <li> Nooooooooo!  I ordered dark brown and just opened it but it&#x27;s blonde :(</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t blend well at all with short hair and it Doesnt look like real hair at ALL. the golden brown color in the pic is MUCH DARKER in person.Will not purchase again</li>
            <li> They are so soft and pretty :)</li>
            <li> These extensions were really great. Everyone thought it was my real hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a full head clip though, so buyers beware.  In order to use this piece, you have to section your hair and then place the hair piece.  In order to have a full head of this hair, you need to have 5 or 6 or more of these hair pieces.  The quality isn&#x27;t too bad if you do not mind constant care.  The hair is synthetic and tangles quite a bit.</li>
            <li> These were very soft, they clip on well, and you can straighten them but it makes it feel a little like when hair has split ends.. a little tip for straightening though go through it fast with the flat iron  Although it has wonderful material and great quality for a cheap price  it did arrive late and the seller was contacted but i would recommend this product if you are patient</li>
            <li> It was nice but it was on extension</li>
            <li> Was not the right color I ask for</li>
            <li> I ordered these over a month ago and they haven&#x27;t shown. Severely disappointed and quite frankly I just want my money back. They&#x27;re not going to go to use now.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 packs because they look so thin. It took a month to get her and is from Asia. The dark brown is more of a auburn brown and has a ton of red tones in it. I tried curling them and they just melted on my curler like Barbie hair would. These definitely aren&#x27;t human. My real hair is probably 17&amp;#34; and these are supposedly 23&amp;#34; but I put them in my hair is down to my thigh and I am 5&#x27;7 and tall. The clips are sturdy and stay in very well but I would only get these for Halloween. They are soft but you can very much tell they are synthetic.</li>
            <li> The dark brown was a red color. Not even brown at all. Besides the color issue i love them. They dont fall out or get loose in my hair. I tryed to dye them brown but the dye doesnt work with it.</li>
            <li> When they first came in the mail, they were awesome! They seemed perfect... after a few days of wear they went to heck, split ends nastiness, just gross. I will never buy these again, but hey what can you expect for so cheap?</li>
            <li> If you want to use extensions and have them look real, you have to layer them. Wearing one huge thick weft of hair makes it plainly obvious they&#x27;re fake, so I had to use this only when I wore an updo or a braid. With the price though I can&#x27;t really complain. It was pretty overly shiny, and a lot of people say you can baby powder it to remove the shine, but if you&#x27;re baby powdering dark hair it&#x27;s going to turn grey. It tangled pretty fast, and once it was tangled it was un usable, after it had been tangled I figured why not try to use heat on it, because it was useless anyways, obviously the heat didn&#x27;t work too well, it curled a tiny bit but fell right away. Also products have no affect on it, hairspray does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty good for costume hair, to use a couple times.</li>
            <li> They were good for about a week , very soft and nice. But after a while they became so notted up and tangled that I couldn&#x27;t even comb through it. Plus they don&#x27;t curl.</li>
            <li> I received them 2 weeks earlier then estimated delivery! They match my hair perfect! brown with a reddish tint to them. They are EXTREMELY long! A lot longer then i expected. The hair falls out pretty bad, but i expected that for the price. I like them a lot!</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s very soft and looks like real hair. It does have a red tint to it, but the color is very accurate to the picture. Great buy and definitely will purchase again if needed :)</li>
            <li> these were too thin. I have pretty thick hair, so I guess I should&#x27;ve got two. too shiny and too thin.</li>
            <li> They took a month to be delivered and as soon as I put them in them a clip broke. They are really nice but they are fake hair so they got ruined when I tried doing anything with them. I do not recommend to buy this product.</li>
            <li> I read a bad review of this after i ordered it and was worried. it came today and is terrific! The color is a little winey or reddish which I hopefully can alter but the hair and texture is much better than i would have thought for the terriic price and I would order this again in a minute</li>
            <li> This product was okay. The first day I got it, I washed it and wore it, but the next day it was tangled. I couldn&#x27;t even comb it through and still can&#x27;t to this day. I&#x27;ve had it for a month now. I really don&#x27;t like this item at all, my money was wasted.</li>
            <li> Thought the track of hair would be wider, but the length of hair is long.  I also thought the are hair extensions would be fuller in the amount of hair.  But it is still okay to use if I want to have a longer hair look.</li>
            <li> Great came just as promised. Unfortunately I have a small skull so its a little to big for me. But its okay not their fault I can still wear it just doesnt fit quite right</li>
            <li> Color was off, I ordered the darkest brown and it came in as a chesnut color. Getting a lot of fallout and the clips are pretty uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Very thin not enough hair. Looks very uneven . the problem i had is that it knotted with my real hair</li>
            <li> the hair is soft and long but it came with ONE track! just one? it says extensions so why is there only ONE extension.</li>
            <li> So I ordered these thinking that they were human hair. THEY ARE NOT! So I ended up ordering new extensions from a different user. I got the other extensions way earlier than these. I actually ended up cancelling the order but they still ended up shipping them. When I received them, I emailed this user about returning them. In response they gave me, they can only refund me 50%. ....50%??? Shouldn&#x27;t it be the full refund? Their &amp;#34;manager&amp;#34; was supposed to talk to me about the refund issue, and its been 2 weeks now. Haven not heard anything. I&#x27;m not even going to use these! I just threw away money with product. Not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> 4 Stars because I loved it but it got tangled up and I would have to keep brushing it out .....but other than that I really like it and it matched my hair color.....</li>
            <li> This is what you pay cheap cheap cheap!!! Are so ugly plastic hair .. This is so fake fake!!! I&#x27;m not recommend this please don&#x27;t waist your money!!</li>
            <li> These extensions shipped to my location in about a week and a half. They are pretty true to size and color with the extensions having reddish undertones in the light, giving it an almost auburn look.They are very soft and easy to style. They are a bit too shiny, shinier than normal hair (healthy or not), but it was easily fixable with a cosplay wig remedy. A pretty good product, nevertheless.</li>
            <li> This just arrived today, early, which is a plus I guess. However, I didn&#x27;t even need to remove it from the package to see the poor quality. It is nowhere as thick as it appears in the image. Also, it is very rough in texture! Dose not feel like hair at all. There are a lot more red tones to this &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; then appear in the image as well. Overall, not sure if i&#x27;m even going to try it on. Might make a good fake hair piece/dress-up prop for a pre-teen, that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I got it today the shipping is fast . They are long soft and thick I really love it I order 23inch dark brown it had ill reddish hairs but u can&#x27;t really tell . I would recommend this product !!!(: aim surely going to buy another one later</li>
            <li> did not match my hair color , look weird when placed on hair because when you lift your head you see the hair underneath and when you see a big difference between the hairs above the extension .. looks like a wanna be horse .. and i just dont like synthetic hair sorry .</li>
            <li> Wayyy to thin, prob should buy three and scissors to look somewhat legit. But if you have really short hair you&#x27;ll need to invest in time</li>
            <li> Feels real and it never tangles!!! It&#x27;s soooo soft and so cheap! I love this wig because it&#x27;s soooo great and worth the little money it is</li>
            <li> My hairs rather thin, so I can&#x27;t wear a full 7 piece set. This single weft was perfect! A lot thicker than I expected after reading all the reviews. Very Very Very long. The color was definitely off though. My hairs a dark almost black brown, and I ordered the extension in dark brown, but it came a medium brown with red low lights. I&#x27;ll order it in black next time. Since its real hair I&#x27;ll just dye it. I have yet to use heat on it though. Came in pretty fast too. I ordered on June 19th, &amp; received it July 1st. Overall very happy &amp; worth the price!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten the hair yet. But I really hope they&#x27;re the right hair color &amp; will blend end with my hair. But I have to wait until june 17 to get them :/ thats pertty far :/ but hey, hopefully its worth the wait ^_^</li>
            <li> I got the dark brown and it was waaay to dark, it also had a red tinge to it, like a dark auburn. It is also thin and you will probably need two. I have medium thickness hair and one made it look weird. However the product was neatly and nicely packaged and feels very real. It&#x27;s a tad shiny but no more so then when you super straighten your hair. All in all I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> I received mine and put them in for a wedding I was going to attend. The color really doesn&#x27;t match the picture, and they don&#x27;t stay in as tight as I would like them to. These are a one time use extensions. You get what you pay for. Since its not human hair, they do tangle and look fake.</li>
            <li> This came to me 2 weeks before expected time and I was very pleased ! I love the color , even though it didn&#x27;t match mine because it was a little reddish but it fit perfectly with my sisters hair so I let her have it! I&#x27;m very pleased only thing is it tangles so much but so far it&#x27;s a good product ! I was not disappointed :)</li>
            <li> They were long and soft. The only problem was the color was more burgundy, which wasn&#x27;t much of a problem because I bought this to add to my 70g set of extensions. So they look like highlights. They are synthetic but I&#x27;m sure I won&#x27;t need to do anything to them as long as I take care of them.</li>
            <li> The price was good so I bought them and what a wast of money! They are not dark brown more dark red and you can&#x27;t brush them without them ripping and they are full if stactic</li>
            <li> Super noticeable!  I have alot of hair and its thick so for the extensions to show its no good. The darkest color is still really light , I cut the extensions and curled them . Only way I got them to look decent.</li>
            <li> After reading reviews i was a little concerned, however i recived package in one week. The hair was exactly what i wanted!!! Great product for the price. I will def be ordering again in the future!!!</li>
            <li> i ordered this thinking it would be really good for a cheap price. then i read the other reviews... some were good some were bad. but then i was like oh well to late now, then it came in i was so surprised at how good it looked! just what i wanted!! honestly i think the people or whatever that made them sometimes watch what they doing and then others rush because after my sister-in-law ordered the same thing from the same people and hers was so messed up, the hair was falling out and the clips would brake off. i dont know what happened when they were making the one she got but mines was perfect! just gotta hope you get the good one out of the batch i guess. oh well in the end she just uses mine and between the both of us it holds up pretty good! i would def buy another one but im scared to get a messed up one like she had. i wouldnt say not to get this, i just say cross your fingures after you order it.</li>
            <li> I got two of the dark brown ones they werent even the same color as eachother</li>
            <li> The hair is horrible...I didn&#x27;t even attempt to put this in my head.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, it was in a coil. And once I brushed it out with my hand, it was straight, long and very shiny. I&#x27;m going to wear it this weekend!!</li>
            <li> I thought I order dark brown and it&#x27;s more copper than anything.</li>
