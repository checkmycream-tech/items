            <li>incredible soft clean aroma</li>
            <li>The shipment arrived very very quickly and was well packaged.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked Coty Musk since the first time I tried it in a department store some 15 or so years ago.</li>
            <li>and it was just fine.</li>
            <li>No longer available in stores.  </li>
            <li>Liked the older version.  </li>
            <li>I also reccomend Thallium black along with this, they are both great colognes with very distinct scents!</li>
            <li>The smell is good but it doesn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
            <li>Smell fades quickly.</li>
            <li>, I had so many good complement on this lotion and people don&#x27;t believe when I mention the price, less than $12!</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery and just what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just going to go back to using New Musk for men, which smells great.</li>
            <li>ever since Old English stop selling theirs, now that was a great musk cologne.</li>
            <li>Perfect distance, people can&#x27;t smell you from 5 feet away, but if they are close enough they can, and decent lasting.</li>
            <li>Priced right.  </li>
            <li>We buy this regularly also on Amazon because of the great low price!</li>
            <li>hard to find, my fav.... at a great price.</li>
            <li>i only love this brand of musk cologne</li>
            <li>I recommend this cologne to anyone who wants to have a fresh scent with them ALL day.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t worn colognes because of office politics for many decades and getting back into it.  </li>
            <li>Ordering it on line was better than going out and hunting for it at different stores.</li>
            <li>only cologne i have used for 20 years, just love it</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it&#x27;s not overpowering (based on proper application) meaning that you don&#x27;t smell it 15 feet before</li>
            <li>the only problem I have with it is the cost is more than I prefer to pay.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!!</li>
            <li>I saw that this musk got pretty decent reviews</li>
            <li>Hard to find now and glad you had it available.  </li>
            <li>Not always available locally.</li>
            <li>is all you need so it&#x27;ll go much longer.</li>
            <li>Real deal.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Had original Coty Musk several years ago</li>
            <li>Overall, definitely worth the price they ask for, so 5 stars!</li>
            <li>He has tried a couple of other brands of musk but they do not smell the same - either too strong or the scent wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this highly</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It just has a sexy scent, but I usually like all scents of Musk.  </li>
            <li>Price is right and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>My husband has used this for years, lightly scented and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Can hardly smell it, but the chick love it...</li>
            <li>Oddly enough this fragrance first came out in a very fancy bottle and packaging long, long ago.  </li>
            <li>No other would suit him</li>
            <li>Very hard to find in stores any more.</li>
            <li>Everything from Amazons end was great, but the product seemed watered down, the fragrance was weak and didn&#x27;t last long.</li>

            <li> so it&#x27;s not realistic to review the actual product.  </li>
            <li> product was also bigger amount than expected</li>
            <li> - this product has been around for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> Not having the bigger one is the only complaint.</li>
            <li> Usually the only place I can buy this is to go into Walmart.</li>
            <li> I keep this with my other cologne&#x27;s, at the ready.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This one is smaller than the bottle I usually get</li>
            <li> A waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Obviously colognes/sprays mix with the individual&#x27;s body chemistry and creates a unique smell, unfortunately this one smells terrible on me.</li>
            <li> I wanted a different variation on the musk scent so after reading reviews and the description on this one I decided to blind buy it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find at times and if Wal Mart stops caring it</li>
            <li> This is crap - and the company that manufactures this and pawns it off as the real deal should be disallowed to sell products on Amazon.</li>
            <li> For a while it was very difficult to find but thankfully it&#x27;s emerged back on the scene.</li>

            <li> best musk for the price and aroma in the marketplace........ product has been around for many years and just gets better with age.........</li>
            <li> One of my husbands favorites. Been using it for 31 years. Cant find in the stores around here. very satisfied</li>
            <li> i only love this brand of musk cologne</li>
            <li> hard to find, my fav.... at a great price.</li>
            <li> Out of all the designer and expensive colognes, this is one on that has produced the most compliments.</li>
            <li> I recommend this cologne to anyone who wants to have a fresh scent with them ALL day. I have had several women stop me and ask what I was wearing. WOW!!!! I will continue to use it. So should you.</li>
            <li> Received promptly! Will order again.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery and just what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this on my man, its sexy and makes him smell good. All men would like the smell as well</li>
            <li> product arrived on time-despite the weather conditions.  product was also bigger amount than expected</li>
            <li> A waste of time and money. No fragrance within five minutes of putting this on. Had original Coty Musk several years ago and it was just fine. This is crap - and the company that manufactures this and pawns it off as the real deal should be disallowed to sell products on Amazon. An embarrassment.</li>
            <li> Everything from Amazons end was great, but the product seemed watered down, the fragrance was weak and didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough this fragrance first came out in a very fancy bottle and packaging long, long ago.  Then Coty bought them and I have always like it.  Haven&#x27;t worn colognes because of office politics for many decades and getting back into it.  Has changed.  Liked the older version.  Sampled all price ranges and for me you don&#x27;t necessarily need to spend lots of money.  Great value.</li>
            <li> My husband has used this for years, lightly scented and long lasting. Very hard to find in stores any more.</li>
            <li> Usually the only place I can buy this is to go into Walmart. It is nice to receive it at my door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> My wife loves the smell of this cologne and I have gotton a lot of compliments from women at work.</li>
            <li> incredible soft clean aroma, I had so many good complement on this lotion and people don&#x27;t believe when I mention the price, less than $12!</li>
            <li> I happen to love this fragrance, but as the title says, you either like a fragrance or you don&#x27;t so it&#x27;s not realistic to review the actual product.  I will say that I received exactly what I ordered, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Have been using this since the seventies great fragrance not overpowering fresh and clean smell I would recommend this highly</li>
            <li> My husbands favorite cologne of all the musk cologne out there ever since Old English stop selling theirs, now that was a great musk cologne. I wish they would return it. But this is a very good second, you have to use a bit more but the fragrance is nice and it smells very good on him. It&#x27;s hard to find at times and if Wal Mart stops caring it I&#x27;ll have to kept buying on line. This vendors price was better than Wal Mart can you believe that.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the smell of this on me, need I say more. I keep this with my other cologne&#x27;s, at the ready.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue purchasing this in the future.</li>
            <li> It arrived in good time and good shape. Of the cologne I ordered, I and my wife like this the best. It was a good value for the price. Ordering it on line was better than going out and hunting for it at different stores.</li>
            <li> Very light fragrance. Can hardly smell it, but the chick love it...</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne my husband wears.  It is not overly strong and has a very nice scent.  He has tried a couple of other brands of musk but they do not smell the same - either too strong or the scent wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> Smell fades quickly. I do like the scent - this product has been around for a LONG time.</li>
            <li> only cologne i have used for 20 years, just love it</li>
            <li> I like this because it is not too strong &amp; overwhelming.  It just has a sexy scent, but I usually like all scents of Musk.  We buy this regularly also on Amazon because of the great low price!</li>
            <li> I wanted a different variation on the musk scent so after reading reviews and the description on this one I decided to blind buy it. Basically all I need to say is this; I was out one night recently and a female friend of mine told me that I smell like baby powder. I can&#x27;t disagree with her, as that it a very good description of what this could smell like on you. Obviously colognes/sprays mix with the individual&#x27;s body chemistry and creates a unique smell, unfortunately this one smells terrible on me. I&#x27;m just going to go back to using New Musk for men, which smells great. Try this if you want, but don&#x27;t say you weren&#x27;t warned.</li>
            <li> Good price and nice fragrance. Not always available locally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked Coty Musk since the first time I tried it in a department store some 15 or so years ago. This one is smaller than the bottle I usually get but it&#x27;s also a spray and one shot of mist is all you need so it&#x27;ll go much longer. I love the smell and it&#x27;s not overpowering (based on proper application) meaning that you don&#x27;t smell it 15 feet before and after you pass the person wearing it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect, exactly what I wanted. Was delivered promptly!</li>
            <li> Dad loves it every year. The used to have a bigger bottle to splash on.  Now only make the smaller spray. Not having the bigger one is the only complaint.</li>
            <li> I saw that this musk got pretty decent reviews but I&#x27;m giving this musk a 1 star. The smell is good but it doesn&#x27;t last at all. One hour the fragrance was practically gone.</li>
            <li> I have been using Coty Musk for years.  the only problem I have with it is the cost is more than I prefer to pay.</li>
            <li> No longer available in stores.  One of my favorites.  Glad I found it.  Priced right.  I think I&#x27;ll stock up.</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne, and my favorite for him to wear! It is getting harder to find in stores, so I was happy to find it on Amazon at a great price.</li>
            <li> Just ordered this cologne off amazon, didn&#x27;t know what to expect. Great scent, very musky, without being over bearing. Perfect distance, people can&#x27;t smell you from 5 feet away, but if they are close enough they can, and decent lasting. Overall, definitely worth the price they ask for, so 5 stars! I also reccomend Thallium black along with this, they are both great colognes with very distinct scents!</li>
            <li> Have been looking for this for a while.  Is isn&#x27;t sold in stores that I can find.  My hubby&#x27;s signature scent .  Perfect in all aspects.</li>
            <li> The shipment arrived very very quickly and was well packaged.  My brother loves the product and we would use this vendor again in the future.</li>
            <li> I love musk and my husband smells great every time he wears it. Price is right and it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Real deal. Very happy</li>
            <li> Thank goodness they didn&#x27;t discontinue Coty Musk Cologne Spray! For a while it was very difficult to find but thankfully it&#x27;s emerged back on the scene. My husband uses nothing else and I prefer this scent above anything else he&#x27;s used. When you think about it, the scent you wear is also for your signifigant other!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scent is the king of all musk scents. Nothing else even comes close!</li>
            <li> Great to be able to find this for my husband.  Hard to find now and glad you had it available.  He has been wearing this cologne since we started dating over 35 years ago.  No other would suit him</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing this cologne for over thirty years.  It is his signature fragrance! I wouldn&#x27;t know him without it!!!</li>
