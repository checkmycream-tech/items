    <ol>
            <li>Awesome sunscreen.</li>
            <li>this is great  </li>
            <li>On good skin days, I pat it on over prescription acne medication.</li>
            <li>This product is good to mix with liquid foundation to overcome the whiteness of it all.  </li>
            <li>On a side note, this sunscreen does have a drying agent, which makes it good for oily skin.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wipe your eyebrows after you put this on!</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and need a powerful sun block  </li>
            <li>This product is truly amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is very light</li>
            <li>When I want more coverage I top it with powder mineral foundation or mix it with liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>I love this sunscreen, just bought more</li>
            <li>Simply the best sunscreen we&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love how it just absorbs into the skin immediately - almost like it&#x27;s not there.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling nicely matted and smooth.</li>
            <li>You might be better off getting a foundation that has sunscreen, because this one does show up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light weight, feels great but really protects your skin.</li>
            <li>and I strongly believe it will help me a lot.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to go in my eyes and burn them, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>texture is light and my face doesn&#x27;t get greasy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The texture is a bit watery but it goes on quite smooth</li>
            <li>Original orders had a smooth tInted solution.  </li>
            <li>Light, not oily and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>No bad smell</li>
            <li>I have tried every possible sunscreen with only zinc and TD and this has been the best.</li>
            <li>(i&#x27;m lucky to work with teens who have no filter).</li>
            <li>I love all Skinceuticals products, and use them frequently.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and feels very sheer</li>
            <li>There are definitely more sheer sunscreens than this one.</li>
            <li>Maybe you should test it at an office before purchasing for your first time.</li>
            <li>I purchased the sunscreen from a dermatologist at a too-high price and then bought the large size from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I called Skinceuticals to ask about this, and they told me they don&#x27;t even sell the large bottle I bought through Amazon.</li>
            <li>This product goes on sheer, dries quickly is not oily and feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li>Plus, it really works against the sun.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>But it really does the job</li>
            <li>It absorbs really well.</li>
            <li>is too much to pay to find out the description is inaccurate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not dark at all but got many comments about how especially white I looked that day</li>
            <li>Once dry makeup goes on easily with no clumping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;they are worth it, especially if you are&lt;br /&gt;one who takes care of their skin.</li>
            <li>However, from now on, I will purchase directly from them.</li>
            <li>, I did not notice that it broke out my sensitive acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not cheap, but I&#x27;ve found it to be very worth the money.</li>
            <li>The recent product is chalky and pure white.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s irritating my sensitive skin, and causing more rosacea.</li>
            <li>I have always love this product, a little expensive but worth it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased the sunscreen from a dermatologist at a too-high price and then bought the large size from Amazon. The product delivers maximum sunscreen protection--a necessity in Southern California--with a bit of color. On good skin days, I pat it on over prescription acne medication. When I want more coverage I top it with powder mineral foundation or mix it with liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> I love this sunscreen, just bought more yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is light and my face doesn&#x27;t get greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> This product is good to mix with liquid foundation to overcome the whiteness of it all.  The texture is a bit watery but it goes on quite smooth</li>
            <li> I get compliments on a weekly basis when I wear this sunscreen.  If you&#x27;re trying to go for the porcelain look, this product is for you.  I always get asked if I&#x27;m wearing foundation or BB cream because this product puts a veil on your face and smooths out all your imperfections.  I am a guy and I don&#x27;t wear makeup.  This product is truly amazing.  On a side note, this sunscreen does have a drying agent, which makes it good for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Was looking for something that did not have the slimy residue feeling, this is it, it virtually disapears soon after</li>
            <li> Simply the best sunscreen we&#x27;ve ever used.  I can&#x27;t recommend it enough.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to go in my eyes and burn them, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> We opened the package and noticed that the product was not sealed; it had previously been opened.</li>
            <li> Been using for years...protects, adds some color and no chemicals!</li>
            <li> Skinceutical products are the best!&lt;br /&gt;Although quite expensive, I think that&lt;br /&gt;they are worth it, especially if you are&lt;br /&gt;one who takes care of their skin.</li>
            <li> This product was a indication of my dermatologist, it will be my 1st time using this product, I saw some interview and I strongly believe it will help me a lot.</li>
            <li> Although I purchased this in March, I&#x27;ve just begun using it. When applying it, there is a &amp;#34;sandy&amp;#34; abrasive feel to the cream, even after shaking it well. I called Skinceuticals to ask about this, and they told me they don&#x27;t even sell the large bottle I bought through Amazon. This makes me quite suspicious. I would like to return the product although I understand it&#x27;s been awhile. It&#x27;s irritating my sensitive skin, and causing more rosacea. I love all Skinceuticals products, and use them frequently. However, from now on, I will purchase directly from them.</li>
            <li> I have always love this product, a little expensive but worth it. It is almost invisible under the makeup, I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Awesome sunscreen. It&#x27;s so light weight, feels great but really protects your skin. I wear it everyday on my face before putting on makeup.</li>
            <li> It seems to do the job.  Light, not oily and absorbs quickly.  Can use make-up over this with ease.  Looks like you have nothing on.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  A little goes a long way on my face and neck area. It is very light and you do not feel that you are wearing anything. I sometimes use it as is or with BB cream for added protection.</li>
            <li> I have tried every possible sunscreen with only zinc and TD and this has been the best. No bad smell and I do not mind using it.....I usually feel gross after I put sunscreen on but not with this.  It goes on nice and feels very sheer, I did not notice that it broke out my sensitive acne prone skin.  I hope this never goes away!!</li>
            <li> This product goes on sheer, dries quickly is not oily and feels great on your skin. Once dry makeup goes on easily with no clumping.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this stuff. My friend recommended it and I have been using it now for almost a year. Unlike every other SPF I have used over the years, it never causes my skin to break out or get irritated. Plus, it really works against the sun. It can be a tad drying, so if you have dry skin you may need to use it with a moisturizer. I love how it just absorbs into the skin immediately - almost like it&#x27;s not there. Though I know it is because I don&#x27;t get burned! It&#x27;s not cheap, but I&#x27;ve found it to be very worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and this is the only sunscreen I&#x27;ve used that is actually non greasy, and have tried almost everything. Rubs in completely dry.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin and need a powerful sun block  this is great  although a tiny bit white/opaque on my face.  But it really does the job</li>
            <li> The product absorbs immediately and leave absolutely NO residue.  Product covers evenly and thoroughly.  It takes a literal dime amount to cover my entire face.  A little bit goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this sunscreen for over a month now. I like it. It doesn&#x27;t make my face shiny. It absorbs really well. It leaves my face feeling nicely matted and smooth. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it makes your eyebrows looking whitish. Be sure to wipe your eyebrows after you put this on!</li>
            <li> I was terribly disappointed becausethe item was cchanged from my previous purchases.  Original orders had a smooth tInted solution.  The recent product is chalky and pure white.  Unfortunately I tossed the box away and could not return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Never burns my eyes. The only lotion I can use for sports.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t as bad as other physical sunscreens but it definitely isn&#x27;t sheer enough to use on skin darker than the white fluid. I&#x27;m not dark at all but got many comments about how especially white I looked that day (i&#x27;m lucky to work with teens who have no filter). There are definitely more sheer sunscreens than this one. You might be better off getting a foundation that has sunscreen, because this one does show up. This brand also makes a tinted sunscreen that works well for me. I&#x27;ve never worn it under makeup, though, so I can&#x27;t advise about how well it blends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest problem with this purchase is the return policy. The company I was directed to return it to (G.S.N.) emailed me and said they&#x27;d refund &amp;#34;less than 20% of the purchase price&amp;#34; if it had been opened. Well, I couldn&#x27;t have found out how opaquely white this product would make my skin look if I hadn&#x27;t opened it. I feel like $40+ and return shipping is too much to pay to find out the description is inaccurate. I know a cosmetic medical office that sells Skinceuticals products in the smaller versions and has testers. Maybe you should test it at an office before purchasing for your first time.</li>
