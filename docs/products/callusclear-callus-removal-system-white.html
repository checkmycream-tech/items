    <ol>
            <li>LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the quality and the value of this product.  </li>
            <li>It works great!  </li>
            <li>This thing beats all of those and does the job wonderfully!  </li>
            <li>I use it once a week to maintain now but keeping my feet looking and feeling great is effortless with this.  </li>
            <li>Also great that it plugs in so you do not burn through batteries.  </li>
            <li>I got this and OMG AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i tried this product, knowing that is sold by amazon (so there must be a good reason)</li>
            <li>and oh my god it works so good.</li>
            <li>and she said the &amp;iacute;tem was good</li>
            <li>and she said the &amp;iacute;tem was good</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase</li>
            <li>and like my feet to look nice.</li>
            <li>Product is just ok not as good as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Everything sounded too good to be true.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for this kind of callus remover which power was by plug in and not batteries, this is it, not too strong</li>
            <li>/&gt;It can shave off callus skin, but you need to be patient, polish many times.</li>
            <li>it is on my toes, under the nail and top of them, the sides and the bottom of my foot, and heal.</li>
            <li>It seemed more I used the manual type files</li>
            <li>and my feet have NEVER looked or felt  better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I had better luck with a cheaper battery operated callous remover.  </li>
            <li>this is so nice to have , and everything it said it can do , is right on the money</li>
            <li>/&gt;I found a fine file type cheese grater worked wonders.</li>
            <li>Cheap quality</li>
            <li>Fantastic</li>
            <li>I thought this would be more powerful since it is electric.</li>
            <li>This worked great, but it didn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, the first day I used it my feet looked and felt better.  </li>
            <li>Felt better and looked better then when I had paid to get a professional pedicure.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m back to looking for a good callous remover.  </li>
            <li>When I asked for that email confirmation having never received it(and since I was trying to correct the original order- return something- NOT purchase more stuff so obviously did not order more)</li>
            <li>I used it two days in a row, and by the second day my feet looked &#x27;normal&#x27; and felt amazing!  </li>
            <li>my feet really look smooth now.</li>
            <li>you amazon for such an amazing product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s noisy but just as powerful as this one and files the callouses quicker and deeper.)</li>
            <li>The price was right so even if it did not work I was not out a lot.  </li>
            <li>Awesome, it is not too hard, not too soft, it is just right.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe for light soft calluses, but not for me.  </li>
            <li>It is so gentle and leaves your feet very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>On the positive, the shipping came extremely fast.</li>
            <li>it really works and the plates can even be replaced so you can share with your family members.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d tried all sorts of lotions and moisturizing socks and foot files and nothing really worked.  </li>
            <li>and it really works:  </li>
            <li>It takes forever to see any difference and the callouses on the side of the foot/heel really won&#x27;t come off well at all.  </li>
            <li>If you put too much pressure it stops spinning.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>will be returning the ENTIRE original order and mailing it back \\&quot;Return to Sender\\&quot; for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>This simply does not file the callous adequately.</li>
            <li>I looked around on Amazon and this gadget seemed highly rated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>then it won&#x27;t fix them on first use, but will eventually after multiple uses.  </li>
            <li>but it works fast and your feet are smooth in very little time.  </li>
            <li>Also noticed Callous Clear charged an additional $38.97 (which was actually less than my original order) to my account.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Callous Clear online and accidently typed \\&quot;Yes\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;No</li>
            <li>It still took at least 5 more minutes of work with the microplane to finish.  </li>
            <li>Just wow</li>
            <li>The company representative told me that so long as I do NOT open the package and have it returned to the warehouse they will process a full refund.  </li>
            <li>but it has the necesary power to remove in no time your hard skin , and it&#x27;s also safe enough for unexperienced hands.</li>
            <li>I think the hard scrubbing on your feet actually makes more callused skin</li>
            <li>Barely a month after I received it, it stopped working.  </li>
            <li>Now, it is not a quick fix miracle, if your feet are as bad as mine it will take 2 or 3 days to be PERFECT.  </li>
            <li>The motor is not very powerful, so you can&#x27;t exert too much pressure or it will stop spinning.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The product is not strong enough as well, the power inlet broke the very first day i received it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It would take me at least 15 minutes of vigorous work to clean up one foot.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After at least 20 minutes of work on one foot I went and got the microplane and was surprised at how much faster it was than this thing.  </li>

            <li> Better than the conventional file, but still very slow.  </li>
            <li> There are other brands but much more expensive.</li>
            <li> I called the company, AGAIN, only to have them tell me that I purchased it the same day as my other online order.  </li>
            <li> the item arrived properly packaged but, after opening it looked as if it had been used previously as there was a white dust in the business end of the unit  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a metal disk on the bottom with a rough surface.  </li>
            <li> I have spent a fortune on creams, scrubs and manual files and rasps.</li>
            <li> Not much results after 30 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am not sure what the competition has to offer with regards to above.</li>
            <li> I only wish it were easier to use on small areas like parts of my toes that have calluses.  </li>
            <li> I use mine about once every other week</li>
            <li> or so when I notice my feet getting a little rough</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s at least as slow as a regular file, but your arm doesn&#x27;t get quite as tired (although my legs didn&#x27;t enjoy being twisted around for a long period of time while this thing whirred</li>
            <li> This device works for a few runs, then the blades get dull and the replacements are super expensive.</li>
            <li> i was really starting to think no one cares about calluses or takes it serious</li>
            <li> It just bogged down and did not cut callus at all.  </li>
            <li> It works, but it is a little tricky.</li>
            <li> it is an electric powered little machine that shaves away the unwanted skin on your foot.</li>
            <li> If you could put a little pressure on the blade, it might  work, but it just stops.  </li>
            <li> This item does not do any heavy duty work, it also takes time to work it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thought it was a waste of money, and will not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I 100% recommend this to anyone who has problems with dried, cracked, or callused feet.  </li>
            <li> i definitely recommend this product for anyone who is tired of using callus products that did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> I wear sandals almost all year round</li>
            <li> Slow motor speed - I expected something faster and stronger.</li>
            <li> I tried a conventional file, it was way too slow and tiring.  </li>
            <li> When I saw this I was not sure about it, but figured it could not hurt anything.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, cracked skin on my heels.  </li>
            <li> It was not a good purchase for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate wearing flip flops and high heels which is awful since i live in Texas</li>
            <li> It looks a little scary and sounds weird when you use it (put it against your foot)</li>
            <li> the worse the callus seemed to get.</li>
            <li> I have ordered plenty of stuff online and NEVER experienced this before-</li>
            <li> Other than that, just disappointed and here&#x27;s why...</li>
            <li> Dry, cracked, callused, ugly feet!  </li>
            <li> Amazon reviewers failed me.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointing item.  </li>
            <li> WRONG!  </li>
            <li> I danced for 14 years and so have really bad callouses on my heels and balls of my feet.  </li>
            <li> Stupid me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying.  </li>
            <li> I am 27 and have AWFUL feet.  </li>
            <li> i want to start off saying i have the worst callus problems ever on my foot.</li>
            <li> WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE and PROCESSING department ever!</li>

            <li> I am 27 and have AWFUL feet.  Dry, cracked, callused, ugly feet!  I hate wearing flip flops and high heels which is awful since i live in Texas and it is always flip flop season here.  I have tried every cream on the market.  I tried the ped egg, which it did work but actually ended up hurting my arms before I could get anywhere with my feet.  When I saw this I was not sure about it, but figured it could not hurt anything.  The price was right so even if it did not work I was not out a lot.  I got this and OMG AMAZING!  Now, it is not a quick fix miracle, if your feet are as bad as mine it will take 2 or 3 days to be PERFECT.  HOWEVER, the first day I used it my feet looked and felt better.  My husband even commented when we were in bed asking if i had socks on because my feet were not jabbing him.  I used it two days in a row, and by the second day my feet looked &#x27;normal&#x27; and felt amazing!  Felt better and looked better then when I had paid to get a professional pedicure.  I 100% recommend this to anyone who has problems with dried, cracked, or callused feet.  I use it once a week to maintain now but keeping my feet looking and feeling great is effortless with this.  I just sit on the couch and let the &#x27;machine&#x27; do the work.  LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!! Also great that it plugs in so you do not burn through batteries.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the quality and the value of this product.  It works great!  I only wish it were easier to use on small areas like parts of my toes that have calluses.  It works, but it is a little tricky.</li>
            <li> I have thick, cracked skin on my heels.  Runs in the family.  It&#x27;s annoying.  I tried a conventional file, it was way too slow and tiring.  I tried a [[ASIN:B002BWQ68U Microplane Foot File]].  Better than the conventional file, but still very slow.  It would take me at least 15 minutes of vigorous work to clean up one foot.  \\&quot;What I need is power tools\\&quot; I thought.  I looked around on Amazon and this gadget seemed highly rated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is basically a motorized, circular file.  There&#x27;s a metal disk on the bottom with a rough surface.  Turn it on and it spins around.  The motor is not very powerful, so you can&#x27;t exert too much pressure or it will stop spinning.  So it&#x27;s at least as slow as a regular file, but your arm doesn&#x27;t get quite as tired (although my legs didn&#x27;t enjoy being twisted around for a long period of time while this thing whirred away).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After at least 20 minutes of work on one foot I went and got the microplane and was surprised at how much faster it was than this thing.  It still took at least 5 more minutes of work with the microplane to finish.  And that was just one foot, I gave up on working on the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this in the cupboard and haven&#x27;t touched it since.</li>
            <li> i want to start off saying i have the worst callus problems ever on my foot. it is on my toes, under the nail and top of them, the sides and the bottom of my foot, and heal. I tried EVERYTHING there is to try basically in the market. i was really starting to think no one cares about calluses or takes it serious&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i tried this product, knowing that is sold by amazon (so there must be a good reason) and oh my god it works so good. it is an electric powered little machine that shaves away the unwanted skin on your foot. it really works and the plates can even be replaced so you can share with your family members. my feet really look smooth now. i definitely recommend this product for anyone who is tired of using callus products that did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you amazon for such an amazing product.</li>

            <li> I wear sandals almost all year round and like my feet to look nice. I have spent a fortune on creams, scrubs and manual files and rasps. It seemed more I used the manual type files the worse the callus seemed to get. I think the hard scrubbing on your feet actually makes more callused skin This product seem to have the opposite affect. It is so gentle and leaves your feet very soft and smooth. I use it every couple of days for just a minute or so on each foot and my feet have NEVER looked or felt  better.</li>
            <li> this is so nice to have , and everything it said it can do , is right on the money</li>

It looks a little scary and sounds weird when you use it (put it against your foot) but it works fast and your feet are smooth in very little time.  If you have cracked heels (I do) then it won&#x27;t fix them on first use, but will eventually after multiple uses.  I use mine about once every other week or so when I notice my feet getting a little rough and I love it.</li>
            <li> On the positive, the shipping came extremely fast. Other than that, just disappointed and here&#x27;s why...&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap quality - I accidentally broke the plastic fan and container while cleaning. Just wow because I just got it...&lt;br /&gt;- Slow motor speed - I expected something faster and stronger. Not much results after 30 mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time Amazon reviewers failed me. Everything sounded too good to be true. Stupid me.</li>
            <li> Maybe for light soft calluses, but not for me.  It just bogged down and did not cut callus at all.  If you could put a little pressure on the blade, it might  work, but it just stops.  It was not a good purchase for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found a fine file type cheese grater worked wonders. Fantastic and it really works:  Microplane 40020 Grater/Zester. [[ASIN:B00004S7V8 Microplane 40020 Grater/Zester]]</li>
            <li> this caused pain when applied to callus on my foot</li>
            <li> This was a disappointing item.  I had better luck with a cheaper battery operated callous remover.  This simply does not file the callous adequately. It takes forever to see any difference and the callouses on the side of the foot/heel really won&#x27;t come off well at all.  I&#x27;ll try to find another battery operated version. (My last one finally died after years of use. It&#x27;s noisy but just as powerful as this one and files the callouses quicker and deeper.) I thought this would be more powerful since it is electric.</li>
            <li> This worked great, but it didn&#x27;t last.  Barely a month after I received it, it stopped working.  I tossed it out &amp; I&#x27;m back to looking for a good callous remover.  Ugh!!</li>
            <li> I ordered Callous Clear online and accidently typed \\&quot;Yes\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;No Thanks\\&quot; on a pop-up window at time of purchase.  Didn&#x27;t think anything of it because everyone has a review cart option before you actually purchase something.  WRONG!  I called the company 15 minutes after purchase (once I received an email confirmation) to correct the online order and a representative told me that the order had not posted and I would have to call back in 24-48 hours.  I called back in that time frame only to be told the items have left the warehouse.  Also noticed Callous Clear charged an additional $38.97 (which was actually less than my original order) to my account.  I called the company, AGAIN, only to have them tell me that I purchased it the same day as my other online order.  When I asked for that email confirmation having never received it(and since I was trying to correct the original order- return something- NOT purchase more stuff so obviously did not order more) they told me that they did not know why one was not sent nor would they tell me the email address associated with that \\&quot;ghost\\&quot; order.  I ended up having to call my bank and file a claim.  Bottom line:  will be returning the ENTIRE original order and mailing it back \\&quot;Return to Sender\\&quot; for a full refund.  The company representative told me that so long as I do NOT open the package and have it returned to the warehouse they will process a full refund.  After that it&#x27;s on to the claims department at the bank to dispute that second charge.  I have ordered plenty of stuff online and NEVER experienced this before- WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE and PROCESSING department ever!</li>
            <li> This device works for a few runs, then the blades get dull and the replacements are super expensive. Just got a Emjoi Micro-Pedi and it puts this think to shame.</li>
            <li> Product is just ok not as good as I would like it to be.It just didn.t meet my needs at this time</li>
            <li> it was a give for my mother and she said the &amp;iacute;tem was good&lt;br /&gt; it was a give for my mother and she said the &amp;iacute;tem was good</li>
            <li> I think this is just a gadget to get people to buy it. Does not remove the callus as described. If you put too much pressure it stops spinning.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t spend your money on this on.</li>
