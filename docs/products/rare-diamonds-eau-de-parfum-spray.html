            <li>Item was packed well and was exactly what I had ordered at a great price.</li>
            <li>it has the lightness yet the absolute capture me of a sweet yet flowery, and one that someone might come up and just want to close their eyes and say,&#x27;&#x27; what is that wonderful fragrance?&#x27;</li>

            <li>Rare Diamonds is one of my favorite scents.  </li>
            <li>Smells a tad cheap.</li>
            <li>Expected it to be as good or better than rare pearl</li>
            <li>Absolutely lovely fragrance and don&#x27;t really know how to explain the smell except to say it smells like sparkling diamonds or champagne.</li>
            <li>Anything more is overwhelming and the cheapness is made very obvious.</li>
            <li>I ordered this perfume years ago thru Avon at a higher price &amp; have been wearing it as my primary perfume every since.</li>
            <li>You smile and say like me RARE DIAMONDS AND WALK AWAY.&lt;br /&gt;/</li>
            <li>, the fragrance doesn&#x27;t linger on like rare pearl.</li>
            <li>I like avon spray series very much.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what she wanted and she couldn&#x27;t believe that I had found it.</li>

            <li>Once I was in elevator, a folk walked in, &amp;#34; you smells very good&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>Thanks again, Amazon.</li>
            <li>Very feminine.</li>
            <li>My other favorite is Haiku.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells good in small or tiny amounts.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to know I could order it thru Amazon when I ran out &amp; for a mere $10 plus free shipping!</li>
            <li>My mom has been using this bottle for nearly 2 years and the Avon label and all the info on the bottle had rubbed off, so after looking up some of the details of the bottle I was brought to this.</li>
            <li>but it fell far below my expectations</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t last super long though...</li>
