            <li>The shipping was great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best ever a must buy</li>

            <li>Great price and beautiful product.  </li>
            <li>but still a great buy.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m so happy with this product.</li>
            <li>The formula is great</li>
            <li>texture is great</li>
            <li>the lipstick has a great pigment and it doesnt rub off with ease.</li>
            <li>Great nude matte color</li>
            <li>The color needs to have a pinker tone to it, unless people want their lips to look like their fair skin color.</li>
            <li>This is good for two things; length of wear and controlling shine.</li>
            <li>Simply perfect, very fast delivery</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with the product!</li>
            <li>Pure Hollywood works perfect.</li>
            <li>The color is amazing.</li>
            <li>love the color and it feel good on skin.</li>
            <li>By applying a tinted gloss on top of  this does help.</li>
            <li>Love the customer service</li>
            <li>I love that it goes on liquid but dries in matte texture</li>
            <li>LOVE this lipstick.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to buy more colors.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it ❤</li>
            <li>Such a beautiful color!</li>
            <li>but i love it sure</li>
            <li>will order more</li>
            <li>Make sure to moisturize before applying.</li>
            <li>love the color, and product</li>
            <li>Great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li>I will get it again and try more colors.</li>
            <li>, i absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>beautiful color, not as nude as i originally thought, more of a classic pink-y nude</li>
            <li>but the color was way too light-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve exfoliated my lips lightly about an hour before use</li>
            <li>WAY too light of a color.</li>
            <li>have a caramel skin complexion and in order to use this product I had to line my lips with either a light brown or darker nude color</li>
            <li>the product is fantastic</li>
            <li>It is very matte and very skin color like for fair skinned ladies like myself.</li>
            <li>Super creamy and smooth.</li>
            <li>It arrived so fast, i love liquid lipsticks, pure Hollywood is definitely better paired with a brown lip liner, it washes out my face when applied alone</li>
            <li>Great color especially to mix with a darker nude lip liner really makes the color pop!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this more</li>
            <li>am a NC45 in MAC Cosmetics and a C6,C8 mixture in Loreal True Match if that helps anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny people are willing to pay 3times more than orginal price.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping with prime.</li>
            <li>The application is liquidy, but it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I just believe everyone should be aware of their skin and what will fit them best.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is long lasting and feels great!</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, very classic look</li>
            <li>worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Goes on so nicely and lasts so long!</li>
            <li>The matte dry is amazing</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty.</li>
            <li>what type* of sub-cosmetic you are getting into, especially when moving to more &amp;#34;professionally-recognized&amp;#34; brands.</li>
            <li>Love it a little light</li>
            <li>such a shame because the colors are phenomenal and the staying power really is .</li>
            <li>Pale pink color is perfect for building.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good liquid lipstick, but gives a dry look and is very pale so with my complexion, I like it better on top of a pink lipstick or with lipliner.</li>
            <li>Personally I love the product; I expected a gloss but got a lipstick</li>
            <li>Really runny and shows every crease and wrinkle.</li>
            <li>way too much comes out on the wand</li>
            <li>Honestly, the latter is the only reason I could see for owning this - if you are a model or a photographer.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color, just a little lighter than expected.  </li>
            <li>It goes on wet and dries matte very quickly  </li>
            <li>highly recommend plus</li>
            <li>Is that normal?</li>
            <li>it came early , I&#x27;m definitely going to order more in the future</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s right in the middle.</li>
            <li>I can not tell you the number of times I had to powder lips to keep the light refractions down.</li>
            <li>Goes on looking very chalky and dry.  </li>
            <li>Super sticky and made my lips look wrinkled after a few min.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, just a little bit of the feeling of dryness, but did not dry me out like a lot of the other long wearing lipsticks out there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have natural dark pink lips and have a hard time wearing light colors.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long on the lips either for what it is suppose to be.</li>
            <li> Will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This color is not light pink, but a very neutral tan.  </li>
            <li> Super patchy, and poor quality.</li>
            <li> and I STILL get things mixed up all the time - not to mention the parade of new an improved compounds..</li>
            <li> At first it goes on nicely then it hardens and looks and feels terrible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda dry on my lips.</li>
            <li> Lips feel immediately dry.</li>
            <li> but it does not leave your lips feeling dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it stayed on longer than a half hour before getting the gross line where my lips meet.</li>
            <li> It  makes every line in your lips stand out which ages you about 15 years, and it leaves your lips very dry.  </li>
            <li> I really do not like it.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a darker nude based on the pictures.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I find it to make my lips look dry and crackly within a half an hour of application.  </li>
            <li> It was lighter and less pink.</li>
            <li> Pigments from this company have been average IME - other info based on company experience.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried this on and it ended up being a little darker than expected.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m going to pair it with a dark nude lip liner</li>
            <li> product, at least those that are similar, are *intended</li>
            <li> Saw this in Style magazine as and &amp;#34;Editors Pick&amp;#34; for the &amp;#34;perfect pale pink lipstick&amp;#34; so thought I would try.  </li>
            <li> Color is too pale, like a pale pink chalk on your lips.  </li>
            <li> I am light medium skin and it looked like ghost lips :(  </li>
            <li> Nice colour, horrible product.</li>
            <li> This formula is so chalky, makes me look like the walking dead.</li>
            <li> The color was not accurate and once the lipstick dries, your lips look chapped and flaky.  </li>
            <li> * to go on very thick and very dry</li>
            <li> I am not sure why anybody likes this product.</li>
            <li> not sure what is up with that).</li>
            <li> I thought the shade was nothing like it showed online (which I kind of understand, but still not happy about) and the formula was terrible.</li>
            <li> I would give this a negative review if I could.</li>
            <li> (Please note: I DO NOT own this product, but I do have some experience with liquid-to-matte cremes.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve also applied Vaseline lip gloss about a half hour before applying and it still cracks and dries up like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Dumb!</li>
            <li> not get me wrong</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> All around hate this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed - I am returning it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sticky and nasty.</li>
            <li> This is the WORST lipstick I have ever used.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> The shipping was great! The color is pretty.</li>
            <li> I tried this on and it ended up being a little darker than expected. Once dried it ended up being really sticky?  Is that normal? Personally I love the product; I expected a gloss but got a lipstick</li>
            <li> The color that came on my lips wasn&#x27;t exactly similar to the one in the picture. It was lighter and less pink. Pigment itself went on well. But did not end up keeping it</li>
            <li> It arrived so fast, i love liquid lipsticks, pure Hollywood is definitely better paired with a brown lip liner, it washes out my face when applied alone but still a great buy.</li>
            <li> It is very matte and very skin color like for fair skinned ladies like myself. The color needs to have a pinker tone to it, unless people want their lips to look like their fair skin color. By applying a tinted gloss on top of  this does help. I would not re purchase this color again. I would re purchase this brand in a different color though.</li>
            <li> At first it goes on nicely then it hardens and looks and feels terrible. I really do not like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny people are willing to pay 3times more than orginal price. Dumb!</li>
            <li> Pale pink color is perfect for building. It goes on wet and dries matte very quickly  I like it alot</li>
            <li> Really runny and shows every crease and wrinkle. Nice colour, horrible product.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this more but the color was way too light- I expected it to be a darker nude based on the pictures. I am light medium skin and it looked like ghost lips :(  I do like the formula for a matte longwear lipstick. It is easy to apply, just a little bit of the feeling of dryness, but did not dry me out like a lot of the other long wearing lipsticks out there.&lt;br /&gt;I think you should swatch before you buy though.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe all the folks that love this product, I must be doing something wrong.  I find it to make my lips look dry and crackly within a half an hour of application.  I&#x27;ve exfoliated my lips lightly about an hour before use, I&#x27;ve also applied Vaseline lip gloss about a half hour before applying and it still cracks and dries up like crazy.  such a shame because the colors are phenomenal and the staying power really is .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good liquid lipstick, but gives a dry look and is very pale so with my complexion, I like it better on top of a pink lipstick or with lipliner.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda dry on my lips. Love the customer service</li>
            <li> Not what I expected. It feels like it never drys so your lips constantly stick together. I will not be ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, very classic look</li>
            <li> I love that it goes on liquid but dries in matte texture&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already recommended it multiple times</li>
            <li> This stuff is horrible! It&#x27;s sticky and nasty. Lips feel immediately dry. The color is nonexistent; you can&#x27;t see any color and your lips feel gross. I would give this a negative review if I could.</li>
            <li> LOVE this lipstick. Goes on so nicely and lasts so long! Can&#x27;t wait to buy more colors.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it ❤️❤️❤️&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend plus it came early , I&#x27;m definitely going to order more in the future</li>
            <li> Simply perfect, very fast delivery</li>
            <li> Great price and beautiful product.  Quick shipping with prime. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Great color especially to mix with a darker nude lip liner really makes the color pop!</li>
            <li> Such a beautiful color!</li>

            <li> Saw this in Style magazine as and &amp;#34;Editors Pick&amp;#34; for the &amp;#34;perfect pale pink lipstick&amp;#34; so thought I would try.  It is definitely a matte, no shine or smoothness.  Goes on looking very chalky and dry.  Color is too pale, like a pale pink chalk on your lips.  I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t meet my expectations for an Anastasia product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best ever a must buy I&#x27;m in love with the product!</li>
            <li> Super patchy, and poor quality. It doesn&#x27;t last long on the lips either for what it is suppose to be. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love it a little light but i love it sure will order more</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, just a little lighter than expected.  Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Super creamy and smooth. I have natural dark pink lips and have a hard time wearing light colors. Pure Hollywood works perfect. I think I&#x27;m going to pair it with a dark nude lip liner but I&#x27;m so happy with this product.</li>
            <li> beautiful color, not as nude as i originally thought, more of a classic pink-y nude</li>
            <li> I am not sure why anybody likes this product. I thought the shade was nothing like it showed online (which I kind of understand, but still not happy about) and the formula was terrible. I don&#x27;t think it stayed on longer than a half hour before getting the gross line where my lips meet. All around hate this product.</li>
            <li> I wrote occasionally needs to be applied because eating and drinking throughout the day of course causes some wear. The color is amazing. The application is liquidy, but it dries quickly. Make sure to moisturize before applying.</li>
            <li> love the color, and product</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping</li>
            <li> love the color and it feel good on skin. would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Got this for my girlfriend and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I like the matte look but way too much comes out on the wand and I have to wipe a lot off. I will get it again and try more colors. Will last a long time.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting and feels great!</li>
            <li> Best liquid lipstick out there, i absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Super sticky and made my lips look wrinkled after a few min. even tried it with moisturizer primer, still looked crappy.</li>
            <li> The formula is great but I am just not one of the people that can pull this color off. WAY too light of a color.</li>
            <li> I love this product but I believe it i not for darker skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;I am a NC45 in MAC Cosmetics and a C6,C8 mixture in Loreal True Match if that helps anyone.&lt;br /&gt;I have a caramel skin complexion and in order to use this product I had to line my lips with either a light brown or darker nude color so it would not look weird.&lt;br /&gt;Do not get me wrong the product is fantastic I just believe everyone should be aware of their skin and what will fit them best.&lt;br /&gt;The texture is great the lipstick has a great pigment and it doesnt rub off with ease. The matte dry is amazing but it does not leave your lips feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Great nude matte color</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. worth every penny. Only need to apply once. You literally need to scrub it off.</li>
            <li> This formula is so chalky, makes me look like the walking dead.</li>
            <li> (Please note: I DO NOT own this product, but I do have some experience with liquid-to-matte cremes. I&#x27;m giving a 3 because I have to rate this things and it&#x27;s right in the middle. Pigments from this company have been average IME - other info based on company experience.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product, at least those that are similar, are *intended* to go on very thick and very dry (though not clumpy.. not sure what is up with that). This is good for two things; length of wear and controlling shine. Honestly, the latter is the only reason I could see for owning this - if you are a model or a photographer. I can not tell you the number of times I had to powder lips to keep the light refractions down. This can be hell on those of us who like the eyes to appear.. ya know.. living once the photo in question is processed. Come to think of it, I cannot recommend these types of things if you are a model, either - specialty make-up is the photographer&#x27;s arena and they will let you know what they need from you prep wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, it appears the name has sold the product before the description. Always try to understand *what type* of sub-cosmetic you are getting into, especially when moving to more &amp;#34;professionally-recognized&amp;#34; brands. I&#x27;ve been dabbling in stage/photo-prep and photography for eons and I STILL get things mixed up all the time - not to mention the parade of new an improved compounds.. Hope this helps.</li>
