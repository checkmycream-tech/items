            <li>I have used this product before and am happy to have it delivered to my door.</li>
            <li>this product was great and i will recommend to all people to shop at this store</li>
            <li>Works great on my highlighted hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many purple shampoos, and this is the best.</li>
            <li>Good service!!&lt;br /&gt;I got the produts on time&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied</li>
            <li>and it seems like you have to use a good bit.  </li>
            <li>I right away took it to my stylist to use and was very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I thought it would work better if I had it on longer, nope!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing.</li>
            <li>The violet shampoo evens out the tone of my hair and leaves it feeling absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>and I really liked the effects.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo and the conditioner is just ok.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>the shampoo is great but the conditionar is really so so ..</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok if your hair is not colored or damages ..</li>
            <li>And the Hydrate line, which doesn&#x27;t affect your color at all, was better at cleaning/moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sticking with the Joico unless I can find something better.</li>
            <li>Not as lathering as most shampoos, but that may be because there are no sulfates in this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It provides some level of moisture, but is by no means outstanding.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>it will just make it that much more noticeable.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>And the conditioner makes my hair so soft and smells good!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to report that not only is the shampoo very gentle, but it does the job at getting styling buildup out of hair and leaves it in great condition.</li>
            <li>If you can get the shampoo alone for a lot cheaper please do so and buy a good hydrating conditioner as this can be very drying.</li>
            <li>Love it and worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I have curly hair that tangles easily.</li>
            <li>But when I use this conditioner i can comb through my hair easily with out any entangling products.</li>
            <li>Definitely a product,  I would use for blond to honey highlights,  beautiful results.</li>
            <li>Hands down best purple shampoo out there for all you Blondies!</li>
            <li>The bottoms of my hair are the light blond I want</li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft and they do smell good.</li>
            <li>and it took most of it out on the first shampoo.</li>
            <li>Sure enough,  it did away with with the copper tones, and made my highlights look amazing.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product and it came quicker than expected too.</li>
            <li>the items arrived quickly, and are as described BUT</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon!!)</li>
            <li>This shampoo really tames the brassy streaks and returns the highlighted strands to their original glow.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner which is prt of this set, is o.k.</li>
            <li>I threw it in the trash can right after.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel like my hair was clean and it is really, really purple.  </li>
            <li>I love joico products, generally, but this one has out done itself!</li>
            <li>so I will be riding the Fudge train because I love SUPER DUPER ASH, but just for regular toning of brassiness I think this Joico brand is fab!</li>
            <li>I used to do highlights but have since let it gradually grow out (with some help from the salon to make it look purposeful) and that type of process can look brassy and flat very easily.</li>
            <li>(One more plus of having short hair!)</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll check with the salon first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not been pretty.........</li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to take it back if it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>It is the shampoo that manages to get my positive attention.</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft and the color was sharp and bright.</li>
            <li>Maintaining blond hair can be difficult but this products makes it easy; it also smells really good.</li>
            <li>I color my hair light blonde and was looking for a \\&quot;violet\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner to help tone the brassiness once in awhile.  </li>
            <li>and it absolutely makes it shine</li>
            <li>It really helps neutralize the brassiness.</li>
            <li>My hair looks very platinum after using this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this after a salon used a purple shampoo on my light blonde hair</li>
            <li>If I happen to be out in the sun too much, my highlights get brassy looking.</li>
            <li>you will like thanks</li>
            <li>Received my product at a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t like the quality of the shampoo &amp; conditioner...</li>
            <li>I really like it and will continue to use until I run out</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>The shampoo doesn&#x27;t really lather all that well</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling a little dry and my scalp like it had residue on it...not too impressed with it.</li>
            <li>My highlights have never looked better - cooler, sunkissed - a lot less brassy.  </li>
            <li>My hair pulls a lot of red, even when my stylist is careful to avoid the warm tones.  </li>
            <li>That said, my hair is super short</li>
            <li>I had a picture of myself before I used the shampoo and conditioner and my blonde looked super yellowish.</li>
            <li>Will turn your hair silver if you leave on for more than a few minutes</li>
            <li>, the Joico makes the new growth blend in better and look like I&#x27;m meant to have a little bit of darker root.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize just how great a job it did until I saw photos we took the other night under neon lights, my hair was shiny and vibrant, and didn&#x27;t look fake-blonde in the least.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>It works better than all the other products that I&#x27;ve tried takes all the yellow.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>maybe they just weren&#x27;t a good fit for my hair :(</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t positively affect my blonde hair at all.</li>
            <li>This really does brighten blond hair that tends to turn yellow after build up.</li>
            <li>It really does tone the blonde in your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much easier than trying to find it locally.</li>
            <li>Word of caution: Use exactly as directed, if you leave it in too long it over-tones your hair.</li>
            <li>It takes away dull brassy tones easily.</li>
            <li>i would have never purchased these if i had known they are the new red bottle formula that i did not want!</li>
            <li>This was recommended by a professional stylist to keep the blonde tone in my colored highlights.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is a cosmetologist she recommended that I use joico violet for my natural grey hair.</li>
            <li>but tends to look stark against the other areas, the Joico makes the new growth blend in better and look like I&#x27;m meant to have a little bit of darker root.</li>
            <li>This works really well for toning down brassiness on my highlights.  </li>

            <li> This works really well for toning down brassiness on my highlights.  </li>
            <li> My new growth (about half in inch) is white/</li>
            <li> And if you do leave it on too long, it washes back out</li>
            <li> But instead of making my hair feel light and brighter, I feel like it leaves a residue or something - feeling dull and heavy, and I have to wash it again within a day.</li>
            <li> This works but you have to TIME how long you leave it in, my hair turned blueish grey the 2nd time</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t leave the shampoo in too long ..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent almost 8 months having my hair bleached out little by little, letting my natural white color come in</li>
            <li> I have ash blonde hair and get it highlighted every 3 months on average.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to leave on too long</li>
            <li> The shampoo bottle is so hard to open tha the shampoo splashes when it is jerked open.  </li>
            <li> Nevermind that it stinks like cheap shampoo.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and helps that orangeness color in my hair fade away slowly.</li>
            <li> Also tames the frizzies that were developing using other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I used Aveda blue malva in the past, but it did not work well.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sticking with the Joico unless I can find something better.rown but tends to look stark against the other areas</li>
            <li> They do it for me without me having to subject my hair to another color.</li>
            <li> I think my blond highlights r less orange as they were</li>
            <li> so it gets really messy</li>
            <li> It your hair is uneven colors</li>
            <li> Too messy.</li>
            <li> almost pale brown</li>
            <li> The process has been slow and tedious because I had black dye in my hair, I have very thick and porous hair that wants to go orange.</li>
            <li> but there is very little moisturizing</li>
            <li> Not really sure...</li>
            <li> After spending too much money on highlights for my brown hair &amp; being disappointed every time, I decided to try a purple shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I tend to get red highlights which I hate and</li>
            <li> Just working the conditioner into my hair is a pain, it&#x27;s not as \\&quot;slick\\&quot; as the average conditioner, my hair remains tangled and it is almost impossible to comb after my shower unless I load up on a leave in conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I was so pissed that I spent $10 on that worthless garbage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> they made my hair drier :(</li>
            <li> and I hate that.</li>
            <li> It is truly awful.  </li>
            <li> Just awful stuff.  </li>
            <li> Terrible, it turned the ends of my hair purple.</li>
            <li> WORST MISTAKE EVER.</li>

            <li> i have greying hair and this shampoo/conditioner helps the color shine. Also tames the frizzies that were developing using other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I order this over and over. LOVE.</li>
            <li> I color my hair light blonde and was looking for a \\&quot;violet\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner to help tone the brassiness once in awhile.  The shampoo does was it should, however if you are looking for a conditioner that actually conditions your hair while providing the violet tint, you should look elsewhere.  Just working the conditioner into my hair is a pain, it&#x27;s not as \\&quot;slick\\&quot; as the average conditioner, my hair remains tangled and it is almost impossible to comb after my shower unless I load up on a leave in conditioner.  My solution is to mix some of the Joico Violet Conditioner with another conditioner.  I will likley purchase the shampoo again, but I will not purchase this conditioner again...it just does nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo and the conditioner is just ok. This really does brighten blond hair that tends to turn yellow after build up.</li>
            <li> After spending too much money on highlights for my brown hair &amp; being disappointed every time, I decided to try a purple shampoo.  I used Aveda blue malva in the past, but it did not work well.  My hair pulls a lot of red, even when my stylist is careful to avoid the warm tones.  I used Joico over the weekend...WOW!  My highlights have never looked better - cooler, sunkissed - a lot less brassy.  I&#x27;m amazed...and will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have gray hair and it absolutely makes it shine will order again.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of different shampoos and conditioners since going platinum blonde. My hair lifts very yellow and I hate that. I used to put a lavendar-based glaze on after the bleach but using these Joice products, I don&#x27;t have to. They do it for me without me having to subject my hair to another color. I&#x27;ve heard people say that some lavendar shampoos make your hair feel coarse or straw-like. I have never had this problem with Joico. That said, my hair is super short so I get it cut every 4-5 weeks so it doesn&#x27;t have time to get damaged. (One more plus of having short hair!) Love, love, love this product and it came quicker than expected too.</li>
            <li> Ive used this for about 4 weeks and I love it! It really helps neutralize the brassiness. And the conditioner makes my hair so soft and smells good! I have curly hair that tangles easily. I aleays need a detangler or leave in conditioner to get through my knotts. But when I use this conditioner i can comb through my hair easily with out any entangling products.</li>
            <li> My hair looks very platinum after using this product. I love joico products, generally, but this one has out done itself!</li>
            <li> I had caramel and orange hair from when I highlighted my hair recently and it took most of it out on the first shampoo. Maintaining blond hair can be difficult but this products makes it easy; it also smells really good.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is amazing. It really does tone the blonde in your hair. I had a picture of myself before I used the shampoo and conditioner and my blonde looked super yellowish. Now my blonde actually looks blonde. I&#x27;m so glad I discovered this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> the shampoo is great but the conditionar is really so so .. it&#x27;s ok if your hair is not colored or damages ..but there is very little moisturizing i would buy the shampoo again though .. also to be noted ... don&#x27;t leave the shampoo in too long .. you might get a streak of purple for a lil while</li>
            <li> joico is all i need to say</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a professional stylist to keep the blonde tone in my colored highlights.  It is truly awful.  There are no suds and it is like rubbing junk on your hair.  I didn&#x27;t feel like my hair was clean and it is really, really purple.  Just awful stuff.  Threw it in the garbage.</li>
            <li> I bought this after a salon used a purple shampoo on my light blonde hair and I really liked the effects. But instead of making my hair feel light and brighter, I feel like it leaves a residue or something - feeling dull and heavy, and I have to wash it again within a day. I&#x27;ll keep using it until the bottle runs out, but feel like if I buy a purple shampoo again, I&#x27;ll check with the salon first.</li>
            <li> Hands down best purple shampoo out there for all you Blondies!</li>
            <li> Terrible, it turned the ends of my hair purple. Don&#x27;t buy it. I threw it in the trash can right after.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling a little dry and my scalp like it had residue on it...not too impressed with it.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Makes my hair soft and helps that orangeness color in my hair fade away slowly.</li>
            <li> SOOO purple and totally kept my blonde incredibly blonde.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent almost 8 months having my hair bleached out little by little, letting my natural white color come in so I can go &#x27;platinum blond&#x27;. (Toner corrects it too of course) The process has been slow and tedious because I had black dye in my hair, I have very thick and porous hair that wants to go orange. During this time I&#x27;ve had to learn to deal with the texture change that bleach brings. It&#x27;s not been pretty.........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salesgirl at a local beauty supply sold me Clairol &amp;#34;Shimmer Lights&amp;#34; shampoo. WORST MISTAKE EVER. Nevermind that it stinks like cheap shampoo. Ignore that it made my hair look like I used a hand dryer at the gas station to style it. It didn&#x27;t positively affect my blonde hair at all. I was so pissed that I spent $10 on that worthless garbage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Pureology Hydrate for years, so I decided I&#x27;d be brand-faithful and swallow the pain of their prices. I bought their Platinum Blonde shampoo, conditioner, and spray. I cried at what it cost at Ulta, but took the shampoo and conditioner back after two weeks because it did nothing whatsoever for my hair. And the Hydrate line, which doesn&#x27;t affect your color at all, was better at cleaning/moisturizing. Avoid the Pureology Platinum line if you want something to counteract brassy....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stylist recommended Joico&#x27;s Violet shampoo, so I bought the duo at Ulta. (It&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon!!) I wanted to be able to take it back if it didn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;m happy to report that not only is the shampoo very gentle, but it does the job at getting styling buildup out of hair and leaves it in great condition. I always use the conditioner with it so that may be a factor. But, it also noticeably perks up my hair and gets that &#x27;yellow&#x27; out of it.  I didn&#x27;t realize just how great a job it did until I saw photos we took the other night under neon lights, my hair was shiny and vibrant, and didn&#x27;t look fake-blonde in the least. My new growth (about half in inch) is white/almost pale brown but tends to look stark against the other areas, the Joico makes the new growth blend in better and look like I&#x27;m meant to have a little bit of darker root. Perfect result and I&#x27;m sticking with the Joico unless I can find something better.rown but tends to look stark against the other areas, the Joico makes the new growth blend in better and look like I&#x27;m meant to have a little bit of darker root.

            <li> A coworker told me to try this and I&#x27;m so happy I did. Not as lathering as most shampoos, but that may be because there are no sulfates in this shampoo. My hair was so soft and the color was sharp and bright. Love it and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> The shampoo bottle is so hard to open tha the shampoo splashes when it is jerked open.  The shampoo is purple so it gets really messy</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and am happy to have it delivered to my door. It&#x27;s much easier than trying to find it locally.</li>
            <li> the items arrived quickly, and are as described BUT the shampoo/conditioner makes me itch.</li>
            <li> Use it everytime I shampoo. I tend to get red highlights which I hate and this works great!</li>
            <li> I have ash blonde hair and get it highlighted every 3 months on average. If I happen to be out in the sun too much, my highlights get brassy looking. This shampoo really tames the brassy streaks and returns the highlighted strands to their original glow.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner which is prt of this set, is o.k. It provides some level of moisture, but is by no means outstanding. It is the shampoo that manages to get my positive attention.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo because I like the smell and I use the conditioner a lot. But my sister just told me about one called Fudge that gives you almost violet blonde hair it gets so ashy so I will be riding the Fudge train because I love SUPER DUPER ASH, but just for regular toning of brassiness I think this Joico brand is fab!</li>
            <li> this product was great and i will recommend to all people to shop at this store you will like thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a faithful Joico customer they always have the best in hair care. Word of caution: Use exactly as directed, if you leave it in too long it over-tones your hair.</li>
            <li> Good service!!&lt;br /&gt;I got the produts on time&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied with the purchase&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Have a good day.!!!..</li>
            <li> My daughter is a cosmetologist she recommended that I use joico violet for my natural grey hair. I love it. It works better than all the other products that I&#x27;ve tried takes all the yellow.</li>
            <li> Received my product at a reasonable time. I right away took it to my stylist to use and was very happy with the results.  I had recently dyed my hair and had gotten some highlights,  and with that had some coppery, reddish tones I wanted to get rid of. Sure enough,  it did away with with the copper tones, and made my highlights look amazing.  Definitely a product,  I would use for blond to honey highlights,  beautiful results.</li>
            <li> This works but you have to TIME how long you leave it in, my hair turned blueish grey the 2nd time bc I thought it would work better if I had it on longer, nope! It your hair is uneven colors it will just make it that much more noticeable. The bottoms of my hair are the light blond I want but the roots are still my brassy since I can&#x27;t just put the shampoo on my roots. This is for maintaining even hair not for evening it out if that makes sense. And if you do leave it on too long, it washes back out so it&#x27;s not the end of the world</li>
            <li> It takes away dull brassy tones easily. Be careful not to leave on too long or you&#x27;ll have blue/purple/gray hair. Never buy this for the conditioner. If you can get the shampoo alone for a lot cheaper please do so and buy a good hydrating conditioner as this can be very drying. I use Macademia Oil found here: [[ASIN:B002WTC37A Macadamia Oil Deep Repair ounces]]</li>
            <li> i would have never purchased these if i had known they are the new red bottle formula that i did not want!</li>
            <li> Not really sure... I think my blond highlights r less orange as they were but I really didn&#x27;t like the quality of the shampoo &amp; conditioner... they made my hair drier :( maybe they just weren&#x27;t a good fit for my hair :(</li>
            <li> This works really well for toning down brassiness on my highlights.  I really like it and will continue to use until I run out and it is time for a toner at the salon.</li>
            <li> Works very well. I&#x27;ve tried many purple shampoos, and this is the best. Leaves my hair so soft! Will turn your hair silver if you leave on for more than a few minutes</li>
            <li> Did not like the purple color in the product.  Too messy.</li>
            <li> Works great on my highlighted hair. Smells great too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It does, in fact, come in red bottles. I use it 2-3 times per week to even out my blond hair... I used to do highlights but have since let it gradually grow out (with some help from the salon to make it look purposeful) and that type of process can look brassy and flat very easily. The violet shampoo evens out the tone of my hair and leaves it feeling absolutely amazing. Amazon was the lowest price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesn&#x27;t really lather all that well and it seems like you have to use a good bit.  The conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft and they do smell good.</li>
