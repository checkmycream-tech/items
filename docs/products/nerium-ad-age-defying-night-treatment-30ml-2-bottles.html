            <li>This night cream is the best I have ever used!</li>
            <li>I have not had any great improvement yet!</li>
            <li>Nerium is an awesome one step anti-aging product.  </li>
            <li>So all you people who are complaining about this stuff - welcome to the world of products that WORK!</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36, my skin looks incredible!</li>
            <li>My skin looks awesome!  </li>
            <li>Great!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best skin are product I have ever used...</li>
            <li>Would recommend  works very good, if used every night before bed.  </li>
            <li>totally happy with purchase and promptness of receiving order</li>
            <li>It has lifted my eyelids, crowsfeet are gone and the furrows in my forehead have been greatly reduced all in just 30 days.  </li>
            <li>But the people I know have all had great results.</li>
            <li>Ray Liotta is suing because someone that looks just like him had great results.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and at a great price!</li>
            <li>We are loving it!</li>
            <li>they vary greatly and for good reason.</li>
            <li>Good luck with your &amp;#34;Deals!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Loved.</li>
            <li>There are many competitors in the skin product market that aren&#x27;t happy to see that Nerium has a product that is so amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is safe!</li>
            <li>but it is definitely better than anything I have ever used!</li>
            <li>But... I promise, you&#x27;ll be ordering more!</li>
            <li>Nice glowing skin.</li>
            <li>When you purchase NeriumAD from a Brand Partner, you get the 30 day guarantee, and a fresh product that works very effectively.</li>
            <li>I love the PRODUCT WHEN PURCHASED BY A BP WITH ALL THE SAFEGUARDS.</li>
            <li>love this anti aging cream.  </li>
            <li>They have an \\&quot;F\\&quot; rating with the Better Business Bureau.  </li>
            <li>the  breakouts are almost gone, I&#x27;m sure if I didn&#x27;t eat chocolate and seafood, the two things that trigger my Rosacea</li>
            <li>I would be even better</li>
            <li>The Nerium company uses a patented process to extract the safe portion of the oleander plant so all these folks saying the plant is posion do not understand this.</li>
            <li>Yes, if you eat an oleander leaf that isn&#x27;t safe.  </li>
            <li>but I do suggest you go to a reputable Nerium distributor.</li>
            <li>glad not everyone loves it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid big money to skin aestheticians to do that and never had this kind of good result before!</li>
            <li>Find yourself a brand partner and try it risk free for 30 days - you will be glad you</li>
            <li>There is also a way to get the product FREE, which sure beats any price.</li>
            <li>easy routine, smells dreamy.</li>
            <li>The delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with product and how fast I received it.</li>
            <li>My fine lines are disappearing.</li>
            <li>Real products are amazing</li>
            <li>2 months was when I really began loving my skin.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll seriously be missing out on an awesome product if you do.</li>
            <li>Be safe, not sorry.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, a great big \\&quot;FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Yes, that&#x27;s right!</li>
            <li>I received my shipment really fast and love</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very even toned and the price was much better than the rep.</li>
            <li>Soon it&#x27;ll be common knowledge that this is the best thing out there -</li>
            <li>I will always be a loyal user of Nerium.</li>
            <li>Seriously noticed great results in one week and on my 3 rd month and my skin keeps getting better.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for just a few months but seems like it has great results.</li>
            <li>I recommended it to my 76 year old mother who has many wrinkles from years of smoking.</li>
            <li>And if you don&#x27;t push through the &#x27;not so fun&#x27;</li>
            <li>I only pay $9.95 shipping and get my product free each month because I have 3 friends who use it and love it too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the product so far and truly hoping that results do increase over the next month, too.</li>
            <li>Yes, it smells kind of dusty, kind of like sandalwood, but not bad.</li>
            <li>Smoother, more even complexion, fine lines less aparent.</li>
            <li>So I tried the product first and bought one for me and my sister.  </li>
            <li>but so is the Real company BPs!  </li>
            <li>My first bottle was a gift from a friend.</li>
            <li>Their product reviews here on Amazon are not all that hot either.</li>
            <li>They will make sure you have proper instructions on HOW to use it..</li>
            <li>Real professionals don&#x27;t sell on Amacon, they&#x27;d never have time!</li>
            <li>Fine lines, crows feet and my deep forehead lines and smile lines are gone.</li>
            <li>Again I was mad at my son when he first approached me with this product, but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin!  </li>
            <li>We ordered 2 units of Nerium for the nite and they sent us one bottle of nite , which fine, and one unit of daytime which was smaller and not what we ordered!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for skin care!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely did not believe the product would work.  </li>
            <li>Now thanks to Nerium</li>
            <li>Forehead wrinkles were much deeper - and those are almost not noticeable anymore.</li>
            <li>This stuff is for real.</li>
            <li>Over priced network marketing company representatives selling their free supplies to get back their investment because it does not work as advertised.</li>
            <li>highly recc this product!</li>
            <li>Uh, get your story straight.  </li>
            <li>It makes skin very even..</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve heard of that product very well</li>
            <li>but for now you could be so much further ahead in your own personal results if you&#x27;d just try it before the masses do.</li>
            <li>When many of the tops of other companies are walking away &amp; joining Nerium, it&#x27;s not for a product that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>, not sure why you&#x27;d spend $180 for 2 bottles when you could get 1 free monthly by telling 3 friends about it, or 2 free monthly by telling 6 friends about it.</li>
            <li>but I think by looking at their websites that they are more concerned with the pyramid scheme of selling and less about if the product really works</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I use it and it has evened-out our skin tone, smoothed out our wrinkles and leaves our skin very soft!</li>
            <li>also want to add that, any good dermatologist or clinical Esthetician would know that 1) age spots often get darker before they lighten, 2) acne often appears or gets worse with a new product before skin smooths or acne diminishes, and 3) tightness is often mistaken for dryness - and even if you are dry/flaky - that is often a natural reaction to a stimulating product and will give way to glowing and new skin underneath.</li>
            <li>Guaranteed, first quality NeriumAD is sold ONLY through their Brand Partners.</li>
            <li>so they just won&#x27;t look as young as I do!</li>
            <li>There is no better product on the market HOWEVER, I want to warn you against ordering NeriumAD on Amazon (which is an otherwise GREAT site), Ebay, or any other site that is not an authorized Nerium International site.</li>
            <li>I am 31 and all of the premature aging that was happening around my eyes and in between my eyebrows is completely gone.</li>
            <li>I have tried nearly everything out there for my sun damaged, acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>So, Russian roulette is NOT a game to be played with this product.</li>
            <li>Bait and switch schemes should not go anywhere near your skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, they are being sued by  Ray Liotta for using his face and using the miracles of the computer to smooth his skin.  </li>
            <li>I started using this product and so far I have not yet formed an opinion.</li>
            <li>I had been plagued with since my early twenties that my makeup barely covered.</li>
            <li>This product must be sold by a Brand Partner with Nerium, if you are buying this product offline you are not getting the real product, and you do not have the 30 day money back guarantee, and you do not have the option to get THIS product for free,and you don&#x27;t get ripped off for them selling it you for DOUBLE THE PRICE.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t usually perform miracles (although I have seen amazing results in as little as a week) -</li>
            <li>I have heard a lot of jabber on social media how terrific this company is, but I am staying out.  </li>

            <li> Some of the bottles being sold on third party sites are used, which means you will only be getting a partial bottle.</li>
            <li> After three days I had hard waxy gunk coming out of my pores and at the end of 1 week my skin was so much smoother because my pores had been cleaned out.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t  know how long this product has been sitting on the shelf or if it has been exposed to sun and heat.</li>
            <li> Even if the box is &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34; you could be getting a product that is tampered with by an UNKNOWN THIRD PARTY</li>
            <li> And, Brand Partners are not authorized to sell on Amazon, and the other 3rd party sites.</li>
            <li> DO YOUR RESEARCH, smells bad and for the money you could buy several other products that work better.</li>
            <li> Well, unknown third parties have the ability to fill their empty bottles with something other than NeriumAD.</li>
            <li> Nerium will probably in due time come tumbling down like a fragile house of cards.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on laser skin treatments with minimal results.</li>
            <li> No reputable Nerium Brand Partner will sell except through the proper venue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;also be aware of fake 5 star submissions/ratings</li>
            <li> And, other bottles?</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d probably guess that after reading my review of a beer keg refrigerator and some other tools</li>
            <li> When you purchase a product from a person other than a Nerium rep, then you don&#x27;t know what quality you&#x27;re getting!</li>
            <li> Within 1 month those places were half faded.</li>
            <li> The product actually made my skin worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that can destroy the effectiveness of the product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this product and at a great price! Highly recommend this for skin care!</li>
            <li> Does not work like it is advertised to.  I didn&#x27;t find any difference in my skin after using two months.</li>
            <li> I received my shipment really fast and love Nerium.  It makes my skin very even toned and the price was much better than the rep. I who sells it for $90 a bottle.</li>
            <li> I read about this product in a marketing magazine about their distribution business plan.  So I tried the product first and bought one for me and my sister.  We are loving it!</li>
            <li> This is a total scam. The product actually made my skin worse. I wanted to like it but I truly believe these people are just out to make money. Smells awful too! Trust me, don&#x27;t do it!</li>
            <li> I love the PRODUCT WHEN PURCHASED BY A BP WITH ALL THE SAFEGUARDS. This product must be sold by a Brand Partner with Nerium, if you are buying this product offline you are not getting the real product, and you do not have the 30 day money back guarantee, and you do not have the option to get THIS product for free,and you don&#x27;t get ripped off for them selling it you for DOUBLE THE PRICE.  if you want to try this product contact me and let&#x27;s get you started using this product properly and with benefits.  This product DOES WORK! if you get the product and not something that has been passed around, opened to refill it and rip people off.</li>
            <li> Do not, I repeat DO NOT purchase NeriumAD on this site! No reputable Nerium Brand Partner will sell except through the proper venue.&lt;br /&gt;The Real products are amazing but so is the Real company BPs!  That is the last you will hear from me. Good luck with your &amp;#34;Deals!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These reviews are from brand partners of nerium . This product simply doesn&#x27;t work! Tried it did 30 says and nothing.</li>
            <li> My first bottle was a gift from a friend. I was sold. I saw results within a week. I will always be a loyal user of Nerium.</li>
            <li> love this anti aging cream.  easy routine, smells dreamy.</li>
            <li> I have extensively researched this company out of Addison, TX.  They have an \\&quot;F\\&quot; rating with the Better Business Bureau.  That&#x27;s right, a great big \\&quot;FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\\&quot;. I have heard a lot of jabber on social media how terrific this company is, but I am staying out.  Their product reviews here on Amazon are not all that hot either. Nerium will probably in due time come tumbling down like a fragile house of cards.  REPEAT: Do your research!  Research and knowledge is everything to avoid falling for fraudulent scammers like these.</li>
            <li> I think this product may work for some but I think by looking at their websites that they are more concerned with the pyramid scheme of selling and less about if the product really works</li>
            <li> It is a great product!</li>
            <li> totally happy with purchase and promptness of receiving order</li>
            <li> This night cream is the best I have ever used! Both my husband and I use it and it has evened-out our skin tone, smoothed out our wrinkles and leaves our skin very soft! I will continue to purchase Nerium through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have not had any great improvement yet!</li>
            <li> Nerium is an awesome one step anti-aging product.  It has lifted my eyelids, crowsfeet are gone and the furrows in my forehead have been greatly reduced all in just 30 days.  If you&#x27;re not seeing these results from Nerium, then maybe you are purchasing old product that has outdated or was overheated in someone car!!  When you purchase a product from a person other than a Nerium rep, then you don&#x27;t know what quality you&#x27;re getting!</li>
            <li> I started using this product after my son started selling it. I had seen some negative reviews on here and I absolutely did not believe the product would work.  After three days I had hard waxy gunk coming out of my pores and at the end of 1 week my skin was so much smoother because my pores had been cleaned out. I&#x27;ve paid big money to skin aestheticians to do that and never had this kind of good result before! At the end of one month my skin was tighter and firmer. People were actually asking what it was doing different because they noticed I looked younger! I&#x27;ve spent thousands of dollars on laser skin treatments with minimal results. My skin was so red from the Rosacea I had been plagued with since my early twenties that my makeup barely covered. Now thanks to Nerium the  breakouts are almost gone, I&#x27;m sure if I didn&#x27;t eat chocolate and seafood, the two things that trigger my Rosacea I would be even better but I can&#x27;t resist!!!  This product has helped me look younger, people say 10 years. It is safe! The Nerium company uses a patented process to extract the safe portion of the oleander plant so all these folks saying the plant is posion do not understand this. Yes, if you eat an oleander leaf that isn&#x27;t safe.  But this large of a company isn&#x27;t stupid. Thet aren&#x27;t going to sell something that&#x27;s dangerous!  I recommended it to my 76 year old mother who has many wrinkles from years of smoking. It has taken ten years off of her face in 60 days! I would never tell my mother to use this product if I thought there was a risk. And my husband has really bad sun-damaged skin. Age spots all over his face.... Within 1 month those places were half faded. After 4 months now they are almost gone! Again I was mad at my son when he first approached me with this product, but it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used on my skin!  There are many competitors in the skin product market that aren&#x27;t happy to see that Nerium has a product that is so amazing.  I&#x27;m thinking that&#x27;s the reason forsome of these negative reviews but then again we aren&#x27;t all the same and it&#x27;s possible the product doesn&#x27;t work for everyone. But the people I know have all had great results. One person was allergic to it.  Try it for yourself but I do suggest you go to a reputable Nerium distributor. You don&#x27;t  know how long this product has been sitting on the shelf or if it has been exposed to sun and heat. I&#x27;ve heard that can destroy the effectiveness of the product.</li>
            <li> If you actually purchase from a brand partner. They will make sure you have proper instructions on HOW to use it.. As well as proper expectations. It doesn&#x27;t usually perform miracles (although I have seen amazing results in as little as a week) - but it is definitely better than anything I have ever used! I personally began to notice results between 19 and 30 days. 2 months was when I really began loving my skin. I have now been using it for 6 months, and I get complimented on my skin EVERYWHERE I go! I am 31 and all of the premature aging that was happening around my eyes and in between my eyebrows is completely gone. Forehead wrinkles were much deeper - and those are almost not noticeable anymore. This stuff is for real. Don&#x27;t miss out on life changing results because someone was unwise and ordered it on Amazon. Find yourself a brand partner and try it risk free for 30 days - you will be glad you did!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to add that, any good dermatologist or clinical Esthetician would know that 1) age spots often get darker before they lighten, 2) acne often appears or gets worse with a new product before skin smooths or acne diminishes, and 3) tightness is often mistaken for dryness - and even if you are dry/flaky - that is often a natural reaction to a stimulating product and will give way to glowing and new skin underneath. So all you people who are complaining about this stuff - welcome to the world of products that WORK! And if you don&#x27;t push through the &#x27;not so fun&#x27; stuff - you&#x27;ll always be stuck with mediocre skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, not sure why you&#x27;d spend $180 for 2 bottles when you could get 1 free monthly by telling 3 friends about it, or 2 free monthly by telling 6 friends about it. Yes, that&#x27;s right! I only pay $9.95 shipping and get my product free each month because I have 3 friends who use it and love it too. And they keep using it - because it is changing their lives as well. Listen to the haters if you want - but you&#x27;ll seriously be missing out on an awesome product if you do. Soon it&#x27;ll be common knowledge that this is the best thing out there - but for now you could be so much further ahead in your own personal results if you&#x27;d just try it before the masses do.</li>
            <li> I have tried nearly everything out there for my sun damaged, acne prone skin. This is the best product I have found. Been using it for one year now. I&#x27;m 36, my skin looks incredible! Fine lines, crows feet and my deep forehead lines and smile lines are gone. I have self confidence. My acne is gone. My scars are lighter. If you are leery... Buy from a person that sales it. 30 day money back guarantee. But... I promise, you&#x27;ll be ordering more!</li>
            <li> Good product. Would recommend  works very good, if used every night before bed.  No fine lines for me. Nice glowing skin.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with product and how fast I received it.</li>
            <li> total bs...doesnt work....reps are trying to sell this crap to get lexus and ipad for commision...buyer beware&lt;br /&gt;also be aware of fake 5 star submissions/ratings</li>
            <li> There is no better product on the market HOWEVER, I want to warn you against ordering NeriumAD on Amazon (which is an otherwise GREAT site), Ebay, or any other site that is not an authorized Nerium International site. Guaranteed, first quality NeriumAD is sold ONLY through their Brand Partners. And, Brand Partners are not authorized to sell on Amazon, and the other 3rd party sites. If you are wanting NeriumAD to work for you, you need to purchase from a Nerium International Brand Partner  to ensure that you are indeed getting NeriumAD product in the bottle that arrives, and receiving the 30 day money back guarantee. Even if the box is &amp;#34;sealed&amp;#34; you could be getting a product that is tampered with by an UNKNOWN THIRD PARTY and there is no telling what is in the bottle. Read the reviews ... they vary greatly and for good reason. Some people are getting bottles left over from a kit belonging to a Brand Partner no longer in the business. There is no date on the bottle or box so you cannot know if it has expired. Some of the bottles being sold on third party sites are used, which means you will only be getting a partial bottle. And, other bottles? Well, unknown third parties have the ability to fill their empty bottles with something other than NeriumAD. This could be useless water (or anything of their choosing). So, Russian roulette is NOT a game to be played with this product. When you purchase NeriumAD from a Brand Partner, you get the 30 day guarantee, and a fresh product that works very effectively. There is also a way to get the product FREE, which sure beats any price. Please do not set yourself up for the possible risk of skin problems, dashed expectations ...  and simply wasting your money. Bait and switch schemes should not go anywhere near your skin. Be safe, not sorry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard of terrific results of Nerium.  I&#x27;m happy with the product so far and truly hoping that results do increase over the next month, too.</li>
            <li> Yes, I took the photos as suggested, but this product removed nothing except $$ from my wallet - it did not remove my wrinkles.  It is a rip-off (and a pyramid scheme).</li>
            <li> Absolute junk that smells as bad as it works. Over priced network marketing company representatives selling their free supplies to get back their investment because it does not work as advertised. Product does not work period DO YOUR RESEARCH, smells bad and for the money you could buy several other products that work better.</li>
            <li> Have been using Nerium for a few months.. I do see a difference in the overall quality and appearance of my skin. Smoother, more even complexion, fine lines less aparent. Others have commented.</li>
            <li> highly recc this product!</li>
            <li> Seriously you poor dear? Uh, get your story straight.  Ray Liotta is suing because someone that looks just like him had great results.  Someone (one of the Independent Brand Partners) said it was Liotta. As far as the rest of the pathetic claims.  Reader beware! When many of the tops of other companies are walking away &amp; joining Nerium, it&#x27;s not for a product that doesn&#x27;t work. How do you know what is in your bottles from AMAZON? Real professionals don&#x27;t sell on Amacon, they&#x27;d never have time! Posers!</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before but you guys have to be kidding. My skin looks awesome!  I ordered 1 bottle to try it and I am back in to order 2 so I don&#x27;t run out.  Yes, it smells kind of dusty, kind of like sandalwood, but not bad. But who cares !!  My fine lines are disappearing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, they are being sued by  Ray Liotta for using his face and using the miracles of the computer to smooth his skin.  If it worked they would not have to lie like this.</li>
            <li> It makes skin very even..&lt;br /&gt;Love the product!!! Non greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone.  One product in all. Great!!!</li>
            <li> We ordered 2 units of Nerium for the nite and they sent us one bottle of nite , which fine, and one unit of daytime which was smaller and not what we ordered! They intentionally ripped us off. Even now with this review they worded our order correct, but did not send us what we ordered! Ripped off by design! Bet they delete this review!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for just a few months but seems like it has great results.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin are product I have ever used...glad not everyone loves it so they just won&#x27;t look as young as I do! Seriously noticed great results in one week and on my 3 rd month and my skin keeps getting better. Thank you Nerium!&lt;br /&gt;This review is from my wife. You&#x27;d probably guess that after reading my review of a beer keg refrigerator and some other tools but she swears by this stuff.</li>
            <li> I started using this product and so far I have not yet formed an opinion. But I&#x27;ve heard of that product very well so I wanted esperimentar. The delivery was very quick. Loved.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what the exchange policy is on this......Guess my optimism clouded my thought process.Have used faithfully for two weeks and have not noticed any change.I now have three jars at quite a dollar investment.To the potential buyer I would say beware.</li>
