            <li>its ok,but i like the hydrating intense moisturizer better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad conditioner...</li>
            <li>Now that I use Enjoy shampoo and conditioner, I use about a peppermint candy sized amount and my hair is soft and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found that, especially in the winter months, I need more conditioning than it&#x27;s able to provide.</li>

            <li>This is my favorite conditioner by far!</li>
            <li>I really like both the shampoo and conditioner from Enjoy.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so soft and silky not to mention more manageable</li>
            <li>I used to use Pantene and had to use a whole handful to get my hair clean and somewhat manageable.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how little I really needed to get wonderful results.  </li>
            <li>Now it is extremely healthy and shinny and not dry.</li>
            <li>Amazing for dry hair!</li>
            <li>purchased this at a local salon for more money than on Amazon (now I&#x27;ll be restocking from Amazon).</li>
            <li>I literally noticed after the first use of this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a few bucks more but worth it!</li>
            <li>is to use a BOAR HAIR BRUSH and a large tooth comb, wash with this shampoo and comb in the conditioner.</li>
            <li>I like the scent just fine personally.</li>
            <li>I would suggest using the entire line of Enjoy products.  </li>
            <li>What I received was very watery.</li>
            <li>They work very well together.</li>
            <li>Ordered this from one_love and it is the real conditioner.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner doesn&#x27;t have an over whelming fragrance but rather a soft fresh smell.  </li>
            <li>I also highly recommend the shampoo on this line too.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down and it looks good whether I straighten my hair or let it air dry in beach waves.</li>
            <li>And with living in a very high humidity area, I am very pleasantly surprised with the result.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was no problem however having used the Enjoy line shampoo and conditioner before the one with the pink star</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and soft and works as well as the high end hair products!</li>
            <li>This is ok for everyday use.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been hooked on the shampoo and conditioner of Enjoy Hydrating for a few years now - I absolutely cannot live without it !</li>
            <li>My hair looks great the first day and ok the second day, but after that the film on the hair from the conditioner makes it appear to be dirty sooner then with other conditioners.</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves your hair soft and managable without being heavy or weighed down.</li>
            <li>I lightly touch up with a flat iron (only about 3-5 minutes) and people rave about my hair all day.  </li>
            <li>No more touching up throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>My hair had previously been thinned and damaged by cheap shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>This keeps my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair so soft and not frizzy at all.  </li>
            <li>I color and straighten and this helps to keep my hair manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>Either way I am really sad, I loved this</li>
            <li>With this new regiment, I only spend about 5 minutes drying.  </li>
            <li>Afterwards, I lightly towel dry and add a little anti-frizz serum (about the size and thickness of a dime)</li>
            <li>I have straight naturally blonde hair and it tends to get quite dry and get split ends.</li>
            <li>A little more runny than usual....</li>
            <li>With the conditioner, apply from the middle of hair to the tips first then work very little into the root area.  </li>

            <li> With the conditioner, apply from the middle of hair to the tips first then work very little into the root area.  </li>
            <li> If you need a deep, thick conditioner then you need to use the Enjoy Luxury line that comes in the pink bottle.</li>
            <li> Usually buy the Luxury Conditioner by Enjoy and a little usually goes a long way but with this conditioner, I feel a have to use a little more to get fully conditioned hair.</li>
            <li> I saw some other reviews that said similar things but based on my prior experience ordered anyway.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments about my hair and this product was a part of my hair routine for quite a long time.</li>
            <li> My past experience with their shampoo and conditioner was that shampoo was rich, thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> My hair used to take 30 minutes to dry and then was still frizzy.  </li>
            <li> We are have different hair type (curly, thin, frizzy, straight)</li>
            <li> I was looking for this product cheaper than what you buy at the salon and larger than the average bottle.</li>
            <li> I have long, dark brown hair that tends to get frizzy and also has some poofy areas.  </li>
            <li> My hair was getting dried out from the coloring and styling I can constantly putting it through.</li>
            <li> She puts in the conditioner and then uses a wet brush to get out all of the tangles.</li>
            <li> and since you only need a small amount to get the job done, it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It is thick stuff and a little hard to get out of the bottle at times, but it is worth the hassle.</li>
            <li> I have already purchased the pink Luxury line conditioner and waiting for it to get here, it never disappoints!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this conditioner I had heard it was really good</li>
            <li> Also the other conditioner was super thick to the point of difficult to squeeze from the bottle.</li>
            <li> so feel like its just going down the drain.</li>
            <li> Totally not enjoy conditioner.</li>
            <li> Never use those plastic stiff brushes they ruin your hair...</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t really help with detangling :(</li>
            <li> Its a very thick conditioner so its kinda hard to get out of the bottle, 2)</li>
            <li> wrong it hardly untangled my hair</li>
            <li> I am so tired of paying an arm and a leg at the salon...</li>
            <li> I am going to leave my 5 star rating, but sadly I can no longer use this product.</li>
            <li> This is clearly fake.</li>
            <li> Rinse out and follow with a cold water rinse</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Love this! Came so fast and nicely packaged! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for years and I love it.I buy it over and over from Amazon. Always like ordering from Amazon. I never have a problem.Thank you Amazon Michelle Reed</li>
            <li> I am going to leave my 5 star rating, but sadly I can no longer use this product. Both the shampoo and conditioner contain both SOY and WHEAT. The ingredient list is cut short or has changed since this one posted online. I kept having a rash all over my face and finally figured out what product I was using that had allergens, it is this one. I didn&#x27;t used to have any problems so maybe they have changed the ingredients. Either way I am really sad, I loved this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this at a local salon for more money than on Amazon (now I&#x27;ll be restocking from Amazon). This product is amazing. I have straight naturally blonde hair and it tends to get quite dry and get split ends. Now it is extremely healthy and shinny and not dry. I literally noticed after the first use of this product. I have been using this a month now and my hair has never been prettier. I have begun to use it on my daughter as well and had the same results. I&#x27;ve done some research and if you have hair like mine the best regimen  is to use a BOAR HAIR BRUSH and a large tooth comb, wash with this shampoo and comb in the conditioner. Rinse out and follow with a cold water rinse so your hair is shinny. Never use those plastic stiff brushes they ruin your hair... for years I had no idea. If you do this you can&#x27;t go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells like citrus/oranges. I like the scent just fine personally. I don&#x27;t like perfume smelling products as I am often allergic, I am not allergic to this.</li>
            <li> I have been using both the Hydrating shampoo and conditioner which were recommended by my hairdresser.  This stuff is fabulous!  I have long, dark brown hair that tends to get frizzy and also has some poofy areas.  I used to use Pantene and had to use a whole handful to get my hair clean and somewhat manageable.  Now that I use Enjoy shampoo and conditioner, I use about a peppermint candy sized amount and my hair is soft and more manageable.  I was surprised at how little I really needed to get wonderful results.  The hairdresser said to apply the shampoo to the roots and scalp then let the suds go through the rest.  With the conditioner, apply from the middle of hair to the tips first then work very little into the root area.  Make sure to comb through before you rinse it out.  Afterwards, I lightly towel dry and add a little anti-frizz serum (about the size and thickness of a dime) and then blowdry.  My hair used to take 30 minutes to dry and then was still frizzy.  With this new regiment, I only spend about 5 minutes drying.  I lightly touch up with a flat iron (only about 3-5 minutes) and people rave about my hair all day.  And with living in a very high humidity area, I am very pleasantly surprised with the result.  No more touching up throughout the day.  Even air drying with just Enjoy shampoo and conditioner, people now comment on how nice my hair looks.  I am sold on this stuff!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever buy this at your salon - get it here!  Great stuff!  I am so tired of paying an arm and a leg at the salon...</li>
            <li> Usually buy the Luxury Conditioner by Enjoy and a little usually goes a long way but with this conditioner, I feel a have to use a little more to get fully conditioned hair. Still works good but once I&#x27;ve used it all I&#x27;m switching back to the Luxury one. It&#x27;s a few bucks more but worth it!</li>
            <li> This is clearly fake. PEOPLE CHECK YOUR BOTTLES. If there is a sticker over top of the barcode this is an EXPIRED or TAMPERED ITEM. Don&#x27;t kid yourself. It might make your hair nicer than cheap shampoo and conditioner but this is FRAUD.</li>
            <li> love the product but the packaging was not so good as about a fourth of it leaked</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad conditioner... but it&#x27;s not super-duper. Have been using this for over a year but I&#x27;ve found that, especially in the winter months, I need more conditioning than it&#x27;s able to provide. I would say its power is about a medium on the conditioning scale.</li>
            <li> best products out there for colored treated hair</li>
            <li> I use this along with Enjoy shampoo to maintain the color of my hair and keep it looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Great hydrating conditioner! My hair had previously been thinned and damaged by cheap shampoos and conditioners. I had to cut off some of the damage, but this conditioner helped save the rest of my hair. My hair immediately felt softer and looked shinier after one use. I only have two complaints: 1) Its a very thick conditioner so its kinda hard to get out of the bottle, 2) I have coarse hair and it didn&#x27;t really help with detangling :( But I will continue to buy this product. The price is well worth it!</li>
            <li> If you need a deep, thick conditioner then you need to use the Enjoy Luxury line that comes in the pink bottle. My hair felt like I hadn&#x27;t been using conditioner at all, and there is a ton to use (33 oz) so feel like its just going down the drain. I have already purchased the pink Luxury line conditioner and waiting for it to get here, it never disappoints!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It smells great and leaves your hair soft and managable without being heavy or weighed down. I have been using this conditioner for years and years and always come back to it for a reason: it works!!!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!  This is the cheapest place to purchase!!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST shampoo you will ever use.  I would suggest using the entire line of Enjoy products.  I have curly hair and have not found anything that makes my hair look or feel better.  Amazon is the cheapest place I have found to buy Enjoy, even with coupons &amp; discounts at Beauty Supply stores in my area.</li>
            <li> very enjoyable to use</li>
            <li> A little more runny than usual....</li>
            <li> Totally not enjoy conditioner. Too good to be true. Just don&#x27;t be cheap and buy stuff from a trusted beauty supply store or salon</li>
            <li> The shipping was no problem however having used the Enjoy line shampoo and conditioner before the one with the pink star I was wondering if this was possibly a counterfeit item. My past experience with their shampoo and conditioner was that shampoo was rich, thick and creamy. What I received was very watery. Also the other conditioner was super thick to the point of difficult to squeeze from the bottle. Again this conditioner was watery comparatively. I saw some other reviews that said similar things but based on my prior experience ordered anyway. Maybe next time will try from a different supplier</li>
            <li> This conditioner works great and since you only need a small amount to get the job done, it lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> Love love love this conditioner!! It doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down and it looks good whether I straighten my hair or let it air dry in beach waves. It makes my hair shiny and soft and works as well as the high end hair products! Smells good too. It is thick stuff and a little hard to get out of the bottle at times, but it is worth the hassle.I also highly recommend the shampoo on this line too.  They work very well together.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  I&#x27;ll never go back to store bought again!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner.  Smells wonderful and leaves your hair shinny and manageable.  I have allergies, but, this product works well for me.</li>
            <li> I love Enjoy shampoo and conditioner! My hair was getting dried out from the coloring and styling I can constantly putting it through. This keeps my hair soft and shiny. It smells nice too.</li>
            <li> this is PH balanced perfectly for my hair and skin. Doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts around hair line, back. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been hooked on the shampoo and conditioner of Enjoy Hydrating for a few years now - I absolutely cannot live without it ! Love this product and the smell is awesome too!</li>
            <li> Ordered this from one_love and it is the real conditioner.  I will try to order shampoo from this seller in the hopes that the shampoo will be legit as well.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years.  Best shampoo and conditioner for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using Enjoy Sulfate Free Hydrating Conditioner for years and will continue to do so. I love how soft, silky and smooth my curls feel when I use this conditioner. I always have it in my guest bath as well and guests are always asking about it and several family members have started using it.  We are have different hair type (curly, thin, frizzy, straight) and we each feel like this conditioner has helped our hair.  The conditioner doesn&#x27;t have an over whelming fragrance but rather a soft fresh smell.  Buying it in the larger size has saved me a lot of money and is perfect for adding a pump to keep it in the shower.</li>
            <li> My hair syles so nice and feels great with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I really like both the shampoo and conditioner from Enjoy. This conditioner does a beautiful job without making my hair heavy or greasy. It also works well with my daughter&#x27;s curly hair. She puts in the conditioner and then uses a wet brush to get out all of the tangles. This is my favorite conditioner by far!</li>
            <li> My hair looks great the first day and ok the second day, but after that the film on the hair from the conditioner makes it appear to be dirty sooner then with other conditioners. I guess if you buy a hydrating product, it will add something to your hair to keep it from drying out.</li>
            <li> its ok,but i like the hydrating intense moisturizer better.This is ok for everyday use.Good deal for the size.way better than other salon shampoos i&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way.  My hair has never been so soft and silky not to mention more manageable</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this conditioner I had heard it was really good and I thought for the price of it it must be... wrong it hardly untangled my hair and it didn&#x27;t give it any more hydration.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair so soft and not frizzy at all.  This is a great product</li>
            <li> I gave this to my daughter as a gift. She is enjoying it.</li>
            <li> good conditioner for my dry hair. I color and straighten and this helps to keep my hair manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> Amazing for dry hair! If you have normal hair, this is best to use twice a week! This product does an amazing job! I always get compliments about my hair and this product was a part of my hair routine for quite a long time. It&#x27;s on a higher price range, but your hair will love you for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with oily type of hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this product cheaper than what you buy at the salon and larger than the average bottle. This was the perfect price for the size of product purchased. I would definitely order it again.</li>
