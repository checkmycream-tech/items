            <li>I been doing my own nails forever</li>
            <li>So we were both thrilled with the results.</li>

            <li>I purchased more of them and they are very easy to use</li>
            <li>They are huge!  </li>
            <li>Many times they tear and have to be thrown out.  </li>
            <li>love them&amp;#34; They are really cute.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more as soon as I see if I get them.</li>

            <li>I absolutely love these nail decor items.</li>
            <li>They looked beautiful, whether my nails were painted or clear.</li>
            <li>either way they will look super nice on.</li>
            <li>First the \\&quot;Tattoos\\&quot; are beautiful, lots of detail and pretty colors.</li>
            <li>Once all in place I did 2 clear coats and they are great.</li>
            <li>These are easy to use nail stickers.  </li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t like where it is placed you can easily peel off and put where you want.</li>
            <li>so the low price on these are great</li>

            <li>so pretty and so easy to use,</li>
            <li>I loved these and look forward to purchasing other designs!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>They are pretty and they stay on well but</li>
            <li>I will definitely use this seller again. :-)</li>
            <li>I purchased 6 different ones and they sent me a seventh as a free gift!</li>
            <li>Looked so pretty</li>
            <li>and i have ordered many different styles from this company!!!</li>
            <li>and I were a little leery when we first tried to use these, as we are both use to the pre-cut kind we have always seen.</li>
            <li>design to large.</li>
            <li>These tattoos were gorgeous, however, I had a hard time applying them to my nails</li>
            <li>just simply very lovely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really  like butterfly.</li>
            <li>It took me a while to figure out how to get the stickers off because I thought the flowers comes of by themselves and not with the whole paper.  </li>
            <li>I would love to use the one on top of the nail in the picture, however it is big enough for Hagrid the Giants Big Toe!</li>
            <li>Luckily we went ahead and tried, and the paper totally disappears.</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; stays put (as long as you use a clear coat after applying).</li>
            <li>Also, found out the hard way that they dissolve very easily.  </li>
            <li>The stickers are pretty but some of them are to big for my nail but</li>
            <li>I loke the way you can use the tattoos I even got more of them I plan on using the black butterflies next</li>
            <li>they seemed old and brittle..</li>
            <li>Product came early.  </li>
            <li>I filed a claim and they sent me an email back saying that I should put it on my nail first to see the actual color to appear.</li>
            <li>I only use one design so far</li>

            <li> the tattoos are  not as pretty as pictured and they are hard to apply.</li>
            <li> These are pretty stickers, but hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Stickers last for a long time.</li>
            <li> they did not stick flat but wrinkled on the nail 4.</li>
            <li> It does take time - the most consuming is cutting them out.</li>
            <li> The product took soooo long to arrive.</li>
            <li> honestly just not worth the effort of cutting and then trying to &amp;#34;pry&amp;#34</li>
            <li> the instructions are not clear</li>
            <li> And they are dark, not a nice crisp purple as shown.  </li>
            <li> I thought the design was very pretty on the picture, but after receiving this product I found it was VERY poor quality</li>
            <li> Junk junk junk total waste of money won&#x27;t come off the paper</li>
            <li> other note:</li>
            <li> Biggest complaint is that one 3 of the 6 designs I choose, 1/3 won&#x27;t fit so are useless.</li>
            <li> I did know that from reading reviews before I bought them but thought it would be a little bit easier.  </li>
            <li> I do not have little hands or nails</li>
            <li> These come on a page you cut out, peel off (with some left over paper unless you are expert cutter with very tiny cutting tools, both of us were worried that the paper would show through.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money for this.</li>
            <li> yet I could not fit the flowered butterfly decal on my thumb even.</li>
            <li> I did not like this item, was not easy to peel off and not easy to apply to the nail.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little hard to peel.</li>
            <li> I was not able to use them and my theme for our wedding was butterflies.</li>
            <li> With the small size that is hard to do.  </li>
            <li> The stickers are hard to peal off.  </li>
            <li> There is no way without seriously losing 1/2 of the design to use this one.</li>
            <li> There are a see through sheets look like a thin wax paper that come with the flowers and when I put them on my nails, the paper show.</li>
            <li> What a disappointing waste of money.</li>
            <li> (I must&#x27;ve been doing it wrong.)</li>
            <li> These butterfly tattoo&#x27;s were not stick on like I expected, so very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> That is absurd!</li>
            <li> the stickers were on a sheet of brown paper and were nearly impossible to pull off.</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought these for my Wifes business and they were a hit.</li>
            <li> The stickers are hard to peal off.  Many times they tear and have to be thrown out.  Would not recommend the product.</li>
            <li> just simply very lovely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what I can write because they are just gorgeous. love them&amp;#34; They are really cute.</li>
            <li> Thank you for this Nail tattoo Sticker Butterfly. I really  like butterfly. Have a nice day!!! Thank you very much</li>
            <li> The butterfly on the white part of the nail is not that size.  They are huge!  And they are dark, not a nice crisp purple as shown.  Inexpensive but not what they are presented to be.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful nail stickers.  However, they are NOT precut so you have to cut them out yourself.  I did know that from reading reviews before I bought them but thought it would be a little bit easier.  Its not.  They are pretty and they stay on well but honestly just not worth the effort of cutting and then trying to &amp;#34;pry&amp;#34; the sticker from the back and then get it on your nail.  Also, found out the hard way that they dissolve very easily.  I washed my hands before applying the top coat and the design just literally &amp;#34;washed&amp;#34; away!</li>
            <li> design to large. the tattoos are  not as pretty as pictured and they are hard to apply. the instructions are not clear</li>
            <li> IT DOESN&#x27;T LOOK AS GOOD AS THE PICTURE</li>
            <li> Horrible! Nothing like the picture! I have no idea how to even to begin to put them on, the instructions don&#x27;t make sense.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time for the party. Really easy to use and looks great. Was a big hit with all my friends</li>
            <li> there great I will be ordering more as soon as I see if I get them. I love the stickers</li>
            <li> They look amazing but u tear alot trying to get them off the paper and they don&#x27;t come with instructions. Good thing for utube</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a little hard to peel. there isn&#x27;t enough surrounding space to cut out and peel without damaging them. Mine were done by a nail tech</li>
            <li> I thought the design was very pretty on the picture, but after receiving this product I found it was VERY poor quality....couldn&#x27;t get any of the stickers off of the card without tearing....they seemed old and brittle..I will stick with the pueen products from now on.....lesson learned.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re gorgeous, especially when I wear clothing that matches the color</li>
            <li> couldnt get decal off paper. aweful</li>
            <li> Junk junk junk total waste of money won&#x27;t come off the paper it just desolves</li>
            <li> Product is beautiful and perfect. Product came early.  I will definitely use this seller again. :-)</li>
            <li> so pretty and so easy to use,</li>
            <li> The stickers are pretty but some of them are to big for my nail but either way they will look super nice on.</li>
            <li> The flower stickers don&#x27;t just come off the protective sheet by themselves. There are a see through sheets look like a thin wax paper that come with the flowers and when I put them on my nails, the paper show. You have to literally cut out the flowers as close as possible to eliminate the extra wax paper.  I will have to post some picture so you all see. I been doing my own nails forever and I have bought many Nail stickers before but nothing like this. It took me a while to figure out how to get the stickers off because I thought the flowers comes of by themselves and not with the whole paper.  I bought a bunch of same type with different designs. I only use one design so far and I am going to return all back to seller.</li>
            <li> Hi,I got items,Thank you</li>
            <li> These are pretty stickers, but hard to use.  You have to cut the shape out and then try to peel it off the backing.  With the small size that is hard to do.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> My Nail tech like them, and they go on very nice I purchased more of them and they are very easy to use</li>
            <li> I did not like this item, was not easy to peel off and not easy to apply to the nail. I will not buy again</li>
            <li> First the \\&quot;Tattoos\\&quot; are beautiful, lots of detail and pretty colors. I purchased 6 different ones and they sent me a seventh as a free gift! I would love to use the one on top of the nail in the picture, however it is big enough for Hagrid the Giants Big Toe! There is no way without seriously losing 1/2 of the design to use this one. My nail lady Mindy and I were a little leery when we first tried to use these, as we are both use to the pre-cut kind we have always seen. These come on a page you cut out, peel off (with some left over paper unless you are expert cutter with very tiny cutting tools, both of us were worried that the paper would show through. Luckily we went ahead and tried, and the paper totally disappears. So we were both thrilled with the results. Biggest complaint is that one 3 of the 6 designs I choose, 1/3 won&#x27;t fit so are useless. But for the cost and the variety and the beautiful design quality they are still very much worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;One other note: The company they ship from is located in Germany, you can not track your package, and it does take longer to arrive. The e-mail I received from the company that they had shipped gave me a delivery window of over a month (said would arrive between Aug. 14 and Sept. 16). However, I had them in just over two weeks, so I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> The product took soooo long to arrive. By the time it got here, the color looks NOTHING like what it looks in the picture. I filed a claim and they sent me an email back saying that I should put it on my nail first to see the actual color to appear. That is absurd! Don&#x27;t waste your time and money for this.</li>
            <li> I love the colors these come in.  Would order them again.</li>
            <li> I loke the way you can use the tattoos I even got more of them I plan on using the black butterflies next</li>
            <li> These tattoos were gorgeous, however, I had a hard time applying them to my nails (I must&#x27;ve been doing it wrong.) Anyways, they come in 2 or 3 sheets, and have a variety of sizes, ranging from my pinky to my thumb (which I found perfect). They looked beautiful, whether my nails were painted or clear. I loved these and look forward to purchasing other designs!</li>
            <li> These are easy to use nail stickers.  No water required, just peel and stick.  Stickers last for a long time.</li>
            <li> These butterfly tattoo&#x27;s were not stick on like I expected, so very disappointed.  I was not able to use them and my theme for our wedding was butterflies.</li>
            <li> Looked so pretty but 1. there was no picture included in order to follow the idea 2. the stickers were on a sheet of brown paper and were nearly impossible to pull off. 3. they did not stick flat but wrinkled on the nail 4. the sticker pictures were much bigger than the picture here. I do not have little hands or nails yet I could not fit the flowered butterfly decal on my thumb even. What a disappointing waste of money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these nail decor items. I do my own nails &amp; am always looking for something new &amp; funky to do with them. Easy to use &amp; stays put (as long as you use a clear coat after applying). Would order again!!</li>
            <li> It does take time - the most consuming is cutting them out. Once they are cut out you peel off the back (I use tweezers-had no problem peeling off the paper) and put on - if you don&#x27;t like where it is placed you can easily peel off and put where you want. Once all in place I did 2 clear coats and they are great. I have to redo my nails every 5-6 days so the low price on these are great and i have ordered many different styles from this company!!!</li>
