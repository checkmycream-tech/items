    <ol>
            <li> This crown worked very well for our Homecoming King this year.  It has a very masculine look to it and the young man wore it the entire evening.  Sturdy.  Very good quality.  The price was very good.</li>
            <li> The crown looks great and fits well.  Much classier than some other alternatives.  As other reviewers have noted, the pin loops are annoying, but can be easily removed or bent out of the way.</li>
            <li> I love it  because the metal is thin I love the Christies they are beautiful  it fits good around my head</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice looking crown, good size to fit on the head and the design goes around without any ugly adjusting bands. The metal is thin but that was exoected. The only annoying thing are the pin loops, they dig into the scalp: easy enough to bend them in and it&#x27;s not a problem. This was the best price point I found on amazon from all the sellers and the shipping was fast and free even though it wasn&#x27;t even prime.</li>
            <li> Beautiful/Attractive.  Very Light Weight.  Good value.  Sized for an adult head.</li>
            <li> The crown looks very regal. Considering the low price, I am shocked at how beautiful it is.&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, the product is durable. I wore this crown during Halloween in 2014, when it rained very harshly in North Hollywood.&lt;br /&gt;The crown&#x27;s integrity was left intact.</li>
            <li> Looked good and my son loved it. We bought it for his 16th birthday party. Only complaint is it bends easy and boys are rough and tumble.</li>
            <li> Lovely. After bending the little loops (inside the edge of the crown) and shaping it a bit more oval...I just love this crown. I&#x27;m going to wear it as part of a Tooth Fairy costume on my next cruise. And, who doesn&#x27;t need a little crown once in a while. Having a bad day? Wear your crown!</li>
            <li> Good crown. Wish it was heavier.</li>
            <li> I really expected more for what I paid.  It&#x27;s kind of flimsy and the stones started falling off as soon as I put it on.  I lost three during a three hour party that involved no dancing or other shenanigans</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it , got a lot of compliments!! It was fit for my King and he looked the part!  Thank you AMAZON.com ;  )</li>
            <li> Well worth the price. Looks more expensive than it is and fit my fiance&#x27;s head just right.</li>
            <li> Very nice weight. Good and strong. Its not made from cheap thin metal and looks regal on our character.</li>
            <li> Better price than other sellers, but still sort of pricey for what it is. Needed it for Prince Charming. Fits an adult male. Looks great, so it get 5 stars for being exactly what it is, better than plastic.</li>
            <li> Great crown for the price. Nice and shiny. We used it as a prom king crown for our Halloween wedding. The crown is a little large, even for a grown mans head. The metal is really easy to bend, so we made it into an oval shape for the prom king. Don&#x27;t snag it on anything though, because you might accidentally bend one of the points in half.</li>
            <li> I have a small head, so it was quite big, and a few if the gems fell off when I opened it. (I can fix that with super glue though.) it looks very nice and I bent the crown in order to make it fit.</li>
