            <li>Great price</li>
            <li>works great stops bleeding on cuts etc.</li>
            <li>This will come in very handy got them today</li>
            <li>A reformulation of ingredients that included an EFFECTIVE Anesthetic is Imperative!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Support this product is wise for those who shave with razors</li>
            <li>nice sizes and great prices cant wait to use it</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work so good</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I say treat yourself to your own styptic.  </li>
            <li>so I needed something more effective than a band aid and styptic pencil.  </li>
            <li>I love the option of repairing cuts by putting a drop of this on a cotton swab rather than sticking a stypic pencil or applicator on my face over and over.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing works better</li>
            <li>It sure beats the stypic aluminum chloride sticks -which makes sense .</li>
            <li>/&gt;It stings much more than any Styptic pencil ever did</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s more in this than Styptic liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Aftr</li>
            <li>Knew the product from many years usage.  </li>
            <li>I like it a lot better than styptic pencils.  </li>
            <li>They all love it and feel a bit better about having pedicures.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t understand why its no longer available in stores.</li>
            <li>Product was returned to seller for a full refund.</li>
            <li>The addition of novocaine {lidocaine} acts as a pain killer but is also used in animal research labs to quickly stop skin cuts from bleeding&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works quickly and does a good job of stopping minor bleeding.</li>
            <li>Fast and very effective at stopping bleeding from razor nicks, paper cuts and minor scrapes.  </li>
            <li>Also works great in the kitchen for little knife nicks.</li>
            <li>so well I searched internet a few years ago and bought what I thought was a lifetime supply of this most effective product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aluminum</li>
            <li>but, it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>i got the clear bar works better</li>
            <li>Stops bleeding right away.</li>
            <li>This just seems more sanitary to me, it stops any bleeding quickly and does not leave the white residue that comes with using the pencils.</li>
            <li>I had a bottle of this 15 years ago but have not been able to find in local stores.  </li>
            <li>I will ALWAYS keep styptic in my medicine cabinet, both in pencil and liquid forms, as styptic is as much a staple item in our home as Tylenol, bandaids and aspirin (not Aleve, not Advil, but ASPIRIN!)  </li>
            <li>If you are like me and, occasionally, find yourself on the &amp;#34;clumsy side&amp;#34; of life, you can literally glue yourself together again with Styptic Magic Touch.  </li>
            <li>first time I used it, I put some on my finger tip and dabbed it on a razor cut on my chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>having this available for any minor cuts is important.</li>
            <li>Throw out the pencil as this really works!  </li>
            <li>very noticeable redness and discomfort lasted about one week.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This liquid styptic product: KDS Lab Styptic Magic Touch Liquid, is the WORSE liquid stypic that I have ever encountered in more than 30+ years of product type use.  </li>
            <li>After use is nearly UNBEARABLE !!!  </li>
            <li>Other products out there that do the job better.</li>
            <li>There will be a quick sting and possibly, some expletives might be said...</li>
            <li>But...... By the next morning I had a huge scab over the entire lobe.</li>
            <li>It can sting like heck though, but it&#x27;s well worth the minor pain.</li>
            <li>Out with the old and in with the new.</li>
            <li>but I applied this to my face where I nicked myself and nearly everywhere the liquid touched (beyond the cut) scabbed up severely and took over a week to heal.</li>
            <li>After washing my ear,  it appeared the chemical had dissolved the top layer of skin as it was very raw and seeped blood.  </li>
            <li>This product is a little more expensive than the pencil form of styptic but it is much more &amp;#34;user friendly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>single edge razor make a lot of cuts on face doesn&#x27;t stop blood fast</li>
            <li>This products burns and damages skin especially the soft skin of your face.</li>

            <li> A total and complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use this product on an animal.</li>

            <li> After recently being nicked during a pedicure I realized I didn&#x27;t want the technicians dabbing my toes with styptic used on a million other feet</li>

            <li> or [...] or  [...]  - worse on damaged tissue.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very caustic.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the products ability to stem bleeding from a small shaving nick.</li>
            <li> It did stop the bleeding but damaged the skin so badly it looked necrotic.</li>
            <li> It was horribly painful.</li>
            <li> I had a very bad reaction to it and</li>
            <li> Worst experience ever.  </li>

            <li> This product actually burn the skin, it has been weeks and there is still a faint mark where it was used. Product was returned to seller for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Ordered &amp; received this, but came in bottles labled &amp;#34;lidocaine&amp;#34;, shipper states to disregard bottle, it is styptic inside... I ended up throwing it away</li>
            <li> I had a bottle of this 15 years ago but have not been able to find in local stores.  I love the option of repairing cuts by putting a drop of this on a cotton swab rather than sticking a stypic pencil or applicator on my face over and over.  The swab goes in the trash and I don&#x27;t have to use it again.  This just seems more sanitary to me, it stops any bleeding quickly and does not leave the white residue that comes with using the pencils.</li>
            <li> This will come in very handy got them today</li>
            <li> After shaving and having a small cut, I applied this product and actually burned my face as I would with other similar products I have used. I had a very bad reaction to it and very noticeable redness and discomfort lasted about one week.</li>
            <li> Bought this product in store some 20 years ago---then it disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;Product worked so well I searched internet a few years ago and bought what I thought was a lifetime supply of this most effective product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aluminum chloride and novocaine are both ingredients that stop skin bleeding from nicks. This product uses both. Some sting, but less than the old iodine used to disinfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing works better and I don&#x27;t understand why its no longer available in stores. It sure beats the stypic aluminum chloride sticks -which makes sense . The addition of novocaine {lidocaine} acts as a pain killer but is also used in animal research labs to quickly stop skin cuts from bleeding&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Support this product is wise for those who shave with razors</li>
            <li> Worst experience ever.  Used for nick on neck, left discolored necrotic looking spot about the size of a nickel that lasted a week.  All three bottles went into garbage.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in the products ability to stem bleeding from a small shaving nick. Other products out there that do the job better.</li>
            <li> I will ALWAYS keep styptic in my medicine cabinet, both in pencil and liquid forms, as styptic is as much a staple item in our home as Tylenol, bandaids and aspirin (not Aleve, not Advil, but ASPIRIN!)  However, that being said:  the liquid is SO versatile.  If you are like me and, occasionally, find yourself on the &amp;#34;clumsy side&amp;#34; of life, you can literally glue yourself together again with Styptic Magic Touch.  There will be a quick sting and possibly, some expletives might be said...but, it is worth it.  I do not like blood; that is why there are TWO professions and the other one is law.  This product is a little more expensive than the pencil form of styptic but it is much more &amp;#34;user friendly&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> stings a bit, but works great. just use a tiny amount on tip of finger, then halve it, and halve it again, then use that on your cut. stings, but works!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I had a specific reaction to my skin (that may not apply to others) but I applied this to my face where I nicked myself and nearly everywhere the liquid touched (beyond the cut) scabbed up severely and took over a week to heal.</li>
            <li> Works for me - stops bleeding when I do my nails.</li>
            <li> Fast and very effective at stopping bleeding from razor nicks, paper cuts and minor scrapes.  It can sting like heck though, but it&#x27;s well worth the minor pain.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very caustic.  It will burn your skin.&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I put some on my finger tip and dabbed it on a razor cut on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;The area where this solution came in contact scabbed over and the skin peeled off over a period of a week. The skin was discolored and red.  Looked like I had Impetago.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give it another try.  Maybe I used too much.&lt;br /&gt;Next time I had a razor cut, I put some of this solution on the end of a Q-tip and just touched the razor cut with it.&lt;br /&gt;Same thing happened but on a smaller scale.&lt;br /&gt;It stings much more than any Styptic pencil ever did but once again, the area of skin that it touched burned and peeled.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s more in this than Styptic liquid.&lt;br /&gt;Aftr 3 weeks, the skin on my chin is finally healing but there is still some peeling visible.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m having some sort of allergic reaction but a regular Styptic pencil doesn&#x27;t do this to me.&lt;br /&gt;Use with extreme caution.</li>
            <li> This products burns and damages skin especially the soft skin of your face. It can scar and discolor your skin.  Look up the dangers of using this chemical on skin  \\&quot;Zinc Chloride MSDS\\&quot; Hazard.com. or [...] or  [...]  - worse on damaged tissue.</li>
            <li> Knew the product from many years usage.  I like it a lot better than styptic pencils.  Supplier did everything as it said that it would do.</li>
            <li> After recently being nicked during a pedicure I realized I didn&#x27;t want the technicians dabbing my toes with styptic used on a million other feet so I decided to purchase this to bring with me to my pedicures.  In fact, I bought one bottle each for all of my friends and family.  They all love it and feel a bit better about having pedicures. I say treat yourself to your own styptic.  Also works great in the kitchen for little knife nicks. Love it!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time. I have to take a blood thinner, so having this available for any minor cuts is important.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend ordered this because he couldn&#x27;t find anything that stopped bleeding when shaving his face. He swears by it now! Great price and you get three, and they last a long time. Stops bleeding right away. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> We are seniors with thining skin and also have a cat that fogets to show us the respect we deserve, so we are always bleeding somewear. This product helps us with these problems.</li>
            <li> A total and complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t use this product on an animal.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time - works well</li>
            <li> my wife had this applied to her foot after the pedicurist cut her. It was horribly painful. It did stop the bleeding but damaged the skin so badly it looked necrotic. The area still got a nasty infection.</li>
            <li> Works quickly and does a good job of stopping minor bleeding. Would purchase it again when needed. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> nice sizes and great prices cant wait to use it</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t nick myself when shaving, but when I do, its almost always the bottom of my ear lobe.  Ears bleed heavily so I needed something more effective than a band aid and styptic pencil.  When I cut my ear, I applied 2 drops to the wound and dabbed away the excess with a q-tip. Bleeding stopped immediately!  But...... By the next morning I had a huge scab over the entire lobe. After washing my ear,  it appeared the chemical had dissolved the top layer of skin as it was very raw and seeped blood.  Two weeks to heal.  Tried it again on a chin nick, being extremely careful this time and applied with a q-tip.  Same results - a chemical burn that made the wound far worse</li>
            <li> This liquid styptic product: KDS Lab Styptic Magic Touch Liquid, is the WORSE liquid stypic that I have ever encountered in more than 30+ years of product type use.  The BURNING and STINGING, not only upon application but Lingering PAIN After use is nearly UNBEARABLE !!!  The minor bleeding is Preferable to the  alleged \\&quot;cure\\&quot; from this product. In my opinion, its use is a TORTURE not a cure! I would NOT Recommend its use to ANYONE!  A reformulation of ingredients that included an EFFECTIVE Anesthetic is Imperative!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work so good i started to shave with single edge razor make a lot of cuts on face doesn&#x27;t stop blood fast i got the clear bar works better</li>
            <li> Out with the old and in with the new. Throw out the pencil as this really works!  Only a little amount needed and no messy stick.</li>
            <li> works great stops bleeding on cuts etc.</li>
