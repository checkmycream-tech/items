            <li> A little expensive but very good</li>
            <li> I like how your hair feels so soft with using this product</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful product. My hair was brittle, dpand extremely dry, very dull looking. Since i&#x27;ve been using this product,  i&#x27;ve notice a  change in my hair. It feels better, strong And  it is finally growing healthy!!!</li>
            <li> JUST WHAT I WANTED!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars yet as i&#x27;ve only used it once.  It used it 3 days after my relaxer and i can&#x27;t stop playing in my hair.  My hair feels so soft and moisturized.  The next morning i also applied a small amount to the length of my hair as a moisturizer.  I will continue to moisturize with it every other day.  But so far it is a great leave in as well as moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner. I use the entire Nairobi line and this is a great way to finish it off. It leaves my hair very soft!</li>
            <li> its a leave in....nothing special. it makes my hair soft when its still wet but water does that too my hair. it feels weird when dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this conditioner for over a year, and it has never disappointed me. It works well on my hair, and dries quickly. Since it&#x27;s a leave-in conditioner, the fact that it doesn&#x27;t have an offensive smell is also a definite plus. It works quickly to recreate waves and curls after my hair becomes dry, and gives it a great shine. The only complaint I have in regards to this product is how difficult it is to find at a reasonable price, sometimes! :)</li>
            <li> Worked great for my hair  which is natural and very coarse. Will order shampoo and other products later.  Would recommend to others.</li>

            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product.  I use too much of it...so I must slow down.  I will reorder more soon...but I don&#x27;t remember from whom I ordered the product.  Whomever it was did an awesome job with the packaging.</li>
            <li> it got to my house within 3 days and i love this product</li>
            <li> Makes hair soft and good as weekly conditioner to leave in.</li>

            <li> The leave in conditioner is non greasy and light. I would buy it and recommend it to others. A good buy.</li>
            <li> wonderful leave in conditioner</li>
            <li> great conditioner that leaves hair nice and smooth. The bottle will last forever, you only need a nickel size for shoulder length hair. great for blowing or dryer wet set.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo to use on the off weeks that I don&#x27;t use the Dandra-Solve Shampoo and Conditioner.  I paired it with the Humecta-Sil Moisture Replenishing Conditioner. It kept my hair very moisturized and smelling great. The only bad part is that it&#x27;s not sold locally and I have to wait for it to be shipped.</li>
            <li> This leave in conditioner is a wonderful product. I used it a the hair salon , so I wanted to continue using it at home since I now sport a natural style. Thanks again.</li>
            <li> Great leave in, helps to also control fly away hair, not oily or heavy and has a very nice scent.</li>
            <li> This is a great conditioner and detangler.  Everyone in my family has natural hair--3c, 4a, 4b and 4c curl patterns.  After washing and conditioning, I apply a quarter-sized amount to hair sections 3-4 inches in diameter.  The rat tail comb slides right through.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good leave in for kids</li>
            <li> I used this along with my deep conditioner. It works wonders and smells great . Will continue to use the whole product line.</li>
            <li> This is the best leave-in conditioner that I have ever used.  It does not weigh your hair down.  It leaves it soft and full of body.</li>
            <li> Love this leave in conditioner. A little thicker in texture than most other brands. Love most Nairobi products. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is okay, not fantastic, will use up but not re-order.</li>
            <li> I love this leave in conditioner. I can definitely see a difference from when I wasn&#x27;t using it. Good stuff and it smells good. My hair is so thick. I needed something that detangled, but was gentle. This is it.</li>
            <li> Thin.  Does not make the hair fell nurished.</li>
            <li> I chose the score for the produce because it&#x27;s not perfect but does the trick for my daily use.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is an easy to leave-in condition - worked well with my hair.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
