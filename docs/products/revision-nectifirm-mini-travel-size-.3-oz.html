            <li>Excellent Service</li>
            <li>Perfect product.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product for smoothing the decollete, stopping neck sagging, crepiness and &amp;#34;double chin&amp;#34; problems.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a great deal!  </li>

            <li>Great stuff....</li>
            <li>Great size for traveling &amp; gym</li>
            <li>I was happy to find travel-sized versions of this product.  </li>
            <li>Fits anywhere and you get a good two applications per tube.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommended and I am so glad he did!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not seeing any amazing results.</li>
            <li>Nice size for travel</li>
            <li>Tiny but great for travel!</li>
            <li>I travel occasionally - glad to have these.</li>
            <li>My profile looks 100% better after using this for one month.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Love the product</li>
            <li>I just reordered:)</li>
            <li>These are free samples!</li>
            <li>The product may be fine, but the size is deceiving.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and I would love to have  travel size tubes, but these tubes are so small</li>
            <li>I have the full size at home.</li>
            <li>Seller, please make this right by delivering what you advertised.  </li>
            <li>At 10 tubes per order you will receive typically 1.5 to 2.5 ml per tube which is a good value for these sample sized tubes and Nectifirm has made a difference that my sister noticed.  </li>
            <li>pretty dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I like it so much!</li>
            <li>Think I would have to buy a bigger tube to give a better review.</li>
            <li>I doubt it&#x27;s enough for more than one use.  </li>
            <li>I compared it and that is exactly what it is.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be a good product that moisturizes well, and I could swear I already see a positive difference in firmness and wrinkle reduction (after just a few days.)</li>
            <li>Most of the time spas give those little tubes away free.</li>
            <li>Why bother trying to deceive when it is so easy to check the actual weight?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll make it much easier to pack them rather than the large jar.</li>
            <li>very misleading photo, the tubes are</li>
            <li>The tubes are very minute.  </li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve been much happier,</li>
            <li>The picture here is very deceiving.</li>
            <li>It turns out they sell it as travel size, however, they are really samples given to them by the company.  </li>
            <li>So they are making money on what they get for free and on something that is not for individual sale.  </li>
            <li>I have used the full size product for a week now and it has helped my 50 year old neck appear softer and more firm.</li>
            <li>will just buy full size next time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have purchased the full size of this product from other vendors before and</li>
            <li>In fact, they are clearly marked &amp;#34;not for resale&amp;#34;, and should not be sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Clearly stated on the back, Sample not for resale...</li>
            <li>They don&#x27; even have a UPC Scan code and clearly states in the back that they are NOT FOR RESALE.  </li>
            <li>had I received the 5 that others have apparently received.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Have been using for about a week, no visible results. Product is alot smaller then what appears  in picture. They are samples you would get from a doctor and say not for resale on the back. pretty dissapointed. will just buy full size next time.</li>
            <li> Great stuff....I would buy it again. ...</li>
            <li> Perfect for traveling. Fits anywhere and you get a good two applications per tube.</li>
            <li> Tiny but great for travel!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product...Excellent Service</li>
            <li> Perfect product. Nice size for travel</li>
            <li> I travel occasionally - glad to have these.</li>
            <li> I got these for travel. I have the full size at home. This is an excellent product for smoothing the decollete, stopping neck sagging, crepiness and &amp;#34;double chin&amp;#34; problems. My profile looks 100% better after using this for one month. Had to get some to take with me I like it so much! My dermatologist recommended and I am so glad he did!</li>
            <li> I like the product, but I too feel ripped off. Clearly stated on the back, Sample not for resale...I want what was advertised as travel size not one application.</li>
            <li> very misleading photo, the tubes are TINY, basically one application.  Will not buy again</li>
            <li> This stuff works. I love it</li>
            <li> Great product and theses tubes are a perfect travel size.</li>
            <li> Problem solved:&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED:  This seller has remedied the situation and I will be receiving the balance of my items....so thank you and I can now give you a 5 star rating.  At 10 tubes per order you will receive typically 1.5 to 2.5 ml per tube which is a good value for these sample sized tubes and Nectifirm has made a difference that my sister noticed.  So, I&#x27;m giving her some of these as a gift!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review:  Not only is it smaller than it said (.3 oz), I ordered 3 or 30 tubes and received only 15 of them.  They are not .3 oz each as advertised which is a problem considering the expense.  The product itself seems to be of quality but this is not a sealed product but rather a sample size tube.  I have used the full size product for a week now and it has helped my 50 year old neck appear softer and more firm.</li>
            <li> Love the product BUTThe picture is deceiving.  I can&#x27;t believe I fell for that trick. I thought the tubes were a little larger. Most of the time spas give those little tubes away free. $2.50 give me a break!</li>
            <li> The tubes are very minute.  Think I would have to buy a bigger tube to give a better review.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, these are not .3 oz. travel sizes.  I would have thought the seller had cleared this up by now, but no.  The tubes I received are samples, marked not for resale, and when I weighed them on a digital scale they were .1 oz, which with the weight of the tube means the product is less than half of that.  Seller, please make this right by delivering what you advertised.  Why bother trying to deceive when it is so easy to check the actual weight?  This is a great product and I would love to have  travel size tubes, but these tubes are so small I doubt it&#x27;s enough for more than one use.  I hope to hear from seller soon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it. Everybody else claims to have received 5 tubes. I received 4, plus two that were not Nectifirm. They were a serum and Intellishade (a tinted moisturizer or foundation - not sure which.) I would&#x27;ve been much happier, had I received the 5 that others have apparently received. It seems to be a good product that moisturizes well, and I could swear I already see a positive difference in firmness and wrinkle reduction (after just a few days.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not seeing any amazing results.</li>
            <li> Great size for traveling &amp; gym</li>
            <li> The product may be fine, but the size is deceiving.  Nowhere on the product does it give the weight/amount.  I have no idea how much is actually in each</li>
            <li> The picture here is very deceiving. These are tiny tiny samples, the type a salesperson throws a handful of in your bag after a purchase. In fact, they are clearly marked &amp;#34;not for resale&amp;#34;, and should not be sold on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I expected 2 larger tubes, not several tiny tubes. Items did not appear so small.  Haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to know if it actually works or not.</li>
            <li> I think my neck is improving,</li>
            <li> I recently ordered these thinking they were travel size.  It turns out they sell it as travel size, however, they are really samples given to them by the company.  I have purchased the full size of this product from other vendors before and as a courtesy they send me a sample.  I compared it and that is exactly what it is.  So they are making money on what they get for free and on something that is not for individual sale.  They don&#x27; even have a UPC Scan code and clearly states in the back that they are NOT FOR RESALE.  I demand a refund immediately!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any improvement</li>
            <li> Have used this for years.  I don&#x27;t know how, but it actually works.  I&#x27;m 64 and my neck is not crepey.  My daughter who is 40 told me her skin is getting crepey so I have sent one to her.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Xcellent product 5 stars</li>
            <li> I was happy to find travel-sized versions of this product.  It&#x27;ll make it much easier to pack them rather than the large jar.</li>
            <li> I like this size for travel.  Have been using this product for 2 years now.</li>
            <li> Yes these are sample sized but 4 last at least a month....for $8.  That&#x27;s a great deal!  I just reordered:)</li>
            <li> Travel size??? These are free samples!</li>
            <li> Went on a few trips convenient tonpack</li>
