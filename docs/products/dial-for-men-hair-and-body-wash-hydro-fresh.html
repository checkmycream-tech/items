PLEASE HELP!!!!</li>
            <li> Packed well and in use *****</li>
            <li> I kid you not, this product is great for your hair. I have tried other products like Dove moisturizer and other shampoos that have dried out my hair (I have normally semi-greasy hair after a day), but after a wash my hair feels soft, and easy to manage. Just try it out and be surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons I have is that it can be more expensive than other products.</li>
            <li> Good texture, and cleaning. Left hair clean and soft, but still strong enough for body. Smell is okay, but could be better.</li>
            <li> The  dye in Dial For MEN  Ultimate clean Hair + Body wash will destroy your white wash clothes.The product left a dirty looking color all over  the wash clothes my husband used when using the product. Bleach can not undo the damage that product caused.You would think the Henkel company would have warned their comsumers about the damage this product can cause. When I called the 800 number on the container I was told the dye in the product caused the problem.I was told one should use a sponge when using the product.Yet, that information is not on the product label.</li>
            <li> Cleans ok, does not seem highly anti-bacterial and it is difficult to rinse off easily with just water as it gets slippery and requires I use my brush to get it all off.</li>
            <li> I like the way this stuff smells. I also like the way it works, how my skin feels after showering, and that is also leaves my short hair clean and nice smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be a five star rating if it didn&#x27;t destroy wash cloths. I have two white ones that the dye has done a number on. Use a sponge? No thanks, I don&#x27;t like a sponge or puff for showering. I have given up on this and won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> Only thing my guy will shower with and smells good too.</li>
            <li> This works well for my husband. He is generous with the amount of body wash he uses and this seems to last a while. The bottle is bigger than the one we buy in the store.</li>
            <li> It is very nice value for money. This is a great product and would recommend to others. The fragrance lasts bit longer than I expected.</li>
            <li> works great as both a body soap and as a shampoo</li>
            <li> Love the smell, it&#x27;s my favorite</li>
            <li> Clean and smell fresh!</li>
            <li> My son is a young growing athlete.  He does martial arts, swimming and tennis and doubling up on his activities 4 days a week.  This was recommended by a dad of an athlete and so I got it.  Since then my sons hair smells amazing after his shower and a tough day.  His hair use to have a sweaty odor even after shower before this product but now this is all we&#x27;re going to be using for him.  He likes it too.</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of my husbands gift, paid rather a lot for postage and then Customers made me pay a further £24.00 - so I shall not be ordering again - over £100 in total too expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this hair and body wash. Lightly scented, not overpowering. Rinses clean. I&#x27;ve bought this product several times already.</li>
            <li> My son is 9 and into sports, and MANY outdoor activities! I originally bought this item for my hubby, but my son quickly claimed it! He smells nice and clean after his showers now, and the 2-in-1 (hair/body) aspect is PERFECT for any guy on the go!! And if you can snag the cheaper 3 pk from Amazon, it beats any local deals!</li>
            <li> I have used this for several years in the shower on my body and hair. Highly recommend.  My wife likes the way it smells also.</li>
