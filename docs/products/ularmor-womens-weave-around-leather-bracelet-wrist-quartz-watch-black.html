            <li> Was nice looking and got when they said, but the sizing was off. I can&#x27;t even wear it. Sellers should put sizing in inches and give leeway</li>

            <li> You get what you pay for I say. Nice looking accessory it&#x27;s flimsy. I dropped it on the floor and the lens shattered.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s prety but the butterfly fell off the first time I wore it and the knob on the side for the time fell off within the first week.</li>
