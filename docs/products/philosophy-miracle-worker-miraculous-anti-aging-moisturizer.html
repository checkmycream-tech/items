            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t know, but she looks beautiful, so I won&#x27;t disagree with her.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve experienced and anti-aging benefits but,</li>
            <li>My skin looked great.</li>

            <li>This cream(based on reviews) seemed like a great option to try out.</li>

            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>Very nice product, I will buy again.  </li>
            <li>Very nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have heard so many wonderful things about the Philosophy skin care line that I was maybe overly enthusiastic about this purchase?  </li>
            <li>Good cream......</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve just started using Philosophy and everything that I&#x27;ve tried I&#x27;ve loved.  </li>
            <li>It is a good moisturizer; it is not greasy.</li>
            <li>For normal-to-oily skin, however, it&#x27;s a good option.</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>and it works good to me.</li>
            <li>good product</li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>I ordered &amp;#34;hope&amp;#34; because it had really good reviews and it was cheaper, but don&#x27;t be fooled &amp;#34;Miracle Worker&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Good, but</li>
            <li>If your looking for an excellent moisturizer this is for you, its worth splurging on!</li>
            <li>As soon as this starts to run out, I&#x27;ll buy the full size from Amazon because it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this is a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Love this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE Philosphy&#x27;s Miracle Worker Skin Care Line!  </li>
            <li>Will order more soon!</li>
            <li>I can tell you that I LOVE this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product, that I cannot be without.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like the miracle line, and the moisturizer is really nice</li>
            <li>Seems to work nicely.  </li>
            <li>Although it is not the absolute best I have ever used</li>
            <li>It really feels like wonderful antioxidants and moisturizers for you skin.  </li>
            <li>I am 40 and have a nice complexion... until I tried this product.  </li>
            <li>It had a nice texture and my skin felt moisturized and not too greasy.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product really softens the skin.</li>
            <li>It is a good product, but I needed something with more moisture.  </li>
            <li>i am thirty years old and this is the best thing i&#x27;ve found since Estee Lauder discontinued their Prescriptives line</li>
            <li>This is, by far the best moisturizer I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>It kind of just sat on top of my skin.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to make sure I liked it before blowing $60 on a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is very light</li>
            <li>This is a good product but due to the retinol it contains may not be the best for people needing sensative skin care products (hope in a jar better in that case).</li>
            <li>(i loved their Super Line Preventer serum).  </li>
            <li>My skin does not look or feel any better.  </li>
            <li>Though I love, love, love, Hope In A Jar, Miracle Worker just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li>I love this as a nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My grandmother who is 68 also uses this and says her skin feels like the elasticity is better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff.    </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great moisturizer - I have really noticed changes in my skin since using this.  </li>
            <li>I love Philosophy products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to lie to you, this is NOT a miracle and you won&#x27;t find yourself quitting your job after you start it to become a top model.</li>
            <li>on my third pot of this stuff now, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
            <li>it can&#x27;t make me a model though :-)</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful moisturizer for all women, especially as the skin ages.</li>
            <li>Love the silky feel of my face and that the product does not have a perfumy smell.</li>
            <li>I have used this for years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I love Philosophy products and decided to pay triple to try</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this produce for 2 years and love it..</li>
            <li>I am over 55 and love how it makes my face feel.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be able to wear it during the day though, because my face gets to oily.  </li>
            <li>but it does tend to lay on top of the skin which gives a dewier (or greasy) appearance and can cause makeup to slide.</li>
            <li>I recommend using a powder foundation with this product rather than a liquid, it seems to stay in place better and helps absorb some of the shine from the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>but I recommend that you research and when possible &amp;#34;try before you buy&amp;#34;, to find the products that will work best for you.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay; but makes my face too oily to use  </li>
            <li>My skin looks so mich better and smoother when i use it.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>I USE IT AT NIGHT AND REALLY LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>Love all things Philosophy, and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love how it feels when it goes on</li>
            <li>I love the philosophy products, even though I think the brand is quite pricy.</li>
            <li>and i love it.  </li>
            <li>what more could you ask for?  </li>
            <li>I love hop in a jar</li>
            <li>and now I love Miracle worker.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it is any better than most moisturizers on the market.</li>
            <li>is MUCH better and is definitely the best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I am sure that this works well for most people.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This product Is great for moisturizing older skin.  </li>
            <li>, it is WELL WORTH the money!!</li>
            <li>Super nice..</li>
            <li>However, it is a really good face cream and it really does make my face look better when I use it.</li>
            <li>It goes on very light and feels cool and refreshing on my skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion feels great when you put it on, but it doesn&#x27;t completely absorb.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many and this is hands down the BEST!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was a great price, cheaper than other more popular online shopping sites and delivery was FAST!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It is rich and creamy and smells lovely.  </li>
            <li>the best of other products I have tried.</li>
            <li>Goes on easy over it.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t over-moisturize and cause breakouts, yet the anti-aging ingredients aren&#x27;t so strong that they cause redness or peeling (as i found with Philosophy&#x27;s \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; retinol night treatment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The pads are an effective exfoliater and along with this nice souffle-like moisturizer your skin is rejuvinated to reveal bright, resurfaced pink skin!!!  </li>
            <li>it is also more luxuriant, rich, and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I ended up spending more on a tried and true product.  </li>
            <li>after a month of use, my skin is noticeably brighter and clearer, with fewer fine lines around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li>After using this for a week I noticed the fine lines around my eyes &amp; mouth start to disappear.  </li>
            <li>A firmer texture and fine lines are erased...</li>
            <li>It is a little pricey and this is why I turned to Amazon for the best price.</li>
            <li>This  miracle worker cream is great for firming and it goes on so smoothly that your foundation does the same</li>
            <li>Not greasy and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>just at a moisturizer, it is fabulous.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and a longtime philosophy customer and although this is a great product it is not for me.  </li>
            <li>It seems to give my skin a nice glow, makes it feel really hydrated</li>
            <li>My skin looked great, but I felt like it was time to move on to the next step up.  </li>
            <li>The creme goes on smoothly and my foundation.</li>
            <li>, it is light but still does the job.</li>
            <li>There is, however, another product available that works just as well for a fraction of the price, and can be used all over your body as well.  </li>
            <li>Before this product I was using cheap over the counter products.</li>
            <li>WELL, IS SMOOTH GOING ON,</li>
            <li>My aging complexion gets a reprieve each time I smooth this moisturizer on.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and supple .</li>
            <li>the anti aging moisturizer is really nice, very creamy.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling smooth, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I lightly massage a dab of it all over my face and the rest on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin smooth and I wake up with glowing skin.</li>
            <li>and it makes my skin feel so soft and good.  </li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>First let me say that I love Philosophy scents.  </li>
            <li>worth every penny!</li>
            <li>It feels like the elasticity has increased significantly.</li>
            <li>I really like this product as it is a very light cream and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>~1/3.&lt;br /&gt;Miracle is a nice consistency but you need more than the tiny amount it states on the bottle</li>
            <li>but it is super rich moisturizing...</li>
            <li>For that price it should have been full.</li>
            <li>my eyes do not sting - this feels more gentle.  </li>
            <li>If you want a moisturizer that only make your skin softer than it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li>Beware it&#x27;s true what you&#x27;ve read</li>
            <li>Not heavy at all, but highly effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was returd and IF got a full refund</li>
            <li>Light and easily absorbed into skin.</li>
            <li>if applying too much, your skin will become more &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Hi I did a test between my other cream and did not tell anyone after a week I asked what side of my face looks better and everyone pick the Miracle and time side LOVE IT :)</li>
            <li>Yes, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer, but I don&#x27;t notice any other benefits from it.  </li>
            <li>I have used other Philosophy Miracle products and have always been happy with the quality of their products.</li>
            <li>I must say the cream keeps my skin soft and smooth and makeup goes on better.</li>
            <li>In the end, if I get that, then I&#x27;m going to be happy as I know that realistically, none of these creams and potions will really take ten years off me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If anyone within my age range, or someone who actually works for Philosophy, could maybe recommend something that is more appropriate for aging skin.  </li>
            <li>It feels luxurious, it absorbs quickly and evenly and you skin feels like velvet afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I love this protect , will highly recommend it</li>
            <li>It is certainly creamy and does a fine job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more of a lotion, than a cream, but goes on smooth &amp; absorbs into skin nicely, takes very little product.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels super soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is a nice step above Hope in a Jar which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I received the Miracle Worker cream in sample form and liked it enough to buy the 2 ounce version.</li>
            <li>In the morning my face feels so soft, smooth and well hydrated!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream at night now for about 2 weeks, I love the way it makes my face feel so soft.</li>
            <li>It is well worth it.</li>
            <li>makes me rarely use it.</li>
            <li>Which *most* anti-wrinkle creams I&#x27;ve tried so far seem to only do that (making me more &amp; more timid to try new ones).</li>
            <li>/&gt;i was totally right.  </li>
            <li>Hoping it would be right this time.</li>
            <li>i love the philosophy products, i like the pure and natural scents.</li>
            <li>I bought it because at 23, I was just starting to see some very fine lines around my eyes(I go in the sun a lot).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably go back to using coconut oil until I feel brave enough to try another anti-aging moisturizer, though ive read on line that coconut oil helps reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Always happy with Philosophy products, but will go back to regular Hope in a Jar.  </li>
            <li>But this one is very gentle.</li>
            <li>it also arrived very fast and not damaged.</li>
            <li>very very please with the product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22 with porcelain hyper-pale skin (a UV damage nightmare waiting to happen) and I have fine lines under my eyes and very micro fine lines on my forehead starting to form already!(Unfair.)</li>
            <li>but the results are mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>I have tried most lotions and potions and truly feel that these products are intended for younger audiences.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer, my face is not the same without it!</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>Works great....easy to use and gentle to skin!</li>
            <li>Goes on so smooth, leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>For day-time use, I have mixed 1/2 of Miracle worker with 1/2 of my favorite face sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I just finished the first jar and am hooked....</li>
            <li>I will come back for more.</li>
            <li>I bought the 0.5oz size of this product last week and I feel in love with it the after the first use.</li>
            <li>but I highly recommend this as a try!!</li>
            <li>But I like when hope is not enough better and that I use as a day and night cream.&lt;br /&gt;Id</li>
            <li>I have tried many facial lotions in my life from big names and from online with dermatologist formulas and almost all of them have been too oily later in the afternoon, not moisturizing enough so you don&#x27;t feel like you even put it on or there is no difference in how you skin feels - this one is PERFECT.  </li>
            <li>now it leaves my skin soft and helps from drying I also use it before applying my makeup because it helps make it go on smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it more as a preventative measure in my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I have used a couple other Philosophy moisturizers and other brands, but find this works best for me.  </li>
            <li>This seems to be a much more deep moisturizing product</li>
            <li>I have been a fairly faithful Dermalogica user for a few years but just felt my skin needed something a bit richer.  </li>
            <li>It is very watery and runs right out of jar.  </li>
            <li>#34;you smell sooo good.&amp;#34;  Not overpowering, not cheap, just clean and fresh and lovely.  </li>
            <li>I really prefer this moisturizer much more than just the regular jar I bought the first time.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen much if any results yet (which is why I gave only 4 stars), but love the way this moisturizer feels and absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and product was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>and I love that my skin stays moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li>Nothing can remove the past wear and tear, but this product gives it a good shot.</li>
            <li>It is very light as well- a true bonus for me because i cannot stand heavy creams on my face.</li>
            <li>If anything, I believe it has helped my acne because many skin experts say moisturizing is a main key in getting rid of acne.</li>
            <li>there is very little if any scent (great for sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>Never again I cant live with out my Philosophy Miracle Worker Anti-Aging Moisturizer, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>if you have dry skin it IS a miracle for sure. ..</li>
            <li>She is very particular about the quality of her makeup.</li>
            <li>I moved to a dry area and I need alittle more moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I certainly don&#x27;t see it doing any &amp;#34;miracles&amp;#34; and will use it until it&#x27;s finished but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li>It probably would be better in the fall and winter for very dry skin.</li>
            <li>Google Amazing Grace, formula change, you will likely find my rant along with that of others who smelled the same rat.  </li>
            <li>I am in my early forties AND HAVE SOME noticible smile lines.</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion.  </li>
            <li>be purchasing more when jar is empty, which won&#x27;t be too soon.</li>
            <li>, this product is an absolute blessing.</li>
            <li>Really like it, i limve in nee england and thd weather</li>
            <li>Who wants to start the trial and error period again.  </li>
            <li>have used this moisturizer for over 2 years and absolutely like it</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really seem to make any difference than say my Nivea hand cream.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Before this, I was using coconut oil, which moisturized very well without causing breakouts.</li>
            <li>It really does make a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I really like this cream</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t change the wrinkle of eyes too much.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I really do like Philosophy products</li>
            <li>Really does improve skin.</li>
            <li>She absolutely swears by it.  </li>
            <li>so mission accomplished.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t deal with breakouts well</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not ready to give up trying anti-wrinkles creams yet...</li>
            <li>this moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li>I try other creams, but they never feel as good as this one, so I come back to it.</li>
            <li>I love this because so many moisturizers feel good going on but your skin is dried out in a few hours or less.  </li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way too which is great because I don&#x27;t see myself running out anytime soon.</li>
            <li>I am rating this product as good, not exceptional.</li>
            <li>The results were nice and I usually break out with anything that touches my skin.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t justify spending this kind of money on a small jar of cream, and am happier with the long-term benefits of Skin MD.  </li>
            <li>I did feel mild tingling upon use, but since I have used strong serums in the past that wasn&#x27;t a concern.  </li>
            <li>Glad Amazon carries it, as their price is less than the retail stores.</li>
            <li>Avon&#x27;s Anew is better and costs less.</li>
            <li>Would recommend this to anyone 40 years or older.</li>
            <li>Wish I can get money back because most of my moisturizers last a longer than this.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing this for 6 years now and many people think I am younger than I actually am, so it must be working.</li>
            <li>so I had high expectations.</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s another high quality product from Philosophy.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this face cream because of the reviews.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a little over a year now and still love it.  </li>
            <li>When I wore Amazing Grace years ago, not one day went by where I did not receive at least two or three people telling me &amp;</li>
            <li>It is not a thick cream, it is quite runny.  </li>
            <li>As a woman in her early 40&#x27;s with dry/normal skin, this really helps minimize those aging signs that are trying to show up.  </li>
            <li>There is a healthy glow I like, but as I said, never oily if I apply less!</li>
            <li>It feels a little greasy at first, but within 20 minutes my skin soaks it right up!  </li>
            <li>and yes I just got my new jar...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This was sold to me as new..</li>
            <li>It also is super moisturizing for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>it feels very soft and moisture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 36 and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I usually NEVER try any creams or moisturizers for my face, since I break out every time I try one.</li>
            <li>Willing to purchase again in the future!</li>
            <li>This cream is good -- but it definitely does not work the miracles it claims to.&lt;br /&gt;I would compare it to something which can be found at half the price at the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is good -- but the amount in the jar is not so much --- so if you want to use it on your neck and decollete, expect to run out rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing bad about it --- but it&#x27;s nothing extraordinary either -- just average</li>
            <li>This product gad brough great relief to my tired, dry old dkin!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer fixed my dry skin problem without aggravating my skin in any way, which is rare.</li>
            <li>I cannot afford a face lift, but any of Philosophy Miracle Worker products do make my face look less wrinkly and more younger looking.</li>
            <li>However I only was able to use it for a couple of weeks before my 4 year old got into it and dumped it down the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li>With a combination skin, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily or dry, but just right.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a little over 2 weeks and my face feels and looks better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 50 years young</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like getting old.  </li>
            <li>The product line is used by burn victims and friends sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li>I also thought at least some of my age spots would be alleviated.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much, so it will last along time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll write an update when I&#x27;m ready to order my next Miracle Worker.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin soft and moisturized, even in the winter.  </li>
            <li>May be Hype, and no miracles, but after years of use skin feels soft and supple at 70</li>
            <li>The cream was old when it came it was ruuny and discolored&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it that evening and immediately my skin felt really soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and keep coming back to it.  </li>
            <li>NO HARSH RASHES FROM IT AND IS NOT GREASY.  </li>
            <li>Woke it with soft skin~</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, my skin has not cracked or become chapped.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I look really young anyway.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt to start early I guess.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin soft and seems to hide the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy and absorbs well into the skin.  </li>
            <li>Randomly 1 day I read in Sephora.com about Philosophy Miracle Worker and saw the good reviews for this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I on the other hand was expecting not only softer skin but diminished fine lines and wrinkles as Miracle Worker suggested.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little too rich for my eye zone though-</li>
            <li>I had higher expectations for this product and didn&#x27;t feel it lasted very long</li>
            <li>but I feel like it goes too &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34; when the jar is still about half full.  </li>
            <li>The new staff at Philosophy swears it&#x27;s the same product---</li>
            <li>I still gave it 3 stars as I really believe different things work differently on all of us.  </li>
            <li>it caused major puffy eyes in the morning.</li>
            <li>Due to a packing error on my first order of this item, I took a chance and ordered it again.</li>
            <li>I bought a small trial size of philosophy&#x27;s Miracle Worker at Ulta so that I could try it out first before I spent the money for a full size jar.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 48 years old and have dry and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>for the anti-aging component, I really haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any difference.</li>
            <li>I was browsing the trial size display while waiting to checkout and thought i&#x27;d give this product a try, I didnt realize until I got to the register that I was buying a 22.00 dollar trial size moisturizer but in the interest of time I went ahead and finished my purchase, I have NO REGRETS about paying 22 dollars for this product and will continue using it</li>
            <li>I recently started using Miracle Worker and WOW...</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, I highly recommend you try this.</li>
            <li>It is mild, non irritating, and moisturizes aging skin very well.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and smooth and it isn&#x27;t the least bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful!</li>
            <li>However, I am not sure if I am supposed to be running out of it really quickly?</li>
            <li>For example, most matured women complain about dry skin with the wrinkles and my skin is still very excessively oily from my puberty years.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using it almost a week and not a single pimple.</li>
            <li>only complaint is that Miracle Worker isn&#x27;t available in an SPF formula.  </li>
            <li>I received about $5-$10 off of the original price offered at Philosophy (not much, but any little bit helps).</li>
            <li>In A Jar, i was looking for something a little less greasy and without the strong scent.  </li>
            <li>She said \\&quot;the lines on my face from the night of sleep usually takes awhile to disappear in the morning but after using this they disappear right away\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li>At first this product worked well, but after a few applications it actually made my face break out in red patches.</li>
            <li>But fine lines have not gone away or have gotten worse, this I quess comes over time.</li>
            <li>So many brands and such a wide price range, but it&#x27;s very hard to give up a product line you have been using forever.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Very nice product, I will buy again.  </li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have heard so many wonderful things about the Philosophy skin care line that I was maybe overly enthusiastic about this purchase?  </li>
            <li> Good cream......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using Philosophy and everything that I&#x27;ve tried I&#x27;ve loved.  </li>
            <li> It is a good moisturizer; it is not greasy.</li>
            <li> For normal-to-oily skin, however, it&#x27;s a good option.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> and it works good to me.</li>
            <li> good product</li>
            <li> I loved it</li>
            <li> I ordered &amp;#34;hope&amp;#34; because it had really good reviews and it was cheaper, but don&#x27;t be fooled &amp;#34;Miracle Worker&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Good, but</li>
            <li> If your looking for an excellent moisturizer this is for you, its worth splurging on!</li>

            <li> Love this moisturizer!  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Philosphy&#x27;s Miracle Worker Skin Care Line!  </li>
            <li> Will order more soon!</li>
            <li> I can tell you that I LOVE this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, that I cannot be without.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like the miracle line, and the moisturizer is really nice</li>
            <li> Seems to work nicely.  </li>
            <li> Although it is not the absolute best I have ever used</li>
            <li> It really feels like wonderful antioxidants and moisturizers for you skin.  </li>
            <li> I am 40 and have a nice complexion... until I tried this product.  </li>
            <li> It had a nice texture and my skin felt moisturized and not too greasy.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product really softens the skin.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, but I needed something with more moisture.  </li>
            <li> i am thirty years old and this is the best thing i&#x27;ve found since Estee Lauder discontinued their Prescriptives line</li>
            <li> This is, by far the best moisturizer I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> It kind of just sat on top of my skin.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to make sure I liked it before blowing $60 on a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is very light</li>
            <li> This is a good product but due to the retinol it contains may not be the best for people needing sensative skin care products (hope in a jar better in that case).</li>
            <li> (i loved their Super Line Preventer serum).  </li>
            <li> My skin does not look or feel any better.  </li>
            <li> Though I love, love, love, Hope In A Jar, Miracle Worker just didn&#x27;t work for me.  </li>
            <li> I love this as a nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My grandmother who is 68 also uses this and says her skin feels like the elasticity is better.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff.    </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer - I have really noticed changes in my skin since using this.  </li>
            <li> I love Philosophy products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie to you, this is NOT a miracle and you won&#x27;t find yourself quitting your job after you start it to become a top model.</li>
            <li> on my third pot of this stuff now, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;m sticking with it.</li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t make me a model though :-)</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer for all women, especially as the skin ages.</li>
            <li> Love the silky feel of my face and that the product does not have a perfumy smell.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and love it.  </li>
            <li> I love Philosophy products and decided to pay triple to try</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this produce for 2 years and love it..</li>
            <li> I am over 55 and love how it makes my face feel.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be able to wear it during the day though, because my face gets to oily.  </li>
            <li> but it does tend to lay on top of the skin which gives a dewier (or greasy) appearance and can cause makeup to slide.</li>
            <li> I recommend using a powder foundation with this product rather than a liquid, it seems to stay in place better and helps absorb some of the shine from the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but I recommend that you research and when possible &amp;#34;try before you buy&amp;#34;, to find the products that will work best for you.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay; but makes my face too oily to use  </li>
            <li> My skin looks so mich better and smoother when i use it.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> I USE IT AT NIGHT AND REALLY LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li> Love all things Philosophy, and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I love how it feels when it goes on</li>
            <li> I love the philosophy products, even though I think the brand is quite pricy.</li>
            <li> and i love it.  </li>
            <li> what more could you ask for?  </li>
            <li> I love hop in a jar</li>
            <li> and now I love Miracle worker.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think it is any better than most moisturizers on the market.</li>
            <li> is MUCH better and is definitely the best moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I am sure that this works well for most people.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This product Is great for moisturizing older skin.  </li>
            <li> , it is WELL WORTH the money!!</li>
            <li> Super nice..</li>
            <li> However, it is a really good face cream and it really does make my face look better when I use it.</li>
            <li> It goes on very light and feels cool and refreshing on my skin.</li>
            <li> This lotion feels great when you put it on, but it doesn&#x27;t completely absorb.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many and this is hands down the BEST!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was a great price, cheaper than other more popular online shopping sites and delivery was FAST!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It is rich and creamy and smells lovely.  </li>
            <li> the best of other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Goes on easy over it.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t over-moisturize and cause breakouts, yet the anti-aging ingredients aren&#x27;t so strong that they cause redness or peeling (as i found with Philosophy&#x27;s \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; retinol night treatment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pads are an effective exfoliater and along with this nice souffle-like moisturizer your skin is rejuvinated to reveal bright, resurfaced pink skin!!!  </li>
            <li> it is also more luxuriant, rich, and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I ended up spending more on a tried and true product.  </li>
            <li> after a month of use, my skin is noticeably brighter and clearer, with fewer fine lines around my eyes and mouth.  </li>
            <li> After using this for a week I noticed the fine lines around my eyes &amp; mouth start to disappear.  </li>
            <li> A firmer texture and fine lines are erased...</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey and this is why I turned to Amazon for the best price.</li>
            <li> This  miracle worker cream is great for firming and it goes on so smoothly that your foundation does the same</li>
            <li> Not greasy and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> just at a moisturizer, it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and a longtime philosophy customer and although this is a great product it is not for me.  </li>
            <li> It seems to give my skin a nice glow, makes it feel really hydrated</li>
            <li> My skin looked great, but I felt like it was time to move on to the next step up.  </li>
            <li> The creme goes on smoothly and my foundation.</li>
            <li> , it is light but still does the job.</li>
            <li> There is, however, another product available that works just as well for a fraction of the price, and can be used all over your body as well.  </li>
            <li> Before this product I was using cheap over the counter products.</li>
            <li> WELL, IS SMOOTH GOING ON,</li>
            <li> My aging complexion gets a reprieve each time I smooth this moisturizer on.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and supple .</li>
            <li> the anti aging moisturizer is really nice, very creamy.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling smooth, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I lightly massage a dab of it all over my face and the rest on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin smooth and I wake up with glowing skin.</li>
            <li> and it makes my skin feel so soft and good.  </li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> First let me say that I love Philosophy scents.  </li>
            <li> worth every penny!</li>
            <li> It feels like the elasticity has increased significantly.</li>
            <li> I really like this product as it is a very light cream and goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> ~1/3.&lt;br /&gt;Miracle is a nice consistency but you need more than the tiny amount it states on the bottle</li>
            <li> but it is super rich moisturizing...</li>
            <li> For that price it should have been full.</li>
            <li> my eyes do not sting - this feels more gentle.  </li>
            <li> If you want a moisturizer that only make your skin softer than it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> Beware it&#x27;s true what you&#x27;ve read</li>
            <li> Not heavy at all, but highly effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was returd and IF got a full refund</li>
            <li> Light and easily absorbed into skin.</li>
            <li> if applying too much, your skin will become more &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Hi I did a test between my other cream and did not tell anyone after a week I asked what side of my face looks better and everyone pick the Miracle and time side LOVE IT :)</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer, but I don&#x27;t notice any other benefits from it.  </li>
            <li> I have used other Philosophy Miracle products and have always been happy with the quality of their products.</li>
            <li> I must say the cream keeps my skin soft and smooth and makeup goes on better.</li>
            <li> In the end, if I get that, then I&#x27;m going to be happy as I know that realistically, none of these creams and potions will really take ten years off me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If anyone within my age range, or someone who actually works for Philosophy, could maybe recommend something that is more appropriate for aging skin.  </li>
            <li> It feels luxurious, it absorbs quickly and evenly and you skin feels like velvet afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I love this protect , will highly recommend it</li>
            <li> It is certainly creamy and does a fine job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more of a lotion, than a cream, but goes on smooth &amp; absorbs into skin nicely, takes very little product.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels super soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is a nice step above Hope in a Jar which is what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I received the Miracle Worker cream in sample form and liked it enough to buy the 2 ounce version.</li>
            <li> In the morning my face feels so soft, smooth and well hydrated!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream at night now for about 2 weeks, I love the way it makes my face feel so soft.</li>
            <li> It is well worth it.</li>
            <li> makes me rarely use it.</li>
            <li> Which *most* anti-wrinkle creams I&#x27;ve tried so far seem to only do that (making me more &amp; more timid to try new ones).</li>
            <li> /&gt;i was totally right.  </li>
            <li> Hoping it would be right this time.</li>
            <li> i love the philosophy products, i like the pure and natural scents.</li>
            <li> I bought it because at 23, I was just starting to see some very fine lines around my eyes(I go in the sun a lot).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably go back to using coconut oil until I feel brave enough to try another anti-aging moisturizer, though ive read on line that coconut oil helps reduce wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Always happy with Philosophy products, but will go back to regular Hope in a Jar.  </li>
            <li> But this one is very gentle.</li>
            <li> it also arrived very fast and not damaged.</li>
            <li> very very please with the product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 with porcelain hyper-pale skin (a UV damage nightmare waiting to happen) and I have fine lines under my eyes and very micro fine lines on my forehead starting to form already!(Unfair.)</li>
            <li> but the results are mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> I have tried most lotions and potions and truly feel that these products are intended for younger audiences.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, my face is not the same without it!</li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Works great....easy to use and gentle to skin!</li>
            <li> Goes on so smooth, leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> For day-time use, I have mixed 1/2 of Miracle worker with 1/2 of my favorite face sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> I just finished the first jar and am hooked....</li>
            <li> I will come back for more.</li>
            <li> I bought the 0.5oz size of this product last week and I feel in love with it the after the first use.</li>
            <li> but I highly recommend this as a try!!</li>
            <li> But I like when hope is not enough better and that I use as a day and night cream.&lt;br /&gt;Id</li>
            <li> I have tried many facial lotions in my life from big names and from online with dermatologist formulas and almost all of them have been too oily later in the afternoon, not moisturizing enough so you don&#x27;t feel like you even put it on or there is no difference in how you skin feels - this one is PERFECT.  </li>
            <li> now it leaves my skin soft and helps from drying I also use it before applying my makeup because it helps make it go on smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it more as a preventative measure in my daily routine.</li>
            <li> I have used a couple other Philosophy moisturizers and other brands, but find this works best for me.  </li>
            <li> This seems to be a much more deep moisturizing product</li>
            <li> I have been a fairly faithful Dermalogica user for a few years but just felt my skin needed something a bit richer.  </li>
            <li> It is very watery and runs right out of jar.  </li>
            <li> #34;you smell sooo good.&amp;#34;  Not overpowering, not cheap, just clean and fresh and lovely.  </li>
            <li> I really prefer this moisturizer much more than just the regular jar I bought the first time.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen much if any results yet (which is why I gave only 4 stars), but love the way this moisturizer feels and absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and product was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> and I love that my skin stays moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> Nothing can remove the past wear and tear, but this product gives it a good shot.</li>
            <li> It is very light as well- a true bonus for me because i cannot stand heavy creams on my face.</li>
            <li> If anything, I believe it has helped my acne because many skin experts say moisturizing is a main key in getting rid of acne.</li>
            <li> there is very little if any scent (great for sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> Never again I cant live with out my Philosophy Miracle Worker Anti-Aging Moisturizer, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> if you have dry skin it IS a miracle for sure. ..</li>
            <li> She is very particular about the quality of her makeup.</li>
            <li> I moved to a dry area and I need alittle more moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I certainly don&#x27;t see it doing any &amp;#34;miracles&amp;#34; and will use it until it&#x27;s finished but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> It probably would be better in the fall and winter for very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Google Amazing Grace, formula change, you will likely find my rant along with that of others who smelled the same rat.  </li>
            <li> I am in my early forties AND HAVE SOME noticible smile lines.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.  </li>
            <li> be purchasing more when jar is empty, which won&#x27;t be too soon.</li>
            <li> , this product is an absolute blessing.</li>
            <li> Really like it, i limve in nee england and thd weather</li>
            <li> Who wants to start the trial and error period again.  </li>
            <li> have used this moisturizer for over 2 years and absolutely like it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really seem to make any difference than say my Nivea hand cream.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Before this, I was using coconut oil, which moisturized very well without causing breakouts.</li>
            <li> It really does make a difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I really like this cream</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t change the wrinkle of eyes too much.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I really do like Philosophy products</li>
            <li> Really does improve skin.</li>
            <li> She absolutely swears by it.  </li>
            <li> so mission accomplished.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t deal with breakouts well</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not ready to give up trying anti-wrinkles creams yet...</li>
            <li> this moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> I try other creams, but they never feel as good as this one, so I come back to it.</li>
            <li> I love this because so many moisturizers feel good going on but your skin is dried out in a few hours or less.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way too which is great because I don&#x27;t see myself running out anytime soon.</li>
            <li> I am rating this product as good, not exceptional.</li>
            <li> The results were nice and I usually break out with anything that touches my skin.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t justify spending this kind of money on a small jar of cream, and am happier with the long-term benefits of Skin MD.  </li>
            <li> I did feel mild tingling upon use, but since I have used strong serums in the past that wasn&#x27;t a concern.  </li>
            <li> Glad Amazon carries it, as their price is less than the retail stores.</li>
            <li> Avon&#x27;s Anew is better and costs less.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this to anyone 40 years or older.</li>
            <li> Wish I can get money back because most of my moisturizers last a longer than this.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for 6 years now and many people think I am younger than I actually am, so it must be working.</li>
            <li> so I had high expectations.</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s another high quality product from Philosophy.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this face cream because of the reviews.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a little over a year now and still love it.  </li>
            <li> When I wore Amazing Grace years ago, not one day went by where I did not receive at least two or three people telling me &amp;</li>
            <li> It is not a thick cream, it is quite runny.  </li>
            <li> As a woman in her early 40&#x27;s with dry/normal skin, this really helps minimize those aging signs that are trying to show up.  </li>
            <li> There is a healthy glow I like, but as I said, never oily if I apply less!</li>
            <li> It feels a little greasy at first, but within 20 minutes my skin soaks it right up!  </li>
            <li> and yes I just got my new jar...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This was sold to me as new..</li>
            <li> It also is super moisturizing for my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> it feels very soft and moisture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I usually NEVER try any creams or moisturizers for my face, since I break out every time I try one.</li>
            <li> Willing to purchase again in the future!</li>
            <li> This cream is good -- but it definitely does not work the miracles it claims to.&lt;br /&gt;I would compare it to something which can be found at half the price at the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is good -- but the amount in the jar is not so much --- so if you want to use it on your neck and decollete, expect to run out rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing bad about it --- but it&#x27;s nothing extraordinary either -- just average</li>
            <li> This product gad brough great relief to my tired, dry old dkin!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer fixed my dry skin problem without aggravating my skin in any way, which is rare.</li>
            <li> I cannot afford a face lift, but any of Philosophy Miracle Worker products do make my face look less wrinkly and more younger looking.</li>
            <li> However I only was able to use it for a couple of weeks before my 4 year old got into it and dumped it down the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> With a combination skin, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily or dry, but just right.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a little over 2 weeks and my face feels and looks better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 50 years young</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like getting old.  </li>
            <li> The product line is used by burn victims and friends sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> I also thought at least some of my age spots would be alleviated.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use much, so it will last along time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll write an update when I&#x27;m ready to order my next Miracle Worker.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and moisturized, even in the winter.  </li>
            <li> May be Hype, and no miracles, but after years of use skin feels soft and supple at 70</li>
            <li> The cream was old when it came it was ruuny and discolored&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it that evening and immediately my skin felt really soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and keep coming back to it.  </li>
            <li> NO HARSH RASHES FROM IT AND IS NOT GREASY.  </li>
            <li> Woke it with soft skin~</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, my skin has not cracked or become chapped.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I look really young anyway.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt to start early I guess.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin soft and seems to hide the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy and absorbs well into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Randomly 1 day I read in Sephora.com about Philosophy Miracle Worker and saw the good reviews for this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I on the other hand was expecting not only softer skin but diminished fine lines and wrinkles as Miracle Worker suggested.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little too rich for my eye zone though-</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations for this product and didn&#x27;t feel it lasted very long</li>
            <li> but I feel like it goes too &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34; when the jar is still about half full.  </li>
            <li> The new staff at Philosophy swears it&#x27;s the same product---</li>
            <li> I still gave it 3 stars as I really believe different things work differently on all of us.  </li>
            <li> it caused major puffy eyes in the morning.</li>
            <li> Due to a packing error on my first order of this item, I took a chance and ordered it again.</li>
            <li> I bought a small trial size of philosophy&#x27;s Miracle Worker at Ulta so that I could try it out first before I spent the money for a full size jar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 48 years old and have dry and very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> for the anti-aging component, I really haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I was browsing the trial size display while waiting to checkout and thought i&#x27;d give this product a try, I didnt realize until I got to the register that I was buying a 22.00 dollar trial size moisturizer but in the interest of time I went ahead and finished my purchase, I have NO REGRETS about paying 22 dollars for this product and will continue using it</li>
            <li> I recently started using Miracle Worker and WOW...</li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, I highly recommend you try this.</li>
            <li> It is mild, non irritating, and moisturizes aging skin very well.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and smooth and it isn&#x27;t the least bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful!</li>
            <li> However, I am not sure if I am supposed to be running out of it really quickly?</li>
            <li> For example, most matured women complain about dry skin with the wrinkles and my skin is still very excessively oily from my puberty years.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using it almost a week and not a single pimple.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that Miracle Worker isn&#x27;t available in an SPF formula.  </li>
            <li> I received about $5-$10 off of the original price offered at Philosophy (not much, but any little bit helps).</li>
            <li> In A Jar, i was looking for something a little less greasy and without the strong scent.  </li>
            <li> She said \\&quot;the lines on my face from the night of sleep usually takes awhile to disappear in the morning but after using this they disappear right away\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I have dry, sensitive skin</li>
            <li> At first this product worked well, but after a few applications it actually made my face break out in red patches.</li>
            <li> But fine lines have not gone away or have gotten worse, this I quess comes over time.</li>
            <li> So many brands and such a wide price range, but it&#x27;s very hard to give up a product line you have been using forever.</li>
            <li> Maybe I didnt use this stuff long enough?</li>
            <li> I was worried at first that stinging would mean a breakout or irritated skin, but it did basically nothing.</li>
            <li> This means that the jar doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> But clearly, it needs someone with tougher, less reactive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 60s and have dry skin, especially in winter.</li>
            <li> I believe it makes a good base for foundation because I have noticed my foundation lasting longer.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this product to persons with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Long time customer.</li>
            <li> At $8 a bottle, it lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> MINOR.</li>
            <li> That said, it is still one of my favorite moisterizers for really cold, dry weather.</li>
            <li> I will admit that I have tried other products and always went back to Philosophy&#x27;s Miracle Worker.</li>
            <li> but I have not noticed any other benefits such as firming of the skin or changes in the evenness of skin tone.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again and the other products related to it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it very long</li>
            <li> a very long way,&lt;br /&gt;so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to use at night to see if it makes a difference with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> The consistency is rather greasy but it does help heal dry skin.</li>
            <li> keeps the dry winter skin at bay and the dry flakiness has dissapeared overnight after using this product!</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, think long and hard.  </li>
            <li> after only using it for less than a week, i see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> so I will go back to paying less.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for those with a little less sensitive skin?  </li>
            <li> I would prefer something a little heavier, perhaps, since the moisturizing effect doesn&#x27;t seem to last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> Not really</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try this cream as a makeup base and, yes, it did give me a lovely foundation upon which to apply makeup.  </li>
            <li> This cream stings a bit when you first put it on, and has an awful smell to it; I would have been fine with those aspects</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure; I felt like 3 weeks twice a day would be long enough to notice even a slight change?</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I will never purchase one thing from Philosophy again, and I deleted all my other rave reviews for them.  </li>
            <li> Only have to use a small amount</li>
            <li> Not sure how this anti-ages however I feel my skin looks younger.</li>
            <li> like maybe some ingredients encourage estrogen production and at 22 I&#x27;m bursting at the seams with estrogen and other youthful hormones already</li>
            <li> A little bit of Miracle Worker goes a long way!!  </li>
            <li> They changed the way the products were made by Philosophy, worst of all was the way they changed the formula for Amazing Grace perfume--my signature fragrance for years--and claimed that it was the same.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the jar it was half empty.  </li>
            <li> anti-aging therapy without UV protection feels a little pointless, so i use \\&quot;When Hope Is Not Enough SPF\\&quot; each morning.</li>
            <li> Needless to say not so much.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li> seems ok as a product for skin....but HATE the smell.</li>
            <li> it was more expensive than Hope In A Jar, so i blindly hoped it&#x27;d be a \\&quot;level up\\&quot; in quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have been using this for less than a month, along with the Philosophy serum.  </li>
            <li> In A Jar&amp;#34; by the same brand, but it is not nearly as good.</li>
            <li> It is expensive and does not seem like it is going to last long.</li>
            <li> I found it to be a little too satiny,shiny for daytime use.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned because before I bought it I read people claiming it broke out their skin.</li>
            <li> (I use a little bit of primer on my oily areas</li>
            <li> with the 100+ degree days my skin felt a little oily.</li>
            <li> A little goes</li>
            <li> This product helps with dryness, but yet it&#x27;s not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after a few days.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was an old jar or something wrong with the cream.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to be whipped &amp; firm as the picture indicates</li>
            <li> It is really heavy and greasy.</li>
            <li> It is a heavy moisturizer</li>
            <li> I t has even helped with uneven skin tone.  </li>
            <li> To me, it doesn&#x27;t feel any different than a typical less expensive &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Need very little product for coverage.  </li>
            <li> This one is a little to thick and gooey for me.</li>
            <li> I am not sure that it is supposed to be this way.</li>
            <li> usually use Boots 7 - purchased in Target or online and costs</li>
            <li> and it is not better than Boots</li>
            <li> I bought the smaller size (from ULTA) because it is expensive</li>
            <li> Not sure about the Anti- Aging Effects</li>
            <li> Not sure where the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; is....</li>
            <li> The seal was broken and it was a mess.</li>
            <li> So maybe I have an allergy to a common ingredient in anti-aging creams, maybe it has something to do with my youth:</li>
            <li> It is kinda thick but blends in well</li>
            <li> I live in MA, and it is very cold in the winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I received a sample and upon testing a small amount behind my ear</li>
            <li> I was desperate for dry skin help aggravated by having the heat running for winter.  </li>
            <li> Ridiculously ineffective.  </li>
            <li> my skin has become worse.  </li>
            <li> I tried this a few times and it seemed to make the wrinkles worsen (get deeper &amp; multiply), so I am afraid to continue use.</li>
            <li> provides no moisture to my dry skin and never helped with any wrinkles :(</li>
            <li> I am not stating they are bad, but I think my skin needed a little something</li>
            <li> Very tired of all the false skin care claims.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with philosophy.  </li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this moisterizer.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will not order this item again.</li>
            <li> Sorry, Philosophy, but you&#x27;ve priced yourself beyond my budget!</li>
            <li> However, I found it a bit greasy and it had a rather unpleasant scent.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a bad product</li>
            <li> Painful.</li>
            <li> It did not :(</li>
            <li> like this stuff, and even though it is expensive, I will probably order it again!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
            <li> and it allows for an even base without over drying.</li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed in philosophy with this product.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED as I paid a lot of money for this cream</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever bought on amazon.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I opened the jar it was half empty.  For that price it should have been full.</li>
            <li> I do not like the consistency. It is runny and drippy. Will not buy again. I am not sure that it is supposed to be this way.</li>
            <li> very disappointed. I did not know I was going to get 4 jars that were .5 oz each</li>
            <li> I do not think I&#x27;ll buy this again.  I am underwhelmed with this product.  My skin does not look or feel any better.  I use a lot of Philosophy products so I had high expectations.</li>
            <li> Good cream......but the results are mediocre at best.I used this cream as a day and night cream and was not overwhelmed with the results.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give miracle a try- after 12 weeks I was hoping for a miracle. Needless to say not so much. I am in my early forties AND HAVE SOME noticible smile lines. I must say the cream keeps my skin soft and smooth and makeup goes on better. But fine lines have not gone away or have gotten worse, this I quess comes over time. Let&#x27;s face it If I want a miracle I will need to resort to drastic measures. I have tried most lotions and potions and truly feel that these products are intended for younger audiences. I will continue to use the product along with the serum and when I save enough money I will get some juvadem!!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Though I love, love, love, Hope In A Jar, Miracle Worker just didn&#x27;t work for me.  If you have sensitive skin, think long and hard.  It is rich and creamy and smells lovely.  For myself, it caused a reaction:  red, flushed and sore skin.  I wish you well; for others it delivers, but for me, I&#x27;ll stick with what I (now) know.</li>
            <li> I love this as a nighttime moisturizer. I found it to be a little too satiny,shiny for daytime use. My skin looks and feels super soft and healthy.  It&#x27;s a little too rich for my eye zone though- it caused major puffy eyes in the morning. All in all, it&#x27;s another high quality product from Philosophy.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer, my face is not the same without it! I am 34  and I have been using this product for about 5 months and 1 of those months I was without it. My grandmother who is 68 also uses this and says her skin feels like the elasticity is better. She said \\&quot;the lines on my face from the night of sleep usually takes awhile to disappear in the morning but after using this they disappear right away\\&quot;. I could tell the difference in my face as well, after 2 weeks without it, it just wasn&#x27;t the same! It helps the tone, texture and softness on my face and parts of my body (I use it on my upper back &amp; sometimes upper arms). It is a little pricey and this is why I turned to Amazon for the best price. I received about $5-$10 off of the original price offered at Philosophy (not much, but any little bit helps). I get compliments all the time on my skin and since using this product they can&#x27;t help to notice my glow! Worth it!</li>
            <li> leaves a sticky film and makes my face flush.  I&#x27;m going to use at night to see if it makes a difference with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I was desperate for dry skin help aggravated by having the heat running for winter.  Nothing worked until this.  I am a convert to this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using Philosophy and everything that I&#x27;ve tried I&#x27;ve loved.  I will only use Philosophy from now on.  The price on Amazon was great!</li>
            <li> Very nice product, I will buy again.  Not greasy and goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion.  It is kinda thick but blends in well and I can actually tell a difference in using it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.  Yes, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer, but I don&#x27;t notice any other benefits from it.  In fact, since I began using this and the night serum my skin has become worse.  And I never had a problem with pimples before using this.  Definately won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I usually NEVER try any creams or moisturizers for my face, since I break out every time I try one. But this one is very gentle. I have only been using it for a little over 2 weeks and my face feels and looks better. It seems to be tighter and smoother too. I have even been putting it on the tops of my hands and I have noticed that they look smoother also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great price, cheaper than other more popular online shopping sites and delivery was FAST!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be purchasing more when jar is empty, which won&#x27;t be too soon. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> after going through about three jars of Hope In A Jar, i was looking for something a little less greasy and without the strong scent.  after perusing Sephora&#x27;s display, i purchased a jar of Miracle Worker.  it was more expensive than Hope In A Jar, so i blindly hoped it&#x27;d be a \\&quot;level up\\&quot; in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was totally right.  there is no scent and my eyes do not sting - this feels more gentle.  it is also more luxuriant, rich, and smooth.  after a month of use, my skin is noticeably brighter and clearer, with fewer fine lines around my eyes and mouth.  i am thirty years old and this is the best thing i&#x27;ve found since Estee Lauder discontinued their Prescriptives line (i loved their Super Line Preventer serum).  my skin is normal/combination and this works wonderfully as my nighttime moisturizer.  it doesn&#x27;t over-moisturize and cause breakouts, yet the anti-aging ingredients aren&#x27;t so strong that they cause redness or peeling (as i found with Philosophy&#x27;s \\&quot;Help Me\\&quot; retinol night treatment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my only complaint is that Miracle Worker isn&#x27;t available in an SPF formula.  anti-aging therapy without UV protection feels a little pointless, so i use \\&quot;When Hope Is Not Enough SPF\\&quot; each morning.</li>
            <li> I am a regular user of philosophy products.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with philosophy.  It visibly adds a glow to your skin.</li>
            <li> Always use this product</li>
            <li> I like the texture and I feel younger.  Have used this product for last two years.</li>
            <li> After having had patches of skin on my face literally burned by the toxic junk Cindy Crawford hocks on TV, this product is an absolute blessing. I received a sample and upon testing a small amount behind my ear (yes, Cindy traumatized me), I gave it shot. This is, by far the best moisturizer I have ever tried. It goes on very light and feels cool and refreshing on my skin. The best part about it is that it is not at all greasy. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff.    I haven&#x27;t been using it very long so I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve experienced and anti-aging benefits but, just at a moisturizer, it is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Philosophy was purchased a while back by Coty...as a result, I will no longer be a customer.  They changed the way the products were made by Philosophy, worst of all was the way they changed the formula for Amazing Grace perfume--my signature fragrance for years--and claimed that it was the same.  If I could file a class-action lawsuit for that lie, I would.  Google Amazing Grace, formula change, you will likely find my rant along with that of others who smelled the same rat.  Literally.  The new staff at Philosophy swears it&#x27;s the same product---except it&#x27;s not.  When I wore Amazing Grace years ago, not one day went by where I did not receive at least two or three people telling me &amp;#34;you smell sooo good.&amp;#34;  Not overpowering, not cheap, just clean and fresh and lovely.  I will never purchase one thing from Philosophy again, and I deleted all my other rave reviews for them.  I don&#x27;t like being lied to.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s so light and smooth.  My skin glows.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> Really like it, i limve in nee england and thd weather this einter had bern fierce! This product gad brough great relief to my tired, dry old dkin!😊</li>
            <li> It is a good moisturizer; it is not greasy.</li>
            <li> This product is truly a miracle! after only using it for less than a week, i see a difference in my skin. The wrinkles have diminished, and my complexion just seems fresher. It is very light as well- a true bonus for me because i cannot stand heavy creams on my face.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer - I have really noticed changes in my skin since using this.  Will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy products. This moisturizer is a nice step above Hope in a Jar which is what I was looking for. My skin looked great. However I only was able to use it for a couple of weeks before my 4 year old got into it and dumped it down the bathroom sink.</li>
            <li> What is the purpose of a daytime moisturizer without SPF?</li>
            <li> Excellent product for anti-aging issues.  Delivery was fast and product was exactly as advertised. Would recommend this to anyone 40 years or older.</li>
            <li> Works great....easy to use and gentle to skin!</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 50&#x27;s and a longtime philosophy customer and although this is a great product it is not for me.  For me, nothing compared to hope in a jar.  Why did I give it 4-stars?  Because it is Philosophy and are the best of the best.  Hope in a jar, provides moisturizers my face all day, so why Chang something that works so well for me.</li>
            <li> I was hoping from the description that it would not leave a film on my face.  I have to sleep with an air mask and it sticks to the moisturizer so I can only use it in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to lie to you, this is NOT a miracle and you won&#x27;t find yourself quitting your job after you start it to become a top model. However, it is a really good face cream and it really does make my face look better when I use it. It seems to give my skin a nice glow, makes it feel really hydrated and I like the way it feels. In the end, if I get that, then I&#x27;m going to be happy as I know that realistically, none of these creams and potions will really take ten years off me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my third pot of this stuff now, it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found, and I&#x27;m sticking with it. Shame it can&#x27;t make me a model though :-)</li>
            <li> This is the worst product I have ever bought on amazon.  It is very watery and runs right out of jar.  There is no consistency to it.  Wish I can get money back because most of my moisturizers last a longer than this.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer for all women, especially as the skin ages. It feels like silk going on my face.  It absorbs without leaving a greasy or sticky feeling</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 65 and started with the Hope is Not Enough line.  I probably used it for about 10 years.  My skin looked great, but I felt like it was time to move on to the next step up.  I like the miracle line, and the moisturizer is really nice but I feel like it goes too &amp;#34;runny&amp;#34; when the jar is still about half full.  If anyone within my age range, or someone who actually works for Philosophy, could maybe recommend something that is more appropriate for aging skin.  So many brands and such a wide price range, but it&#x27;s very hard to give up a product line you have been using forever. Who wants to start the trial and error period again.  Suggestions please.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product about 6 months ago and just love it!!!!  Love the silky feel of my face and that the product does not have a perfumy smell.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST mouisturizer EVER.. I have used this for years and love it.  You can feel the tingle on your skin when you put it on.. Super nice..</li>
            <li> I like this product for 40 plus skin. It is mild, non irritating, and moisturizes aging skin very well. I try other creams, but they never feel as good as this one, so I come back to it. Glad Amazon carries it, as their price is less than the retail stores.</li>
            <li> Best Moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this moisturizer for over 2 years and absolutely like it the best of other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> and its all do to Philosophy products. This  miracle worker cream is great for firming and it goes on so smoothly that your foundation does the same</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now. I&#x27;m 50 years young and I have seen a big difference in my skin. This product helps with dryness, but yet it&#x27;s not greasy or heavy. I wouldn&#x27;t go without it.</li>
            <li> After using this for a week I noticed the fine lines around my eyes &amp; mouth start to disappear.  I had this wonderful glow and got tons of compliments from co-workers.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Quality product--love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this is a great moisturizer. However, I found it a bit greasy and it had a rather unpleasant scent. I stopped using it after a few days.</li>
            <li> I love Philosophy products and decided to pay triple to try Miracle.&lt;br /&gt;I usually use Boots 7 - purchased in Target or online and costs ~1/3.&lt;br /&gt;Miracle is a nice consistency but you need more than the tiny amount it states on the bottle and it is not better than Boots so I will go back to paying less.</li>
            <li> Hi I did a test between my other cream and did not tell anyone after a week I asked what side of my face looks better and everyone pick the Miracle and time side LOVE IT :)</li>
            <li> I was browsing the trial size display while waiting to checkout and thought i&#x27;d give this product a try, I didnt realize until I got to the register that I was buying a 22.00 dollar trial size moisturizer but in the interest of time I went ahead and finished my purchase, I have NO REGRETS about paying 22 dollars for this product and will continue using it, it is WELL WORTH the money!! I get compliments on my skin all the time.  If your looking for an excellent moisturizer this is for you, its worth splurging on!</li>
            <li> I have heard a lot about philosophy and I did not believe it until I have tried it. This product exceeds my expectations. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this because so many moisturizers feel good going on but your skin is dried out in a few hours or less.  Or it makes your skin too oily and causes breakouts.  This is perfect-no breakouts, no shine, and my skin feels great.  The one beauty product I splurge on!</li>
            <li> I received the Miracle Worker cream in sample form and liked it enough to buy the 2 ounce version. It is certainly creamy and does a fine job of moisturizing. I like that there is very little if any scent (great for sensitive skin). I would prefer something a little heavier, perhaps, since the moisturizing effect doesn&#x27;t seem to last throughout the day. For normal-to-oily skin, however, it&#x27;s a good option.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 60s and have dry skin, especially in winter. I bought a small trial size of philosophy&#x27;s Miracle Worker at Ulta so that I could try it out first before I spent the money for a full size jar. As soon as this starts to run out, I&#x27;ll buy the full size from Amazon because it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!!  I put it on my face and neck at night after I use Philosophy&#x27;s facial cleanser. A little bit of Miracle Worker goes a long way!!  It feels a little greasy at first, but within 20 minutes my skin soaks it right up!  In the morning my face feels so soft, smooth and well hydrated!  If you have dry skin, I highly recommend you try this. I don&#x27;t recommend it for oily skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizing creme I have ever used.  It is expensive but you don&#x27;t have to use much.</li>
            <li> I was not impressed with this moisterizer. To me, it doesn&#x27;t feel any different than a typical less expensive &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; brand.  The consistency is rather greasy but it does help heal dry skin. I certainly don&#x27;t see it doing any &amp;#34;miracles&amp;#34; and will use it until it&#x27;s finished but will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I swear by this!!  the best stuff ever ....if you have dry skin it IS a miracle for sure. ..</li>
            <li> Love it. It&#x27;s spendy though.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really seem to make any difference than say my Nivea hand cream. Just an overpriced doing nothing kinda cream don&#x27;t wa  set your money on this one.&lt;br /&gt;Update dec 2014&lt;br /&gt;months later...i&#x27;ve been using this again....without any effect.  the product goes on my face and just sits there....provides no moisture to my dry skin and never helped with any wrinkles :(</li>
            <li> Need very little product for coverage.  Seems to work nicely.  Not greasy and disappears into my skin.  Good product.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this product as it is a very light cream and goes on smoothly.  Does it lessen my lines?  Not really but I feel as if I am doing my skin a favor.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I have dry, sensitive skin and it makes my skin feel so soft and good.  I believe it has minimized my lines and wrinkles, too, and I am 75 years old.&lt;br /&gt;Laura</li>
            <li> The creme goes on smoothly and my foundation. Goes on easy over it. It makes your skin glow. Only have to use a small amount</li>
            <li> I would never use anything else on my face.  I have been using this produce for 2 years and love it.. I will admit that I have tried other products and always went back to Philosophy&#x27;s Miracle Worker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 2 time grandma and a 6 time marathoner.  I don&#x27;t like getting old.  Love this moisturizer!  The product line is used by burn victims and friends sensitive to fragrances.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this face cream because of the reviews. I bought it because at 23, I was just starting to see some very fine lines around my eyes(I go in the sun a lot). This cream(based on reviews) seemed like a great option to try out. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now, and I see 0 difference. Before this, I was using coconut oil, which moisturized very well without causing breakouts. This cream stings a bit when you first put it on, and has an awful smell to it; I would have been fine with those aspects had the cream actually made a difference in my skin. It did not :( I was worried at first that stinging would mean a breakout or irritated skin, but it did basically nothing. It was a waste of money. It didn&#x27;t seem to even moisturize that well. It kind of just sat on top of my skin. I&#x27;ll probably go back to using coconut oil until I feel brave enough to try another anti-aging moisturizer, though ive read on line that coconut oil helps reduce wrinkles. Maybe I didnt use this stuff long enough? I&#x27;m not sure; I felt like 3 weeks twice a day would be long enough to notice even a slight change?</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for my skin.  I am over 55 and love how it makes my face feel.  Don&#x27;t need a lot and my face feels softer after using it.  Only use once a day which is in the evening after I was my face when coming home from work after taking that all day make-up off.  Face looks refreshed in the morning.</li>
            <li> If you want a moisturizer that only make your skin softer than it&#x27;s a good buy. I on the other hand was expecting not only softer skin but diminished fine lines and wrinkles as Miracle Worker suggested. I also thought at least some of my age spots would be alleviated. But that hasn&#x27;t occurred either. I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I used to use Elizabeth Arden Visible Difference and it works good to me. Randomly 1 day I read in Sephora.com about Philosophy Miracle Worker and saw the good reviews for this moisturizer. I made it a try and I didn&#x27;t have to regret. Although I don&#x27;t like the smell and it&#x27;s a bit oily for my oily skin, but I can feel the result after only 4 days. My skin is smoother, brighter. I&#x27;ll keep continue using this guy and see its result of anti-aging.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It really does make a difference in my skin.  I use it in the evening after I&#x27;ve washed all of my makeup off.  After a few days of use my skin is much healthier and younger looking.</li>
            <li> At first this product worked well, but after a few applications it actually made my face break out in red patches. Painful. Had to discontinue this product.  Very disappointed in philosophy with this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream, it is light but still does the job. However, I am not sure if I am supposed to be running out of it really quickly? It is expensive and does not seem like it is going to last long.</li>
            <li> Perfect product even for those with oily skin. No breakout! Not sure how this anti-ages however I feel my skin looks younger.</li>
            <li> The seal was broken and it was a mess. The product had coated the bottle. I&#x27;m still using it because I dont believe in wasting it however I will be searching a different way to purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my friends n myself. it feels very soft and moisture. it doesn&#x27;t change the wrinkle of eyes too much. but I could use it day and night. I used before the make up.</li>
            <li> Was not like what I had purchased in sephora stores . Greasy and a different color and consistency . Wish I had believed the reviews that said this before Made a $40 purchase. Beware it&#x27;s true what you&#x27;ve read</li>
            <li> Due to a packing error on my first order of this item, I took a chance and ordered it again. Hoping it would be right this time. My second order came to me packed well, but the cream itself was yellow, watery and grainy. I don&#x27;t know if it was an old jar or something wrong with the cream. Needless to say, I will not order this item again. I will buy it where I have a return policy..</li>
            <li> I love this product. Goes on so smooth, leaves my skin soft. Will continue to purchase this product.  I don&#x27;t have to use much, so it will last along time.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for less than a month, along with the Philosophy serum.  Haven&#x27;t seen much if any results yet (which is why I gave only 4 stars), but love the way this moisturizer feels and absorbs into the skin.  For day-time use, I have mixed 1/2 of Miracle worker with 1/2 of my favorite face sunscreen.  I&#x27;ll write an update when I&#x27;m ready to order my next Miracle Worker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product nightly for 2 weeks and my skin is softer as promised, however its too short of a time frame to know if it will do everything as promised.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I love Philosophy scents.  I really wanted to like this product.  Tried it for 3 months, but just couldn&#x27;t keep using it.  I&#x27;m 48 years old and have dry and very sensitive skin.  The product didn&#x27;t bother my skin, which is why I kept using it.  However, the moisturizer just didn&#x27;t seem to &#x27;moisturize&#x27;.  It is not a thick cream, it is quite runny.  I had to use alot to feel like my face was properly covered.  This means that the jar doesn&#x27;t last very long.  Gave this product 3 stars because it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I just finished the first jar and am hooked.... I can&#x27;t believe this does what it says, it brightens the skin and helps with complexion and tone... Great product, and yes I just got my new jar... I use it in the morning before work and before I go to bed.... It has done wonders to my skin.</li>
            <li> I only wish it had an SPF!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE Philosphy&#x27;s Miracle Worker Skin Care Line!  As a woman in her early 40&#x27;s with dry/normal skin, this really helps minimize those aging signs that are trying to show up.  It also is super moisturizing for my dry skin.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin soft and moisturized, even in the winter.  I&#x27;ve been using this line of products for six months or so - I used it before and switched to something else.  I ended up switching back.  It&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream at night now for about 2 weeks, I love the way it makes my face feel so soft. I wouldn&#x27;t be able to wear it during the day though, because my face gets to oily.  Don&#x27;t expect it to be whipped &amp; firm as the picture indicates, it&#x27;s more of a lotion, than a cream, but goes on smooth &amp; absorbs into skin nicely, takes very little product.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a bad product but  I didn&#x27;t see any results from it. It is really heavy and greasy. I prefer Skinceuticals emollient cream.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but due to the retinol it contains may not be the best for people needing sensative skin care products (hope in a jar better in that case).</li>
            <li> Although it is not the absolute best I have ever used it is very good. I would only recommend this product to persons with very dry skin. It is what it says... a... MOISTURIZER. It is very light but it does tend to lay on top of the skin which gives a dewier (or greasy) appearance and can cause makeup to slide. I recommend using a powder foundation with this product rather than a liquid, it seems to stay in place better and helps absorb some of the shine from the moisturizer. My skin does appear smoother while I am wearing the moisturizer but I have not noticed any other benefits such as firming of the skin or changes in the evenness of skin tone. I really do like Philosophy products but I recommend that you research and when possible &amp;#34;try before you buy&amp;#34;, to find the products that will work best for you.</li>
            <li> I have tried many and this is hands down the BEST! I wish Amazon hadn&#x27;t canceled their subscription service for this cream! It is a wonderful consistency and gives dewy moisture to your skin. Not heavy at all, but highly effective. I use it as both a day and night cream.</li>
            <li> Have noticed smaller pores and have had NO BREAKOUTS since beginning use of this product.  It is a heavy moisturizer so you may not like it if that puts you off.  This is the best anti-aging moisturizer for my skin that I have used.</li>
            <li> good product and it did everythng they said it would do. it also arrived very fast and not damaged. at all</li>
            <li> May be Hype, and no miracles, but after years of use skin feels soft and supple at 70</li>
            <li> Seems to be working well.  I have used other Philosophy Miracle products and have always been happy with the quality of their products.</li>
            <li> Love this. Really does improve skin. Will order more soon!</li>
            <li> I like the product and it&#x27;s a great moisturiser but it really too costly for an everyday cream and it has no sunscreen</li>
            <li> This product Is great for moisturizing older skin.  It isn&#x27;t perfumie and seems to work just great.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> very very please with the product...love Philosophy products!  Will get this product again!  I love Amazon.  Would recommend buying from them to anyone!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay; but makes my face too oily to use  so I use it on my chest &amp; prefer TNS Essential for my face.</li>
            <li> The results were nice and I usually break out with anything that touches my skin.  It made my skin glow.</li>
            <li> The cream was old when it came it was ruuny and discolored&lt;br /&gt;It was returd and IF got a full refund</li>
            <li> This is some of the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever found! All their products I have been happy with! Long time customer.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this for years.  She absolutely swears by it.  I wouldn&#x27;t know, but she looks beautiful, so I won&#x27;t disagree with her.  She is very particular about the quality of her makeup.</li>
            <li> Very tired of all the false skin care claims.  Ridiculously ineffective.  I would not recommend for skin over 40 yrs</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try this cream as a makeup base and, yes, it did give me a lovely foundation upon which to apply makeup.  There is, however, another product available that works just as well for a fraction of the price, and can be used all over your body as well.  It&#x27;s call Skin MD and can be purchased here on Amazon or elsewhere.  At $8 a bottle, it lasts for a long time.  You only need a few drops. I&#x27;ve used Philosophy products for quite a while but I can&#x27;t justify spending this kind of money on a small jar of cream, and am happier with the long-term benefits of Skin MD.  Sorry, Philosophy, but you&#x27;ve priced yourself beyond my budget!</li>
            <li> This is my second jar and I don&#x27;t want to be without it.  It is a wonderful product.  I will come back for more.</li>
            <li> I bought the 0.5oz size of this product last week and I feel in love with it the after the first use. I bought the smaller size (from ULTA) because it is expensive and I wanted to make sure I liked it before blowing $60 on a moisturizer. I was a little concerned because before I bought it I read people claiming it broke out their skin. I have oily/acne prone skin and I use a lot of harsh/drying products (like salicylic acid and benzyl peroxide). I used it that evening and immediately my skin felt really soft and hydrated. It literally feels like I&#x27;m rubbing butter on my face. I have been using it almost a week and not a single pimple. If anything, I believe it has helped my acne because many skin experts say moisturizing is a main key in getting rid of acne. Before this product I was using cheap over the counter products. I am not stating they are bad, but I think my skin needed a little something more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read on here some people saying it makes their skin shiny looking. It does not have this effect on me. I believe it makes a good base for foundation because I have noticed my foundation lasting longer. (I use a little bit of primer on my oily areas also).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course everyone has different skin and different products react differently but I highly recommend this as a try!!</li>
            <li> Best night cream ever!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and keep coming back to it.  My skin looks so mich better and smoother when i use it. The only deterrent is the price.</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer. It probably would be better in the fall and winter for very dry skin. with the 100+ degree days my skin felt a little oily.</li>
            <li> You can see improvement in feel and texture of the skin. I t has even helped with uneven skin tone.  Great product.  It is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this moisturizer.  Started using it when Prescriptives stopped making their &amp;#34;all you need&amp;#34;.  I have definitely become a &amp;#34;Philosophy&amp;#34; customer and as always Amazon delivers it on time and packaged well</li>
            <li> I had higher expectations for this product and didn&#x27;t feel it lasted very long which makes it even more expensive.</li>
            <li> THIS MOISTERIZER IS OUT OF SIGHT.  I ABSOLULTELY LOVE IT.  IT WORKS WELL, IS SMOOTH GOING ON, NO HARSH RASHES FROM IT AND IS NOT GREASY.  I USE IT AT NIGHT AND REALLY LOVE THE WAY MY SKIN FEELS AND LOOKS</li>
            <li> Ive used this in conjunction with the Miracle Worker Retinol pads. Not sure about the Anti- Aging Effects but it is a great moisturizer! goes on kinda greasy but after a while it seeps into your skin. Woke it with soft skin~ so mission accomplished. I loved it But I like when hope is not enough better and that I use as a day and night cream.&lt;br /&gt;Id still recommend this one tho.&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I can tell you that I LOVE this moisturizer! I have tried lots of brands and hey, at 50, I need the moisture - this is the best. My skin feels soft and smooth and it isn&#x27;t the least bit greasy.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Again, have been usung for 2-3 weeks, and don&#x27;t see any benefits yet.  Will give it another 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  Use it day and night.  Does not leave a greasy feeling.  Use in conjunction with sunscreen and it works great!</li>
            <li> Love all things Philosophy, and this is no exception. Light and easily absorbed into skin. worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Best moisturizer I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer I will use.  I have been using it for about 10 years.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> My aging complexion gets a reprieve each time I smooth this moisturizer on. Nothing can remove the past wear and tear, but this product gives it a good shot.</li>
            <li> This was sold to me as new.. It came with no box, the container was scratched and the moisture cream was a different color than the one that I bought at the cosmetic counter ( it was darker than the moisture cream that I bought at the department store cosmetic counter). VERY DISAPPOINTED as I paid a lot of money for this cream and it was not as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have tried many facial lotions in my life from big names and from online with dermatologist formulas and almost all of them have been too oily later in the afternoon, not moisturizing enough so you don&#x27;t feel like you even put it on or there is no difference in how you skin feels - this one is PERFECT.  It feels luxurious, it absorbs quickly and evenly and you skin feels like velvet afterwards.  I do not get the afternoon shine.  It really feels like wonderful antioxidants and moisturizers for you skin.  I will now use this one forever</li>
            <li> This lotion feels great when you put it on, but it doesn&#x27;t completely absorb.  That said, it is still one of my favorite moisterizers for really cold, dry weather.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything it claimed... didn&#x27;t moisturize well, didn&#x27;t help prevent wrinkles, and didn&#x27;t lift.  Not sure where the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; is....</li>
            <li> I have been using Hope in a Jar for over 10 years and it has done wonders for my skin. I recently started using Miracle Worker and WOW... My skin feels smooth and supple . It feels like the elasticity has increased significantly. I love how it feels when it goes on and I love that my skin stays moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> I love the philosophy products, even though I think the brand is quite pricy.</li>
            <li> I love this protect , will highly recommend it</li>
            <li> i love the philosophy products, i like the pure and natural scents. the anti aging moisturizer is really nice, very creamy.  you only need a little bit. i use it every day and i love it.  i would recommend this to anybody who cares about their skin as they age.</li>
            <li> I live in MA, and it is very cold in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;So far, my skin has not cracked or become chapped.&lt;br /&gt;I like this stuff, and even though it is expensive, I will probably order it again!!</li>
            <li> Always happy with Philosophy products, but will go back to regular Hope in a Jar.  This one is a little to thick and gooey for me.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer in conjuction with the Miracle Worker Retnoid Pads deliver a \\&quot;one-two punch system\\&quot; that works on your face overnight while you sleep.  When you wake up and wash your face be so pleased when you look in the mirror!!!  The pads are an effective exfoliater and along with this nice souffle-like moisturizer your skin is rejuvinated to reveal bright, resurfaced pink skin!!!  A firmer texture and fine lines are erased...what more could you ask for?  What are you waiting for???  Order this product now!  You&#x27;ll be glad you did!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see the results I was looking for..</li>
            <li> I have been using the miracle worker for a year now it leaves my skin soft and helps from drying I also use it before applying my makeup because it helps make it go on smooth. Amazon has the best pricing on it,.</li>
            <li> I have been using Philosophy for about a year now, I ran out of my Moisturizer and tried another brand .... Never again I cant live with out my Philosophy Miracle Worker Anti-Aging Moisturizer, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> My wife uses this product and she swears by it</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Great product. Willing to purchase again in the future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this at night after washing my face with Purity. It leaves my skin feeling smooth, but not greasy. A little bit goes a long way too which is great because I don&#x27;t see myself running out anytime soon. My face gets oily. Using this product seems to keep the oiliness at bay. I can tell my face is not deprived of moisture. I lightly massage a dab of it all over my face and the rest on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the anti-aging component, I really haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any difference. Also, I&#x27;m still in my twenties and I look really young anyway. I&#x27;m using it more as a preventative measure in my daily routine. It doesn&#x27;t hurt to start early I guess.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong!! I can tell a big difference in my skin from using this.</li>
            <li> This is the face moisturizer for me.  I have used a couple other Philosophy moisturizers and other brands, but find this works best for me.  With a combination skin, it doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily or dry, but just right.  And smoothest skin.  I recommend this to all, though a word about applying it... if applying too much, your skin will become more &amp;#34;oily&amp;#34;.  There is a healthy glow I like, but as I said, never oily if I apply less!</li>
            <li> I have heard so many wonderful things about the Philosophy skin care line that I was maybe overly enthusiastic about this purchase?  I have been a fairly faithful Dermalogica user for a few years but just felt my skin needed something a bit richer.  I am 40 and have a nice complexion... until I tried this product.  2 weeks in my skin looked irritated.  I did feel mild tingling upon use, but since I have used strong serums in the past that wasn&#x27;t a concern.  But then came the breakouts.  I really don&#x27;t deal with breakouts well (who does?) so after giving it another week, I had to put it away... permanently.  Maybe it works for those with a little less sensitive skin?  But for me, I had to make a change to something different.  I still gave it 3 stars as I really believe different things work differently on all of us.  It had a nice texture and my skin felt moisturized and not too greasy.  But clearly, it needs someone with tougher, less reactive skin.</li>
            <li> I really prefer this moisturizer much more than just the regular jar I bought the first time. This seems to be a much more deep moisturizing product and I will order it again when needed.</li>
            <li> Philosophy is terrific</li>
            <li> Excellent product really softens the skin.</li>
            <li> seems ok as a product for skin....but HATE the smell. makes me rarely use it.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, that I cannot be without.&lt;br /&gt;I can tell an instant difference on my complexion when I apply Miracle Worker Anti-Aging.&lt;br /&gt;Actually, I dab a teeny bit on in the morning, and then again at night. A little goes a very long way,&lt;br /&gt;so don&#x27;t over-apply.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 with porcelain hyper-pale skin (a UV damage nightmare waiting to happen) and I have fine lines under my eyes and very micro fine lines on my forehead starting to form already!(Unfair.) I tried this a few times and it seemed to make the wrinkles worsen (get deeper &amp; multiply), so I am afraid to continue use. Which *most* anti-wrinkle creams I&#x27;ve tried so far seem to only do that (making me more &amp; more timid to try new ones). So maybe I have an allergy to a common ingredient in anti-aging creams, maybe it has something to do with my youth: like maybe some ingredients encourage estrogen production and at 22 I&#x27;m bursting at the seams with estrogen and other youthful hormones already so I&#x27;m getting a counter effect -- I don&#x27;t know!!  &#x3D;(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I know my youthful skin does have a different chemistry. For example, most matured women complain about dry skin with the wrinkles and my skin is still very excessively oily from my puberty years.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not ready to give up trying anti-wrinkles creams yet... MUST. ERASE. ALL. MINOR. IMPERFECTIONS.</li>
            <li> I moved to a dry area and I need alittle more moisturizer. I love hop in a jar and now I love Miracle worker.</li>
            <li> I am rating this product as good, not exceptional. It is a great moisturizer but I don&#x27;t think it is any better than most moisturizers on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 and have very sensitive skin. I also have rosacea on my cheeks. This moisturizer fixed my dry skin problem without aggravating my skin in any way, which is rare. It leaves my skin smooth and I wake up with glowing skin. I am now using &amp;#34;Hope In A Jar&amp;#34; by the same brand, but it is not nearly as good. I ordered &amp;#34;hope&amp;#34; because it had really good reviews and it was cheaper, but don&#x27;t be fooled &amp;#34;Miracle Worker&amp;#34; is MUCH better and is definitely the best moisturizer I have ever used. I will be ordering it again once I&#x27;m done with &amp;#34;Hope In A Jar.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I cannot afford a face lift, but any of Philosophy Miracle Worker products do make my face look less wrinkly and more younger looking. I have been wearing this for 6 years now and many people think I am younger than I actually am, so it must be working. I also like how it nourishes my face.</li>
            <li> Good, but Avon&#x27;s Anew is better and costs less.</li>
            <li> Have used all of the Philosophy products for about 2 1/2 years and would NOT stop.</li>
            <li> It is a good product, but I needed something with more moisture.  I ended up spending more on a tried and true product.  I am sure that this works well for most people.</li>
            <li> this moisturizes really well. the price is cheaper on amazon even with the added next day shipping price. keeps the dry winter skin at bay and the dry flakiness has dissapeared overnight after using this product! great buy, but it is super rich moisturizing... although with my combination skin it still works i put it under my make up primer and it allows for an even base without over drying.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a little over a year now and still love it.  Makes your skin soft and seems to hide the wrinkles.  The price couldn&#x27;t be beat and received it way before the estimated delivery.</li>
            <li> This cream is good -- but it definitely does not work the miracles it claims to.&lt;br /&gt;I would compare it to something which can be found at half the price at the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is good -- but the amount in the jar is not so much --- so if you want to use it on your neck and decollete, expect to run out rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing bad about it --- but it&#x27;s nothing extraordinary either -- just average</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  It&#x27;s not heavy and absorbs well into the skin.  I would buy it again and the other products related to it.</li>
