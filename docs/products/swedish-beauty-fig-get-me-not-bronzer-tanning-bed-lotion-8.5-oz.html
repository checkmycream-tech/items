            <li>and I just love the scent!!</li>
            <li>It smells great when you are putting it on, but after tanning its not as pleasant.</li>

            <li>:)  Great!  </li>
            <li>Item has a good sent and was a great deal on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>The scent stays pleasant even after tanning.  </li>
            <li>very fair skinned and most tanning lotions with a bronzer give me that orange glow which everyone dreads.  </li>
            <li>Smells so good and bronzes without streaks.</li>
            <li>and it also is a good mosterizer</li>
            <li>I have fair skin.</li>
            <li>Always loved this.</li>
            <li>Works great and fabulous smell!</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this lotion!  </li>
            <li>I was hooked the first time I used it, and the smell is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin almost immediately and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Great lotion for cheap price.</li>
            <li>Gives amazing color every time.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing</li>
            <li>No streaking, smells amazing.</li>
            <li>The price on Amazon is amazing compared to the 50 dollars I ended up spending in the store, which is why I ordered it again.</li>
            <li>Smells great, and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I really liked the price and smell of this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because I really liked Take Olive Me and wanted to try another from this brand.</li>
            <li>Nice and even tan</li>
            <li>great product, low price and smells great!!</li>
            <li>Has a nice scent to it, and it is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>This was perfect and much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li>produces a nice tan color no orange or streaking</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re probably not going to the right salon or have very fair skin that doesn&#x27;t tan well anyways.</li>
            <li>Love this product, light scent and works great.</li>
            <li>This was shipped quickly and is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I tan very easily and have a darker complexion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been wonderful so far.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is easily absorbed by your skin.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my sensitive skin and way cheaper than salon prices.</li>
            <li>By far the best lotion I have used!  </li>
            <li>Smells good and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin felt amazing after first use and made my skin look bronzed!!!</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this tanning lotion and the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and it works great too!!</li>
            <li>A lotion with a mild and pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>Great smelling tanning lotion, light and fresh scent.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I love this product.</li>
            <li>i got this for me love it</li>
            <li>I am in love with this lotion.</li>
            <li>My all time favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone!! :)</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this lotion at the tanning salon and love it.  </li>
            <li>and I really love it.</li>
            <li>They sent a free sample of another lotion with mine!</li>
            <li>Love the smell and use it every time I go to the tanning salon.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>This one is more affordable and works well.</li>
            <li>Me Not is probably my favorite out of all of them.</li>
            <li>Most tanning lotions give me a rash/bumps all over my body.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Such a great price!</li>
            <li>and they love it also.  </li>
            <li>yes this product reached my expectations and surpassed them, its a wonderful almost all natural product, but it is paraben free.</li>
            <li>I did enjoy the smell which came across as a nice flowery scent.</li>
            <li>I love this brand of tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>so I love it</li>
            <li>Love this lotion</li>
            <li>Very exciting!</li>
            <li>Works really well for indoor and outdoor tanning and smells amazing!</li>
            <li>And was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>Skin feels moisturized and looks great after a tan, lasts for a long while,  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>It is eco and sensitive-skin conscious, and smells great without being too overpowering.</li>
            <li>I tan fairly easily</li>
            <li>I have fair skin and tend to get irritated with lotions, this is such a creamy product and applies nicely without any irritation or discomfort.</li>
            <li>The bronzing is good, it&#x27;s very moisturizing, and glides on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>The first thing that I noticed was that most lotions I have used are more of a liquid based this product was much heavier and more of a consistency of toothpaste as a result you use more than you would if it were more of a liquid as it does not spread as easy.  </li>
            <li>but it is very fruity and much better than sweaty post-tan smell!</li>
            <li>It is an amazing product, it applies very creamy and moisturizes your body</li>
            <li>so I bought luminary since ive heard such great reveiws about it hope it gets me</li>
            <li>but overall it works great.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic too.</li>
            <li>Gave me a nice tan that stuck around longer then normal!</li>
            <li>When I started tanning (and I tan easily and quickly)</li>
            <li>The first time, I bought it at the tanning salon for a lot more than I paid through Amazon.</li>
            <li>but I originally bought Queen tanning lotion for over $100</li>
            <li>So excited when I found this online, instead of having to buy it at LA Tan.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>Great product - smells great and helps you get a deep dark tan while moisturizing your skin.  </li>
            <li>its a nice lotion for the winter time due to its nice moisture features.</li>
            <li>So far I am loving this lotion.</li>
            <li>It smells good and is moisturizing so that is a plus, but I have had much better results with Green With Envy.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to apply and was not messy.  </li>
            <li>Nice and thick but goes a long way and smells great!</li>
            <li>Just a couple to name; Gilded, Hot!, Satin De Sol, Risque, etc, etc.</li>
            <li>My favorite tanning lotion by far!  </li>
            <li>Exactly as ordered!</li>
            <li>Great scent, helps to develop an even dark color!</li>
            <li>Nice moisturizer, but didn&#x27;t give me the deep tan I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Really gives me a nice, natural color boost when I use it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like it sits on top of your skin like many other lotions do.</li>
            <li>It is more natural than most others but also has a really nice texture and scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I use this lotion every other session and it continues to give good effect.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very nice, its a little thicker than other lotions from the same line, which is a plus :) it also has a nice scent, not too strong.</li>
            <li>RIGHT</li>
            <li>This one is great if you have areas that are hard to tan.</li>
            <li>If you are considering this tanning lotion, I would be the first to recommend it.</li>
            <li>i will be ordering more in the future--</li>
            <li>I would go out of a morning for about 30 minutes before it was too hot.</li>
            <li>I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy but still works very well!</li>
            <li>but im sure it&#x27;s the same for every bronzer.</li>
            <li>Swedish Beauty was my first choice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only lotion I have tried that was more like a cream than a watery, runny lotion.</li>
            <li>My first time buying a lotion off the internet.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I find myself using it when tanning outside.  </li>
            <li>I am an avid tanner</li>
            <li>As such, I&#x27;ve used multiple types of indoor tanning lotions, most notably &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; lotions.</li>
            <li>Love it we&#x27;ll buy again in future!!</li>
            <li>This was my first time using this lotion.</li>
            <li>I did not think the scent was as nice as other reviews I read</li>
            <li>Very luxurious feel and very hydrating!</li>
            <li>I do notice that my skin does not get as dark with this lotion as it does with a tingler, but this is a nice switch.</li>
            <li>It smells great and got me tan really fast only using the level 2 beds which is suprising because im super pale.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to pay the price for a product I can actually use and enjoy.</li>
            <li>You could easily buy the same product for twice the price at a salon.</li>
            <li>I love this tanning lotionm it smells nice and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice little color boost.</li>
            <li>I also really like the texture of these lotions, as well as the way my skin still feels moisturized after tanning but not greasy.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than in a salon of course.</li>
            <li>as fast.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take much time before I had some color.</li>
            <li>If you put on too much or use it too often, you can get orange</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe I used to pay so much to buy this at a salon.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely adores this lotion as well.)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t see results with this lotion.</li>
            <li>SO much cheaper than salon prices.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much cheaper on Amazon than in the tanning salons.</li>
            <li>It smells good and is extremely condition to my skin and also adds a bit of bronz instantly.</li>
            <li>Nice smell, lasts a long time, definitely the real brand product not a knock off.</li>
            <li>Smells great, works quickly and gives me a deep tan without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li>When i worked at a tanning salon I would recommend this lotion to girls who already have pretty tan skin, not pale skin.</li>
            <li>I am sensitive to some lotions and was concerned about that when I first used this lotion</li>
            <li>I like this product and noticed color, but I noticed I felt kind of sticky/sweaty after my tanning session, which usually doesn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li>I normally love Swedish Beauty tanning products and had high expectations for this bottle, but I think it&#x27;s just average.</li>
            <li>Decent price.  </li>
            <li>My main concern was price which is houw</li>
            <li>Mild enough scent that it doesn&#x27;t choke you out.</li>
            <li>Let me first start out saying that I am an avid tanner, and have used over 8 different types of high end tanning products.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and I plan on purchasing it again when this tube runs out, which will be awhile.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and it was less than half the price I would have paid for it in the salon.</li>
            <li>Last a long time also :)))))</li>
            <li>This is a nice lotion with a thick consistency that rubs into the skin well.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li>I am new to tanning</li>
            <li>but I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>looks very natural.</li>
            <li>I have used it in the past and it is definitely a favorite.  </li>
            <li>beats the tanning clubs prices by far!</li>
            <li>When I finally ran out I searched Amazon and was blown away by how much cheaper it was!</li>
            <li>I used this as a sample in the tanning salon for the first time last summer after it was recommended by the staff.  </li>
            <li>If your looking for something mild that is gentle on the skin and will give you a slight color boost</li>
            <li>Second of all it DOES have bronzers in it, so it gives you more color than the average lotion.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and got me super dark and moisturized!</li>
            <li>First of all the fact that it&#x27;s natural and by Swedish beauty is not only a \\&quot;green\\&quot; plus, but it helps if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Reason because this bronzer is not a great one, the lotion itself smells AMAZING and it hydrates</li>
            <li>AND IT MAKES YOUR SKIN REALLY SOFT.</li>
            <li>I did some research on a tanning lotion company that offered products with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>For anyone with sensitive skin I recommend this and even in the salon</li>
            <li>It smelled like the real stuff from the salon but didn&#x27;t look the same</li>
            <li>Nothing too exciting just a regular lotion at much lesser price.</li>
            <li>It is thick and creamy but absorbs well and leaves a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t help me hold my tan, but as long as I keep tanning, this lotion really helps me build a tan.</li>
            <li>Lotion is quite thick which causes you to go thru it a little quicker, but with the good price it&#x27;s not a big issue.</li>
            <li>and I have nothing bad to say about it: it smells great</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t want that same old scent, this is a must try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li>But it is thick and goes an real well and really leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t help as much in the way of tanning as some other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Once I finish tanning, my skin possesses a slight tint, which I suspect is due to a combination of the tanning light &amp; the lotion.</li>
            <li>, so for me is was the little extra I needed to get a little more color.  </li>
            <li>It is not sticky on your skin, it absorbs really well and helps your tan stay a little longer.</li>

            <li> Its a great price here the salons carry and its triple in price.</li>
            <li> LOL.</li>
            <li> and I just love the scent!!</li>
            <li> It smells great when you are putting it on, but after tanning its not as pleasant.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and the results are great.</li>

            <li> but the smell is AMAZING!</li>

            <li> :)  Great!  </li>
            <li> Item has a good sent and was a great deal on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> The scent stays pleasant even after tanning.  </li>
            <li> very fair skinned and most tanning lotions with a bronzer give me that orange glow which everyone dreads.  </li>
            <li> Smells so good and bronzes without streaks.</li>
            <li> and it also is a good mosterizer</li>
            <li> I have fair skin.</li>
            <li> Always loved this.</li>
            <li> Works great and fabulous smell!</li>
            <li> This smells really good and goes on nicely.</li>

            <li> All time favorite!</li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion!  </li>
            <li> I was hooked the first time I used it, and the smell is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin almost immediately and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for cheap price.</li>
            <li> Gives amazing color every time.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing</li>
            <li> No streaking, smells amazing.</li>
            <li> The price on Amazon is amazing compared to the 50 dollars I ended up spending in the store, which is why I ordered it again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I really liked the price and smell of this lotion.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because I really liked Take Olive Me and wanted to try another from this brand.</li>
            <li> Nice and even tan</li>
            <li> great product, low price and smells great!!</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent to it, and it is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This was perfect and much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li> produces a nice tan color no orange or streaking</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re probably not going to the right salon or have very fair skin that doesn&#x27;t tan well anyways.</li>
            <li> Love this product, light scent and works great.</li>
            <li> This was shipped quickly and is a great product.  </li>
            <li> I tan very easily and have a darker complexion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been wonderful so far.</li>
            <li> It smells great and is easily absorbed by your skin.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my sensitive skin and way cheaper than salon prices.</li>
            <li> By far the best lotion I have used!  </li>
            <li> Smells good and goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> My skin felt amazing after first use and made my skin look bronzed!!!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this tanning lotion and the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and it works great too!!</li>
            <li> A lotion with a mild and pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> Great smelling tanning lotion, light and fresh scent.  </li>
            <li> Honestly I love this product.</li>
            <li> i got this for me love it</li>
            <li> I am in love with this lotion.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite tanning lotion.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone!! :)</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this lotion at the tanning salon and love it.  </li>
            <li> and I really love it.</li>
            <li> They sent a free sample of another lotion with mine!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and use it every time I go to the tanning salon.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> This one is more affordable and works well.</li>
            <li> Me Not is probably my favorite out of all of them.</li>
            <li> Most tanning lotions give me a rash/bumps all over my body.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Such a great price!</li>
            <li> and they love it also.  </li>
            <li> yes this product reached my expectations and surpassed them, its a wonderful almost all natural product, but it is paraben free.</li>
            <li> I did enjoy the smell which came across as a nice flowery scent.</li>
            <li> I love this brand of tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> so I love it</li>
            <li> Love this lotion</li>
            <li> Very exciting!</li>
            <li> Works really well for indoor and outdoor tanning and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> And was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> Skin feels moisturized and looks great after a tan, lasts for a long while,  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> It is eco and sensitive-skin conscious, and smells great without being too overpowering.</li>
            <li> I tan fairly easily</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and tend to get irritated with lotions, this is such a creamy product and applies nicely without any irritation or discomfort.</li>
            <li> The bronzing is good, it&#x27;s very moisturizing, and glides on smoothly.  </li>
            <li> The first thing that I noticed was that most lotions I have used are more of a liquid based this product was much heavier and more of a consistency of toothpaste as a result you use more than you would if it were more of a liquid as it does not spread as easy.  </li>
            <li> but it is very fruity and much better than sweaty post-tan smell!</li>
            <li> It is an amazing product, it applies very creamy and moisturizes your body</li>
            <li> so I bought luminary since ive heard such great reveiws about it hope it gets me</li>
            <li> but overall it works great.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic too.</li>
            <li> Gave me a nice tan that stuck around longer then normal!</li>
            <li> When I started tanning (and I tan easily and quickly)</li>
            <li> The first time, I bought it at the tanning salon for a lot more than I paid through Amazon.</li>
            <li> but I originally bought Queen tanning lotion for over $100</li>
            <li> So excited when I found this online, instead of having to buy it at LA Tan.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> Great product - smells great and helps you get a deep dark tan while moisturizing your skin.  </li>
            <li> its a nice lotion for the winter time due to its nice moisture features.</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this lotion.</li>
            <li> It smells good and is moisturizing so that is a plus, but I have had much better results with Green With Envy.</li>
            <li> It was very easy to apply and was not messy.  </li>
            <li> Nice and thick but goes a long way and smells great!</li>
            <li> Just a couple to name; Gilded, Hot!, Satin De Sol, Risque, etc, etc.</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning lotion by far!  </li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered!</li>
            <li> Great scent, helps to develop an even dark color!</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer, but didn&#x27;t give me the deep tan I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Really gives me a nice, natural color boost when I use it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like it sits on top of your skin like many other lotions do.</li>
            <li> It is more natural than most others but also has a really nice texture and scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion every other session and it continues to give good effect.</li>
            <li> This lotion is very nice, its a little thicker than other lotions from the same line, which is a plus :) it also has a nice scent, not too strong.</li>
            <li> RIGHT</li>
            <li> This one is great if you have areas that are hard to tan.</li>
            <li> If you are considering this tanning lotion, I would be the first to recommend it.</li>
            <li> i will be ordering more in the future--</li>
            <li> I would go out of a morning for about 30 minutes before it was too hot.</li>
            <li> I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy but still works very well!</li>
            <li> but im sure it&#x27;s the same for every bronzer.</li>
            <li> Swedish Beauty was my first choice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only lotion I have tried that was more like a cream than a watery, runny lotion.</li>
            <li> My first time buying a lotion off the internet.</li>
            <li> Most of the time I find myself using it when tanning outside.  </li>
            <li> I am an avid tanner</li>
            <li> As such, I&#x27;ve used multiple types of indoor tanning lotions, most notably &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; lotions.</li>
            <li> Love it we&#x27;ll buy again in future!!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this lotion.</li>
            <li> I did not think the scent was as nice as other reviews I read</li>
            <li> Very luxurious feel and very hydrating!</li>
            <li> I do notice that my skin does not get as dark with this lotion as it does with a tingler, but this is a nice switch.</li>
            <li> It smells great and got me tan really fast only using the level 2 beds which is suprising because im super pale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to pay the price for a product I can actually use and enjoy.</li>
            <li> You could easily buy the same product for twice the price at a salon.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotionm it smells nice and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice little color boost.</li>
            <li> I also really like the texture of these lotions, as well as the way my skin still feels moisturized after tanning but not greasy.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than in a salon of course.</li>
            <li> as fast.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take much time before I had some color.</li>
            <li> If you put on too much or use it too often, you can get orange</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I used to pay so much to buy this at a salon.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely adores this lotion as well.)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t see results with this lotion.</li>
            <li> SO much cheaper than salon prices.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much cheaper on Amazon than in the tanning salons.</li>
            <li> It smells good and is extremely condition to my skin and also adds a bit of bronz instantly.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, lasts a long time, definitely the real brand product not a knock off.</li>
            <li> Smells great, works quickly and gives me a deep tan without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> When i worked at a tanning salon I would recommend this lotion to girls who already have pretty tan skin, not pale skin.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to some lotions and was concerned about that when I first used this lotion</li>
            <li> I like this product and noticed color, but I noticed I felt kind of sticky/sweaty after my tanning session, which usually doesn&#x27;t happen.  </li>
            <li> I normally love Swedish Beauty tanning products and had high expectations for this bottle, but I think it&#x27;s just average.</li>
            <li> Decent price.  </li>
            <li> My main concern was price which is houw</li>
            <li> Mild enough scent that it doesn&#x27;t choke you out.</li>
            <li> Let me first start out saying that I am an avid tanner, and have used over 8 different types of high end tanning products.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and I plan on purchasing it again when this tube runs out, which will be awhile.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it was less than half the price I would have paid for it in the salon.</li>
            <li> Last a long time also :)))))</li>
            <li> This is a nice lotion with a thick consistency that rubs into the skin well.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to try something new</li>
            <li> I am new to tanning</li>
            <li> but I have VERY sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I have used it in the past and it is definitely a favorite.  </li>
            <li> beats the tanning clubs prices by far!</li>
            <li> When I finally ran out I searched Amazon and was blown away by how much cheaper it was!</li>
            <li> I used this as a sample in the tanning salon for the first time last summer after it was recommended by the staff.  </li>
            <li> If your looking for something mild that is gentle on the skin and will give you a slight color boost</li>
            <li> Second of all it DOES have bronzers in it, so it gives you more color than the average lotion.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and got me super dark and moisturized!</li>
            <li> First of all the fact that it&#x27;s natural and by Swedish beauty is not only a \\&quot;green\\&quot; plus, but it helps if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Reason because this bronzer is not a great one, the lotion itself smells AMAZING and it hydrates</li>
            <li> AND IT MAKES YOUR SKIN REALLY SOFT.</li>
            <li> I did some research on a tanning lotion company that offered products with all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> For anyone with sensitive skin I recommend this and even in the salon</li>
            <li> It smelled like the real stuff from the salon but didn&#x27;t look the same</li>
            <li> Nothing too exciting just a regular lotion at much lesser price.</li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy but absorbs well and leaves a lovely scent.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help me hold my tan, but as long as I keep tanning, this lotion really helps me build a tan.</li>
            <li> Lotion is quite thick which causes you to go thru it a little quicker, but with the good price it&#x27;s not a big issue.</li>
            <li> and I have nothing bad to say about it: it smells great</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t want that same old scent, this is a must try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far</li>
            <li> But it is thick and goes an real well and really leaves your skin soft.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t help as much in the way of tanning as some other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Once I finish tanning, my skin possesses a slight tint, which I suspect is due to a combination of the tanning light &amp; the lotion.</li>
            <li> , so for me is was the little extra I needed to get a little more color.  </li>
            <li> It is not sticky on your skin, it absorbs really well and helps your tan stay a little longer.</li>
            <li> Provides a dark tan and leaves the skin so soft!  </li>
            <li> I would really recommend buying it through this provider, it&#x27;s usually around $45 in stores.</li>
            <li> For me it would be my upper body that&#x27;s harder to tan</li>
            <li> Ultimately this is the fault of the seller due to improper packaging.  </li>
            <li> I WILL NOT EVER GO BACK TO ANY OTHER LOTION....</li>
            <li> It definitely got me dark.</li>
            <li> This is the first product that I have used that gives that extra color without looking fake.</li>
            <li> Paid at least double for this product at the actual tanning bed.  </li>
            <li> Scent is minimal, not too perfumy.  </li>
            <li> I work at a hospital and even with all the hand washing it lasts longer than other lotions.  </li>
            <li> Look forward in trying other lotions in from this company.  </li>
            <li> but I bought this lotion and went tanning probably every other day for about two weeks</li>
            <li> This is the same lotion they sell at tanning salons for less than half the price and it smells amazing...even after tanning!</li>
            <li> Nothing extreme.</li>
            <li> I BEEN USING ALL KINDS OF LOTIONS THAT WILL MAKE ME DARK.  </li>
            <li> hands down gives you the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; that all us tanners want when we go tanning.</li>
            <li> I have tried other tanners and they usually make me itchy or feel blotchy on my skin when I apply them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thicker though</li>
            <li> and it produces a very dark tan that looks like you went to the Bahamas for a vacation,</li>
            <li> It does give a natural looking tan versus an unrealistic tan.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Sun Tan City for $50 and and purchased through amazon for half the money!</li>
            <li> I have pale skin.</li>
            <li> Same quality, but waaaay less expensive.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really liked the price and smell of this lotion.  I have used it in the past and it is definitely a favorite.  Unfortunately, the tanning lotion was shipped in a padded envelope.  When I opened the envelope, the cap was dislodged from the bottle and cracked into 3 pieces.  This caused lotion to ooze all over the packaging.  I was irratated that I would have to return it and reorder since there is no exchange option.  Ultimately this is the fault of the seller due to improper packaging.  I hope they use boxes in the future.</li>
            <li> Honestly I love this product. I have tried other tanners and they usually make me itchy or feel blotchy on my skin when I apply them. I purchased this from Sun Tan City for $50 and and purchased through amazon for half the money! It is an amazing product, it applies very creamy and moisturizes your body and it produces a very dark tan that looks like you went to the Bahamas for a vacation, lol. I will continue purchasing this product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it was less than half the price I would have paid for it in the salon. It absorbs into the skin almost immediately and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> i got this for me love it</li>
            <li> I am in love with this lotion. I actually work at a tanning salon and we sell this for three times the price! Great lotion for cheap price.</li>
            <li> My all time favorite tanning lotion. It is more natural than most others but also has a really nice texture and scent that is not overwhelming. It is not sticky on your skin, it absorbs really well and helps your tan stay a little longer. Plus it&#x27;s a great price compared to the salon.</li>
            <li> Likes:  Scent is minimal, not too perfumy.  Creamy, not greasy.  Decent price.  None of the other additives like hemp, cooling, heating, tingling, etc etc - which I HATE.  Dislikes:  Doesn&#x27;t help as much in the way of tanning as some other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This lotioned worked amazing!! My skin felt amazing after first use and made my skin look bronzed!!! I love this lotion!!!! I would recommend it to anyone!! :)</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  Provides a dark tan and leaves the skin so soft!  The first time, I bought it at the tanning salon for a lot more than I paid through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Hi! If you are considering this tanning lotion, I would be the first to recommend it. It&#x27;s been wonderful so far. In only a matter of days my tanning experience has been amplified by this lotion. It smells great and is easily absorbed by your skin. I would highly recommend this product and I plan on purchasing it again when this tube runs out, which will be awhile.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I really liked Take Olive Me and wanted to try another from this brand. Love it. Love the smell which is deliciously fruity without being over-powering. I also really like the texture of these lotions, as well as the way my skin still feels moisturized after tanning but not greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product - smells great and helps you get a deep dark tan while moisturizing your skin.  Buying online is 1/2 the cost of what tanning shops charge.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this lotion at the tanning salon and love it.  It is thick and creamy but absorbs well and leaves a lovely scent.  I work at a hospital and even with all the hand washing it lasts longer than other lotions.  I&#x27;ve never liked to use lotions after showering because they would feel greasy or sticky but this is wonderful.  I&#x27;ll miss it when tanning season is over.</li>
            <li> Gives amazing color every time.</li>
            <li> Very excited to use!!! I have used this lotion before, but when I bought it at the actual salon. I will now only  buy tanning lotions from Amazon. Same quality, but waaaay less expensive. Very exciting!</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well</li>
            <li> Great smell. So much cheaper than in a salon of course. Nice and even tan</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Works great and fabulous smell!</li>
            <li> I used this lotion all last summer and I really love it. It smells great and got me tan really fast only using the level 2 beds which is suprising because im super pale. I was noticably tanner already after only my second tanning session. I would reccomend this lotion to anyone! I would have bought it again this summer but I wanted to try something new so I bought luminary since ive heard such great reveiws about it hope it gets me tan.just as fast.</li>
            <li> This was shipped quickly and is a great product.  I had used it before so knew what I was getting. The scent stays pleasant even after tanning.  They sent a free sample of another lotion with mine!</li>
            <li> This lotion is very nice, its a little thicker than other lotions from the same line, which is a plus :) it also has a nice scent, not too strong. The tan it provides is very nice as well :)</li>
            <li> Love the smell and use it every time I go to the tanning salon. It is my very very favorite!!!</li>
            <li> Smells so good and bronzes without streaks. It was very easy to apply and was not messy.  I Love this product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product! Perfect for my sensitive skin and way cheaper than salon prices. Shipped fast and got me super dark and moisturized!</li>
            <li> great product, low price and smells great!! i will be ordering more in the future-- beats the tanning clubs prices by far!</li>
            <li> Nice moisturizer, but didn&#x27;t give me the deep tan I was expecting. Plus I smelled like I had been tanning in a booth.</li>
            <li> This product is intended for use in a tanning bed however I used it when sitting out on my deck. It didn&#x27;t take much time before I had some color. I would go out of a morning for about 30 minutes before it was too hot. after three to five days I had great color!  I will use it again as well as recommend it to others</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!  Nothing too exciting just a regular lotion at much lesser price. Not oily. Feels great. Skin feels moisturized and looks great after a tan, lasts for a long while,  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about a year now and I have nothing bad to say about it: it smells great and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot to get great results. I would really recommend buying it through this provider, it&#x27;s usually around $45 in stores.</li>
            <li> THIS LOTION IS AWESOME AND IT MAKES YOUR SKIN REALLY SOFT. I WILL ONLY USE THIS LOTION FORM NOW ON...</li>
            <li> So far I am loving this lotion. Really gives me a nice, natural color boost when I use it. It is very thick and absorbs well. It doesn&#x27;t feel like it sits on top of your skin like many other lotions do. I like that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy but still works very well! I would recommend adding this lotion to your rotation for sure!</li>
            <li> Love this product, light scent and works great. Doesn&#x27;t have that tanning lotion smell,  if you don&#x27;t want that same old scent, this is a must try.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Has a great smell and doesn&#x27;t leave you smelling like a tanning bed. Color progression a little slow, but I don&#x27;t like looking like tan mom, so it&#x27;s perfect for me!!</li>
            <li> Bought this product at a salon for 30+ with a discount. Wish I would have gotbit on here but overall it works great. Smells amazing and after one use gets me tanner. If you put on too much or use it too often, you can get orange but im sure it&#x27;s the same for every bronzer. Definitely reccomend. But if you are looking for a moisturizer I don&#x27;t think this is the one. It&#x27;s a little thicker though so I would recommend rotating or pairing with a moisture lotion like juicy gossip. The two worked well for me. This one is great if you have areas that are hard to tan. For me it would be my upper body that&#x27;s harder to tan so this is perfect!!</li>
            <li> My sister told me to try this product, so I searched it on amazon and purchased from this site. This product is wonderful and smells great!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I used to pay so much to buy this at a salon. When I finally ran out I searched Amazon and was blown away by how much cheaper it was! Great for outdoor tanning!</li>
            <li> My friend works at a tanning bed and recommended this to me... I love it! Nice and thick but goes a long way and smells great! Gave me a nice tan that stuck around longer then normal!</li>
            <li> Great scent, helps to develop an even dark color!</li>
            <li> Best tanning bronzer ever! Conditions the skin beautifully, feels great... and I just love the scent!!</li>
            <li> Buy it here instead of at the salon! Cheaper and same product!!!</li>
            <li> Great product for a base tan. I have pale skin. No streaking, smells amazing.</li>
            <li> The same stuff you get at the tanning salon but a lot cheaper!</li>
            <li> I did some research on a tanning lotion company that offered products with all natural ingredients. Swedish Beauty was my first choice. They have a great selection of lotions for affordable prices.  The tanning salon wanted $45 for the same lotion.  Look forward in trying other lotions in from this company.  P.S.  The smell is AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> By far the best lotion I have used!  Smells great, is not greasy, and tans wonderfully.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> DOES NOT STREAK ON YOUR SKIN.  LOVE IT HOPE THE PRICE STAYS .  WHAT A BARGAIN.  ALSO DOES NOT HAVE ODOR OF YOU JUST HAD A TAN.</li>
            <li> All time favorite! Smells awesome for hours,</li>
            <li> I have fair skin and tend to get irritated with lotions, this is such a creamy product and applies nicely without any irritation or discomfort. It smells fantastic too. It&#x27;s the only lotion I have tried that was more like a cream than a watery, runny lotion. Love it</li>
            <li> Smells great, fruity. Does not streak. Very moisturizing. Great price. Love!</li>
            <li> Swedish Beauty has a lot of wonderful tanning lotions. This one is more affordable and works well. It also seemed to last me quite a while. The only problem I had with it the fig scent. It smells great when you are putting it on, but after tanning its not as pleasant.</li>
            <li> Let me first start out saying that I am an avid tanner, and have used over 8 different types of high end tanning products. Just a couple to name; Gilded, Hot!, Satin De Sol, Risque, etc, etc. I would have to say that Fig Get Me Not is probably my favorite out of all of them. First of all the fact that it&#x27;s natural and by Swedish beauty is not only a \\&quot;green\\&quot; plus, but it helps if you have sensitive skin. (I do not but my sister does and she absolutely adores this lotion as well.) Second of all it DOES have bronzers in it, so it gives you more color than the average lotion. I tan fairly easily but I bought this lotion and went tanning probably every other day for about two weeks and I was THE DARKEST I have EVER been. And I was living in Arizona at the time, where EVERYONE is bronze. The price on Amazon is amazing compared to the 50 dollars I ended up spending in the store, which is why I ordered it again. You can use it inside or outside and even as a daily moisturizer. A lot of the time a persons ability to tan depends on the bed they&#x27;re using and their skin type... so if you hear bad reviews on it they&#x27;re probably not going to the right salon or have very fair skin that doesn&#x27;t tan well anyways. Do yourself a favor and buy this lotion, because you will NOT regret it!</li>
            <li> I have been tanning for years but I have VERY sensitive skin. Most tanning lotions give me a rash/bumps all over my body. I&#x27;ve been using &#x27;Fig Get Me Not&#x27; for the past 6 months and I LOVE it. Smells great, works quickly and gives me a deep tan without irritating my skin. I would recommend to anyone who tans! I will never use another lotion again.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. Some people don&#x27;t like the scent. I do.</li>
            <li> Great product. I am new to tanning but I originally bought Queen tanning lotion for over $100 and my skin was beyond itchy and had a rash all over. I ended up selling my bottle and buying fig get me not. And im incredibly happy I&#x27;m not itchy, didn&#x27;t turn red. For anyone with sensitive skin I recommend this and even in the salon I&#x27;m willing to pay the price for a product I can actually use and enjoy.</li>
            <li> I love this tanning lotionm it smells nice and a little goes a long way. I am sensitive to some lotions and was concerned about that when I first used this lotion but it&#x27;s gentle and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Smells great and u like that it goes in thick and it also is a good mosterizer</li>
            <li> My favorite tanning lotion by far!  It smells good and is extremely condition to my skin and also adds a bit of bronz instantly.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and gives you a great tan!! Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered! This is the same lotion they sell at tanning salons for less than half the price and it smells amazing...even after tanning! Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this tanning lotion and the fact that it&#x27;s all natural and it works great too!! Just wish you could get a bigger bottle of it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but the smell is AMAZING! It definitely got me dark. Now if your looking for a lotion that&#x27;ll take the after tan smell away this isn&#x27;t for you. But it is thick and goes an real well and really leaves your skin soft. Even after showering. Such a great price!</li>
            <li> My first time buying a lotion off the internet. I&#x27;m not impressed with the results I&#x27;ve gotten with this lotion.</li>
            <li> Paid at least double for this product at the actual tanning bed.  It smells great and it works good. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I normally love Swedish Beauty tanning products and had high expectations for this bottle, but I think it&#x27;s just average. When I started tanning (and I tan easily and quickly) It didn&#x27;t accelerate the process. It smells good and is moisturizing so that is a plus, but I have had much better results with Green With Envy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion!  Most of the time I find myself using it when tanning outside.  I was hooked the first time I used it, and the smell is wonderful.  I tan very easily and have a darker complexion, so for me is was the little extra I needed to get a little more color.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I feel like this product works well in helping achieve a deeper, \\&quot;bronzier\\&quot; tan. I did not think the scent was as nice as other reviews I read but it is very fruity and much better than sweaty post-tan smell! Lotion is quite thick which causes you to go thru it a little quicker, but with the good price it&#x27;s not a big issue.</li>
            <li> I used this as a sample in the tanning salon for the first time last summer after it was recommended by the staff.  I am very fair skinned and most tanning lotions with a bronzer give me that orange glow which everyone dreads.  This is the first product that I have used that gives that extra color without looking fake. I use this lotion every other session and it continues to give good effect. The smell is pleasant and the results are great.</li>
            <li> Smelling lotion and does wonders on my skin since I am in the sun and tanning in the tanning bed.</li>
            <li> I am an avid tanner and I really don&#x27;t see results with this lotion. I have used almost the entire bottle and I don&#x27;t see that I have gotten any darker then using a cheep lotion. I don&#x27;t even think it keeps your skin conditioned. I have noticed my skin is dryer since switching to this lotion. I will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> It smelled like the real stuff from the salon but didn&#x27;t look the same what so ever! Even the consistency was different it was a lot thinner than the fig lotion I have bought in the salon. Not sure if it&#x27;s legit.</li>
            <li> I have been an avid &amp;#34;tanner&amp;#34; for the past 19 years. As such, I&#x27;ve used multiple types of indoor tanning lotions, most notably &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; lotions. I decided to give up the burning tingle &amp; give this one a try. This is a nice lotion with a thick consistency that rubs into the skin well. Once I finish tanning, my skin possesses a slight tint, which I suspect is due to a combination of the tanning light &amp; the lotion. I do notice that my skin does not get as dark with this lotion as it does with a tingler, but this is a nice switch. I may look for something else when finished to see if I can find a lotion that provides a darker finish (without tingle).</li>
            <li> I buy this lotion every summer. I love it! Works really well for indoor and outdoor tanning and smells amazing! Has no &amp;#34;gross tanning lotion&amp;#34; smell. People always ask me what I&#x27;m using.</li>
            <li> Love it we&#x27;ll buy again in future!! Smells good and goes on smooth. Last a long time also :)))))) happy</li>
            <li> Lotion works great and smells awesome!  I let everyone smell it and they love it also.  I tan well with it also.</li>
            <li> I BEEN USING ALL KINDS OF LOTIONS THAT WILL MAKE ME DARK.  I AM WHITE AND I DO NOT TAN IN THE SUN OR INDOOR BEDS AND THIS WILL MAKE ME HAVE A TAN RIGHT AFTER I GET OUT OF THE INDOOR BEDS!!! I LOVE IT!!!!!  I WILL NOT EVER GO BACK TO ANY OTHER LOTION....BECAUSE THIS STUFF WORKS!!!!! THANK YOU!!!!</li>
            <li> Works great in the tanning bed. After 2 days Deff. See results. I would buy this again. Smells great, and goes on smooth. I have fair skin. It doesn&#x27;t help me hold my tan, but as long as I keep tanning, this lotion really helps me build a tan. I purchased it because of the reviews... And was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> I like it.smells great!!! Ordered already couple times the same</li>
            <li> I never buy tanning lotion at the salon... They charge almost 4 times the price! This is the same product they sell at my salon - only a lot cheaper. This smells really good and goes on nicely.</li>
            <li> yes this product reached my expectations and surpassed them, its a wonderful almost all natural product, but it is paraben free. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Great smelling tanning lotion, light and fresh scent.  The bronzing is good, it&#x27;s very moisturizing, and glides on smoothly.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using this lotion. its thick but not TOO thick. its a nice lotion for the winter time due to its nice moisture features. it smells great and does the job. im an experienced tanner and this lotion hands down gives you the &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; that all us tanners want when we go tanning. I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Nice smell, lasts a long time, definitely the real brand product not a knock off. SO much cheaper than salon prices.</li>
            <li> This botanical product moisturizes my skin and brings out its best.  Once caution: it has some color that can get on clothing.</li>
            <li> I like this product and noticed color, but I noticed I felt kind of sticky/sweaty after my tanning session, which usually doesn&#x27;t happen.  I used it in a booth because I was afraid I would sweat it off in a bed.</li>
            <li> Always loved this. When i worked at a tanning salon I would recommend this lotion to girls who already have pretty tan skin, not pale skin. Reason because this bronzer is not a great one, the lotion itself smells AMAZING and it hydrates but the bronzer isn&#x27;t great. This lotion doesn&#x27;t give you that gross smell/feeling after you tan. Recommended if you go to work after you tan, or go work out, or like to do things after you tan because you smell good!</li>
            <li> I was out of my product that I purchased at the tanning salon and needed something for the last 2 weeks of my membership.  My main concern was price which is houw I ended up with Swedish Beauty.  The first thing that I noticed was that most lotions I have used are more of a liquid based this product was much heavier and more of a consistency of toothpaste as a result you use more than you would if it were more of a liquid as it does not spread as easy.  I did not notice my tan getting any darker while I used this lotion but it did keep my skin moist.  I did enjoy the smell which came across as a nice flowery scent.</li>
            <li> Has a nice scent to it, and it is not overpowering. Mild enough scent that it doesn&#x27;t choke you out. Gives a nice little color boost. Nothing extreme. If your looking for something mild that is gentle on the skin and will give you a slight color boost this is it.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for. A lotion with a mild and pleasant scent.  This was perfect and much cheaper than the salon.</li>
            <li> So excited when I found this online, instead of having to buy it at LA Tan.  Worth every penny!  Produces a great tan, smells great and is cheaper than the store!</li>
            <li> Great smelling Tanning lotion, you could absolutley use this even if not tanning. Very luxurious feel and very hydrating! produces a nice tan color no orange or streaking looks very natural. Its a great price here the salons carry and its triple in price. Being a second purchase speaks volumes in this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it at the tanning salon!  I saved almost $40 by buying it online!!!!  I like the tan it gives me.</li>
            <li> :)  Great!  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this brand of tanning lotions. It is eco and sensitive-skin conscious, and smells great without being too overpowering. You could easily buy the same product for twice the price at a salon.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it so I love it LOL. It does give a natural looking tan versus an unrealistic tan. Item has a good sent and was a great deal on Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion and it&#x27;s so much cheaper on Amazon than in the tanning salons. The local salons told a lady that it&#x27;s not the same product if you buy it online, and she Believed her!!!</li>
