            <li>it does make you seem to be sweating more.</li>
            <li>Removes mascara, soothes chapped lips, and is an excellent (odorless/tasteless) personal lubricant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.</li>
            <li>&gt; Not too many stores carried it.</li>
            <li>For awhile, Walmart in some stores had it on the shelves.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the price began rising and rising, forcing many stores even Walmart not to carry it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I love Amazon purchase are always on time.</li>
            <li>Better than any hand lotion.</li>
            <li>If you aren&#x27;t using this as a makeup remover (like me) make sure you keep your body hydrated.</li>
            <li>I was using it as a pre-workout body rub to induce sweating - which it works okay at.</li>
            <li>I told the (female) agent what it was &amp; how wonderful it had been over the years.</li>
            <li>but it was ok</li>
            <li>Amazing product if you love having your face silky smooth baby but</li>
            <li>Better than vasoline.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for years, but can&#x27;t find it in most stores.</li>
            <li>Outstanding for use as a lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used Albolene Moisturizing Cream off/on for most of my life.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>I love the way my body reacts during my workout.</li>
            <li>Great Item, Fast shipper, will use again.</li>
            <li>I will buy more</li>
            <li>I will be buying a lot more.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the reviews of sweating more when applying this to your body.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>We are both glad I bought it for her.</li>

            <li>I am using it for exercising with my sweating belt and it really works!!!!</li>
            <li>This really does make you sweat a lot!!!!</li>
            <li>This is a great buy, I highly recommed it.</li>
            <li>This is also great to use for an unscented massage oil or a highly moisturizing face wash.</li>
            <li>I was told when I turned 30 by an 80 yr old woman that if I used this, I would have unwrinkled beautiful skin like HER which she attibuted to using ALBOLENE.</li>
            <li>However, I think it&#x27;s pretty good for removing eye makeup.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li>Make sure you drink water because it is easy to become dehydrated.</li>
            <li>It is light and cheap and effective.  </li>
            <li>There are no perfumes or ingredients that would irritate most sensitive skin (like mine) and the moisture properties are a great bonus.</li>
            <li>Great for sweating when working out, and for soft skin !</li>
            <li>Love this,it also smooth the stomach</li>
            <li>but is is by far a great product.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a great product by far and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Albolene Moisturizing Cleanser leaves my skin very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li>Good cleanser and good for wraps to loose water weight</li>
            <li>This cleanser is so good it is absolutely the best for skin conditions as well as useful for using on the skin for multiple purposes.</li>
            <li>Its a cool product!</li>
            <li>Arrival was very quick and I&#x27;m planning to use this when I start exercising</li>
            <li>It easily takes off waterproof eye makeup without any rubbing.</li>
            <li>Stage makeup and body paint are both part of my craft and easily wiped away with Albolene.</li>
            <li>Fully and easily removes all makeup</li>
            <li>This does the job and cleans up easily</li>
            <li>Its so easy, my eyelashes don&#x27;t get rubbed out and I never have raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>Every trace of make-up  is easily removed.</li>
            <li>Also it doesn&#x27;t rise off easily.</li>
            <li>IT REMOVES ALL MY MAKE UP AND EASILY REMOVE WATER PROOF</li>
            <li>It is just greasy but can easily be washed off.  </li>
            <li>i would recommend this product for anyone wanting a cleanser that is inexpensive, easy to use, and non-drying.</li>
            <li>too-- easy to spread in the eye</li>
            <li>This is some pretty amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>, I think this product works MUCH better than the Sweet Sweat to extract</li>
            <li>Love this product and I got the sweet sweat belt to</li>
            <li>Love it and for a fraction of the cost of Sweet Sweat</li>
            <li>Yet even the price,&lt;br /&gt;though very high,didn&#x27;t stop me from buying this, most wonderful facial cream&lt;br</li>
            <li>this stuff is better than sweat sweet.  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t even remember why I bought this in the first place</li>
            <li>Its a very good moisturizer for when you don&#x27;t want to have dry skin...</li>
            <li>It plumps up some of the fine lines I have on my face.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fine.  </li>
            <li>I checked with the EWG website first to make sure that I could use this product since I have so many skin allergies.</li>
            <li>If it all doesn&#x27;t come off that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>It works fine.</li>
            <li>This product does fine</li>
            <li>but still, I love how mild this product is.</li>
            <li>it will smooth your skin, but you won&#x27;t lose weight.  </li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I started using it as a makeup remover.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for removing make up especially lipstick stains.</li>
            <li>This stuff has been great for the last twenty years.  </li>
            <li>Arrived on time, its great on my skin, I use it to lose extra body water when working out.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product every time I work out.</li>
            <li>for myself I use it for weight loss and is a great product in my personal opinion.</li>
            <li>I simply smooth it on and wipe it off with disposable cotton towelettes that I purchased, and I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>My face is so smooth now.  </li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s so smooth.</li>
            <li>Results in clear bright skin.</li>
            <li>I truly enjoy using this to remove my eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>Also a great personal lubricant for men.</li>
            <li>There is nothing fantastic about it.</li>
            <li>Skin feel smooth afterwards</li>
            <li>Fantastic face cleansing product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>Great personal lubricant</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I finally found my true use for albolene.</li>
            <li>I wrap with plastic wrap first and then place the sweat band on top and let&#x27;s just say OMG.  </li>
            <li>It is DEFINITELY worth every penny!</li>
            <li>so hopefully it&#x27;ll last me a while, if not i will gladly buy more!</li>
            <li>originally bought this to use on my belly when working out to help burn the fat.</li>
            <li>I originally bought at a sweat</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t tried it for its original use as a makeup remover.</li>
            <li>i originally bought this to use when i work out..</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this to help me lose belly fat.</li>
            <li>My face still didn&#x27;t seem all the way clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves the face feeling clean, but moisturized.</li>
            <li>I use regularly to clean my face.</li>
            <li>Great product for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li>Its suppose to be to clean make up</li>
            <li>It also works as a substitute for lip balm and is great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great moisturizer for all areas of dry skin.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Removes all my make up, and leaves my face nice and soft!</li>
            <li>Keeps your skin soft &amp; smooth!!</li>
            <li>Loving it so far!  </li>
            <li>I recommend this cleanser as it is better for softening skin, using in intimate purposes better than other creams and lubes and will leave a pleasant afterglow on the skin area used.</li>
            <li>i heard you can use this as a weight loss similar to sweet sweat as well but seems to go on smooth  and clean easily with warm water or damped cloth.</li>
            <li>i heard you can use this as a weight loss similar to sweet sweat as well but seems to go on smooth and clean easily with warm water or damped cloth.</li>
            <li>, my make up after parting no problem anymore, also all over your body after showering specially in the winter</li>
            <li>It came to me right AWAY!</li>
            <li>right here on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Takes my make up right off !</li>
            <li>She was right!</li>
            <li>It literally takes the makeup right off in seconds!</li>
            <li>Great for moisturizing very dry skin like feet.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face nice and soft with no greasy residue</li>
            <li>I use it for my sweet sweat belt and this thing makes me sweat</li>
            <li>but it does the job good enough.</li>
            <li>I use it in the bath and it leaves everything very slippery, it works ok</li>
            <li>I have this and Sweet Sweat</li>
            <li>and I must say that this products make you really sweat better.</li>
            <li>I use it under my sweet sweat waist trimmer and also for my sons skin ( he has eczema )</li>
            <li>Okay, let me start by saying this product is for makeup removal and really works at that.</li>
            <li>This is a good, basic workhorse of a product with a versatile texture and inert, non-irritating ingredients.</li>
            <li>I wear it even when I am not working out in the true sense of the word</li>
            <li>Tried and true kinda stuff.</li>
            <li>It works with the sweet sweat.</li>
            <li>The albolene cream really works and makes you sweat more.</li>
            <li>Love it makes you sweat so much</li>
            <li>No bad reaction form my skin from using Abolene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent, but you can tell that it is there.</li>
            <li>I think with a very intense workout, abolene produces a strong sweet..</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned about using it so much, thinking I was &#x27;clogging my pores&#x27; or something, but a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office told me that this was the best type of product (oil based) to use to remove makeup because it does moisturize so well.</li>
            <li>and i can notice how clean and fresh my skin feels already.</li>
            <li>It feels like vaseline, super greasy.</li>
            <li>so it open my pores more to sweat more.</li>
            <li>Came in quick</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so quick to wash my face with this instead of soap.  </li>
            <li>Received super fast...works as stated but using it for workouts not as a makeup remover</li>
            <li>This stuff is super greasy.</li>
            <li>Because the product liquifies upon application, it is easier to spread quickly on a squirmy child.</li>
            <li>I honetly didn&#x27;t notice that I sweat more using this stuff while working out (which is the main purpose for getting the stuff).</li>
            <li>great for ppl with sensitive skin leaves it really soft</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I go through many jars of this excellent stuff</li>
            <li>I wish I could write a better and more personal review, but my wife saw it on the counter and decided it was hers.</li>
            <li>I like the lightness of the cream and the scent is mild..</li>
            <li>I bought this to use under my waist cincher to enhance sweating and drop inches quickly.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;ve tried different gels that worked a lot better if this doesn&#x27;t work for you try gel-v Beachbody its more pricey</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this over top named brands that could cost a fortune.</li>
            <li>So happy I ordered and love the results for my very dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried Vaseline and Vaseline Intensive care as well as many other lubricants and found this to be the best for this because the others all went dry way too soon</li>
            <li>It works great right now in the winter months when I really need the extra moisture.</li>
            <li>I use this on my easy days when I&#x27;m not too much working out but have on throughout day with my waist band.</li>
            <li>Today is my first day using it!</li>
            <li>With consistent use while working out you WILL lose inches!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>(It will clog your sink if you try to rinse it off without wiping it off with a tissue first!)</li>
            <li>cleans my face and definitely works with the waist trimmer belt to sweat more when i&#x27;m working out!</li>
            <li>Once I got through first mile, I adjusted trimmer and felt lots of sweat!  </li>
            <li>jar of &amp;#34; Albolene Moisturizing Cleanser &amp;#34; for my mother because she saw it on TV, and said she had used it in the past and said it was really good!</li>
            <li>Amazon sells Albolene at a reasonable price and it ships for free with the Super Saver shipment choice.  </li>
            <li>might this is more of a water weight and can be gained back easily.</li>
            <li>Its my first time to use this product and most of the review are true it makes u sweat and make ur skin soft</li>
            <li>JUST A TINY SPECK WILL DO AMAZING THINGS EVEN  REMOVE EYE MAKEUP,</li>
            <li>Securely packaged, arrived very soon after order submitted.  </li>
            <li>Saw that it is now available in a tube, which makes it very portable.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ts worth it</li>
            <li>It does tend to leave a greasy residue which my hands which is quicky absorbed after a minute or two.  </li>
            <li>However, the skin around my eyes looks and feels a lot more soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Love this ,your skin will feel so soft after using and it cleans your skin well</li>
            <li>It does exactly what Sweet Sweat does at a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Therefore, like many i googled waist trimmers and read several reviews and decided to get the sweet sweat waist trimmer and tried some of the sweet sweat gel.</li>
            <li>my waist trimmer (laugh now</li>
            <li>Not only do I use it as a makeup remover, but also a moisturizer and under my waist trimmer when I workout, so I can put up a nice sweat.</li>
            <li>It worth every penny and</li>
            <li>The most important my son has eczema and this is the only thing ( I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun</li>
            <li>but it felt kind of gross</li>
            <li>BUT its well worth it.</li>
            <li>In fact, it seems to work better at keeping my son&#x27;s skin moist and soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy, and leaves my face incredibly soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>none of the other brands ever came close to being as good as Albolene....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another good thing about this product compared to the other is that it is UNSCENTED.</li>
            <li>a pool of water drips right off ...</li>
            <li>right after</li>
            <li>Makeup slides right off</li>
            <li>I believe not using water is the best way to keep my face moisturized, however, this product is not completely removing my makeup as does my Neutrogena face wash which I remove with a wet wash cloth.</li>
            <li>I use this as a facial cleanser and it takes off makeup very easily.  </li>
            <li>you can go for a long time and it stays nice and slippery.</li>
            <li>It does amazing things to dry spots (even on my dog) .</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li>so when I received the cream I filled the empty plastic balm container with it and placed it in the freezer to set since I wasn&#x27;t sure it would not leak or hold up</li>
            <li>Abolene works way better than vaseline and does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li>The best and only way to take off heavy eye makeup.</li>
            <li>Works great...removes makeup so easily and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>Fun fact, its also a safe personal lubercant ;)</li>
            <li>you Amazon and the entire team for doing such a good job on delivering the products quickly.</li>
            <li>But for it&#x27;s original intent it apparently works great because my wife won&#x27;t let me \\&quot;waste her stuff\\&quot; anymore.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s also very good for you face ,but I recived mine broken ....</li>
            <li>I use it to wash my face and my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The dress was a size 8 and when I first tried it on ( three weeks before the wedding) and I had to breath in and hold abit in order to zip it up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had so much sweat leave my body at one time!</li>
            <li>I first learned about Albolene being used for fitness through YouTube fitness channels.</li>
            <li>the ingredients are similar but for some reason Albolene works better.</li>
            <li>Over time I have even noticed that the skin around my eyes and mouth has remained soft and smooth because of the mineral oil ingredient.</li>
            <li>Just to get rid of extra water weight and sweat more in that area.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>More sweat instantly!</li>
            <li>I first looked up YouTube videos.</li>
            <li>Well worth the buy and fast two day shipping.</li>
            <li>So I love this moisturizing cleanser not scented and doesn&#x27;t need a lot, so this should last me a while.</li>
            <li>It definitely does work well, makes you sweat more under neath the belt.</li>
            <li>I watched a video that said to use this along with a waist trainer, in which i did, and it helped so much with the rubbing!</li>
            <li>At first when I put it on I was thinking to myself why am I using  petroleum products on my face.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s enough to use for 3 months ore more</li>
            <li>I use this daily for makeup removal and it surely removes everything from your face.</li>
            <li>Albolene works very well for me!</li>
            <li>Rinsing afterwards would defeat the purpose of using it in the first place.  </li>
            <li>Now, two years later, that jar has been sitting there mostly un-used.</li>
            <li>So glad I saw the commercial because I didn&#x27;t know if Albolene was still sold.</li>
            <li>A jar will last most of a life time if this is all you use it for</li>
            <li>This is my first day using it for my workout</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it consistently, but it does make me sweat in the stomach area.</li>
            <li>I actually rub it on my arms, legs and waist to help me sweat more during workouts.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Leaves your face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s main ingredient is mineral oil rather than petroleum jelly, therefore, it liquefies quickly and turns into an almost baby oil-like consistency.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Takes off make up, dosnt burn, and came fast!</li>
            <li>I was skeptic at first, but I must admit makes me sweat,</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>I love this product although I use it for weight loss purposes because it helps you sweat extra water weight when I rub on my stomach and wrap it up.  </li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed I&#x27;ve uses it literally from head to toe</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s all that matters to me ;)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with Albolene that it became part of my daily routine for the dry skin I get from my allergies.</li>
            <li>Fantastic makeup remover and extremely gentle on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is regular vaseline , but this order was still very successful.</li>
            <li>Mineral oil has been a big cause of allergies, rushes, and irritations, and I am surprised to know that this product is mostly made of IT!</li>
            <li>have used both Sweet Sweat and Albolene back to back... and to be honest with you</li>
            <li>Makes my skin super soft!</li>
            <li>It arrived very soon and the product is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve pretty much just used soap and water.</li>
            <li>when used in the intimate places instead of all that higher priced&lt;br /&gt;junk</li>
            <li>I highly recommend both, but the Skingenixx is much better in my opinion if you want to spend the extra money!</li>
            <li>exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li>It leaves my feet super soft, which is something you can achieve with lotion,  oil, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love the product and i will order again, it helps a lot with my dry skin.</li>
            <li>A tiny bit goes a long way and feels so good on my face.</li>
            <li>It works well on large foam flies and medium flies.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty surprised when I first opened it and realized it basically looks exactly like vaseline.</li>
            <li>A fine (and cost-effective) product for personal lubrication purposes.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not only good for makeup removing but to sweat and loose weight .</li>
            <li>Love this ,works great,leaves my skin so soft and takes off my make-up so easy, even waterproff mascara,I tried so many expensive cleansers  </li>
            <li>I put a little on, rub it around, tissue off, then rinse with a warm washcloth.</li>
            <li>This is so great for heavy eyeliner and mascara!!!</li>
            <li>Good price, and this product is hard to find at stores.</li>
            <li>Really gets the sweat going</li>
            <li>This product really works for sweating the belly fat away.  </li>
            <li>therefore I want to see how much will I sweat.</li>
            <li>Very product for makeup removal too.</li>
            <li>fortunately I still had the lid from my last jar.</li>
            <li>I was really worried that I would break out after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used mascara or eyesliner, I used to have to really wipe and irritate my eyes to take off all the makeup at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>So when I ran out of it I kept the hollow plastic stick and wondered if I&#x27;d be able to use this Albolene cream with it.</li>
            <li>but it worked out very well</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It a grease, much like petroleum jelly except</li>
            <li>It is extremely gentle and removes all of my eye make-up.  </li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to worry about grease that doesn&#x27;t come off when you wipe it or wash off in the tub( who wants a greasy tub?)  </li>
            <li>I bought this because people said it worked very well with the waist trimmer belt.</li>
            <li>It really works if you put the abolene cream on, then wrap with plastic wrap, then your waist trimmer.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need as much night cream.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how much i sweat....</li>
            <li>When I apply this cream wrap with cling wrap put on my belt and start exerciseing it really works helps to make u sweat</li>
            <li>Though I haven&#x27;t used much of the Albolene, I already like it and appreciate the fact that it isn&#x27;t greasy on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really sweat from (my tummy)</li>
            <li>This really makes you sweat.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone who works out and wants to sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>It passed the test and my skin feels very silky after using this.</li>
            <li>I promise) to seal in moisture and help heal his skin I use while he is still damp straight out of the tub</li>
            <li>It really ads to the sweat I produce under my waist belt.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for Abolene.</li>
            <li>I feel my face feels so much softer in the morning.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended it!</li>
            <li>I heard about this product through a celebrity endorsement and it absolutely does work.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and versatile cleanser.</li>
            <li>I use Albolene for everything even as a moisturizer for the whole body.  </li>
            <li>I just started using it on my face and find it is a perfect cleanser to help my skin in this cold weather.</li>
            <li>Not greasy at all, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Soaks in faster than Aquaphor and really solves the chapping and redness overnight.</li>
            <li>Very greasy, smooths the skin, but doesn&#x27;t get stretch marks to go away.</li>
            <li>AND IT REALLY DOES HELP</li>
            <li>The cream really works for,  used it before gym</li>
            <li>I started using this on my feet and found that it really helps.</li>
            <li>It is very greasy</li>
            <li>I really like Albolene Moisturizing Cleanser and have been using it for years now -- it works very well for me.</li>
            <li>Very helpful for those trying to lose weight.</li>
            <li>Its really working on me.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It is very greasy though, which I don&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li>Its so very Gentle.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t  need to use much.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used it</li>
            <li>, it is not greasy it blend in to your skin, I also put it on my tattoo to heal since it has no smell thanks guys and the delivery</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>It really make you sweat.</li>
            <li>It really help get your makeup off and then use a cleaser with it or</li>
            <li>Really works sweating when your using wraps</li>
            <li>It really works i use it to work out with the sweat</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;ve really worked out once I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>well spent.:-)</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>I will give a update in the near future to share more of my ideas.</li>
            <li>It is equally effective removing everyday makeup.</li>
            <li>In the middle of the week I use something more natural like coconut oil to remove oil on my skin.</li>
            <li>Which allows your pores to be more open and clear.</li>
            <li>Mascara and lipstick come right off and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Keeps her skin from becoming too dry.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give an one star because I&#x27;m sure it should serve other purpose, but for fat burning purposes, it is not efficient.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this hoping to slather my mid section with it and use a waist band while working out.</li>
            <li>The Abolene Cleanser takes my makeup off better than any other item I have used.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m really excited to use it when it&#x27;s solid.</li>
            <li>My friend&#x27;s mom said this helped her not get as much wrinkles when she got older</li>
            <li>Then I use my regular cleanser to clean my pores.</li>
            <li>It is a good cleanser for people with dry or very dry skin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t think of a con for this product and I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a gentle, moisturizing way to remove makeup.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Recently I was at a health/supplement store when I saw the competitor&#x27;s product Sweet ___.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over 20 years and thrilled to find it on Amazon, as drugstores usually don&#x27;t stock it.  </li>
            <li>Its like trying to rub sticky slime off your face trying to get it off.. does work good to remove makeup but not good for all over face.. takes like 10 minutes of rinsing to remove residue.</li>
            <li>Glad this item came in promptly just as expected!!</li>
            <li>Trying to keep an open mind and will keep using it for a little while to give it a fair chance,.</li>
            <li>i sweated a little more when i wore it but not to much</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t yet say much about the product because it&#x27;s fairly new.</li>
            <li>Not only does it quickly and easily remove my eye makeup, it doesn&#x27;t dry and damage my sensitive skin like so many other makeup removers.</li>
            <li>My main use is for working out.</li>
            <li>Works particularly well with waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li>The consistency is the same and equally safe to remove eye make up as well as facial foundation.</li>
            <li>also use this for workouts, mainly for my abs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one last me a good six months with using some everyday.</li>
            <li>I mainly use it to remove water-proof makeup.</li>
            <li>need to stay out of the sun particularly since I&#x27;ve had skin cancer 3</li>
            <li>My dermatologist said to NOT dry off after shower; instead, rub on the albolene, which I do, and rarely use a towel.</li>
            <li>rub on desired area and opens your pours to help sweat in that particular area.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Albolene.</li>
            <li>This came highly recommended by a friend and that is why I bought it.</li>
            <li>the price was/is outrageously high for any one who doesn&#x27;t have a</li>
            <li>Be sure to wash your face after using this product or it could leave your skin feeling a little greasy.</li>
            <li>I just wished it could have been protected a little better.</li>
            <li>Amilean is thicker more like a loation where albolene is little greaser.</li>
            <li>It really leaves my skin feeling soft, I mainly brought it for weight loss purposes.</li>
            <li>So far, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>really gets the makeup off and helps the skin feel soft</li>
            <li>and I might add leaves skin feeling real soft</li>
            <li>serves its purpose and really makes you sweat used for waist trimmer while running and ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS had a trail of sweat when my workouts were complete</li>
            <li>I have very smooth,&lt;br /&gt;soft and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this on my face which is really helping to clear up my oily skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used it on my belly with the plastic wrap before working out and it really works also leaves my skin baby soft.</li>
            <li>It is a gentle product, not harsh.</li>
            <li>This helps with this problem as well as I&#x27;m able to use this to remove makeup instead of harsh cleansers.</li>
            <li>Prior to working out, I apply it to my biceps and my stomach (then put on the Sweet Sweat Waist Trimmer) and this makes me sweat so much more than usual.</li>
            <li>it was ohk, it made me sweat a little but not as much as the sweet sweat gel!</li>
            <li>I have an normal to oily face</li>
            <li>is gonna last me a long time, and it was cheap too!  </li>
            <li>However I didn&#x27;t see an difference than if I exercised normally.</li>
            <li>Still using the product, however it does have amazing results and I&#x27;ve only had it less than a month.  </li>
            <li>I am using this to help lose some tummy chubby, it makes you sweat, trim down waist size cool product !</li>
            <li>The only thing is, you&#x27;ll need to be sure to wear slippers, because it&#x27;s pretty messy if you like to walk barefoot.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try something new</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>The jar is huge and will last for several years.</li>
            <li>I use it for my super dry feet too and it works.</li>
            <li>It also leaves my skin feeling very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>After using for 2 nights of using Albolene, the soles of my feet feel are very soft.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li>It makes you skin very soft.</li>
            <li>; how slippery it was, so I bought some and WOW ! ......</li>
            <li>Hmm, I&#x27;ve only used this a couple days so verdict is still out, but my first impression was/</li>
            <li>I use a steamy hot washcloth to remove it from my face giving me a facial of sorts.</li>
            <li>not sure if I sweated more or not.</li>
            <li>Skin so soft!</li>
            <li>You only need a very small amount to get good results.</li>
            <li>In  the  morning,  after  I  clean  with  ALBOLENE,  I  apply  my  daily  facial  moisture.  </li>
            <li>The stuff is amazing if your working out and the friction lasts for ever and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve compared it to &amp;#34;sweet sweat&amp;#34; and other amazing WAY MORE EXPENSIVE products and</li>
            <li>Works really well with the Sweet Sweat waste band.</li>
            <li>I always used to put too much on my face) and wipe it off with a small towel that I run under hot water first.</li>
            <li>worth every single penny!</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim from a picture I saw, well never the less a picture is worth a thousand words!</li>
            <li>I use this product as a workout enhancer, it helps be sweat like crazy, great for getting rid of water weight</li>
            <li>Makes your skin baby soft.</li>
            <li>I have heard no comments from my husband and he has a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>And my skin tends to be sensitive and break out from sime moisturizers or skin treatments.</li>
            <li>This helps keep my skin soft and hydrated all day even my feet and elbows.</li>
            <li>This prevents any irritation to the sensitive skin in the eye area.</li>
            <li>Wow...</li>
            <li>This stuff has really helped me lose extra fat around my belly.</li>
            <li>so far-</li>
            <li>Found a very affordable alternative to discontinued Mary Kay Extra Emollient Cleanser</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t help much as far as weight loss is concerned though.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li>No workout is complete without this stuff.</li>
            <li>Just one wipe with a soft cloth or cotton ball and the makeup is all gone.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s helped them remain soft through out the day.</li>
            <li>I suddenly developed an allergy on my eyelids and the dermatologist recommended Albolene.  </li>
            <li>Purchase Albonene at my local Rite Aid;  it is very greasy when applied</li>
            <li>the only thing it did was made my stomach really grease.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and my face now seems so soft.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product because, after reading some of the reviews and friends, I was sure I would get more burning effect during my workout, however the only effect it made was to make everything dirty and sticky.</li>
            <li>It keeps them so soft.</li>
            <li>so far-</li>
            <li>comes completely off, 2.</li>
            <li>Just know if you have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li>I bought this 2 years ago and finally I&#x27;ve found a real use for it.</li>
            <li>I transferred some albolene into an old Nivea cream travel sized tin and carry it in my purse.</li>
            <li>SO FAR I AM LIKE THIS.</li>
            <li>I use this under my sweat bands and it makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li>Redheads do have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>soft</li>
            <li>Never helped as far as increasing sweat production under workout garment.</li>
            <li>I have also used it on my skin as a moisturizer, it keeps your skin soft.</li>
            <li>My two year old has excema.  </li>
            <li>Paired with a microfiber cloth, this removes all my face, lip, and eye makeup in one pass and leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Because of its petroleum base, it has wonderful staying power and is so silky to the touch.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to use it a few times for its original intended purpose which is a moisturizing makeup remover.</li>
            <li>Now, I wipe this stuff over and under my eyes where I need to remove makeup, then gently wipe away with toilet tissue.</li>
            <li>It seems to be the exact same consistency and very similar</li>
            <li>so if you have sensitive skin or skin issues its not as harsh as sweet sweat or beauty bum.</li>
            <li>Removes make-up quickly and without mess.</li>
            <li>It arrived at my house quickly and I opened the little box automatically and rubbed the Albolene all over my body then exercised.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it on smaller more delicate flies yet.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to take my makeup off at night and immediately after using started having major break outs on my face.</li>
            <li>and there is no complaining or crying as with many other creams.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m long retired,disabled and am not living high on the hog.</li>
            <li>my skin looks amazing and no need for expensive moisturizer</li>
            <li>This cleanser has a consistency similar to vaseline and is clear.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been using this product and brand for a long time in boxing and regular work out ,very helpful to lose weight and apply it before the sauna belt</li>
            <li>So whether that was a problem that was fixed later or my nose is gone, I didn&#x27;t have that</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how soft the bottoms of my feet are now that I&#x27;ve been using it regularly</li>
            <li>My skin is ALWAYS COMPLIMENTED on how I have such a young, unlined complextion...</li>
            <li>be careful not too put too much</li>
            <li>B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say Albolene works really well to help get rid of water weight, as for the longer term effects, I&#x27;m not sure since it&#x27;s my first day, but I definitely felt a difference</li>
            <li>I like this stuff you sweat a lot especially in the steam room plus your skin feels so soft</li>
            <li>I love the moisture that it leaves behind without having to add a moisturizer after washing.  </li>
            <li>However, when I received it the top was broken</li>
            <li>It is a bit thinner/greasier than the Mary Kay, but so far, the closest I have found for my sensitive, extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>however I decided this time to go to the bathroom today,  wet my face a bit and then used a little bit of baking soda that I have in the bathroom to give myself a light exfoliation...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It may seem pricey, but it really isn&#x27;t when you compare it to other moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Just really hard to clean</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than other &amp;#34;workout</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s hard to clean this off the face.</li>
            <li>It took two other face products for my skin to feel clean again and another few days my skin to clear up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m careful about sun, etc., but I really believe Albolene has been a big part of my good-around-the-eyes skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not dry.</li>
            <li>I rub it on my tummy and put on my sweet sweat waist trainer and when im done with my hard  2 hr body  workout ..</li>
            <li>I first used it to remove waterproof mascara, which led to using it everyday on my face in the shower.  </li>
            <li>My sister recently told me about Skingenixx Facial Cleanser because it is contains powerful anti-aging ingredients like green tea, collagen, and glycolic acid</li>
            <li>I am currently pregnant and can hardly wait to see what it does in aiding weight loss around my abs and thighs.</li>
            <li>I used it to lose a little water weigh for certain occasion</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this makes me sweat much other than what I do normally.</li>
            <li>A little oily but really gets the sweat pouring from the body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not irritating, not greasy, and I just use a little and wipe off with a tissue.  </li>

            <li> I love Albolene...</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  </li>
            <li> I have eczema that pops up on my hands mostly during the summer months.</li>

            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> She said it was easier to spread than Aquaphor or Eucerin, and worked better.</li>

            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> and the Skingenixx has worked even better than the Albolene for me.</li>
            <li> it does make you seem to be sweating more.</li>
            <li> Removes mascara, soothes chapped lips, and is an excellent (odorless/tasteless) personal lubricant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years.</li>
            <li> &gt; Not too many stores carried it.</li>
            <li> For awhile, Walmart in some stores had it on the shelves.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the price began rising and rising, forcing many stores even Walmart not to carry it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love Amazon purchase are always on time.</li>
            <li> Better than any hand lotion.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t using this as a makeup remover (like me) make sure you keep your body hydrated.</li>
            <li> I was using it as a pre-workout body rub to induce sweating - which it works okay at.</li>
            <li> I told the (female) agent what it was &amp; how wonderful it had been over the years.</li>
            <li> but it was ok</li>
            <li> Amazing product if you love having your face silky smooth baby but</li>
            <li> Better than vasoline.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years, but can&#x27;t find it in most stores.</li>
            <li> Outstanding for use as a lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used Albolene Moisturizing Cream off/on for most of my life.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> I love the way my body reacts during my workout.</li>
            <li> Great Item, Fast shipper, will use again.</li>
            <li> I will buy more</li>
            <li> I will be buying a lot more.</li>

            <li> This is a great buy, I highly recommed it.</li>
            <li> This is also great to use for an unscented massage oil or a highly moisturizing face wash.</li>
            <li> I was told when I turned 30 by an 80 yr old woman that if I used this, I would have unwrinkled beautiful skin like HER which she attibuted to using ALBOLENE.</li>
            <li> However, I think it&#x27;s pretty good for removing eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!!</li>
            <li> Make sure you drink water because it is easy to become dehydrated.</li>
            <li> It is light and cheap and effective.  </li>
            <li> There are no perfumes or ingredients that would irritate most sensitive skin (like mine) and the moisture properties are a great bonus.</li>
            <li> Great for sweating when working out, and for soft skin !</li>
            <li> Love this,it also smooth the stomach</li>
            <li> but is is by far a great product.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a great product by far and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Albolene Moisturizing Cleanser leaves my skin very smooth and clean.</li>
            <li> Good cleanser and good for wraps to loose water weight</li>
            <li> This cleanser is so good it is absolutely the best for skin conditions as well as useful for using on the skin for multiple purposes.</li>
            <li> Its a cool product!</li>
            <li> Arrival was very quick and I&#x27;m planning to use this when I start exercising</li>
            <li> It easily takes off waterproof eye makeup without any rubbing.</li>
            <li> Stage makeup and body paint are both part of my craft and easily wiped away with Albolene.</li>
            <li> Fully and easily removes all makeup</li>
            <li> This does the job and cleans up easily</li>
            <li> Its so easy, my eyelashes don&#x27;t get rubbed out and I never have raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Every trace of make-up  is easily removed.</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t rise off easily.</li>
            <li> IT REMOVES ALL MY MAKE UP AND EASILY REMOVE WATER PROOF</li>
            <li> It is just greasy but can easily be washed off.  </li>
            <li> i would recommend this product for anyone wanting a cleanser that is inexpensive, easy to use, and non-drying.</li>
            <li> too-- easy to spread in the eye</li>
            <li> This is some pretty amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> , I think this product works MUCH better than the Sweet Sweat to extract</li>
            <li> Love this product and I got the sweet sweat belt to</li>
            <li> Love it and for a fraction of the cost of Sweet Sweat</li>
            <li> Yet even the price,&lt;br /&gt;though very high,didn&#x27;t stop me from buying this, most wonderful facial cream&lt;br</li>
            <li> this stuff is better than sweat sweet.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t even remember why I bought this in the first place</li>
            <li> Its a very good moisturizer for when you don&#x27;t want to have dry skin...</li>
            <li> It plumps up some of the fine lines I have on my face.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fine.  </li>
            <li> I checked with the EWG website first to make sure that I could use this product since I have so many skin allergies.</li>
            <li> If it all doesn&#x27;t come off that&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> It works fine.</li>
            <li> This product does fine</li>
            <li> but still, I love how mild this product is.</li>
            <li> it will smooth your skin, but you won&#x27;t lose weight.  </li>
            <li> I liked it so much that I started using it as a makeup remover.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for removing make up especially lipstick stains.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been great for the last twenty years.  </li>
            <li> Arrived on time, its great on my skin, I use it to lose extra body water when working out.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product every time I work out.</li>
            <li> for myself I use it for weight loss and is a great product in my personal opinion.</li>
            <li> I simply smooth it on and wipe it off with disposable cotton towelettes that I purchased, and I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> My face is so smooth now.  </li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s so smooth.</li>
            <li> Results in clear bright skin.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy using this to remove my eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> Also a great personal lubricant for men.</li>

            <li> Great personal lubricant</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I finally found my true use for albolene.</li>
            <li> I wrap with plastic wrap first and then place the sweat band on top and let&#x27;s just say OMG.  </li>
            <li> It is DEFINITELY worth every penny!</li>
            <li> so hopefully it&#x27;ll last me a while, if not i will gladly buy more!</li>
            <li> originally bought this to use on my belly when working out to help burn the fat.</li>
            <li> I originally bought at a sweat</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t tried it for its original use as a makeup remover.</li>
            <li> i originally bought this to use when i work out..</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to help me lose belly fat.</li>
            <li> My face still didn&#x27;t seem all the way clean.</li>
            <li> It leaves the face feeling clean, but moisturized.</li>
            <li> I use regularly to clean my face.</li>
            <li> Great product for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Its suppose to be to clean make up</li>
            <li> It also works as a substitute for lip balm and is great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great moisturizer for all areas of dry skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Removes all my make up, and leaves my face nice and soft!</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin soft &amp; smooth!!</li>
            <li> Loving it so far!  </li>
            <li> I recommend this cleanser as it is better for softening skin, using in intimate purposes better than other creams and lubes and will leave a pleasant afterglow on the skin area used.</li>
            <li> i heard you can use this as a weight loss similar to sweet sweat as well but seems to go on smooth  and clean easily with warm water or damped cloth.</li>
            <li> i heard you can use this as a weight loss similar to sweet sweat as well but seems to go on smooth and clean easily with warm water or damped cloth.</li>
            <li> , my make up after parting no problem anymore, also all over your body after showering specially in the winter</li>
            <li> It came to me right AWAY!</li>
            <li> right here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Takes my make up right off !</li>
            <li> She was right!</li>
            <li> It literally takes the makeup right off in seconds!</li>
            <li> Great for moisturizing very dry skin like feet.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face nice and soft with no greasy residue</li>
            <li> I use it for my sweet sweat belt and this thing makes me sweat</li>
            <li> but it does the job good enough.</li>
            <li> I use it in the bath and it leaves everything very slippery, it works ok</li>
            <li> I have this and Sweet Sweat</li>
            <li> and I must say that this products make you really sweat better.</li>
            <li> I use it under my sweet sweat waist trimmer and also for my sons skin ( he has eczema )</li>
            <li> Okay, let me start by saying this product is for makeup removal and really works at that.</li>
            <li> This is a good, basic workhorse of a product with a versatile texture and inert, non-irritating ingredients.</li>
            <li> I wear it even when I am not working out in the true sense of the word</li>
            <li> Tried and true kinda stuff.</li>
            <li> It works with the sweet sweat.</li>
            <li> The albolene cream really works and makes you sweat more.</li>
            <li> Love it makes you sweat so much</li>
            <li> No bad reaction form my skin from using Abolene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad scent, but you can tell that it is there.</li>
            <li> I think with a very intense workout, abolene produces a strong sweet..</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about using it so much, thinking I was &#x27;clogging my pores&#x27; or something, but a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office told me that this was the best type of product (oil based) to use to remove makeup because it does moisturize so well.</li>
            <li> and i can notice how clean and fresh my skin feels already.</li>
            <li> It feels like vaseline, super greasy.</li>
            <li> so it open my pores more to sweat more.</li>
            <li> Came in quick</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quick to wash my face with this instead of soap.  </li>
            <li> Received super fast...works as stated but using it for workouts not as a makeup remover</li>
            <li> This stuff is super greasy.</li>
            <li> Because the product liquifies upon application, it is easier to spread quickly on a squirmy child.</li>
            <li> I honetly didn&#x27;t notice that I sweat more using this stuff while working out (which is the main purpose for getting the stuff).</li>
            <li> great for ppl with sensitive skin leaves it really soft</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I go through many jars of this excellent stuff</li>
            <li> I wish I could write a better and more personal review, but my wife saw it on the counter and decided it was hers.</li>
            <li> I like the lightness of the cream and the scent is mild..</li>
            <li> I bought this to use under my waist cincher to enhance sweating and drop inches quickly.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;ve tried different gels that worked a lot better if this doesn&#x27;t work for you try gel-v Beachbody its more pricey</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this over top named brands that could cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> So happy I ordered and love the results for my very dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried Vaseline and Vaseline Intensive care as well as many other lubricants and found this to be the best for this because the others all went dry way too soon</li>
            <li> It works great right now in the winter months when I really need the extra moisture.</li>
            <li> I use this on my easy days when I&#x27;m not too much working out but have on throughout day with my waist band.</li>
            <li> Today is my first day using it!</li>
            <li> With consistent use while working out you WILL lose inches!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> (It will clog your sink if you try to rinse it off without wiping it off with a tissue first!)</li>
            <li> cleans my face and definitely works with the waist trimmer belt to sweat more when i&#x27;m working out!</li>
            <li> Once I got through first mile, I adjusted trimmer and felt lots of sweat!  </li>
            <li> jar of &amp;#34; Albolene Moisturizing Cleanser &amp;#34; for my mother because she saw it on TV, and said she had used it in the past and said it was really good!</li>
            <li> Amazon sells Albolene at a reasonable price and it ships for free with the Super Saver shipment choice.  </li>
            <li> might this is more of a water weight and can be gained back easily.</li>
            <li> Its my first time to use this product and most of the review are true it makes u sweat and make ur skin soft</li>
            <li> JUST A TINY SPECK WILL DO AMAZING THINGS EVEN  REMOVE EYE MAKEUP,</li>
            <li> Securely packaged, arrived very soon after order submitted.  </li>
            <li> Saw that it is now available in a tube, which makes it very portable.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ts worth it</li>
            <li> It does tend to leave a greasy residue which my hands which is quicky absorbed after a minute or two.  </li>
            <li> However, the skin around my eyes looks and feels a lot more soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Love this ,your skin will feel so soft after using and it cleans your skin well</li>
            <li> It does exactly what Sweet Sweat does at a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Therefore, like many i googled waist trimmers and read several reviews and decided to get the sweet sweat waist trimmer and tried some of the sweet sweat gel.</li>
            <li> my waist trimmer (laugh now</li>
            <li> Not only do I use it as a makeup remover, but also a moisturizer and under my waist trimmer when I workout, so I can put up a nice sweat.</li>
            <li> It worth every penny and</li>
            <li> The most important my son has eczema and this is the only thing ( I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun</li>
            <li> but it felt kind of gross</li>
            <li> BUT its well worth it.</li>
            <li> In fact, it seems to work better at keeping my son&#x27;s skin moist and soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, easy, and leaves my face incredibly soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> none of the other brands ever came close to being as good as Albolene....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another good thing about this product compared to the other is that it is UNSCENTED.</li>
            <li> a pool of water drips right off ...</li>
            <li> right after</li>
            <li> Makeup slides right off</li>
            <li> I believe not using water is the best way to keep my face moisturized, however, this product is not completely removing my makeup as does my Neutrogena face wash which I remove with a wet wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I use this as a facial cleanser and it takes off makeup very easily.  </li>
            <li> you can go for a long time and it stays nice and slippery.</li>
            <li> It does amazing things to dry spots (even on my dog) .</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery.</li>
            <li> so when I received the cream I filled the empty plastic balm container with it and placed it in the freezer to set since I wasn&#x27;t sure it would not leak or hold up</li>
            <li> Abolene works way better than vaseline and does not dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> The best and only way to take off heavy eye makeup.</li>
            <li> Works great...removes makeup so easily and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> Fun fact, its also a safe personal lubercant ;)</li>
            <li> you Amazon and the entire team for doing such a good job on delivering the products quickly.</li>
            <li> But for it&#x27;s original intent it apparently works great because my wife won&#x27;t let me \\&quot;waste her stuff\\&quot; anymore.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s also very good for you face ,but I recived mine broken ....</li>
            <li> I use it to wash my face and my skin is soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The dress was a size 8 and when I first tried it on ( three weeks before the wedding) and I had to breath in and hold abit in order to zip it up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had so much sweat leave my body at one time!</li>
            <li> I first learned about Albolene being used for fitness through YouTube fitness channels.</li>
            <li> the ingredients are similar but for some reason Albolene works better.</li>
            <li> Over time I have even noticed that the skin around my eyes and mouth has remained soft and smooth because of the mineral oil ingredient.</li>
            <li> Just to get rid of extra water weight and sweat more in that area.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> More sweat instantly!</li>
            <li> I first looked up YouTube videos.</li>
            <li> Well worth the buy and fast two day shipping.</li>
            <li> So I love this moisturizing cleanser not scented and doesn&#x27;t need a lot, so this should last me a while.</li>
            <li> It definitely does work well, makes you sweat more under neath the belt.</li>
            <li> I watched a video that said to use this along with a waist trainer, in which i did, and it helped so much with the rubbing!</li>
            <li> At first when I put it on I was thinking to myself why am I using  petroleum products on my face.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s enough to use for 3 months ore more</li>
            <li> I use this daily for makeup removal and it surely removes everything from your face.</li>
            <li> Albolene works very well for me!</li>
            <li> Rinsing afterwards would defeat the purpose of using it in the first place.  </li>
            <li> Now, two years later, that jar has been sitting there mostly un-used.</li>
            <li> So glad I saw the commercial because I didn&#x27;t know if Albolene was still sold.</li>
            <li> A jar will last most of a life time if this is all you use it for</li>
            <li> This is my first day using it for my workout</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it consistently, but it does make me sweat in the stomach area.</li>
            <li> I actually rub it on my arms, legs and waist to help me sweat more during workouts.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Leaves your face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s main ingredient is mineral oil rather than petroleum jelly, therefore, it liquefies quickly and turns into an almost baby oil-like consistency.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Takes off make up, dosnt burn, and came fast!</li>
            <li> I was skeptic at first, but I must admit makes me sweat,</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this product although I use it for weight loss purposes because it helps you sweat extra water weight when I rub on my stomach and wrap it up.  </li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed I&#x27;ve uses it literally from head to toe</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s all that matters to me ;)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with Albolene that it became part of my daily routine for the dry skin I get from my allergies.</li>
            <li> Fantastic makeup remover and extremely gentle on my very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is regular vaseline , but this order was still very successful.</li>
            <li> Mineral oil has been a big cause of allergies, rushes, and irritations, and I am surprised to know that this product is mostly made of IT!</li>
            <li> have used both Sweet Sweat and Albolene back to back... and to be honest with you</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> It arrived very soon and the product is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve pretty much just used soap and water.</li>
            <li> when used in the intimate places instead of all that higher priced&lt;br /&gt;junk</li>
            <li> I highly recommend both, but the Skingenixx is much better in my opinion if you want to spend the extra money!</li>
            <li> exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li> It leaves my feet super soft, which is something you can achieve with lotion,  oil, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love the product and i will order again, it helps a lot with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a long way and feels so good on my face.</li>
            <li> It works well on large foam flies and medium flies.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised when I first opened it and realized it basically looks exactly like vaseline.</li>
            <li> A fine (and cost-effective) product for personal lubrication purposes.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not only good for makeup removing but to sweat and loose weight .</li>
            <li> Love this ,works great,leaves my skin so soft and takes off my make-up so easy, even waterproff mascara,I tried so many expensive cleansers  </li>
            <li> I put a little on, rub it around, tissue off, then rinse with a warm washcloth.</li>
            <li> This is so great for heavy eyeliner and mascara!!!</li>
            <li> Good price, and this product is hard to find at stores.</li>
            <li> Really gets the sweat going</li>
            <li> This product really works for sweating the belly fat away.  </li>
            <li> therefore I want to see how much will I sweat.</li>
            <li> Very product for makeup removal too.</li>
            <li> fortunately I still had the lid from my last jar.</li>
            <li> I was really worried that I would break out after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used mascara or eyesliner, I used to have to really wipe and irritate my eyes to take off all the makeup at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> So when I ran out of it I kept the hollow plastic stick and wondered if I&#x27;d be able to use this Albolene cream with it.</li>
            <li> but it worked out very well</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It a grease, much like petroleum jelly except</li>
            <li> It is extremely gentle and removes all of my eye make-up.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to worry about grease that doesn&#x27;t come off when you wipe it or wash off in the tub( who wants a greasy tub?)  </li>
            <li> I bought this because people said it worked very well with the waist trimmer belt.</li>
            <li> It really works if you put the abolene cream on, then wrap with plastic wrap, then your waist trimmer.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need as much night cream.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much i sweat....</li>
            <li> When I apply this cream wrap with cling wrap put on my belt and start exerciseing it really works helps to make u sweat</li>
            <li> Though I haven&#x27;t used much of the Albolene, I already like it and appreciate the fact that it isn&#x27;t greasy on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really sweat from (my tummy)</li>
            <li> This really makes you sweat.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone who works out and wants to sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> It passed the test and my skin feels very silky after using this.</li>
            <li> I promise) to seal in moisture and help heal his skin I use while he is still damp straight out of the tub</li>
            <li> It really ads to the sweat I produce under my waist belt.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for Abolene.</li>
            <li> I feel my face feels so much softer in the morning.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended it!</li>
            <li> I heard about this product through a celebrity endorsement and it absolutely does work.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and versatile cleanser.</li>
            <li> I use Albolene for everything even as a moisturizer for the whole body.  </li>
            <li> I just started using it on my face and find it is a perfect cleanser to help my skin in this cold weather.</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Soaks in faster than Aquaphor and really solves the chapping and redness overnight.</li>
            <li> Very greasy, smooths the skin, but doesn&#x27;t get stretch marks to go away.</li>
            <li> AND IT REALLY DOES HELP</li>
            <li> The cream really works for,  used it before gym</li>
            <li> I started using this on my feet and found that it really helps.</li>
            <li> It is very greasy</li>
            <li> I really like Albolene Moisturizing Cleanser and have been using it for years now -- it works very well for me.</li>
            <li> Very helpful for those trying to lose weight.</li>
            <li> Its really working on me.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> It is very greasy though, which I don&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li> Its so very Gentle.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t  need to use much.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it</li>
            <li> , it is not greasy it blend in to your skin, I also put it on my tattoo to heal since it has no smell thanks guys and the delivery</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> It really make you sweat.</li>
            <li> It really help get your makeup off and then use a cleaser with it or</li>
            <li> Really works sweating when your using wraps</li>
            <li> It really works i use it to work out with the sweat</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve really worked out once I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> well spent.:-)</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> I will give a update in the near future to share more of my ideas.</li>
            <li> It is equally effective removing everyday makeup.</li>
            <li> In the middle of the week I use something more natural like coconut oil to remove oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> Which allows your pores to be more open and clear.</li>
            <li> Mascara and lipstick come right off and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Keeps her skin from becoming too dry.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give an one star because I&#x27;m sure it should serve other purpose, but for fat burning purposes, it is not efficient.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this hoping to slather my mid section with it and use a waist band while working out.</li>
            <li> The Abolene Cleanser takes my makeup off better than any other item I have used.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m really excited to use it when it&#x27;s solid.</li>
            <li> My friend&#x27;s mom said this helped her not get as much wrinkles when she got older</li>
            <li> Then I use my regular cleanser to clean my pores.</li>
            <li> It is a good cleanser for people with dry or very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of a con for this product and I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a gentle, moisturizing way to remove makeup.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Recently I was at a health/supplement store when I saw the competitor&#x27;s product Sweet ___.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 20 years and thrilled to find it on Amazon, as drugstores usually don&#x27;t stock it.  </li>
            <li> Its like trying to rub sticky slime off your face trying to get it off.. does work good to remove makeup but not good for all over face.. takes like 10 minutes of rinsing to remove residue.</li>
            <li> Glad this item came in promptly just as expected!!</li>
            <li> Trying to keep an open mind and will keep using it for a little while to give it a fair chance,.</li>
            <li> i sweated a little more when i wore it but not to much</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t yet say much about the product because it&#x27;s fairly new.</li>
            <li> Not only does it quickly and easily remove my eye makeup, it doesn&#x27;t dry and damage my sensitive skin like so many other makeup removers.</li>
            <li> My main use is for working out.</li>
            <li> Works particularly well with waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> The consistency is the same and equally safe to remove eye make up as well as facial foundation.</li>
            <li> also use this for workouts, mainly for my abs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one last me a good six months with using some everyday.</li>
            <li> I mainly use it to remove water-proof makeup.</li>
            <li> need to stay out of the sun particularly since I&#x27;ve had skin cancer 3</li>
            <li> My dermatologist said to NOT dry off after shower; instead, rub on the albolene, which I do, and rarely use a towel.</li>
            <li> rub on desired area and opens your pours to help sweat in that particular area.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend Albolene.</li>
            <li> This came highly recommended by a friend and that is why I bought it.</li>
            <li> the price was/is outrageously high for any one who doesn&#x27;t have a</li>
            <li> Be sure to wash your face after using this product or it could leave your skin feeling a little greasy.</li>
            <li> I just wished it could have been protected a little better.</li>
            <li> Amilean is thicker more like a loation where albolene is little greaser.</li>
            <li> It really leaves my skin feeling soft, I mainly brought it for weight loss purposes.</li>
            <li> So far, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> really gets the makeup off and helps the skin feel soft</li>
            <li> and I might add leaves skin feeling real soft</li>
            <li> serves its purpose and really makes you sweat used for waist trimmer while running and ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS had a trail of sweat when my workouts were complete</li>
            <li> I have very smooth,&lt;br /&gt;soft and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my face which is really helping to clear up my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on my belly with the plastic wrap before working out and it really works also leaves my skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> It is a gentle product, not harsh.</li>
            <li> This helps with this problem as well as I&#x27;m able to use this to remove makeup instead of harsh cleansers.</li>
            <li> Prior to working out, I apply it to my biceps and my stomach (then put on the Sweet Sweat Waist Trimmer) and this makes me sweat so much more than usual.</li>
            <li> it was ohk, it made me sweat a little but not as much as the sweet sweat gel!</li>
            <li> I have an normal to oily face</li>
            <li> is gonna last me a long time, and it was cheap too!  </li>
            <li> However I didn&#x27;t see an difference than if I exercised normally.</li>
            <li> Still using the product, however it does have amazing results and I&#x27;ve only had it less than a month.  </li>
            <li> I am using this to help lose some tummy chubby, it makes you sweat, trim down waist size cool product !</li>
            <li> The only thing is, you&#x27;ll need to be sure to wear slippers, because it&#x27;s pretty messy if you like to walk barefoot.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try something new</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> The jar is huge and will last for several years.</li>
            <li> I use it for my super dry feet too and it works.</li>
            <li> It also leaves my skin feeling very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> After using for 2 nights of using Albolene, the soles of my feet feel are very soft.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> It makes you skin very soft.</li>
            <li> ; how slippery it was, so I bought some and WOW ! ......</li>
            <li> Hmm, I&#x27;ve only used this a couple days so verdict is still out, but my first impression was/</li>
            <li> I use a steamy hot washcloth to remove it from my face giving me a facial of sorts.</li>
            <li> not sure if I sweated more or not.</li>
            <li> Skin so soft!</li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount to get good results.</li>
            <li> In  the  morning,  after  I  clean  with  ALBOLENE,  I  apply  my  daily  facial  moisture.  </li>
            <li> The stuff is amazing if your working out and the friction lasts for ever and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve compared it to &amp;#34;sweet sweat&amp;#34; and other amazing WAY MORE EXPENSIVE products and</li>
            <li> Works really well with the Sweet Sweat waste band.</li>
            <li> I always used to put too much on my face) and wipe it off with a small towel that I run under hot water first.</li>
            <li> worth every single penny!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim from a picture I saw, well never the less a picture is worth a thousand words!</li>
            <li> I use this product as a workout enhancer, it helps be sweat like crazy, great for getting rid of water weight</li>
            <li> Makes your skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> I have heard no comments from my husband and he has a sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> And my skin tends to be sensitive and break out from sime moisturizers or skin treatments.</li>
            <li> This helps keep my skin soft and hydrated all day even my feet and elbows.</li>
            <li> This prevents any irritation to the sensitive skin in the eye area.</li>
            <li> Wow...</li>
            <li> This stuff has really helped me lose extra fat around my belly.</li>
            <li> so far-</li>
            <li> Found a very affordable alternative to discontinued Mary Kay Extra Emollient Cleanser</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help much as far as weight loss is concerned though.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling soft.</li>
            <li> No workout is complete without this stuff.</li>
            <li> Just one wipe with a soft cloth or cotton ball and the makeup is all gone.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s helped them remain soft through out the day.</li>
            <li> I suddenly developed an allergy on my eyelids and the dermatologist recommended Albolene.  </li>
            <li> Purchase Albonene at my local Rite Aid;  it is very greasy when applied</li>
            <li> the only thing it did was made my stomach really grease.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and my face now seems so soft.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product because, after reading some of the reviews and friends, I was sure I would get more burning effect during my workout, however the only effect it made was to make everything dirty and sticky.</li>
            <li> It keeps them so soft.</li>
            <li> so far-</li>
            <li> comes completely off, 2.</li>
            <li> Just know if you have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 years ago and finally I&#x27;ve found a real use for it.</li>
            <li> I transferred some albolene into an old Nivea cream travel sized tin and carry it in my purse.</li>
            <li> SO FAR I AM LIKE THIS.</li>
            <li> I use this under my sweat bands and it makes my skin so soft</li>
            <li> Redheads do have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> soft</li>
            <li> Never helped as far as increasing sweat production under workout garment.</li>
            <li> I have also used it on my skin as a moisturizer, it keeps your skin soft.</li>
            <li> My two year old has excema.  </li>
            <li> Paired with a microfiber cloth, this removes all my face, lip, and eye makeup in one pass and leaves my skin soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Because of its petroleum base, it has wonderful staying power and is so silky to the touch.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to use it a few times for its original intended purpose which is a moisturizing makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Now, I wipe this stuff over and under my eyes where I need to remove makeup, then gently wipe away with toilet tissue.</li>
            <li> It seems to be the exact same consistency and very similar</li>
            <li> so if you have sensitive skin or skin issues its not as harsh as sweet sweat or beauty bum.</li>
            <li> Removes make-up quickly and without mess.</li>
            <li> It arrived at my house quickly and I opened the little box automatically and rubbed the Albolene all over my body then exercised.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on smaller more delicate flies yet.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to take my makeup off at night and immediately after using started having major break outs on my face.</li>
            <li> and there is no complaining or crying as with many other creams.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m long retired,disabled and am not living high on the hog.</li>
            <li> my skin looks amazing and no need for expensive moisturizer</li>
            <li> This cleanser has a consistency similar to vaseline and is clear.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product and brand for a long time in boxing and regular work out ,very helpful to lose weight and apply it before the sauna belt</li>
            <li> So whether that was a problem that was fixed later or my nose is gone, I didn&#x27;t have that</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how soft the bottoms of my feet are now that I&#x27;ve been using it regularly</li>
            <li> My skin is ALWAYS COMPLIMENTED on how I have such a young, unlined complextion...</li>
            <li> be careful not too put too much</li>
            <li> B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say Albolene works really well to help get rid of water weight, as for the longer term effects, I&#x27;m not sure since it&#x27;s my first day, but I definitely felt a difference</li>
            <li> I like this stuff you sweat a lot especially in the steam room plus your skin feels so soft</li>
            <li> I love the moisture that it leaves behind without having to add a moisturizer after washing.  </li>
            <li> However, when I received it the top was broken</li>
            <li> It is a bit thinner/greasier than the Mary Kay, but so far, the closest I have found for my sensitive, extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> however I decided this time to go to the bathroom today,  wet my face a bit and then used a little bit of baking soda that I have in the bathroom to give myself a light exfoliation...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may seem pricey, but it really isn&#x27;t when you compare it to other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Just really hard to clean</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than other &amp;#34;workout</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to clean this off the face.</li>
            <li> It took two other face products for my skin to feel clean again and another few days my skin to clear up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m careful about sun, etc., but I really believe Albolene has been a big part of my good-around-the-eyes skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not dry.</li>
            <li> I rub it on my tummy and put on my sweet sweat waist trainer and when im done with my hard  2 hr body  workout ..</li>
            <li> I first used it to remove waterproof mascara, which led to using it everyday on my face in the shower.  </li>
            <li> My sister recently told me about Skingenixx Facial Cleanser because it is contains powerful anti-aging ingredients like green tea, collagen, and glycolic acid</li>
            <li> I am currently pregnant and can hardly wait to see what it does in aiding weight loss around my abs and thighs.</li>
            <li> I used it to lose a little water weigh for certain occasion</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this makes me sweat much other than what I do normally.</li>
            <li> A little oily but really gets the sweat pouring from the body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not irritating, not greasy, and I just use a little and wipe off with a tissue.  </li>
            <li> It really does open your pores and makes you sweat and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> also use it as an all over moisturizer and it has helped my extreme sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I recently in the last few months added in using cetaphil sensitive bar soap and a electric facial brush</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that has dry patches due to my lupus rash flare ups.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really hard to get off of your face, it takes a really hot wash cloth to remove this stuff.</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s a little more expensive than buying it directly in the shop but</li>
            <li> my skin is much softer and not as flaky as usual.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I will be using it in my routine from now on.</li>
            <li> It also last long as you don&#x27;t need to use alot.</li>
            <li> Last a long time.</li>
            <li> A tiny bit of Albolene goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early twenties and my face seems to break out due to dry skin.</li>
            <li> and it definitely works wonders on dry feet and hands .</li>
            <li> I often leave a dab on my lips before going to bed at night to keep them moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Albolene is reasonably priced for the effectiveness and quantity which lasts a couple of months at least with daily use.</li>
            <li> In the early years, I paid less than five dollars a jar.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> The cream my dermatologist prescribed was so expensive and really did not help that much.</li>
            <li> He sent her home one day with one blue tin and one pink tin (yes tins back then!)of Albolene Creme.</li>
            <li> because Albolene is a solid at room temperature, it provides the same occlusive barrier as those other products.</li>
            <li> have much fewer eye wrinkles, where the Albolene has been in contact, than any of my friends in their late 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Then the day of the wedding I put on my long flowing dress</li>
            <li> It does work as long as you work along with it.</li>
            <li> I use Albolene for removing make-up; it also helps heal minor cuts and scratches.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stopped using it long ago.</li>
            <li> After half mile, felt tingling and extra heat on back.  </li>
            <li> regiment consisted of rubbing Albolene on my mid area, taking Saran Wrap ( or basic store brand plastic wrap) and wrap it around my mid area going around at least three times, then wrapping a neoprene waist trimmer belt ( can find one in Marshall&#x27;s for 5.99), lastly, hitting the treadmill or stepper for 45 minutes atleast 4 times a week.</li>
            <li> ..........it stays as long as &amp;#34;you&amp;#34; can, believe me, even by yourself.......!.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe it took me so long to find this product!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has a problem with dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it for my dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin is so dry; this helps lock in the moisture.  </li>
            <li> I have a use a towel to dry off....</li>
            <li> This my wife uses for her dry skin on her feet.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of problems with dry, cracked skin on my feet.  </li>
            <li> It provides additional moisturizer for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> also I used it because my feet feels dry and it helped to keep them moist</li>
            <li> I also use this for dry winter skin</li>
            <li> But now, I just use it as a makeup remover, &amp; moisturizer when my skin gets dry or flaky.</li>
            <li> Albolene is not as thick as Vasoline but its main ingredient is petrolatum (Vasoline) and it melts into the skin.  </li>
            <li> Skin feels soft for a little due to the paraffin.</li>
            <li> During the cold months of the year I find Albolene helps my dry skin better than any other product.</li>
            <li> but I found out that Pond&#x27;s Original Cold Cream got bought out and now uses a different formula.</li>
            <li> So everyday use by  general consumers makes this a supreme makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I suffer from ecxema and my skin is so soft, no more dark patches on my back.</li>
            <li> I bought this to substitute my sweet sweat, but it failed.</li>
            <li> However, it is also used for people trying to loose weight.</li>
            <li> and Amazon was the only place that I could track it down.</li>
            <li> My belly has definitely slimmed down.</li>
            <li> Once I took off the waist trimmer, sweat was literally dripping off the waist trimmer and all down my torso and back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it since November and now, in April, still have about half the tub left.</li>
            <li> A small amount will last you an entire session.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I brought this product for my very dry and flaky skin on my feet and since I have been using the moisturizing cleanser</li>
            <li> My mom let me borrow some of hers once when my face was very dry and scaly after I had a rash.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> My skin is very, very dry and this cream has been so helpful.</li>
            <li> only  been  using  it  for  a  little  over  1  week  </li>
            <li> (just a little dab is enough!</li>
            <li> but it also left me with a little rash</li>
            <li> It enduces the sweat during my workout as well as keeps my skin moisturized due to the neoprene material is comparatively to rubber...which can dry out skin...</li>
            <li> dry with these other creams.</li>
            <li> makes my skin look and feel smooth even in the cold weather</li>
            <li> i usually have to reapply something to my skin but using this last a long time i can even skip a day even after i take a shower</li>
            <li> A few of the reviews mentioned the \\&quot;overpowering\\&quot; smell of Abolene, but personally I couldn&#x27;t smell it.</li>
            <li> It is water soluable so a wet washcloth does the trick.</li>
            <li> my clothes be so wet.</li>
            <li> I will buy again once my jar is empty....</li>
            <li> Gave this a 4 because it came sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like Vaseline, I rub on a minimal amount and am sweating in 5mins.</li>
            <li> Got what I expected.</li>
            <li> The product came in on time and was packaged/sealed very well (it arrived with other items ordered that were very delicate).</li>
            <li> My skin is dry now where in places that have previously been oily.  </li>
            <li> If you want to loose the belly weight rub it on and cover with seram wrap!!</li>
            <li> I use it to treat my son&#x27;s diaper rash, it doesn&#x27;t smell like the other stuff, it doesn&#x27;t hurt him at all, and</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Now it feels heavier and does not exactly liquify.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet only been using for a week with the waist trimmer belt.</li>
            <li> I have not used it in any other way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try it for the other purpose and see how that goes.</li>
            <li> Not really their fault since I didn&#x27;t read the ingredients, but buyer beware!</li>
            <li> I use it as a moisturizer as well as a make up remover and for other things also.</li>
            <li> I had given up removing my makeup all the way at night because it was less damaging than using any other makeup removers.</li>
            <li> I am 62 now and look at least 20 years younger!</li>
            <li> I rubbed it all over my body, from my face and neck area down to my anckles.</li>
            <li> my midsection has went down a lot since I have been using this product</li>
            <li> yes i wouldnt give it a thumbs up or down ....</li>
            <li> /&gt;The price here on Amazon is exactly HALF of what they charge at CVS &amp; RiteAid</li>
            <li> I put my little black on dress for the weddings rehearsal dinner....</li>
            <li> It is a thick gel-like cleanser that works well on my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I wore my waist trainer for a couple hours and it made me sweat a little.</li>
            <li> I brought a waist belt to use w/ this product to help me shed my little tummy.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the advice of a friend who also has a little kid with eczema who requires after-bath &amp;#34;greasing&amp;#34; each night.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product about a little over a month ago...</li>
            <li> its cost and a little bit does go along ways.&lt;br /&gt;Rev</li>
            <li> plus you can get it in little pack to take on trips</li>
            <li> A little oily for a face cleanser though.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with breaking out after using this for a little over a month.</li>
            <li> I saw the makeup break down with very little effort.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> that dries up and disappears in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to slather it on as others have mentioned because it is greasy and as bit messy.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive eyes and wear eye makeup you cannot go wrong with using albolene to remove it.</li>
            <li> This is a staple for folks in stage plays who use this to take off heavy, gooped-on make-up.  </li>
            <li> I tote this around everyday to my cycling class.  </li>
            <li> And while I don&#x27;t usually bother to measure my waist, few times I have, there is a difference.</li>
            <li> I have a friend whose jogging bra rubs her raw in marathons, so I will recommend.  </li>
            <li> I rub it around my waist and use a pink wrap and a waist belt and it makes me sweat like crazy and lose a lot of weight off my stomach and back.</li>
            <li> Oh and I enclosed a little photo of my tummy!</li>
            <li> but I was shocked and how much dirt my skin released.</li>
            <li> I have used Albolene for the past 15 years as a makeup remover.</li>
            <li> My mom taught me to use Cold Cream to remove makeup but as an adult</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if it happened during delivery.  </li>
            <li> I sweated but didn&#x27;t receive the excessive sweat everyone else did.</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re supposed to keep this on or wipe it off.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this item for the past couple days</li>
            <li> I am usually dripping sweat and my clothes can be rung out after I workout.</li>
            <li> Was desperately searching for Mary Kay Extra Emollient Cleanser -- which has been discontinued for reasons that mystify -- when I came across a few suggestions to try this instead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to sweat while working out</li>
            <li> Hard to take off</li>
            <li> Hard about it from a boxing gym.</li>
            <li> Laughing I asked her to find one wrinkle on my face, hard as she tried she couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> using paper tissue would leave traces, using towel would make the towel hard to wash.</li>
            <li> I work out hard and I wear my cincher along with this product</li>
            <li> a little goes along way!!</li>
            <li> this is THICK.  </li>
            <li> and/or were too thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> and i mean i sweat bt</li>
            <li> might seem pricey but the jar seriously lasts forever.</li>
            <li> It works just as well, comes in a vat-sized container, and is ridiculously inexpensive to use.</li>
            <li> I use it to combat dry hands during cold weather.</li>
            <li> idea that it will help you lose weight is really ridiculous though.</li>

            <li> THE JAR CAME BROKEN</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really gets the sweat going</li>
            <li> Makes your skin baby soft.</li>
            <li> works very nicely for makeup removal and moisturization.  I use it to remove my eye make up as well.  It leaves your face nice and soft with no greasy residue</li>
            <li> this is bulls***. don&#x27;t waste your money.  it will smooth your skin, but you won&#x27;t lose weight.  you can warp anything around your waist with this product under it, you will not receive results.  if there is a cream or solution out there that helps you lose weight, this ain&#x27;t the one.</li>
            <li> It arrived very soon and the product is exactly what I wanted, It&#x27;s a little more expensive than buying it directly in the shop but i&#x27;ts worth it</li>
            <li> This product really works for sweating the belly fat away.  I wrap with plastic wrap first and then place the sweat band on top and let&#x27;s just say OMG.  When I took the plastic wrap off Sweat poured to the floor to where I had to mop it up no kidding. I jogged and run on the treadmill for 45 minutes twice a day.  Going back to the doctor one week later for a physical I lost 6 pounds.</li>
            <li> Works great with my waist trainer</li>
            <li> really good aide in trying too sweat during my workout</li>
            <li> A bit to greasy for me sort of reminds me of vaseline.. I did see dirt lifted up. But after i cotton balled it off instead of water like directons say to do. My face still didn&#x27;t seem all the way clean.</li>
            <li> Removes make-up quickly and without mess.</li>
            <li> All around great product. I just started using it for eczema and it seems to be working well. My main use is for working out. Apply a generous amount of Albolene to the belly and wrap your belly with saran wrap before putting on your waist trainer. The Albolene helps to melt the belly fat away.</li>
            <li> Arrival was very quick and I&#x27;m planning to use this when I start exercising therefore I want to see how much will I sweat. I will be starting next week and I see what it does....</li>
            <li> I love this. It makes me sweat at the gym!  A trainer told me to get this</li>
            <li> I use this as a facial cleanser and it takes off makeup very easily.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my sensitive skin.  This stuff also works on problem areas to take off inches.  Just rub some on then put a belly band on before your workout.  It sweats the inches off.  Fun fact, its also a safe personal lubercant ;)</li>
            <li> This product felt like putting crisco on my skin.  I felt like I had wax on my face.  I wiped it off and my face immediately started breaking out.  It took two other face products for my skin to feel clean again and another few days my skin to clear up.  I have very sensitive skin that has dry patches due to my lupus rash flare ups.  I&#x27;ll stick with Cetaphil.</li>
            <li> Oh my oprahh!!! This makes you sweat buckets. After my rockin body workout when I take it off ... sweat is everywhere. Even sipped through my undies. Very product for makeup removal too. Removed my matte lipstick well</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great value.  It came to me right AWAY!</li>
            <li> A few of the reviews mentioned the \\&quot;overpowering\\&quot; smell of Abolene, but personally I couldn&#x27;t smell it. I have heard no comments from my husband and he has a sensitive nose. So whether that was a problem that was fixed later or my nose is gone, I didn&#x27;t have that experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the experience I did have. My skin is dry now where in places that have previously been oily.  And my skin tends to be sensitive and break out from sime moisturizers or skin treatments. So I read an article in a woman&#x27;s magazine where their panel reviewed various skin treatments and this sounded like it could work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it does. I use it to wash my face and my skin is soft and smooth. It plumps up some of the fine lines I have on my face. I have also used Abolene as a moisturizer for my body. Just one application to my elbows made a world of difference to my elbows. No bad reaction form my skin from using Abolene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may seem pricey, but it really isn&#x27;t when you compare it to other moisturizers. You only need a very small amount to get good results. I would recommend this to anyone who has a problem with dry skin.</li>
            <li> When having physical therapy on my arm several years ago, the therapist used Albolene as a lubricant.  I liked it so much that I started using it as a makeup remover.  Now, I use it as a moisturizer on my arms (especially elbows), legs, and feet before I go to bed.  I can&#x27;t believe how soft the bottoms of my feet are now that I&#x27;ve been using it regularly--no need to use my Ped Egg.  The only thing is, you&#x27;ll need to be sure to wear slippers, because it&#x27;s pretty messy if you like to walk barefoot.</li>
            <li> This helps keep my skin soft and hydrated all day even my feet and elbows. It does tend to leave a greasy residue which my hands which is quicky absorbed after a minute or two.  It even keeps my hands hydrated after multiple washings.</li>
            <li> I put this on under my waist trimmer before i work out and it opens my pores and all my water weight comes off</li>
            <li> love it! exactly what i expected and more</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Albolene to remove mascara for over 30 years (yikes) and even when I tried to replace it with dept store brands that matched the mascaras (Lancome, Estee Lauder, Clinque, you name it) none of the other brands ever came close to being as good as Albolene....&lt;br /&gt;Never gets in your eyes or interferes w/contact lens wearing&lt;br /&gt;I have much fewer eye wrinkles, where the Albolene has been in contact, than any of my friends in their late 40&#x27;s. I&#x27;m careful about sun, etc., but I really believe Albolene has been a big part of my good-around-the-eyes skin.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it on my face because I am oily skinned and find I need regular cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;The price here on Amazon is exactly HALF of what they charge at CVS &amp; RiteAid....&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend..... works just as well w/waterproof mascaras....</li>
            <li> I have used Albolene for the past 15 years as a makeup remover. It works great! It easily takes off waterproof eye makeup without any rubbing. This prevents any irritation to the sensitive skin in the eye area. Be sure to wash your face after using this product or it could leave your skin feeling a little greasy.</li>
            <li> Good product and quick shipping</li>
            <li> Great for taking makeup off</li>
            <li> This  facial  cleaning  product  amazing.  I&#x27;ve  only  been  using  it  for  a  little  over  1  week  and  I  can  see  the  difference  in  my  face.  My  face holds  more  moisture  and  looks  fresher.  I use  the  product  2  times  a  day  (morning  &amp;  night).  However,  I  don&#x27;t  just  wipe it  off  with  a  towel.  I  massage  ALBOLENE  into  my  face  and  neck;  then  I  take  warm  water  and  on  my  hands  and  massage  it  deeper  into  my  skin.  Then  I  wipe  off  ALBOLENE  with  a  warm  towel.  In  the  morning,  after  I  clean  with  ALBOLENE,  I  apply  my  daily  facial  moisture.  At  night,  after  cleaning,  I  apply  my  regular  night  facial  crème.  Love  this  product.</li>
            <li> It came in good time and was worth it</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser.  Have used it for many years. It leaves the face feeling clean, but moisturized. Try it.  You&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I have used this for taking off make-up for over 20 years.  It is light and cheap and effective.  Try it!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It did arrive with a cracked lid bur fortunately I still had the lid from my last jar.</li>
            <li> Amazing! I used it along with the Sweat Sweat during my workout, but I also used it while cleaning to house. Great Product!</li>
            <li> My mom taught me to use Cold Cream to remove makeup but as an adult I&#x27;ve pretty much just used soap and water. I recently decided I wanted to use something gentler but I found out that Pond&#x27;s Original Cold Cream got bought out and now uses a different formula. I thought I&#x27;d try something new so I found this Albolene stuff on Amazon. I was pretty surprised when I first opened it and realized it basically looks exactly like vaseline. I was really worried that I would break out after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used mascara or eyesliner, I used to have to really wipe and irritate my eyes to take off all the makeup at the end of the day. Now, I wipe this stuff over and under my eyes where I need to remove makeup, then gently wipe away with toilet tissue. It immediately takes off the makeup. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with breaking out after using this for a little over a month. However, the skin around my eyes looks and feels a lot more soft and supple. I can&#x27;t think of a con for this product and I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re looking for a gentle, moisturizing way to remove makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s great for removing make up especially lipstick stains. I&#x27;ve also used it for my dry skin and it definitely works wonders on dry feet and hands .</li>
            <li> My physical therapist used this stuff on my back years ago, and I was&lt;br /&gt;amazed &amp;#34;then&amp;#34; how slippery it was, so I bought some and WOW ! ......it&lt;br /&gt;not only does wonders for massaging areas,  but it&#x27;s a miracle producing&lt;br /&gt;product when used in the intimate places instead of all that higher priced&lt;br /&gt;junk that dries up and disappears in a few minutes.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t do&lt;br /&gt;that..........it stays as long as &amp;#34;you&amp;#34; can, believe me, even by yourself.......!.</li>
            <li> i have had an eczema for 20 or more years and after using albolene cleanser it has cleared  the redness and i seldom use a steroid application now. also use it as an all over moisturizer and it has helped my extreme sensitive skin.  wonderful stuff</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery.Great cream to be used with a slimmer belt! I am using and enjoying it! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> This is my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for makeup removal.  Cleansing without drying.  Works particularly well with waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! It&#x27;s hard for me to sweat while working out and this stuff literally had sweat dripping off of my stomach. Also perfect for taking off make up. I&#x27;m sold!!!!</li>
            <li> This product reminds me of Vaseline that I have in my cabinet. (No offense) I will continue to use this and study how it works for me. I will give a update in the near future to share more of my ideas.</li>
            <li> I have always worn a waist trimmer during workouts and have had great results with it. Recently I was at a health/supplement store when I saw the competitor&#x27;s product Sweet ___. Anyhow, I bought it in a stick version and loved it but what I didn&#x27;t love was the price. So when I ran out of it I kept the hollow plastic stick and wondered if I&#x27;d be able to use this Albolene cream with it. It seems to be the exact same consistency and very similar so when I received the cream I filled the empty plastic balm container with it and placed it in the freezer to set since I wasn&#x27;t sure it would not leak or hold up but it worked out very well and I have been keeping it in my medicine cabinet since then and have not had any problems. I don&#x27;t have to slather it on as others have mentioned because it is greasy and as bit messy. But as I mentioned it works great and it does not seem to have any smell/odor. This is a great buy, I highly recommed it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Albolene Cleanser for years and then suddenly could not find it in stores.  Was so pleased to find it on Amazon.  It is the best cleanser to remove eye makeup without drying the sensitive area around the eye.  I have very dry skin so the cleanser is perfect for me keeping my skin soft while cleansing the makeup off every day.</li>
            <li> The only thing that takes off my makeup and sunblock without drying me out.</li>
            <li> I purchased Albolene to remove my makeup but as a makeup remover...I did not like. It make my face feel too greasy and I felt better using Olay wipes. HOWEVER, as a waist cincher it was GREAT! I heard a T.V personality talk about how she rubbed Albolene on her side and stomach rolls to increase sweat as she worked out. Since I had a mother of the groom&#x27;s dress to look beautiful in for my sons wedding....I decided to go for it.&lt;br /&gt;My regiment consisted of rubbing Albolene on my mid area, taking Saran Wrap ( or basic store brand plastic wrap) and wrap it around my mid area going around at least three times, then wrapping a neoprene waist trimmer belt ( can find one in Marshall&#x27;s for 5.99), lastly, hitting the treadmill or stepper for 45 minutes atleast 4 times a week. You must do cardio along with this regiment if you want results. I did eat as healthy as I could ( I do love sweets).&lt;br /&gt;When I put my little black on dress for the weddings rehearsal dinner....Wow...I thought I looked great. Then the day of the wedding I put on my long flowing dress and as I walked in the church...and all eyes were on me as I walked, I felt great and my son smiled as he saw me walk in ( but he cried when his beautiful bride walked in... :-D). The dress was a size 8 and when I first tried it on ( three weeks before the wedding) and I had to breath in and hold abit in order to zip it up. But,.on the wedding day, I had room to spare. It does work as long as you work along with it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it! Today is my first day using it! It&#x27;s not just a make up remover, it&#x27;s a fat remover too! Ha! I put it on my target areas like my arms, back fat, stomach and of course my thighs! I was oozing sweat! I&#x27;m definitely recommending this product to friends and family! Oh and I enclosed a little photo of my tummy! You can see the sweat droplets! Until next time..</li>
            <li> Thoroughly removes makeup.. And it makes you sweat profusely, if intended for fitness purposes.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every night to take off my make up and it does a wonderful job. It also leaves my skin feeling very soft afterwards.</li>
            <li> This stuff has really helped me lose extra fat around my belly. I excersice after I put it on and it helps me sweat</li>
            <li> Got it today cant wait to start using this Product!</li>
            <li> Its okay. Skin feels soft for a little due to the paraffin. I use regularly to clean my face.</li>
            <li> It works so good! Removes all my make up, and leaves my face nice and soft! Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I use this product to help me with water weight.  I rub a generous amount on my stomach and lower back, wrap myself in saran wrap and a waist belt, go workout and  when I take off all my belly gear, water is pouring off me.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Not only is this a great product for your skin, but also for children&#x27;s skin! I use it to treat my son&#x27;s diaper rash, it doesn&#x27;t smell like the other stuff, it doesn&#x27;t hurt him at all, and best of all...if I put this on him at night before he goes to bed...his rash is completely gone by morning! I love this! It is DEFINITELY worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I like this so far- i heard you can use this as a weight loss similar to sweet sweat as well but seems to go on smooth  and clean easily with warm water or damped cloth. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Love this ,your skin will feel so soft after using and it cleans your skin well</li>
            <li> Yes when I work out I rub it on my belly wrap my belly with plastic wrap then my belly burn band workout and when I&#x27;m finished the swear is like water</li>
            <li> Seems a bit greasy, but does the job of cleansing.</li>
            <li> I have used this for 32 years now to remove my make-up cause it takes off mascara &amp; face makeup. It is water soluable so a wet washcloth does the trick. I have NO WRINKLES AT ALL!  I was told when I turned 30 by an 80 yr old woman that if I used this, I would have unwrinkled beautiful skin like HER which she attibuted to using ALBOLENE. Well, I HAVE to SAY...My skin is ALWAYS COMPLIMENTED on how I have such a young, unlined complextion...Has to be my ALBOLENE cause I am 62 now and look at least 20 years younger!</li>
            <li> Does the job for both removing makeup and getting a good Sweat in to lose weight!</li>
            <li> Good cleanser and good for wraps to loose water weight</li>
            <li> Love this,it also smooth the stomach</li>
            <li> This stuff has been great for the last twenty years.  I could no longer get it locally, so ordered.  The shipping was fine.  The product is not the same consistency even though the ingredients read the same.  It used to liquify upon contact with the skin.  Now it feels heavier and does not exactly liquify.  What is up with that?  I will still use it but I wish it was the way I have always known it to be.</li>
            <li> I use this to help me sweat doing my workout and it does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> So After reading numerous reviews, I opted to buy this product in conjunction with the bracoo waist trainer and hydroxycut elite. I wore my waist trainer for a couple hours and it made me sweat a little. But let me tell you, I put the Abolene all over my midsection underneath my waist trainer, had it on for a couple hours and added a 30 minute workout to the mix and once I took my waist trainer off, I was literally dripping with sweat! So far, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had so much sweat leave my body at one time! I wore this along with plastic wrap and my waist trainer belt and and did 30 minute cardio and omg it was like a puddle of water falling out of the wrap when i removed it from my body. i love how a lot came in the tube so hopefully it&#x27;ll last me a while, if not i will gladly buy more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to see the results of this product.  I was slightly disappointed, however, because the bottom was cracked. Nothing has spilled out but I&#x27;m not sure if it happened during delivery.  I just wished it could have been protected a little better.</li>
            <li> I love this product it&#x27;s not only good for makeup removing but to sweat and loose weight .</li>
            <li> Have used this for decades.  Every once in a while I try something else, but ALWAYS return to Albolene.  My face loves and needs it.</li>
            <li> Great for Gym purpose(fat burning) and also make up</li>
            <li> Hallelujah!!! Found a very affordable alternative to discontinued Mary Kay Extra Emollient Cleanser right here on Amazon! The consistency is the same and equally safe to remove eye make up as well as facial foundation. Plus, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for face and hands.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what Sweet Sweat does at a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;I have used both Sweet Sweat and Albolene back to back... and to be honest with you, I think this product works MUCH better than the Sweet Sweat to extract sweat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another good thing about this product compared to the other is that it is UNSCENTED. Which is perfect. With Sweet Sweat, even after a GOOD shower, the product leaves a scent on your skin. It&#x27;s not a bad scent, but you can tell that it is there. With Albolene, there is no lingering fragrance of any sort. Which I truly appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT. Will be purchasing more when I run out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps with your buying decisions!</li>
            <li> This is the truth for your skin and as a workout product. I will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> good product have use it for years during workout&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m a believer. I first learned about Albolene being used for fitness through YouTube fitness channels. I was skeptical at first. Therefore, like many i googled waist trimmers and read several reviews and decided to get the sweet sweat waist trimmer and tried some of the sweet sweat gel. I loved the waist trimmer (great quality and stays put) but for me, the gel was just ok . I sweated but didn&#x27;t receive the excessive sweat everyone else did. So I kept using my trimmer but decided to purchase the albolene before my workout today and Lordy... I was sweating in my trimmer on the way to the track. Long story short, I will be using it in my routine from now on. #1 it&#x27;s cheaper #2 it works better. Believe it or not itappears the ingredients are similar but for some reason Albolene works better. Go with the Albolene it&#x27;s a quality product and it proved to work for me. I know I will have to focus on diet /sodium &amp;stay hydrated as well to keep  my results. By the way , Rite Aid has Albolene cheaper than Walgreen Pharmcy if u don&#x27; get it online.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time, its great on my skin, I use it to lose extra body water when working out. Will recommend. Best price out there.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help much as far as weight loss is concerned though.</li>
            <li> I put this on my feet when I get out the shower and then wrap with plastic over night. It leaves my feet super soft, which is something you can achieve with lotion,  oil, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought this to use on my belly when working out to help burn the fat. It does make you sweat, but it also makes me itch horribly to the point I can&#x27;t even tolerate it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff it makes me sweat a lot during my cardio workouts.</li>
            <li> Love, Love this product. It will take off the most stubborn waterproof mascara.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over 20 years and thrilled to find it on Amazon, as drugstores usually don&#x27;t stock it.  I first used it to remove waterproof mascara, which led to using it everyday on my face in the shower.  My skin is so dry; this helps lock in the moisture.  I am a forever fan.&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea that it is used while exercising as well;  I have a friend whose jogging bra rubs her raw in marathons, so I will recommend.  Thank you for that hint!</li>
            <li> great for using as sweat enhancing for my waist trim band.</li>
            <li> A little oily but really gets the sweat pouring from the body. Especially when used in the sauna.</li>
            <li> Stage makeup and body paint are both part of my craft and easily wiped away with Albolene. It is equally effective removing everyday makeup. Over time I have even noticed that the skin around my eyes and mouth has remained soft and smooth because of the mineral oil ingredient. I often leave a dab on my lips before going to bed at night to keep them moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;Albolene is reasonably priced for the effectiveness and quantity which lasts a couple of months at least with daily use. There are no perfumes or ingredients that would irritate most sensitive skin (like mine) and the moisture properties are a great bonus. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product every time I work out. When i tell u I wrap it with plastic and do a work of 2 1/2 hours my clothes be so wet. Please amazing stuff</li>
            <li> Love it!!  Have used it for years but couldn&#x27;t find it in my local drug store.  Great product for people with dry skin.</li>
            <li> Good product for removing makeup</li>
            <li> I think with a very intense workout, abolene produces a strong sweet..</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling soft. Fully and easily removes all makeup</li>
            <li> I used it to remove my makeup and yes it does the trick.</li>
            <li> Many uses, it helps applying after a shower. To improve KP, skin dryness, skin blotches and discoloration, cuts, and even wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this for workouts, mainly for my abs. Just to get rid of extra water weight and sweat more in that area.</li>
            <li> really gets the makeup off and helps the skin feel soft</li>
            <li> On time. Just as advertised. Awesome product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be buying it for the rest of my life my skin looks amazing and no need for expensive moisturizer</li>
            <li> Adds youth to ur skin with moisture. I got carded</li>
            <li> Not sure yet only been using for a week with the waist trimmer belt. It does make you sweat</li>
            <li> I have used this during boxing training and it works great I also used amilean as well. the only difference between items is the texture of the product. Amilean is thicker more like a loation where albolene is little greaser. for myself I use it for weight loss and is a great product in my personal opinion. It gets the job done oh and I might add leaves skin feeling real soft &#x3D;) always a plus especially for a woman.</li>
            <li> I love the moisture that it leaves behind without having to add a moisturizer after washing.  I simply smooth it on and wipe it off with disposable cotton towelettes that I purchased, and I&#x27;m done.  I will say that I still do use eye makeup remover for my stubborn mascara and liquid eyeliner.  I found that I was having to rub my eyes too abrasively to remove all of my eye makeup.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for wrkg out! Make you sweat a lot!</li>
            <li> Its my first time to use this product and most of the review are true it makes u sweat and make ur skin soft I love this product and get more soon..</li>
            <li> This is not a cleanser.  It a grease, much like petroleum jelly except this is THICK.  i broke out in a horrible rash.</li>
            <li> Albolene cream is the best makeup remover that I have ever used, especially for eye makeup.  It is non greasy, yet still moisturizes my face.  A tiny bit goes a long way and feels so good on my face. I used to be able to buy it in any drug store and they no longer carry it.  Thank Goodness for Amazon since I could not used anything else.</li>
            <li> I use Albolene for removing make-up; it also helps heal minor cuts and scratches.  Albolene is not as thick as Vasoline but its main ingredient is petrolatum (Vasoline) and it melts into the skin.  I would highly recommend Albolene.</li>
            <li> No workout is complete without this stuff. I don&#x27;t like working out without it. More sweat instantly!</li>
            <li> This product works amazing for losing water weight meaning It will make you sweat a lot. Its suppose to be to clean make up but it also works for working out. I first looked up YouTube videos. I haven&#x27;t yet to use for its real purpose but if you want to sweat more, this works great. It feels like vaseline, super greasy. I wore a neoprene waist belt. Its odorless too. Well worth the buy and fast two day shipping.</li>
            <li> Yes it works, and I have recommened it to many of my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I am currently using this as a makeup remover and the second it&#x27;s applied the makeup all starts coming off. Just one wipe with a soft cloth or cotton ball and the makeup is all gone. I am currently pregnant and can hardly wait to see what it does in aiding weight loss around my abs and thighs. So thrilled.</li>
            <li> It is mostly mineral oil. Mineral oil has been a big cause of allergies, rushes, and irritations, and I am surprised to know that this product is mostly made of IT!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing make-up remover and leaves your skin feeling great afterwards. I use it for my hands also and it&#x27;s helped them remain soft through out the day. I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I use this product as a workout enhancer, it helps be sweat like crazy, great for getting rid of water weight</li>
            <li> I love this product. What I use it for is my workouts so it open my pores more to sweat more. I rub it on put on plastic wrap then my waist trimmer (laugh now but it works) after a workout and I take off the trimmer it is amazing it&#x27;s like a faucet the amount of sweat that pours out. So I love this moisturizing cleanser not scented and doesn&#x27;t need a lot, so this should last me a while.</li>
            <li> Keeps your skin soft &amp; smooth!!</li>
            <li> makes u sweat like crazy,,my stomach was literally dripping after zumba albolene and plastic wrap</li>
            <li> I suddenly developed an allergy on my eyelids and the dermatologist recommended Albolene.  This was 8 years ago and I&#x27;ve been using the product ever since.  It is extremely gentle and removes all of my eye make-up.  I use the moisturizing cleanser on my feet and hands as well.  This is a great product.  Amazon sells Albolene at a reasonable price and it ships for free with the Super Saver shipment choice.  All in all purchasing this product through Amazon is a wonderful choice.</li>
            <li> I use this product when I work out.  My workouts are enhanced and I sweat like crazy.  I love this product and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this as an excellent long-lasting lubricant for jelqing.  I have tried Vaseline and Vaseline Intensive care as well as many other lubricants and found this to be the best for this because the others all went dry way too soon and/or were too thick and greasy. This does the job and cleans up easily so you don&#x27;t have to worry about grease that doesn&#x27;t come off when you wipe it or wash off in the tub( who wants a greasy tub?)  Also works great as a sexual lubricant :)</li>
            <li> I bought this because people said it worked very well with the waist trimmer belt. It definitely does work well, makes you sweat more under neath the belt. Definitely not as good as the sweet sweat but it&#x27;s cheaper so definitely a better option!</li>
            <li> Abolene works way better than vaseline and does not dry out your skin. I just smear some on each eye, wipe it off and 100% of my eye makeup is gone. My experience is that this works best in the shower but it does the trick outside as well. I&#x27;ll even open my eyes when I have this stuff on and it won&#x27;t irritate them at all. Its so easy, my eyelashes don&#x27;t get rubbed out and I never have raccoon eyes. My mom showed me this stuff at 14 and I will never use anything else, I even showed this product to the girls in my sorority and they all love it as well.</li>
            <li> This product has been an all-time favorite of mine.  It gets rid of any dirt, make-up and residue on your face and eyes without irritation.  It could also be used as a moisturizer in a pinch!</li>
            <li> I switched to albolene for cleaning my face about a year ago and my breakouts have improved. I&#x27;m in my early twenties and my face seems to break out due to dry skin. This helps with this problem as well as I&#x27;m able to use this to remove makeup instead of harsh cleansers. If you have sensitive eyes and wear eye makeup you cannot go wrong with using albolene to remove it. I recently in the last few months added in using cetaphil sensitive bar soap and a electric facial brush and my face has improved even more.&lt;br /&gt;Albolene might seem pricey but the jar seriously lasts forever. I&#x27;ve had one last me a good six months with using some everyday. Now if your using it for that dumb fitness sweating thing I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll go through it/waste it quicker, but to each their own.</li>
            <li> I like this product for sweating.I place on my stomach and then put my stomach band while working out.I sweat alot in that area.&lt;br /&gt;I brought this product to use as a facial cleanser.It works but to grease for my face, which cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> I use it as a work out enhancer. Must have. I go through one of these a month. I&#x27;ve bought over 10 already. Keeps my belly trim.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, period. Not only do I use it as a makeup remover, but also a moisturizer and under my waist trimmer when I workout, so I can put up a nice sweat. It really works if you put the abolene cream on, then wrap with plastic wrap, then your waist trimmer.</li>
            <li> trying to see results</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> Only took 6 days (Including weekends to get to me). Product makes me sweat profusly while working out with my shaper.</li>
            <li> Hmm, I&#x27;ve only used this a couple days so verdict is still out, but my first impression was/is it&#x27;s basically expensive Vaseline, it&#x27;s really hard to get off of your face, it takes a really hot wash cloth to remove this stuff. Trying to keep an open mind and will keep using it for a little while to give it a fair chance,.</li>
            <li> Great for removing make up from the face.  Skin feels hydrated afterwards so I don&#x27;t need as much night cream.</li>
            <li> This item works great as my nighttime  cleanser to remove makeup without drying my skin and it is great under my waist trainer, I lost 2 inches in 1 week.</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it both as a facial cleanser and also as a workout product. I put it on my body in the areas I want to target, like my abs, then wrap myself up in plastic and do my work out. I eliminate a lot of liquid that way.</li>
            <li> The cap is broken when I receive it!!!</li>
            <li> Makes for an awesome workout!</li>
            <li> didnt work for me, but my friend used it and it worked great for her</li>
            <li> Purchase Albonene at my local Rite Aid;  it is very greasy when applied and you&#x27;re supposed to wipe it off&lt;br /&gt; however I decided this time to go to the bathroom today,  wet my face a bit and then used a little bit of baking soda that I have in the bathroom to give myself a light exfoliation... WELL! Who told me to do that!!!&lt;br /&gt; I washed off my face and I could not believe the junk that came off my face! I was so embarrassed for my sink if it could talk it would scream! black dark gunk that came off my face looked as if I hadn&#x27;t washed my skin in months to say the least it was disgusting! I wash my face at night and go through my nightly routines since I like a bit of makeup but I was shocked and how much dirt my skin released. I see that everyone is using this Albonene for shaping their waist so tonight I will try that... I have a Squeem waist shaper rub this cream on for a couple of days and see what happens... get off my makeup pretty good!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much i sweat....i have never sweat like this. It worth every penny and a lil go along away. This jar will last along time</li>
            <li> Takes my make up right off ! and also removes any dirt off my skin.</li>
            <li> I used it for itchinness and I never got itchy again. Saved my life. I use it twice a day and after showers in my abs</li>
            <li> I use it as a moisturizer and makeup remover and for working out to make me burn more calories around my waist...It has so many uses and leaves your skin feeling so smooth!! Definitely worth the money!! I will buy again once my jar is empty.... already recommended it to my sister in law whose both  kids have eczema and she said she is going to buy!!</li>
            <li> Gave this a 4 because it came sooner than expected. It really leaves my skin feeling soft, I mainly brought it for weight loss purposes. So far so good. Check out reviews on YouTube.</li>
            <li> I some times work as a clown and this by far is the best for removing the grease paint. Ive used shampoos, soap, Mineral oil ect but Abolene is by far the best and easiest to work with!</li>
            <li> makes my skin look and feel smooth even in the cold weather i usually have to reapply something to my skin but using this last a long time i can even skip a day even after i take a shower</li>
            <li> I watched a video that said to use this along with a waist trainer, in which i did, and it helped so much with the rubbing! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Works good. I use it for Weightloss.</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;ve used this for removing make-up  and as a moisturizer.  Every trace of make-up  is easily removed. Love it.  I haven&#x27;t use it under my waist cincher yet.  Soon I&#x27;ll try it for that and review it also.  Nevertheless, this is an awesome cleanser!</li>
            <li> I looked for this in MN. and couldn&#x27;t t find it so was pleased I could purchase online.  I am satisfied and will continue to get it here.</li>
            <li> This cleanser is so good it is absolutely the best for skin conditions as well as useful for using on the skin for multiple purposes. I recommend this cleanser as it is better for softening skin, using in intimate purposes better than other creams and lubes and will leave a pleasant afterglow on the skin area used. Anyone who uses this should be very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I brought this product to put on my stomach to help burn extra water and the only thing it did was made my stomach really grease.</li>
            <li> I use it for my sweet sweat belt and this thing makes me sweat it&#x27;s also very good for you face ,but I recived mine broken ....</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly... Definitely buying again. I Used it under my latex waist trainer to sweat more while working out &amp; it work wonders to help me drop some inches. Its an awesome make-up remover as well</li>
            <li> Great product my skin complexion is noticeable clearer</li>
            <li> Was desperately searching for Mary Kay Extra Emollient Cleanser -- which has been discontinued for reasons that mystify -- when I came across a few suggestions to try this instead. Yippee!  It works just as well, comes in a vat-sized container, and is ridiculously inexpensive to use. Get it.</li>
            <li> I simply love this product.  I have oily skin and my face now seems so soft.  I use it ONLY as a make up remover.  At first when I put it on I was thinking to myself why am I using  petroleum products on my face.  My face is so smooth now.  I use it once in a week or once in two weeks.  I did break out on my cheeks but I am sparingly using this product.  In the middle of the week I use something more natural like coconut oil to remove oil on my skin. PS: after suing abolene my skin has reduced its oiliness immensely.</li>
            <li> Works when you workout</li>
            <li> Must have, per my wife</li>
            <li> This cleanser has a consistency similar to vaseline and is clear.  It is a good cleanser for people with dry or very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Anytime you re-purpose something its never as good as the intended product. I don&#x27;t think this makes me sweat much other than what I do normally. Also it doesn&#x27;t rise off easily. Even after a shower. The upside is its a moisturizer so if you have sensitive skin or skin issues its not as harsh as sweet sweat or beauty bum.</li>
            <li> When I apply this cream wrap with cling wrap put on my belt and start exerciseing it really works helps to make u sweat and it pulls out excess water</li>
            <li> Love it! I am using it for exercising with my sweating belt and it really works!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product lost 4 inches from my waist on 4 weeks in conjunction with cardio. Love Albolene !!!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t try it yet but it&#x27;s enough to use for 3 months ore more</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for taking off make-up.  This is a staple for folks in stage plays who use this to take off heavy, gooped-on make-up.  So everyday use by  general consumers makes this a supreme makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Received my order promptly and was well packaged.  Though I haven&#x27;t used much of the Albolene, I already like it and appreciate the fact that it isn&#x27;t greasy on my skin.  Nice sized container for the price.</li>
            <li> Its a bit too gunky for me like a jar of vaseline but it does the job good enough.</li>
            <li> I use this product and my waist trimmer while I do my cardio. It help me sweat more in my mid-section. Works for me.</li>
            <li> Each morning, before going to the gym, I apply it to my stomach and waist areas. Then I cover it by wrapping the area with plastic wrap (which kinda itches) and a waist trimmer before getting dressed. Really increases the sweat in those areas and works great for me!</li>
            <li> I use this to cleanse my face of ANY trace of makeup as well as on my stomach while working out! This is one of my favorite products out there! With consistent use while working out you WILL lose inches!</li>
            <li> This is the Gold Standard for masturbation.  It multiplies sensation 10X and leaves your skin feeling great too!&lt;br /&gt;Look no further.</li>
            <li> My gyno referred me to this product to use as girl lubricant.  I was having problems with the product I had used for years.  This works awesome for the purpose I bought it.  I have not used it in any other way.</li>
            <li> I used Albolene products years ago but could not find it in local stores.  Then I remembered to check Amazon!  Voila...there it was.  So happy I ordered and love the results for my very dry, sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I use this daily for makeup removal and it surely removes everything from your face. Which allows your pores to be more open and clear. I also use it with my waist belt when exercising it allows me to sweat x 10 !! Multi uses and a great price!</li>
            <li> I bought it to use for waist training, however I use it as a make up remover and moisturizer for my skin. I suffer from ecxema and my skin is so soft, no more dark patches on my back.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love albolene!  I put it on my stomach before wrapping myself in saran wrap and my waist cincher.  I work out for about an hour and when I un-wrap sweat is pouring from my mid-section.  Albolene also leaves my skin feeling very very smooth!</li>
            <li> Nice I love it helps me lost weight off my tummy</li>
            <li> Great product. It won&#x27;t disappoint!</li>
            <li> this is awesome. i use on my stomach with a sweat belt while i work out. i saw difference with in 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Good price for the size</li>
            <li> I bought this product because, after reading some of the reviews and friends, I was sure I would get more burning effect during my workout, however the only effect it made was to make everything dirty and sticky. I can&#x27;t give an one star because I&#x27;m sure it should serve other purpose, but for fat burning purposes, it is not efficient.</li>
            <li> Great product. Similar to the consistency of Vaseline. It is a thick gel-like cleanser that works well on my extremely dry skin. Would not recommend for anyone with oily skin.</li>
            <li> Came in quick I put it in the area I don&#x27;t really sweat from (my tummy) and it helped a lot I have lost an inch around my stomach area after two weeks of using it</li>
            <li> 100 percent effective love it ...When I go to the Gym.... I rub it on my tummy and put on my sweet sweat waist trainer and when im done with my hard  2 hr body  workout ..Boy.... a pool of water drips right off ...I have a use a towel to dry off.... this is a  daily permanent fixture to my beauty...and Its a very good moisturizer for when you don&#x27;t want to have dry skin... this lasts 24 hrs.... overnight....Love It!!!!</li>
            <li> This my wife uses for her dry skin on her feet. It keeps them so soft. I use it every night on my arms &amp; legs. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> This has always been one of the best products on the market for removing makeup and for keeping your skin soft.</li>
            <li> The product came in on time and was packaged/sealed very well (it arrived with other items ordered that were very delicate). I&#x27;m so happy with Albolene that it became part of my daily routine for the dry skin I get from my allergies. I couldn&#x27;t be any happier, and it came in time as my other one was almost completely out!</li>
            <li> I love I use this for the gym around my waist idk whats in that release all the toxins but you should find out because i lost 15inches of  my waist</li>
            <li> I like this so far- i heard you can use this as a weight loss similar to sweet sweat as well but seems to go on smooth and clean easily with warm water or damped cloth. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> this is great for so many things. make up removable, use as lotion,granddaughter liked it also. great buy for the money</li>
            <li> Enough said, you will sweat! Definitely does what it says it is going to do. I do not even need to wear my compression shorts or waist cincher, just putting it on and working out, I sweat 50% more. Make sure you drink water because it is easy to become dehydrated.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT... IT REMOVES ALL MY MAKE UP AND EASILY REMOVE WATER PROOF MASCARA AS WELL.</li>
            <li> Just love this cleaner. Have used it for years. Will for sure order it again</li>
            <li> I just love this. I use it all over my body &amp; it&#x27;s so smooth. Will purchase again when it&#x27;s halfway done.</li>
            <li> Hard to take off and it&#x27;s too oily. Hate it.</li>
            <li> This really makes you sweat. I would recommend this for anyone who works out and wants to sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> Sweat, sweat... baby sweat!!! Helps me break a sweat faster when I work out... So worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Satisfied users for 40+ years. An excellent personal lubricant.</li>
            <li> Works really well with the Sweet Sweat waste band. Great product.</li>
            <li> Totally made my face break out. Do not put on your face. I read you can put it on your belly under some plastic wrap then workout so you sweat more. Sounds like a better plan then using it to take off makeup.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure I was going to like this but I have been reading a lot about soap-less cleansing for the face. I checked with the EWG website first to make sure that I could use this product since I have so many skin allergies. It passed the test and my skin feels very silky after using this. I don&#x27;t even need extra moisturizer. I use a steamy hot washcloth to remove it from my face giving me a facial of sorts. It works great right now in the winter months when I really need the extra moisture.</li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure that this work before posting a review. It does make you sweat if you do a wrap with it I also have the Ann Chery waist trimmer. it is a great combination but you must workout in order to get a good work out. but do keep in might this is more of a water weight and can be gained back easily. but is is by far a great product.</li>
            <li> I like that it is not as greasy as Vaseline.  My daughter has eczema and her dermatologist recommended this product. I put some on her arms and legs in the evenings and it seems to be doing the job.  Keeps her skin from becoming too dry.  We&#x27;re happy.</li>
            <li> I like the cream I rub it on my stomach before I work out and you can see the difference you waist get smaller</li>
            <li> I am so glad I purchased this stuff and hate I&#x27;m just now finding out about it after all these years 1. excellent make up remover non greasy to me comes completely off, 2. I&#x27;ve used it to wash my face and to my surprise no breakouts 3. The most important my son has eczema and this is the only thing ( I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun I promise) to seal in moisture and help heal his skin I use while he is still damp straight out of the tub and when he gets ups in the morning this is a life saver I would buy this product by the gallon</li>
            <li> I only use Albolene when working out. It was recommended by my trainer.... This product helps you sweat more and its great!!</li>
            <li> Use product to help my body produce more sweat but ima not sure if I sweated more or not. Ok product</li>
            <li> Works like a champ, yes yes yes. I recommend this product, it&#x27;s more than a make up remover. Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim from a picture I saw, well never the less a picture is worth a thousand words! The stuff is amazing if your working out and the friction lasts for ever and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Excellent...I actually apply the product prior to putting on my neoprene shorts B4 workouts...It is excellent....It enduces the sweat during my workout as well as keeps my skin moisturized due to the neoprene material is comparatively to rubber...which can dry out skin...No issues now...great!</li>
            <li> It really does open your pores and makes you sweat and a little goes a long way. I would definitely recommend and buy again.</li>
            <li> I got this because I heard it helps with weight loss if you apply it to your abs and wrap with plastic wrap before you work out.  It didn&#x27;t help for me, it was like I stopped sweating. So i stopped using it for yhat and now just for makeup removal,  which works great but i still have to wash my face afterwards to remove the excess grease. So for makeup removal I&#x27;d give it 4 or 5 stars. Just know if you have naturally oily skin then you will need to wash your face after to remove excess grease.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so quick to wash my face with this instead of soap.  Just grease it up and wipe it off.  If it all doesn&#x27;t come off that&#x27;s fine.  It&#x27;s like moisturizer.  Do exfoliate with another product from time to time though.</li>
            <li> Awesome makeup removal! Part of my skin care routine. Results in clear bright skin. I originally bought at a sweat aide(just felt gooey), but tried it as a makeup removal and like it for that much more.</li>
            <li> I brought this product for my very dry and flaky skin on my feet and since I have been using the moisturizing cleanser my skin is much softer and not as flaky as usual. the cracked skin on my feet at this point seem to be healing.  I know its used for removing makeup, but I recommended Albolene for use on damage crack skin as well.</li>
            <li> good cleanser but don&#x27;t use as a moisturizer....too greasy. I used it to moisturize my knees and it DID do the&lt;br /&gt;trick.....especially when coming in from the garden. I mainly use it to remove water-proof makeup.</li>
            <li> Never knew a make-up remover could help with weight loss! This product has been amazing! Prior to working out, I apply it to my biceps and my stomach (then put on the Sweet Sweat Waist Trimmer) and this makes me sweat so much more than usual.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cleanser for several years, ever since I discovered I was allergic to products with a fragrance. Albolene works very well for me!</li>
            <li> I use it in the bath and it leaves everything very slippery, it works ok but I don&#x27;t think I will buy anymore</li>
            <li> I brought this product soley for working out. I brought a waist belt to use w/ this product to help me shed my little tummy. I work out w/ this product and it does help w/ perspiration. It&#x27;s like Vaseline, I rub on a minimal amount and am sweating in 5mins. I received my package on time, I am a happy and satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I use this product both as a make up remover as well as under my waist belt when I exercise. It really ads to the sweat I produce under my waist belt.  It is just greasy but can easily be washed off.  This product is well recommended for its multi use.</li>
            <li> I used Abolene for weight loss purposes and I have been using it on my tummy area for about a month and I defiantly see the results. While working it out it will increase sweat on areas applied. LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> lLOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff best makeup remover and helps induces sweat for water weight elimination.</li>
            <li> Love this cream. Great for removing makeup but also excellent skin moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have this and Sweet Sweat and I must say that this products make you really sweat better. I tote this around everyday to my cycling class.  My outfit is soaking after I&#x27;m finished.  Great buy!</li>
            <li> Received super fast...works as stated but using it for workouts not as a makeup remover but I might just try it for that as well.</li>
            <li> I like it and item was delivered speedy</li>
            <li> it was ohk, it made me sweat a little but not as much as the sweet sweat gel!</li>
            <li> This stuff is a miracle. My mom let me borrow some of hers once when my face was very dry and scaly after I had a rash.&lt;br /&gt;In a week of using this my skin softened up again! I knew I had to get some for myself, and this is such a great deal!!</li>
            <li> This came highly recommended by a friend and that is why I bought it. However, when I used it, I felt like I was leaving grease on my face after wiping off with a tissue. Rinsing afterwards would defeat the purpose of using it in the first place.  So I&#x27;ve gone back to my cleansing cloths from Costco.</li>
            <li> Great for lot&#x27;s of things.</li>
            <li> Thanks for Abolene. I use it under my sweet sweat waist trimmer and also for my sons skin ( he has eczema )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for some reason I thought it would be like cream or lotion but looks like grease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT NOT A PROBLEM, no complaints :)</li>
            <li> From what I can tell. It works fine. It&#x27;s very thick and oily. I don&#x27;t have any complaints.</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser ever!  A friend recommended it to me, and I have no disappointments.</li>
            <li> Great for shedding water weight.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist gave me some samples of Albolene when I went to her with red swollen eyes (allergies).  She told me to use it to remove makeup and then don&#x27;t wash my face as it is a great moisturizer.  It is kind of greasy (don&#x27;t believe reviews that say it is not), but it works great, so that is OK.  I have a lot of problems with dry, cracked skin on my feet.  After using for 2 nights of using Albolene, the soles of my feet feel are very soft.  I do this about 3 nights a weeks andI wear a lightweight pair of socks to keep the sheets from getting greasy.</li>
            <li> Much better than K-Y for sex. Doesn&#x27;t lose its moisture.</li>
            <li> My wife orders this and she&#x27;s gorgeous, so it must have wonderful redeeming features.</li>
            <li> I love Albolene...I have been using it for years for facial cleansing.  It does a great job and leaves my face soft and bright!  Shipping was very speedy...a great transaction!</li>
            <li> I brought this product to help me sweat at the gym. It helps shed a lot of water weight. It&#x27;s also a good makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoy using this to remove my eye makeup.  After I remove my eye makeup then I remove my face makeup.  I feel my face feels so much softer in the morning. Highly recommended it!</li>
            <li> I heard about this product through a celebrity endorsement and it absolutely does work. I saw the makeup break down with very little effort. Although my habit is still to wash my face with soap and water, I noticed how moisturized my skin was without the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Love this product and I got the sweet sweat belt to</li>
            <li> I have used this product for many years.  It is excellent for cleansing  your face as well as removing makeup.  i would recommend this product for anyone wanting a cleanser that is inexpensive, easy to use, and non-drying.</li>
            <li> I bought this 2 years ago and finally I&#x27;ve found a real use for it. I originally bought this hoping to slather my mid section with it and use a waist band while working out. Yes, it created a lot of sweat but it felt kind of gross and I prefer using the waist band without the Albolene. So I decided to use it a few times for its original intended purpose which is a moisturizing makeup remover. I have an normal to oily face and I just didn&#x27;t like how it felt. However, I think it&#x27;s pretty good for removing eye makeup. Now, two years later, that jar has been sitting there mostly un-used. I have eczema that pops up on my hands mostly during the summer months. I transferred some albolene into an old Nivea cream travel sized tin and carry it in my purse. My eczema is clearing up now! It keeps it so moisturized. I am so happy I finally found my true use for albolene.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and versatile cleanser. Use it for makeup removal, body cleanser for daughters eczema(9 months), lip exfoliation... Etc this is a must have in our household</li>
            <li> AMAZING makeup remover and great for helping you sweat through that work out.</li>
            <li> I got it to use under a waist band. Its so greasy, and sticks to everything you touch, not a fan.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;ve been using it on my stomach when I workout. It make you sweat more around your waist when you work out. I wrap my stomach in saran wrap, and waist trimmer while working out.</li>
            <li> Works great but don&#x27;t like the greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> It had leaked all over inside the box it came in. Not sure what happened...just going to use it as I don&#x27;t have time to send it back.&lt;br /&gt;Was out of the last one.</li>
            <li> Awesome got it really fast at my door within couple of days awesome products came in a excellent box loved everything about it from the day I ordered till today very happy with it ☺️</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this product. It&#x27;s a great product, I use it as a moisturizing cream with hand lotion.  It provides additional moisturizer for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is super greasy. Its like trying to rub sticky slime off your face trying to get it off.. does work good to remove makeup but not good for all over face.. takes like 10 minutes of rinsing to remove residue.</li>
            <li> I use Albolene for everything even as a moisturizer for the whole body.  It lasts forever and does what is advertised to do.</li>
            <li> Love this ,works great,leaves my skin so soft and takes off my make-up so easy, even waterproff mascara,I tried so many expensive cleansers  and this is the best, price is right also !!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use it to rub on my belly cover with plastic and it helps sweat while I exercise.&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried it for make up remover</li>
            <li> I see some reviews are based on using it for a moisturizer and others to induce sweating and burning calories during workouts. I&#x27;ll have to try it for the ladder, I&#x27;m too afraid to use this as a moisturizer because it seems like vaseline, in my opinion. I&#x27;ll try it for the other purpose and see how that goes. I can use to trim my waist for sure.</li>
            <li> I will order this prduct again meets my needs</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended to me by a doctor to use as a sexual lubricant!  It works as promised...not leave you feeling greasy...and Amazon was the only place that I could track it down.</li>
            <li> It works real good for my girlfriend she said is it took of her make up like nothing and she is all so using it to loos wait</li>
            <li> I bought this to take my makeup off at night and immediately after using started having major break outs on my face. I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t question what it was made of before using it, but after looking into the ingredients it&#x27;s mineral oil! UGH! Mineral oil is basically a solid form of baby oil, which totally suffocates your skin and doesn&#x27;t allow it to breathe so no wonder I broke out.... Not really their fault since I didn&#x27;t read the ingredients, but buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Excellent makeup remover.</li>
            <li> Okay, let me start by saying this product is for makeup removal and really works at that. However, it is also used for people trying to loose weight. I rubbed it all over my body, from my face and neck area down to my anckles. Got dressed in my workout attire and let me tell you I was sweating terribly!!! I started walking and running around 6am-7:45am. The sun alone helps with sweating. I lost 3lbs that week. The jar is a bit for the price BUT its well worth it. If you want to loose the belly weight rub it on and cover with seram wrap!! Product is great!!! It also last long as you don&#x27;t need to use alot. Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Just what I need it a little expensive</li>
            <li> I saw a TV commercial recently for Albolene and it brought back memories of my mother using it through the years I was growing up. My mother always had the most beautiful skin and she swore by this product. So glad I saw the commercial because I didn&#x27;t know if Albolene was still sold. I just started using it on my face and find it is a perfect cleanser to help my skin in this cold weather.</li>
            <li> I believe not using water is the best way to keep my face moisturized, however, this product is not completely removing my makeup as does my Neutrogena face wash which I remove with a wet wash cloth. I will continue to use it through the winter and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Skin so soft! Workouts are finally being maximized!</li>
            <li> Use it to take my makeup off</li>
            <li> Awesome product, works fine.</li>
            <li> I use this in place of Sweat as a workout enhancer because it&#x27;s way cheaper and I think it honestly works better! Love it and for a fraction of the cost of Sweet Sweat you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard this stuff was used as a substitute for fly floatant and fished with some guides this summer that used it.  It works well on large foam flies and medium flies.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on smaller more delicate flies yet.  A jar will last most of a life time if this is all you use it for and you will probably want to transfer some to a smaller container for use on the river.  It also works as a substitute for lip balm and is great for dry skin.  I&#x27;m not into makeup so I haven&#x27;t tried it for its original use as a makeup remover.</li>
            <li> I love it. Not greasy at all, very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I bought this on the advice of a friend who also has a little kid with eczema who requires after-bath &amp;#34;greasing&amp;#34; each night. She said it was easier to spread than Aquaphor or Eucerin, and worked better. She was right! Because the product liquifies upon application, it is easier to spread quickly on a squirmy child. (This is probably why it&#x27;s billed as a makeup remover, too-- easy to spread in the eye area.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And because Albolene is a solid at room temperature, it provides the same occlusive barrier as those other products. In fact, it seems to work better at keeping my son&#x27;s skin moist and soft. I notice it contains paraffin-- that might be the magic ingredient. I&#x27;ve begun using it on my chapped winter hands, and it&#x27;s great! Soaks in faster than Aquaphor and really solves the chapping and redness overnight. This is a good, basic workhorse of a product with a versatile texture and inert, non-irritating ingredients. It&#x27;s our elbow grease!</li>
            <li> Great for moisturizing very dry skin like feet. Also a great personal lubricant for men.</li>
            <li> Great as a moisturizer, but not so good as a weight loss product.</li>
            <li> This product makes you sweat like crazy. You will burn off a lot of water weight,  this is great stuff.</li>
            <li> The Abolene Cleanser takes my makeup off better than any other item I have used. Not only does it quickly and easily remove my eye makeup, it doesn&#x27;t dry and damage my sensitive skin like so many other makeup removers. I had given up removing my makeup all the way at night because it was less damaging than using any other makeup removers. This has been a blessing for clearing up my skin. Bonus: It doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes/contacts the next day.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizing cream love how it makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> Very greasy, smooths the skin, but doesn&#x27;t get stretch marks to go away.</li>
            <li> Thus is a very good product. This is my first day using it for my workout and I was seating alot even the saran plastic was soaked. Recommend for a weight loss product.</li>
            <li> I honetly didn&#x27;t notice that I sweat more using this stuff while working out (which is the main purpose for getting the stuff). I&#x27;ve stopped using it long ago. Just ok.</li>
            <li> Great for waist training!</li>
            <li> I love the product and i will order again, it helps a lot with my dry skin. I will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s great for the skin. I heard it helps slim the stomach if using while working out  but still waiting on the results.</li>
            <li> I love it. Great for taking makeup off and for working out.</li>
            <li> This is also great to use for an unscented massage oil or a highly moisturizing face wash.</li>
            <li> This stuff is WONDERFUL!!!</li>
            <li> This is great for working out. Makes you sweat lots too.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product about a little over a month ago...i have used it on my stomach with my waist cincher...my skin is left feeling softer and smoother. When i exercise i do sweat more w Yuba th the cream than before in this area... I think its a good product and im please with my results thus far...inch by inch off..</li>
            <li> SWEAT SWEAT SWEAT... I&#x27;ve compared it to &amp;#34;sweet sweat&amp;#34; and other amazing WAY MORE EXPENSIVE products and this gem works just as well or better.. GET IT! Plus it&#x27;s good for your skin!</li>
            <li> SO FAR I AM LIKE THIS. I USE IT WHEN I WORK OUT AND IT REALLY DOES HELP</li>
            <li> I love this product. Great as a cleanser and helps to in weight lost.</li>
            <li> The cream really works for,  used it before gym and so so sweating</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this as a weight loss aid when exercising. So it works foe me.</li>
            <li> I wear it even when I am not working out in the true sense of the word and I sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> i originally bought this to use when i work out..however i have used it since i received it in place of my lotion and i love it!!  a little goes along way!! i sweated a little more when i wore it but not to much</li>
            <li> I believe it works I use this on my easy days when I&#x27;m not too much working out but have on throughout day with my waist band. Just really hard to clean I have to wash my hands like 4 times to get oiliness off.</li>
            <li> I bought it some I could Saran wrap my stomach.  I haven&#x27;t used it consistently, but it does make me sweat in the stomach area.</li>
            <li> serves its purpose and really makes you sweat used for waist trimmer while running and ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS had a trail of sweat when my workouts were complete</li>
            <li> I am using this to help lose some tummy chubby, it makes you sweat, trim down waist size cool product ! no bs. and removes my make up like magic.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this to remove my makeup. I actually rub it on my arms, legs and waist to help me sweat more during workouts. Works great. Hard about it from a boxing gym.</li>
            <li> i love the way it feels and i like how it has no scent. great for ppl with sensitive skin leaves it really soft be careful not too put too much it will leave you greasy</li>
            <li> I have been using Albolene for 45 years.  It is the best for removing makeup.  I could not find this product locally so I was happy to see I could purchase it through Amazon.  Came promptly. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe it took me so long to find this product! It literally takes the makeup right off in seconds!</li>
            <li> I started using this on my feet and found that it really helps. I bought this to substitute my sweet sweat, but it failed. So I just started using it on my feet every night and to my surprise my feet are way softer. Working out can take a toll on your feet and this stuff actually helps.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very soft afterwards. Its a cool product!</li>
            <li> I used this stuff when I was in theatre to remove my stage make-up. I&#x27;d been searching for a good street make-up remover and came across this again. I love it! It&#x27;s quick, easy, and leaves my face incredibly soft and moisturized. I&#x27;ve been using it since November and now, in April, still have about half the tub left. I put a little on, rub it around, tissue off, then rinse with a warm washcloth. (It will clog your sink if you try to rinse it off without wiping it off with a tissue first!) I was a little concerned about using it so much, thinking I was &#x27;clogging my pores&#x27; or something, but a plastic surgeon&#x27;s office told me that this was the best type of product (oil based) to use to remove makeup because it does moisturize so well. I&#x27;ll keep using it!</li>
            <li> I use this under my sweat bands and it makes my skin so soft and I drop from the fat melting.</li>
            <li> The best and only way to take off heavy eye makeup. Tried and true kinda stuff.</li>
            <li> Great for taking off makeup.  Leaves your face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this for exercising and it works like a charm I love it . I rub it around my waist and use a pink wrap and a waist belt and it makes me sweat like crazy and lose a lot of weight off my stomach and back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kinda so so on this product. There is nothing fantastic about it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t agree with my skin type, caused breakout. I discontinued use and discarded it.</li>
            <li> Best cleaner ever.  Love it</li>
            <li> I used this for working out and it does make you sweat. It is very greasy so I so not use it often but when I do use it I sweat a lot. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Just get a store brand... IT does remove make-up well.</li>
            <li> Wife says that it is very good makeup remover. Can&#x27;t say myself, so I&#x27;ll have to&lt;br /&gt;take her word for it.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep skin moist</li>
            <li> I love it! Works wonders!!</li>
            <li> I really like Albolene Moisturizing Cleanser and have been using it for years now -- it works very well for me. Albolene Moisturizing Cleanser leaves my skin very smooth and clean. Very good product. My sister recently told me about Skingenixx Facial Cleanser because it is contains powerful anti-aging ingredients like green tea, collagen, and glycolic acid [[ASIN:B00VSF4T26 Skingenixx Complete Exfoliating Facial Cleanser!]] and the Skingenixx has worked even better than the Albolene for me. I highly recommend both, but the Skingenixx is much better in my opinion if you want to spend the extra money!</li>
            <li> MY USE FOR EVERYTHING CREAM TINY EYE WRINKLES, NECK CREASES, SUNBURN  JUST A TINY SPECK WILL DO AMAZING THINGS EVEN  REMOVE EYE MAKEUP,</li>
            <li> This product smells great and it helps you sweat during workouts. It is very similar to petroleum jelly but not as dense. Much cheaper than other &amp;#34;workout helpers&amp;#34; used along with a sweat belt for the waist.</li>
            <li> Skin feel smooth afterwards</li>
            <li> Very helpful for those trying to lose weight. Helps you sweat like crazy! Love it!</li>
            <li> Securely packaged, arrived very soon after order submitted.  Great moisturizer.  Water soluble; therefore, not greasy.  I use it to combat dry hands during cold weather.</li>
            <li> My roommate has this and she told  me I should get it so I did.  Loving it so far!  I can tell this is gonna last me a long time, and it was cheap too!  My friend&#x27;s mom said this helped her not get as much wrinkles when she got older so yay to me!</li>
            <li> Its really working on me.I apply albolene on my waist and wrap with saran wrap then i start to do workout .I had lost 4 inches on my waist .I was 42 and now I am 37 .</li>
            <li> This things is also good for eczema. Very good product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s very easy to use. I wish I had found this years ago.</li>
            <li> it does make you seem to be sweating more. However I didn&#x27;t see an difference than if I exercised normally. I apply it to my stomach, place the saran wrap, them my waist trimmer, and then my waist cincher. But I don&#x27;t exercise without it nevertheless.</li>
            <li> works miracles! cleans my face and definitely works with the waist trimmer belt to sweat more when i&#x27;m working out!</li>
            <li> Removes mascara, soothes chapped lips, and is an excellent (odorless/tasteless) personal lubricant. Saw that it is now available in a tube, which makes it very portable.</li>
            <li> great cleanser.  It is very greasy though, which I don&#x27;t mind.  I wear it to sleep.  I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re supposed to keep this on or wipe it off.  I leave it on.  My face stays moisturize.  Definitely buy again.  Last a long time.</li>
            <li> This product makes me itch. Not sure if I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years. In the early years, I paid less than five dollars a jar.&lt;br /&gt; Not too many stores carried it. For awhile, Walmart in some stores had it on the shelves.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the price began rising and rising, forcing many stores even Walmart not to carry it.&lt;br /&gt;The public&#x27;s loss.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been perusing amazon&#x27;s products for a couple of years now.&lt;br /&gt;Not until very recently did I see  AlBOLENE being marketed on amazon,&lt;br /&gt;but the price was/is outrageously high for any one who doesn&#x27;t have a&lt;br /&gt;decent income.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m long retired,disabled and am not living high on the hog. Yet even the price,&lt;br /&gt;though very high,didn&#x27;t stop me from buying this, most wonderful facial cream&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve ever experienced.&lt;br /&gt;It removes anything that might adhere to facial skin, even makeup. Its so very Gentle.&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t  need to use much. A tiny bit of Albolene goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;My skin has always been described as: baby skin. I have very smooth,&lt;br /&gt;soft and sensitive skin. Redheads do have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;I need to stay out of the sun particularly since I&#x27;ve had skin cancer 3 times.&lt;br /&gt;Since I couldn&#x27;t purchase Albolene anywhere until now, I resorted to using&lt;br /&gt;other creams, none of which could compete with Albolene. My skin always&lt;br /&gt;felt dry with these other creams. Now I&#x27;m using Albolene again, my skin feels&lt;br /&gt;wonderful. Not dry. Alive!&lt;br /&gt;I have to learn to use it sparingly because&lt;br /&gt;of its cost and a little bit does go along ways.&lt;br /&gt;Rev Pat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Albolene for years.  Fantastic face cleansing product. A+++++</li>
            <li> Great product for working out.</li>
            <li> love love love! i have used this with my cling wrap and my waist cincher.. it works trust me!</li>
            <li> I like the product.  However, when I received it the top was broken so I had to transfer the product to another jar.</li>
            <li> It works with the sweet sweat.</li>
            <li> Instead of buying eye make-up remover products, I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  It&#x27;s not irritating, not greasy, and I just use a little and wipe off with a tissue.  The jar is huge and will last for several years.</li>
            <li> I use this product to cleanse my face at night. In the morning my face looks bright and glowing. I use it for my super dry feet too and it works. I love Amazon purchase are always on time.</li>
            <li> The thing I like about this product is that it is water soluble and not greasy. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the price (which is why I only gave it a 4 star) however, HBKDirect seller had the best price.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist said to NOT dry off after shower; instead, rub on the albolene, which I do, and rarely use a towel. Seems to work well. At least I&#x27;m not flaking !</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Makes my skin super soft!</li>
            <li> I have used Albolene Moisturizing Cream for almost 20 years as my make-up remover. I used to use Vaseline to take off my mascara but switched to Albolene when a girl in my dance troupe turned me on to it.  Mascara and lipstick come right off and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized. It&#x27;s main ingredient is mineral oil rather than petroleum jelly, therefore, it liquefies quickly and turns into an almost baby oil-like consistency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the company will like me saying this but Albolene is an amazing sensual lubricant, too.  Because of its petroleum base, it has wonderful staying power and is so silky to the touch.  Needless to say, I go through many jars of this excellent stuff and it&#x27;s not inexpensive--but worth every single penny!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. I don&#x27;t use it for makeup remover or for working out (I&#x27;m a dude). Works superbly for what I use it for. Better than any hand lotion. A small amount will last you an entire session. I wish I knew about this stuff years ago!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is regular vaseline , but this order was still very successful. After reading the reviews from amazon and all over the Internet,  I had to try it for myself. It arrived at my house quickly and I opened the little box automatically and rubbed the Albolene all over my body then exercised. Albolene + Sauna/Sweatsuit &#x3D; Tons of sweat and eventually results. If you aren&#x27;t using this as a makeup remover (like me) make sure you keep your body hydrated.</li>
            <li> Works great for weight loss. rub on desired area and opens your pours to help sweat in that particular area.</li>
            <li> This products says what it does. amazing for make-up remover on the eyes and face. but if you have an overly oily face then its best to wash your face with your own face wash after you use the albolene. this is also great for weightloss. use it with a body wrap when you work out. produces more sweat!</li>
            <li> This def makes you sweat during a workout. I was literally drenched after my work out!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer work great!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a must buy!!! This makes you sweat sweat sweat sweat sweat.....my midsection has went down a lot since I have been using this product it&#x27;s definitely again a must  buy!!!</li>
            <li> I wish I could write a better and more personal review, but my wife saw it on the counter and decided it was hers. ha ha. She uses it every day now. I was using it as a pre-workout body rub to induce sweating - which it works okay at. But for it&#x27;s original intent it apparently works great because my wife won&#x27;t let me \\&quot;waste her stuff\\&quot; anymore.</li>
            <li> In 1965 my mother went to work in a dermatologists office. He sent her home one day with one blue tin and one pink tin (yes tins back then!)of Albolene Creme. I started using it that year and have never stopped...48 years later. I&#x27;ll be 60 in 18 months and have yet to develop crows feet or any facial wrinkles. I swear by this stuff. Not only did I raise all 3 of my daughters on it, now it&#x27;s curing my grandaughter&#x27;s eczema!! Recently I was stopped at airport security and told I couldn&#x27;t pass through with it in my carry on. I told the (female) agent what it was &amp; how wonderful it had been over the years. Laughing I asked her to find one wrinkle on my face, hard as she tried she couldn&#x27;t. She was heading out to buy some when she got off work, LOL. This has to be my all time favorite beauty product!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it but it was ok</li>
            <li> If you think this is going to help you exercise....well maybe your arm.  This stuff is the best for yanking the crank. It never dries out you can go for a long time and it stays nice and slippery. Best stuff ever invented for edging for hours.  Thats what its really best used for.  Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Amazing product if you love having your face silky smooth baby but soft I call it, my make up after parting no problem anymore, also all over your body after showering specially in the winter, it is not greasy it blend in to your skin, I also put it on my tattoo to heal since it has no smell thanks guys and the delivery fast awesome recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great for combineed with a waist trimmer belt. I sweated throughout my workout. Also use as recommended as a cleanser or make-up remover</li>
            <li> My wife loves it to remove make up</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Does the job.  Better than vasoline.</li>
            <li> Use it to urge sweat during my workout, works like a charm.</li>
            <li> The albolene cream really works and makes you sweat more. I like the lightness of the cream and the scent is mild..</li>
            <li> And then try getting THAT off!  You need either hotter water than I want to use - or a face wash.  Which kind of defeats the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use under my waist cincher to enhance sweating and drop inches quickly.  I guess it&#x27;s working but I&#x27;m not sure.  My belly has definitely slimmed down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years to remove my make-up. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer for all areas of dry skin. I recently saw Jacqueline Smith (Charlie&#x27;s Angels) on a talk show and she said she uses this product all the time.</li>
            <li> Honestly i cant say its all that and i actually wore it under my waist cincher and i mean i sweat bt thats about all it did ....i cant realli say it did all this and that....so hell yes i wouldnt give it a thumbs up or down ....its just a product,that make u sweat in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Glad this item came in promptly just as expected!! I have been using this item for the past couple days and i can notice how clean and fresh my skin feels already. This seems to be a great product by far and inexpensive. I would highly recommend this over top named brands that could cost a fortune.</li>
            <li> This is the best makeup remover there is. Even after washing my face with a cloth and cleaning lotion, I still get a lot of makeup off with this product. My mom used it when I was a kid, and I have used it for years as well. Very good product.</li>
            <li> Excellent for removing make up and for general skin moisturizing. I have been using it for years, but can&#x27;t find it in most stores.</li>
            <li> Still using the product, however it does have amazing results and I&#x27;ve only had it less than a month.  Wish I knew about this product a lot sooner.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS. THE JAR CAME BROKEN AND IT&#x27;S JUST PETROLEUM JELLY.</li>
            <li> Rubbed about a 2 teaspoons of Albolene on torso and wrapped waist trimmer over.  After half mile, felt tingling and extra heat on back.  Once I got through first mile, I adjusted trimmer and felt lots of sweat!  Once I took off the waist trimmer, sweat was literally dripping off the waist trimmer and all down my torso and back. I&#x27;d say Albolene works really well to help get rid of water weight, as for the longer term effects, I&#x27;m not sure since it&#x27;s my first day, but I definitely felt a difference</li>
            <li> LOVE IT! Having eczema is hard to find something that wont damage my skin and this does not and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I do Zumba and I put it on my stomach this product is very good and really sweat out the fat</li>
            <li> Outstanding for use as a lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You didn&#x27;t think I was going to say it&#x27;s also a dessert topping and floor wax, did you?</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! It serves multiple uses. I use it as a moisturizer as well as a make up remover and for other things also.</li>
            <li> A fine (and cost-effective) product for personal lubrication purposes.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff you sweat a lot especially in the steam room plus your skin feels so soft I didn&#x27;t use it to remove makeup because I don&#x27;t wear it I used it to lose a little water weigh for certain occasion it works also I used it because my feet feels dry and it helped to keep them moist</li>
            <li> I have used Albolene Moisturizing Cream off/on for most of my life.  I use it after showering, but prior to drying.  Through the years I have found that helps trap the moisture in my skin.  During the cold months of the year I find Albolene helps my dry skin better than any other product.</li>
            <li> It works really well. I use it with the sweat sweat trimming belt. It really make you sweat. I love this product.</li>
            <li> It was ok. Never helped as far as increasing sweat production under workout garment. But it is good as a make-up remover, not cleaser. It really help get your makeup off and then use a cleaser with it or right after and your face is nice and cleaned and moisterized. No need to repurchase for the price, maybe if it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great make up remover</li>
            <li> works great this is my second time ordering this product. i dont use it for make up rremoval i use it to help me sweat when i work out and for my daughters ezcema. i keep some handy</li>
            <li> I used it on my waist to shrink it, but saw no difference.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes you sweat!!!</li>
            <li> Good price, and this product is hard to find at stores. Takes off make up, dosnt burn, and came fast!</li>
            <li> Just arrived in the mail! It&#x27;s melted? But I&#x27;m really excited to use it when it&#x27;s solid. I&#x27;ll write another review in a week or two.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I purchased another product like this that was much more expensive, but this works just as well. I use this while working out under a workout belt, By the time I am done with my workout, my abs are drenched in sweat. And while I don&#x27;t usually bother to measure my waist, few times I have, there is a difference.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this to help me lose belly fat. I apply it to my midsection, put on a stomach trimmer and I workout.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used it to remove makeup but it&#x27;s great for dry skin. I&#x27;ve used it on my back, legs and arms.</li>
            <li> I was skeptic at first, but I must admit makes me sweat, Im starting my Albolene challenge June 23 and will keep you guys updated.</li>
            <li> this stuff is better than sweat sweet.  I love the way my body reacts during my workout. I am usually dripping sweat and my clothes can be rung out after I workout.</li>
            <li> Also great as a sexy lube. Not so good for your day to day cleansing needs as it may leave your face oily, but for removing make up its the best.</li>
            <li> I tried this today for extra sweat around  my stomach, and seemed to improve sweating I also use this for dry winter skin</li>
            <li> Good value for this size, received product quick</li>
            <li> Amazing product. It doe the trick for my mother&#x27;s workout and of course makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon and the entire team for doing such a good job on delivering the products quickly.</li>
            <li> very good make-up remover, but it&#x27;s hard to clean this off the face. using paper tissue would leave traces, using towel would make the towel hard to wash. but still, I love how mild this product is.</li>
            <li> Brought product to lose weight and after just 2 days made my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> This product does fine but it leaves my face oily. It could be&lt;br /&gt;my skin...it does take makeup off good. I haven&#x27;t tried it&lt;br /&gt;for the tummy yet.</li>
            <li> I work out hard and I wear my cincher along with this product, Im not noticing any drastic amount of sweat. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Great for sweating when working out, and for soft skin !</li>
            <li> Great product for working out ut has helped me look alot off.of my.tummy</li>
            <li> Really works sweating when your using wraps</li>
            <li> Help a lot with my exercise routine. Thank You</li>
            <li> great with the waist trimmer belt</li>
            <li> It really works i use it to work out with the sweat be dripping crazy</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t even remember why I bought this in the first place lol. But now, I just use it as a makeup remover, &amp; moisturizer when my skin gets dry or flaky.</li>
            <li> Great Item, Fast shipper, will use again.</li>
            <li> Didnt work for fat reduction at all, I purchased based off reviews</li>
            <li> Yes it is a great product. It makes you skin very soft. I.love it. I will buy more you should try it it works.</li>
            <li> This really does make you sweat a lot!!!! I feel like I&#x27;ve really worked out once I&#x27;m done.  I will be buying a lot more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. It works great. Makeup slides right off and you get the extra bonus of a deep moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Bought this to try to replace Mary Kay Extra Emollient Cleansing Cream, which was discontinued. It is a bit thinner/greasier than the Mary Kay, but so far, the closest I have found for my sensitive, extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the reviews of sweating more when applying this to your body. I did it and yes it worked but noticed that it clogs your pores. I now use it as a makeup remover and it does a good job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my face which is really helping to clear up my oily skin. I&#x27;ve also used it on my belly with the plastic wrap before working out and it really works also leaves my skin baby soft. Def. would buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I could not find it at any WalGreens or Wal-Mart in my area so I had to order it and I&#x27;m so happy I did. Money well spent.:-)</li>
            <li> Makes Me Sweat A Lot!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this 12 oz. jar of &amp;#34; Albolene Moisturizing Cleanser &amp;#34; for my mother because she saw it on TV, and said she had used it in the past and said it was really good! She not only uses it to remove makeup, but also uses it as a moisturizing night cream. She absolutely loves it! We are both glad I bought it for her.We both recommend it to all woman.</li>
            <li> Got what I expected. .thumbs up</li>
            <li> ARRIVED IN GOOD CONDITION, THOUGH THE FRAGILE ITEM WITH IT DID NOT.  HOPING THE RAVE REVIEWS BY JACLYN SMITH ON TV  WILL APPLY.  HAVE ONLY USED ON MY BODY TWICE AFTER SHOWERING AND IT SEEMS TO HELP MOISTURIZE MY SKIN AFTER TOWEL DRYING.</li>
            <li> All I can say For me  .do as it say</li>
            <li> I love this product although I use it for weight loss purposes because it helps you sweat extra water weight when I rub on my stomach and wrap it up.  It helps. I love it. I have also used it on my skin as a moisturizer, it keeps your skin soft.</li>
            <li> I am amazed by this product. I absolutely love it. I have only been using this about a week and my waist is an inch smaller.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I had read about it in Woman&#x27;s World about a year ago as good for removing flaking skin or breakouts around the eyebrows.  It worked! It is a gentle product, not harsh.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed I&#x27;ve uses it literally from head to toe and it has worked wonders on my daughter&#x27;s eczema</li>
            <li> Works great...removes makeup so easily and leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> the litem works great for taking make-up off at night. would recommend it anyone. plus you can get it in little pack to take on trips</li>
            <li> Fantastic makeup remover and extremely gentle on my very sensitive skin. I have acne and eczema and this stuff doesn&#x27;t aggravate either of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea that it will help you lose weight is really ridiculous though. lol</li>
            <li> Great makeup remover and it also Makes you sweat a lot while working out !!!</li>
            <li> makes me sweat like a champ</li>
            <li> This is a staple for makeup removal!</li>
            <li> best product to help you sweat</li>
            <li> My two year old has excema.  This product helps seal in the medication that&#x27;s prescribed to my daughter.  After applying the medication, seal it in with this great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I use this for homeade bodywraps...it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This may have been around forever but....it is awesome. I can&#x27;t live without it. It does amazing things to dry spots (even on my dog) . It also takes all make-up off and makes your skin little baby&#x27;s bottom !!!</li>
            <li> I got this after watching a review on shaping my midsection by working out with cream under my sweat band! All I can say is when I get done with spin class, I take this belt off and its like a puddle drops. Its working for me and of course you cant be a lazy chick-clean up your diet and workout and you will see results!!</li>
            <li> Great personal lubricant</li>
            <li> A fantastic makeup remover! I put it on at night to remove my makeup (just a little dab is enough! I always used to put too much on my face) and wipe it off with a small towel that I run under hot water first. Then I use my regular cleanser to clean my pores. This is so great for heavy eyeliner and mascara!!!</li>
            <li> I have a child with severe eczema and the Dr. recommended this as a moisturizer.  It works really well and there is no complaining or crying as with many other creams.</li>
            <li> love this cleanser. My skin is very, very dry and this cream has been so helpful. The cream my dermatologist prescribed was so expensive and really did not help that much. I saw this advertised on a TV show so I tried it. Awesome stuff! The price is great, and it works! Happy, Happy!</li>
            <li> This product worked wonders on my daughter&#x27;s diaper rash. A little oily for a face cleanser though.</li>
            <li> a lot of people say they try this to lose weight so I decided to purchase it and give it a shot myself it does make you sweat but it also left me with a little rash maybe I&#x27;m allergic to something in it I don&#x27;t know I&#x27;ve tried different gels that worked a lot better if this doesn&#x27;t work for you try gel-v Beachbody its more pricey but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Paired with a microfiber cloth, this removes all my face, lip, and eye makeup in one pass and leaves my skin soft and moisturized. My only regret is that I didn&#x27;t find this product earlier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll recommend this product to anyone!! I&#x27;ve been using alboline for the past 3 weeks and my waist line already shrinked... makes my stomach sweats a lot!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and she&#x27;s a Cosmetologist so that&#x27;s all that matters to me ;)</li>
            <li> This is some pretty amazing stuff. It makes a great moisture barrier for the skin as well as removing makeup. A great product.</li>
            <li> This works good with a waist trimmer. Makes you drip in sweat to help lose extra water weight!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t yet say much about the product because it&#x27;s fairly new. I purchased it as part of my weight loss routine with the waist cincher. However, to my surprise it has helped me with ny acne.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using this product and brand for a long time in boxing and regular work out ,very helpful to lose weight and apply it before the sauna belt</li>
            <li> Love it makes you sweat so much</li>
            <li> Arrived early and is very Good to use during workouts</li>
    </ol>
