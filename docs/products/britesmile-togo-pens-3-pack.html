            <li>I use to buy this from brite smile website but has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>I can tell the difference on my teeth but with this brite smile teeth whitener I bought online</li>
            <li>product is very easy to use and seems to actually work.</li>
            <li>and it tastes funny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several teeth whiteners and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>it was when I first started buying it.</li>
            <li>not that it matters, unless the formula is now less effective.</li>
            <li>BriteSmile knows how to whiten teeth very well.</li>
            <li>This was a reorder, because I think they work very well.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>, I can&#x27;t see the difference in the color of my teeth and the taste n consistency of the whitener is different from the original.</li>
            <li>I had use BriteSmile before, and thought it did a decent job of whitening my teeth.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that it seems like its not doing much for the first couple of days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad there are a few places that still offer it.  </li>
            <li>I even make a point to smile now to show my friends my new white teeth.  </li>

            <li>so easy to use and last a long time</li>
            <li>and they don&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive!</li>
            <li>In the past, I&#x27;ve used whiteners that were more expensive and less comfortable, but I think this brand did just as good of a job.</li>
            <li>No messy trays or strips to apply.</li>
            <li>I have had yellow and even orange color teeth my whole life.  </li>
            <li>easy to use, does make my teeth a little sensitive, so, only use it every other day, every 3 days-&lt;br /&gt;just click &amp; coat teeth, gets in between teeth, which is a plus</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for some time now and they&#x27;ve traditionally been quite expensive.  These came in the original packaging and work great.  You can&#x27;t beat Amazon for a great price on this as well. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Tastes good and doesn&#x27;t sting my gums. I used them twice a day for two weeks as directed and I could definitely see an improvement in the whites of my teeth. In the past, I&#x27;ve used whiteners that were more expensive and less comfortable, but I think this brand did just as good of a job.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff here. BriteSmile knows how to whiten teeth very well. I used it for several days and after the 3rd day started to notice that my teeth became whiter than i thought it would. This is great for everyday and anywhere use. The only problem is that it seems like its not doing much for the first couple of days. and it tastes funny. Its defiantly work it.</li>
            <li> I agree with everyone else that not to order an imatation.  There are a lot of knock-offs out&lt;br /&gt;there and they don&#x27;t even come close to comparison.</li>
            <li> Found this pen to be the only product that gives me a noticeable whitening without sensitivity.  So convenient.  No messy trays or strips to apply.</li>
            <li> easy to use, does make my teeth a little sensitive, so, only use it every other day, every 3 days-&lt;br /&gt;just click &amp; coat teeth, gets in between teeth, which is a plus</li>
            <li> it whitened some but not like some of the reviews stated</li>
            <li> These are getting really hard to find.  They work beautifully!  And so easy.  I apply before my shower in the morning.  White teeth!</li>
            <li> These are the only teeth whitening product that I will use anymore because they don&#x27;t HURT my teeth like the stripes do and they work!</li>
            <li> 3 pens lasted me about as long as 1 of the other pens. I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change either....  :(</li>
            <li> BriteSmile ToGo pens will enhance the natural beauty of healthy teeth. I don&#x27;t think its for erasing bad habits like smoking or tobacco use. I am a coffee drinker and it works for that.</li>
            <li> I think they work great!  I love to smile....</li>
            <li> Was this changed? Yes. There&#x27;s no minty taste, and the pen and packaging have been cheapened - not that it matters, unless the formula is now less effective.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I assumed.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve tried several teeth whiteners and this is my favorite.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t burn my gums and I feel like my breath doesn&#x27;t smell too bad in the morning.</li>
            <li> Great product. Have used these pens for several years and recommended these pens to friends and family.</li>
            <li> Works ok, but expensive</li>
            <li> An easy way to keep teeth white daily. I have been buying these for years. I swear by them. I get compliments on my teeth.</li>
            <li> I have had yellow and even orange color teeth my whole life.  I always grinned rather than smiled.  UNTIL NOW!...... After 2 weeks my wife saw 30% improvement. After 4 weeks there was 50% improvement.  Now i used few times a week and have very white teeth.  I even make a point to smile now to show my friends my new white teeth.  I even feel better about myself now.  This product is hard to locate any other place than AMAZON.  At beginning, use morning and night and don&#x27;t close mouth, simply make a fake smile with teeth together for 10 min.  Do not drink liquids 20-min after or it will wash the product away.  ALSO, USE WITH THE TOOTHPASTE FOR BEST WHITENING POWER.</li>
            <li> I use to buy this from brite smile website but has been discontinued. I can tell the difference on my teeth but with this brite smile teeth whitener I bought online , I can&#x27;t see the difference in the color of my teeth and the taste n consistency of the whitener is different from the original.</li>
            <li> very good product.  I use here and there when I need to a quick fix for whitening my teeth.</li>
            <li> These pens are a great touch up after using the whitening trays, or even just daily to help keep your teeth whiter.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t whiten my teeth &amp;#34;hollywood white&amp;#34; but it took the yellowing away.  It was easy to put on and didn&#x27;t make a mess like trays.</li>
            <li> Thought this was a great idea and very convenient, however, it really did burn my gums.  I do use sensodyne toothpaste and that didn&#x27;t even help with this product.....Amazon was great at returning once again.....I love AMAZING AMAZON!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t get it to stay on teeth! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> it was exactly what I wanted. Thank You</li>
            <li> This was a reorder, because I think they work very well.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use in a nice handy container that you can also take &amp;#34;to go&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> love them! so easy to use and last a long time and they don&#x27;t make my teeth sensitive!</li>
            <li> I just received my order but at this point it appears it is working and I can see and improvement in my teeth. The pen is easy to use and product is transfered very easily.</li>
            <li> product is very easy to use and seems to actually work.</li>
            <li> I use these faithfully especially when traveling and they work great! Find that using the pen twice a day works the best.</li>
            <li> Bought this for years now but the formula seems to have been diluted compared to when I started using this product.&lt;br /&gt;I like the convenience of the TO GO PEN and hope they change the formula back to like it was when I first started buying it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t locate this product and switched to a different brand, that did just about nothing.  I had use BriteSmile before, and thought it did a decent job of whitening my teeth.  I&#x27;m glad there are a few places that still offer it.  I do wish it were a little cheaper though, so I could order more at one time.</li>
