            <li>Excellent product.  </li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>This is a good product to use when you want to style \\&quot;wet\\</li>
            <li>Glad to still be able to purchase this!</li>
            <li>the rest is just preventative, so I am thoroughly sold on the value of keeping some of this stuff around.  :-)</li>
            <li>I purchased that for $2.19 and it works better than this product.</li>
            <li>Love love love this tape.  </li>
            <li>I used this product many years ago when my hair was longer.</li>
            <li>Love this tape.</li>
            <li>It worked okay.</li>
            <li>more stuck up ends</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scotch will soon not have the quality dispensers a good reason to get any and all right now.</li>
            <li>This stuff is comfortable, easy to use and effective.  </li>
            <li>The tape holds wonderfully and when my hair is dry, I pull it off.</li>
            <li>The shipment was prompt and the packaging was secure.</li>
            <li>I was using Breathe Right nasal strips, but this tape works better and goes for longer</li>
            <li>cool and easy to use</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!!!</li>
            <li>Makes a good frownie alternative, but only for the forehead and corners of the mouth.  </li>
            <li>I looked on the internet and was thrilled to find my old friend again.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly the same wonderful tape that it was then, only much more money.  </li>
            <li>This tape breathes very nicely, doesn&#x27;t pull out hair, is soft feeling on and is far easier to remove than frownies.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making it available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using it again and after only a week the lines are noticeably better.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>Short hairstyles benefit from this easy to pull off tape.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>By the time, I go for my reunion, I expect to look much</li>
            <li>For the forehead, though, I much prefer it to frownies.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Recently, my hair seems to have gotten a mind of its own and takes off in 15 different directions.  </li>
            <li>that I&#x27;m older</li>
            <li>For me, the forehead area is the main concern -</li>
            <li>It also prevents the moustache hair from becoming unruly due to the CPAP face mask sliding around during the night and rumpling the moustache hair.</li>
            <li>The shipping cost as much as the tape itself and the tape seemed like it was old stock from the 70&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for my purpose.</li>
            <li>Used this when I was in high school in the 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have those old lady sticking out eyebrows in the morning!</li>
            <li>I still love it, but am not sure I will buy it again, because of the price.  </li>
            <li>During some stressful times in my life, I developed creases between my eyes from scowling.</li>
            <li>Over time, the lines went away completely.  </li>
            <li>So I was pleasantly surprised when I saw this was still on the market.</li>
            <li>My friend said she uses &amp;#34;paper tape&amp;#34; which is in the pharmacy near the bandaids etc.</li>
            <li>Since this tape doesn&#x27;t irritate even sensitive skin (which I have), I decided to experiment with it to decrease the lines by ensuring the skin stayed smooth at least during the night.</li>
            <li>I made this purchase to train the deep wrinkle across my forehead, following the recommendation of other reviewers, and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It barely adhered as I remember it from years ago.</li>
            <li>It is so expensive and does not stick very well, but it is only available this way.</li>
            <li>probably works better with thick hair or other uses.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Now when I get out of the shower and while my hair is still pretty wet, I comb it the way I want it to look and tape it down.  </li>
            <li> I used to use this tape in the 1970&#x27;s and recently got a hairstyle that requires the hair to stay flat against my neck.</li>
            <li> While its expensive compared to what it cost when it was readily available, it&#x27;s waaaaay cheaper than Botox.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave it on too long tho or it will pull  your hair</li>
            <li> be prepared for pulling it loose form your hair&lt;</li>
            <li> I used to use this tape in the late 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s when I was a hairdresser.  </li>
            <li> For the past 40 or so years my hair was very short</li>
            <li> For some reason lately I have been sleeping in such a way that one eyebrow is all distorted when I wake up.  </li>
            <li> It holds down curly hair, on the side of your face or bangs, during the night.  </li>
            <li> When I couldn&#x27;t find the tape, I tried another product called Frownies, but really disliked the stiff paper and need to wet it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find in the drugstores -- this was the only place I could find it.</li>
            <li> This tape was too harsh on my skin.</li>
            <li> at least a few hours - ditto</li>
            <li> I put a small amount of tape on it and in the morning my eyebrow is just where it should be.  </li>
            <li> If you have a difficult time getting your bangs to lay flat, fet no more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tape doesn&#x27;t work on all lines because some are in places where it&#x27;s hard to maintain smoothness during the night, like around the mouth, but forehead lines respond well.  </li>
            <li> If you have thin hair this tape is like putting gum in your hair......</li>
            <li> Wish it were not so expensive.</li>
            <li> This product is very difficult to find.</li>

            <li> You&#x27;d never guess it, but this tape removes lines.  I&#x27;ve used it for years for just that purpose and here&#x27;s how it works.  During some stressful times in my life, I developed creases between my eyes from scowling. Since this tape doesn&#x27;t irritate even sensitive skin (which I have), I decided to experiment with it to decrease the lines by ensuring the skin stayed smooth at least during the night. After washing and drying my face before bed, I&#x27;d put several thicknesses of tape over the lines.  In the morning, they were noticeably smoothed. Over time, the lines went away completely.  I was really impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m older I haven&#x27;t been so concerned about a couple of lines that returned over time, but lately I decided to minimize them and had trouble finding the tape so was pleased I still could on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve started using it again and after only a week the lines are noticeably better.  By the time, I go for my reunion, I expect to look much fresher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tape doesn&#x27;t work on all lines because some are in places where it&#x27;s hard to maintain smoothness during the night, like around the mouth, but forehead lines respond well.  When I couldn&#x27;t find the tape, I tried another product called Frownies, but really disliked the stiff paper and need to wet it to &#x27;glue&#x27; it to your skin.  This stuff is comfortable, easy to use and effective.  While its expensive compared to what it cost when it was readily available, it&#x27;s waaaaay cheaper than Botox.</li>
            <li> This is a good product to use when you want to style \\&quot;wet\\&quot; hair instead of using curlers, etc.</li>
            <li> This product works well for men with moustaches who need to use a CPAP machine for breathing at night.  The tape placed over the moustache and onto the face produces a smoother seal than if it is not used.  It also prevents the moustache hair from becoming unruly due to the CPAP face mask sliding around during the night and rumpling the moustache hair.</li>
            <li> Glad to still be able to purchase this!</li>
            <li> It is so expensive and does not stick very well, but it is only available this way.</li>
            <li> yes i would recommend this I have curly hair and this will hold in place while my hair is drying</li>
            <li> Makes a good frownie alternative, but only for the forehead and corners of the mouth.  Placed around the corners of the eyes, it leaves red line marks that last at least a few hours - ditto the bridge of the nose.  For the forehead, though, I much prefer it to frownies.  This tape breathes very nicely, doesn&#x27;t pull out hair, is soft feeling on and is far easier to remove than frownies.  I will stick to the frownies I have on hand, however, for the corners of my eyes and the bridge of my nose.  For me, the forehead area is the main concern - the rest is just preventative, so I am thoroughly sold on the value of keeping some of this stuff around.  :-)</li>
            <li> The shipment was prompt and the packaging was secure. I made this purchase to train the deep wrinkle across my forehead, following the recommendation of other reviewers, and I was not disappointed. I was using Breathe Right nasal strips, but this tape works better and goes for longer so it&#x27;s much cheaper. Highly recommended for my purpose.</li>
            <li> I used to use this tape in the late 60&#x27;s and early 70&#x27;s when I was a hairdresser.  Now I use it for my wayward eyebrows!!  I sleep in it and I don&#x27;t have those old lady sticking out eyebrows in the morning!</li>
            <li> and these do triple duty for everuthing, cellophane, bandate and hair tapes.&lt;br /&gt;Scotch will soon not have the quality dispensers a good reason to get any and all right now.</li>

            <li> Love love love this tape.  I have been looking for this tape.  I have short hair and after washing my hair I tape the hair on the nape  and also a curl at the ears.  Don&#x27;t leave it on too long tho or it will pull  your hair</li>
            <li> I used this product many years ago when my hair was longer. For the past 40 or so years my hair was very short so I didn&#x27;t need the tape. Recently, my hair seems to have gotten a mind of its own and takes off in 15 different directions.  I looked on the internet and was thrilled to find my old friend again.

            <li> Keeps hair in place all night.</li>
            <li> If you have thin hair this tape is like putting gum in your hair......probably works better with thick hair or other uses.  I&#x27;ll stick with velcro curlers.  Was delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Love this tape. Was out in the stores when I was younger. Just don&#x27;t overdue it. It will pull on your hair. Fast Shipping!!!</li>
            <li> I tried using this for the wrinkles on my forehead.  It worked okay. I prefer to purchase Frownies.</li>
            <li> Works great.  For some reason lately I have been sleeping in such a way that one eyebrow is all distorted when I wake up.  I put a small amount of tape on it and in the morning my eyebrow is just where it should be.  Does not pull out hair on removal.</li>
            <li> It holds down curly hair, on the side of your face or bangs, during the night.  It&#x27;s very hard to find in the drugstores -- this was the only place I could find it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years.  I like this product and the convenience of the dispenser. I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> This product is very difficult to find. Thanks for making it available. If you have a difficult time getting your bangs to lay flat, fet no more.</li>
            <li> I use to use this hair tape in the 70&#x27;s.  It is exactly the same wonderful tape that it was then, only much more money.  I still love it, but am not sure I will buy it again, because of the price.  If they find a way to lower the price, I will start back using it all the time.</li>
            <li> This tape was too harsh on my skin. Maybe I will try it again another time or on a different area.</li>
            <li> Used this when I was in high school in the 60&#x27;s. Short hairstyles benefit from this easy to pull off tape. Or use it on your bsngs.</li>
            <li> works great&lt;br /&gt;but be prepared for pulling it loose form your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ouch&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;otherwise cool and easy to use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no more stuck up ends</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Wish it were not so expensive.</li>
