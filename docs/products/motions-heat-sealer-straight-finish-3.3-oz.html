            <li>It also smells very nice.</li>
            <li>Excellent, but needs some more lab work</li>
            <li>This item smells nice and works great.  </li>
            <li>This is also good to do a brazilian blowout with as well.</li>
            <li>It also provides good heat protection and a shiny finish.  </li>
            <li>The best is that it made my hair feel light and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent price point.</li>

            <li>Love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>so that was nice that I could save a day in processing hair as well.</li>
            <li>My hair turned out shiny and nice.</li>
            <li>I have to say that I am very happy with The Motions Straight Finish.</li>
            <li>and I believe the Motions Straight Finish Sealer to be one of the best.  </li>
            <li>What it does is creates a nice barrier on the hair that protects it from the elements, locks in moisture, and helps to keep your hair at it&#x27;s peak health.</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>I can now straighten my own hair and it looks like I have a relaxer.  </li>
            <li>It applies easily, has a pleasant scent, and doesn&#x27;t leave the hair looking like it was dipped in a tub of petroleum jelly.</li>
            <li>I had to use quite a bit of it for it to be effective, so if you have very strong curls</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you will love!</li>
            <li>Motions Straight Finish Sealer leaves a beautiful sheen to hair.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE WAY MY HAIR FELT AFTER STRAIGHTEN IT.1</li>
            <li>It left the hair tamed, flowing, and wonderful!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Motions products have a nice light scent.  </li>
            <li>I also love to use it on my damp hair just before I braid it for the night.</li>
            <li>Overall an excellent product.</li>
            <li>I love this serum.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many products on my hair</li>
            <li>I can imagine a hair stylist being satisfied with the performance of this product.  </li>
            <li>You can count on having more manageable, touchable, and more enjoyable hair when using this product as directed.</li>
            <li>I am a motions girl have used most of the items.</li>
            <li>I have used many of Motions products this year.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s healthy state.</li>
            <li>It works quickly and effectively.  </li>
            <li>This product make Natural hair more managable and great looking.</li>
            <li>But I am fine with that because it makes magic.</li>
            <li>I rated Motions Straight Finish Sealer 4 stars because it is a good product.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that can be used for multiple hair issues and I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, Motions Sealer works fine when used sparsely but uncertain if I will purchase this again when I could buy Jason or Giovanni organic hair care line instead.</li>
            <li>BUT IT WORKS, that is an important thing to note.</li>
            <li>This product works great on coarse, brittle, and frizzy-prone hair types.</li>
            <li>bouncy feeling I usually enjoy after blow drying.</li>
            <li>I like that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like a helmet and swings freely.  </li>
            <li>Motions Sealer has a light scent to it that is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This hair product is actually very effective, especially on African-American hair.</li>
            <li>I have used it before blow drying and flat ironing and it gives me great results.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important to me as I seem to be very sensitive to highly perfumed products and have to stop using them, even if they work great on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall good product and has a light scent .</li>
            <li>Some of the ingredients besides RUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND)</li>
            <li>I generally don&#x27;t use sealers, but this one is very good at providing that necessary silky smooth feel of the hair.</li>
            <li>This was a good product protecting the hair before the damaging heat for the flat iron.  </li>
            <li>My hair drys out super quick.</li>
            <li>I might not be the target market for this particular product, which I think is for coarser, or more ethnic-type hair.</li>
            <li>Motions Straight Finish Sealer is not heavy or greasy, it leaves hair soft and manageble with a beautiful sheen.</li>
            <li>I use this right after the shower, it goes on easily and really smooths out my hair.  </li>
            <li>I find this to be a lot more comfortable than gel as well, which frankly is a bigger benefit for me</li>
            <li>but when I use it just before the blow dryer and the flat iron, it works amazingly well.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of serums that I really love, that spread well, feel elegant to use, and leave my hair nicely soft and smooth, without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>my one Asian daughter and two African daughters, though, this is great.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been using this product (along with the conditioner and cleanser) for the last several weeks and hair is noticeably smoother, smells great with no adverse affects.</li>
            <li>This product allows my hair to be very straight.</li>
            <li>Another good product from Motions, the Straight Finish Sealer is yet another product they offer in which a little bit goes a long, long way, making this product an incredible value.</li>
            <li>If your hair is heavier or more coarse, it will be an invaluable addition to your product collection.</li>
            <li>The product does exactly as promised.</li>
            <li>I love that this sealer not only controls my fly-aways</li>
            <li>It feels light and soft without being too greasy.  </li>
            <li>This is great for African American woman who use heat on their hair it really does protect your hair</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only an OK value.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m the only one who didn&#x27;t completely love this product.</li>
            <li>I first used it on damp hair, before blow drying</li>
            <li>I use this along with the motions conditioner and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>IT REALLY GIVES YOUR HAIR A SOFT LIGHT WEIGHT FEEL...</li>
            <li>Its refreshing to find a product like this Motions Straight Finish Sealer in this 3.3 ounce size that actually does what the product describes it will.</li>
            <li>would have given it 5 stars if it was all natural or mostly comprised of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Drying it and using the hot iron is so much</li>
            <li>First, let me be clear: the Motions product line is NOT for most white folks.</li>
            <li>It made my hair very shiny and got rid of frizz.  </li>
            <li>The Motions Straigh Finish Sealer works very well to seal your hair and protect it from heat damage.  </li>
            <li>but it really does not take a lot to work</li>
            <li>This product straightens your hair and makes it smooth and shiny, but that is only because of all of the silicone&#x27;s in this product.</li>
            <li>Where this product has really helped me is when I use it as a hair serum.</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely straight after using it as directed.  </li>
            <li>My hair does not hold a curl very well.</li>
            <li>the hair still remains straight.</li>
            <li>in addition, I do not use heat products on my hair, which is probably where this serum really shines.</li>
            <li>It definitely wasn&#x27;t the light,</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Works as promised and hair stays straight without frizzing up.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to completely straighten my naturally curly hair successfully myself with a regular tiny flat iron until I found this new product by Motions!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Perfect for dry hair and is great for smoothing down your edges.</li>
            <li>The Motions Straight Finish Sealer is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m white, but my hair is more coarse than most, so I sometimes use a teeny bit of this to tame my hair, but it was really designed for ethnic hair</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I added just a little more of the finisher to her edges.  </li>
            <li>Now I can have a straight style when I want (without visiting the salon) without permanently changing the structure of my natural curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, with the discovery of this new product, I don&#x27;t have to.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels so smooth and soft, as if I had gone to the salon and had spent a lot of money.</li>
            <li>Motions products, in general, work well for me as they make my hair very soft and very fragrant.</li>
            <li>After using the Motions Straight Finish Sealer my hair was not only soft to the touch but also very manageable.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the new product, I added a moisturizing cream to my hair (don&#x27;t know why because I didn&#x27;t need it at all), which immediately reverted my hair back to curly - but the curls were soft and elongated.  </li>
            <li>However, I am usually not impressed greatly with shine serums in general -</li>
            <li>When going to use my normal products, nothing would work, my hair would stay straight for one day and it would be back all over my head.</li>
            <li>: after I first used the new straight style product, I learned that if I want to keep my straight style, I have to be careful what other hair products I use in combination after the straightening process is complete so that my hair doesn&#x27;t revert back to curls so quickly.  </li>
            <li>It feels healthy and there is no residue that&#x27;s hard to wash.</li>
            <li>This leaves my hair so shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my natural hair and also on my hair weave</li>
            <li>It seals the ends ( in a non-crispy way) and still feels workable and soft.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t add extra stuff and just follow the instructions on the package, the hair should stay straight until you wash it.</li>
            <li>My hair was straight and bouncy, like I just left the shop.</li>
            <li>I used the Motions Straight Finish Sealer and the Cleanser and leave in conditioner before flat ironing my 9 year olds hair.  </li>
            <li>Thank you motions for a product for African American Natural Hair!!!!  </li>
            <li>The second time around, I pumped 1/2 a single pump and spread it throughout my long, fine hair and it worked well.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair feel so soft and shiny, i just wish they had larger containers because i use it a lot</li>
            <li>and I definitely would recommend to others that want to heat style natural hair.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to transition to natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now and although it hasn&#x27;t completely eliminated frizz, it has left my hair smoother and silkier.</li>
            <li>This finish sealer is light enough I put a small amount in my hand and rubbed it in her hair and then sectioned off the hair for flat ironing.  </li>
            <li>Unlike the Motions leave-in conditioner, this shine serum is really just your average shine serum.</li>
            <li>Silicones destroy your hair over time, But that is my fault for not looking at the ingredients first.</li>

            <li> It feels light and soft without being too greasy.  </li>
            <li> This is great for African American woman who use heat on their hair it really does protect your hair</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only an OK value.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m the only one who didn&#x27;t completely love this product.</li>
            <li> I first used it on damp hair, before blow drying</li>
            <li> I use this along with the motions conditioner and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> IT REALLY GIVES YOUR HAIR A SOFT LIGHT WEIGHT FEEL...</li>
            <li> Its refreshing to find a product like this Motions Straight Finish Sealer in this 3.3 ounce size that actually does what the product describes it will.</li>
            <li> would have given it 5 stars if it was all natural or mostly comprised of natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Drying it and using the hot iron is so much</li>
            <li> First, let me be clear: the Motions product line is NOT for most white folks.</li>
            <li> It made my hair very shiny and got rid of frizz.  </li>
            <li> The Motions Straigh Finish Sealer works very well to seal your hair and protect it from heat damage.  </li>
            <li> but it really does not take a lot to work</li>
            <li> This product straightens your hair and makes it smooth and shiny, but that is only because of all of the silicone&#x27;s in this product.</li>
            <li> Where this product has really helped me is when I use it as a hair serum.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely straight after using it as directed.  </li>
            <li> My hair does not hold a curl very well.</li>
            <li> the hair still remains straight.</li>
            <li> in addition, I do not use heat products on my hair, which is probably where this serum really shines.</li>
            <li> It definitely wasn&#x27;t the light,</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Works as promised and hair stays straight without frizzing up.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to completely straighten my naturally curly hair successfully myself with a regular tiny flat iron until I found this new product by Motions!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Perfect for dry hair and is great for smoothing down your edges.</li>
            <li> The Motions Straight Finish Sealer is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m white, but my hair is more coarse than most, so I sometimes use a teeny bit of this to tame my hair, but it was really designed for ethnic hair</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I added just a little more of the finisher to her edges.  </li>
            <li> Now I can have a straight style when I want (without visiting the salon) without permanently changing the structure of my natural curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, with the discovery of this new product, I don&#x27;t have to.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels so smooth and soft, as if I had gone to the salon and had spent a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Motions products, in general, work well for me as they make my hair very soft and very fragrant.</li>
            <li> After using the Motions Straight Finish Sealer my hair was not only soft to the touch but also very manageable.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the new product, I added a moisturizing cream to my hair (don&#x27;t know why because I didn&#x27;t need it at all), which immediately reverted my hair back to curly - but the curls were soft and elongated.  </li>
            <li> However, I am usually not impressed greatly with shine serums in general -</li>
            <li> When going to use my normal products, nothing would work, my hair would stay straight for one day and it would be back all over my head.</li>
            <li> : after I first used the new straight style product, I learned that if I want to keep my straight style, I have to be careful what other hair products I use in combination after the straightening process is complete so that my hair doesn&#x27;t revert back to curls so quickly.  </li>
            <li> It feels healthy and there is no residue that&#x27;s hard to wash.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair so shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> I use this on my natural hair and also on my hair weave</li>
            <li> It seals the ends ( in a non-crispy way) and still feels workable and soft.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t add extra stuff and just follow the instructions on the package, the hair should stay straight until you wash it.</li>
            <li> My hair was straight and bouncy, like I just left the shop.</li>
            <li> I used the Motions Straight Finish Sealer and the Cleanser and leave in conditioner before flat ironing my 9 year olds hair.  </li>
            <li> Thank you motions for a product for African American Natural Hair!!!!  </li>
            <li> The second time around, I pumped 1/2 a single pump and spread it throughout my long, fine hair and it worked well.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair feel so soft and shiny, i just wish they had larger containers because i use it a lot</li>
            <li> and I definitely would recommend to others that want to heat style natural hair.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to transition to natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now and although it hasn&#x27;t completely eliminated frizz, it has left my hair smoother and silkier.</li>
            <li> This finish sealer is light enough I put a small amount in my hand and rubbed it in her hair and then sectioned off the hair for flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> Unlike the Motions leave-in conditioner, this shine serum is really just your average shine serum.</li>
            <li> Silicones destroy your hair over time, But that is my fault for not looking at the ingredients first.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, but it works really well.  </li>
            <li> In the past without a relaxer, if I wanted straight hair, I had to pay for a blow out/flat iron at the salon.  </li>
            <li> and this should last you a long time.  </li>
            <li> and I also use it with my flat iron without causing my hair to burn or giving it a burning smell.</li>
            <li> I like this because I can use a flat iron and straighten out my curls when I want.</li>
            <li> After I was done flat ironing the hair</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t last very long and for the price</li>
            <li> I have very dry, coarse hair</li>
            <li> I guess I had relaxers for too long and forgot how thick my hair really was.</li>
            <li> I like the Motions line because although I do not have African American hair, I have really black, curly, frizzy hair that needs definition.</li>
            <li> My hair generally tries to revert within hours of flat ironing.</li>
            <li> I then let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> but I tend to have dry hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this both on wet hair and on dry</li>
            <li> I am a Black Female with relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> The Motions Sealer allows me to use this it on either wet or dry hair</li>
            <li> I applied it to my wet curls and let them air dry.</li>
            <li> Only half the time do I use heat to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it on wet hair ( after using the cleanser and leave in conditioner)</li>
            <li> reference, I have long, dark brown Caucasian hair of medium thickness.</li>
            <li> and it left my hair oily and heavy.</li>
            <li> My hair is short, thick, coarse, curly, frizzy and kinky.  </li>
            <li> Just a tiny bit absorbs into the hair so this small bottle lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to other Caucasian women like myself because it works wonders.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty expensive compared to other products that seem to work just as well that you can get at any retailer.</li>
            <li> dry hair, it helps me to restyle my look and tame down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With my current hairstyle, this just looks messy, so I usually use gel and overwhelm my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle eastern man with dense, thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> This product helps cut down on my frizz.</li>
            <li> I use a few drops through out the day to keep my hair curly and less frizzy.</li>
            <li> found that if I use this on dried and styled hair, it can become a little heavy</li>
            <li> I find them to be on the heavy side, and as someone who can&#x27;t wash her hair every day I end up looking greasy if I use a serum rather than a cream.</li>
            <li> It takes a lot to soften and lame my wild hair</li>
            <li> I then tried using it after I blow dried, to seal the ends.</li>
            <li> My hair ends are awful...if not treated with something, they just wildly frizz out in weird directions.</li>
            <li> They never seem to completely tame the frizz</li>
            <li> I was afraid that it would leave me with that stringy, weighed down look, but it was far from that.</li>
            <li> It seems like a  small sized bottle considering its price</li>
            <li> Just use a small amount to accomplish this.</li>
            <li> Living in florida curly hair usually stays curly .</li>
            <li> With just a small amount applied to towel-dried hair, my hair looks shiny but not greasy and it is helpful against the humidity as well.  </li>
            <li> My curls are thin, so I have to be careful of the oils I use.</li>
            <li> The greasy residue is hard to rinse.  </li>
            <li> It also left my hair greasy, almost dirty looking.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s always annoying to wash out the next day.</li>
            <li> but that got tedious and expensive.</li>
            <li> OIL, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL, HYDROLYZED KERATIN are questionable?</li>
            <li> Additionally, the product does not smell bad.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> WHOOOP WHOOP IT REALLY GIVES YOUR HAIR A SOFT LIGHT WEIGHT FEEL... I LOVE THE WAY MY HAIR FELT AFTER STRAIGHTEN IT.1</li>
            <li> This was a good product protecting the hair before the damaging heat for the flat iron.  It made my hair very shiny and got rid of frizz.  I did not need to add anything after finishing iron hair.  The style would last for 2 days as well so that was nice that I could save a day in processing hair as well.</li>
            <li> This hair product is actually very effective, especially on African-American hair. It left the hair tamed, flowing, and wonderful!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t know what it is made of- probably unicorns. But I am fine with that because it makes magic. My fuzzy snarly hair looks great. I did keratin treatments for a while but that got tedious and expensive. But when I use this I get the same look as my brazilian blowout. It leaves my hair silky shiny and flexible. It also lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a winner.</li>
            <li> The Motions Straigh Finish Sealer works very well to seal your hair and protect it from heat damage.  It seems like a  small sized bottle considering its price but it really does not take a lot to work and this should last you a long time.  Overall it leaves your hair shiny and protects it well.</li>
            <li> Its refreshing to find a product like this Motions Straight Finish Sealer in this 3.3 ounce size that actually does what the product describes it will. Will order again.</li>
            <li> Unlike the Motions leave-in conditioner, this shine serum is really just your average shine serum. However, I am usually not impressed greatly with shine serums in general - I find them to be on the heavy side, and as someone who can&#x27;t wash her hair every day I end up looking greasy if I use a serum rather than a cream. BUT IT WORKS, that is an important thing to note. It&#x27;s not what I personally prefer, but it DOES work. It also smells very nice. If your hair is heavier or more coarse, it will be an invaluable addition to your product collection.</li>
            <li> I use it as a sealer for the blow dryer.  A little bit goes a long way, but it works really well.  Even on non-African American hair.</li>
            <li> This product straightens your hair and makes it smooth and shiny, but that is only because of all of the silicone&#x27;s in this product. Silicones destroy your hair over time, But that is my fault for not looking at the ingredients first.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair so shiny and soft.  All the frizz is gone and it stays gone all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this both on wet hair and on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use this right after the shower, it goes on easily and really smooths out my hair.  Drying it and using the hot iron is so much easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On dry hair, it helps me to restyle my look and tame down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Motions products have a nice light scent.  That&#x27;s important to me as I seem to be very sensitive to highly perfumed products and have to stop using them, even if they work great on my hair.  This item smells nice and works great.  This is a winner.</li>
            <li> This product is meant to be used as a heat styling protector and sealer. I have used it before blow drying and flat ironing and it gives me great results. My hair turned out shiny and nice. My hair generally tries to revert within hours of flat ironing. This product helps somewhat with that issue. Where this product has really helped me is when I use it as a hair serum. I use it on wet hair ( after using the cleanser and leave in conditioner) I then let my hair air dry. This product helps cut down on my frizz. My hair drys out super quick. I use a few drops through out the day to keep my hair curly and less frizzy. I also love to use it on my damp hair just before I braid it for the night. When I take the braids out the next morning my hair is wavy and not frizzy. This product has almost no scent. Overall an excellent product.</li>
            <li> Motions Straight Finish Sealer leaves a beautiful sheen to hair. This product make Natural hair more managable and great looking. Just use a small amount to accomplish this. Motions Straight Finish Sealer is not heavy or greasy, it leaves hair soft and manageble with a beautiful sheen.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. I am a Black Female with relaxed hair. The product does exactly as promised. My hair is extremely straight after using it as directed.  My hair does not hold a curl very well. I can roller set my hair and the curl will be gone before the day is done.  This product allows my hair to be very straight. However, if I try to curl my hair using a tommy iron  the hair still remains straight. I think that simply means that the product is working as advertised.  That is why I gave it a 5.</li>
            <li> The Motions Straight Finish Sealer is very light and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. I love that this sealer not only controls my fly-aways but it also controls fizzy hair and gives my hair the perfect amount of shine without being too oily. The Motions Sealer allows me to use this it on either wet or dry hair and I also use it with my flat iron without causing my hair to burn or giving it a burning smell. I use this on my natural hair and also on my hair weave and this is a great polisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for dry hair and is great for smoothing down your edges. This is a great product that can be used for multiple hair issues and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have to say that I am very happy with The Motions Straight Finish. I like this because I can use a flat iron and straighten out my curls when I want. This is also good to do a brazilian blowout with as well. It holds for awhile in my hair. Living in florida curly hair usually stays curly . But this will make it last a bit longer and that is a plus for me. Overall good product and has a light scent .</li>
            <li> I have very dry, coarse hair and I have tried many products on my hair and I believe the Motions Straight Finish Sealer to be one of the best.  It takes a lot to soften and lame my wild hair and this helps with both.  It feels light and soft without being too greasy.  It also provides good heat protection and a shiny finish.  I can imagine a hair stylist being satisfied with the performance of this product.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of serums that I really love, that spread well, feel elegant to use, and leave my hair nicely soft and smooth, without weighing it down. This just isn&#x27;t one of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have long, dark brown Caucasian hair of medium thickness. I might not be the target market for this particular product, which I think is for coarser, or more ethnic-type hair. in addition, I do not use heat products on my hair, which is probably where this serum really shines.</li>
            <li> After using the Motions Straight Finish Sealer my hair was not only soft to the touch but also very manageable. For anyone who has curly hair this is a great product and one I&#x27;m sure you will love!</li>
            <li> Another good product from Motions, the Straight Finish Sealer is yet another product they offer in which a little bit goes a long, long way, making this product an incredible value. This product works great on coarse, brittle, and frizzy-prone hair types. It applies easily, has a pleasant scent, and doesn&#x27;t leave the hair looking like it was dipped in a tub of petroleum jelly. What it does is creates a nice barrier on the hair that protects it from the elements, locks in moisture, and helps to keep your hair at it&#x27;s peak health. You can count on having more manageable, touchable, and more enjoyable hair when using this product as directed.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and this product makes my hair look great.  With just a small amount applied to towel-dried hair, my hair looks shiny but not greasy and it is helpful against the humidity as well.  Additionally, the product does not smell bad.</li>
            <li> I like the Motions line because although I do not have African American hair, I have really black, curly, frizzy hair that needs definition. I generally don&#x27;t use sealers, but this one is very good at providing that necessary silky smooth feel of the hair. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a woman of color but I tend to have dry hair. I would recommend this to other Caucasian women like myself because it works wonders. Motions products, in general, work well for me as they make my hair very soft and very fragrant. These products have the most beautiful scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that if I use this on dried and styled hair, it can become a little heavy but when I use it just before the blow dryer and the flat iron, it works amazingly well. My hair feels so smooth and soft, as if I had gone to the salon and had spent a lot of money. Just a tiny bit absorbs into the hair so this small bottle lasts a very long time. The best is that it made my hair feel light and bouncy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent price point. Quality product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of frizz reducing serums over the years.  They never seem to completely tame the frizz and it&#x27;s always annoying to wash out the next day. The greasy residue is hard to rinse.  Not the case with this serum. I&#x27;ve been using this for several weeks now and although it hasn&#x27;t completely eliminated frizz, it has left my hair smoother and silkier. It feels healthy and there is no residue that&#x27;s hard to wash.</li>
            <li> I am a motions girl have used most of the items. This is great for African American woman who use heat on their hair it really does protect your hair I am extremely happy</li>
            <li> it makes my hair feel so soft and shiny, i just wish they had larger containers because i use it a lot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle eastern man with dense, thick, curly hair.  If there is even a hint of humidity my hair will twist into itself over and over.  With my current hairstyle, this just looks messy, so I usually use gel and overwhelm my hair straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been great at keeping the hair from curling without the look of a ton of product in my hair.  I find this to be a lot more comfortable than gel as well, which frankly is a bigger benefit for me (hey, I don&#x27;t have to look at my hair, but I do have to feel it!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just spray it on and comb or brush.  It works quickly and effectively.  I had to use quite a bit of it for it to be effective, so if you have very strong curls you should consider that.  The product didn&#x27;t last very long and for the price it&#x27;s only an OK value.  But it works great.</li>
            <li> Thank you motions for a product for African American Natural Hair!!!!  I used the Motions Straight Finish Sealer and the Cleanser and leave in conditioner before flat ironing my 9 year olds hair.  This finish sealer is light enough I put a small amount in my hand and rubbed it in her hair and then sectioned off the hair for flat ironing.  After I was done flat ironing the hair the hair still had a shine to it and I added just a little more of the finisher to her edges.  This is a good product and I definitely would recommend to others that want to heat style natural hair.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m the only one who didn&#x27;t completely love this product. I first used it on damp hair, before blow drying and it left my hair oily and heavy. My curls are thin, so I have to be careful of the oils I use. I then tried using it after I blow dried, to seal the ends. It also left my hair greasy, almost dirty looking. It definitely wasn&#x27;t the light, bouncy feeling I usually enjoy after blow drying. It does however, work on my curls.I applied it to my wet curls and let them air dry. They were well defined and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Excellent, but needs some more lab work</li>
            <li> My hair ends are awful...if not treated with something, they just wildly frizz out in weird directions. I&#x27;ve tried everything....leave in conditioners, serums, texturizers, etc.  Nothing has worked to control them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this is different.  It seals the ends ( in a non-crispy way) and still feels workable and soft.  I like that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like a helmet and swings freely.  In the meantime, the ends style easier and stay in place after I style, with or without using heat.  Only half the time do I use heat to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, it smells heavenly!!!</li>
            <li> First, let me be clear: the Motions product line is NOT for most white folks. I&#x27;m white, but my hair is more coarse than most, so I sometimes use a teeny bit of this to tame my hair, but it was really designed for ethnic hair care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my one Asian daughter and two African daughters, though, this is great. I also use it sometimes for my African son.</li>
            <li> I have used many of Motions products this year. Some were excellent and others missed the mark. This sealer is just in between. Nothing spectacular. I prefer using the same company&#x27;s product so there is no reaction with my hair. I like the cleanser shampoo so I would use the sealer again just to keep the continuity.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I finally decided to transition to natural hair.  I did the big chop about four months ago now. My hair is short, thick, coarse, curly, frizzy and kinky.  I am a combo of textures but I&#x27;ll say I&#x27;m about a type 3C/4A (for the heck of it).  In the past without a relaxer, if I wanted straight hair, I had to pay for a blow out/flat iron at the salon.  I have never been able to completely straighten my naturally curly hair successfully myself with a regular tiny flat iron until I found this new product by Motions!  This stuff really works.  I can now straighten my own hair and it looks like I have a relaxer.  With summertime weather, I was beginning to think that I should go back to chemical straightening.  However, with the discovery of this new product, I don&#x27;t have to.  Now I can have a straight style when I want (without visiting the salon) without permanently changing the structure of my natural curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one note: after I first used the new straight style product, I learned that if I want to keep my straight style, I have to be careful what other hair products I use in combination after the straightening process is complete so that my hair doesn&#x27;t revert back to curls so quickly.  The first time I used the new product, I added a moisturizing cream to my hair (don&#x27;t know why because I didn&#x27;t need it at all), which immediately reverted my hair back to curly - but the curls were soft and elongated.  If you don&#x27;t add extra stuff and just follow the instructions on the package, the hair should stay straight until you wash it.</li>
            <li> I could actually get a come through my hair. I didn&#x27;t try it with the shampoo and conditioner but may in the future. I really like it. It&#x27;s the only thing that tamed this afro.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using this product (along with the conditioner and cleanser) for the last several weeks and hair is noticeably smoother, smells great with no adverse affects. Works as promised and hair stays straight without frizzing up. 4 stars because of the cost. It&#x27;s pretty expensive compared to other products that seem to work just as well that you can get at any retailer.</li>
            <li> I rated Motions Straight Finish Sealer 4 stars because it is a good product. The directions stated to pump 2-4 times but I found that to drown my hair and make it appear greasy. The second time around, I pumped 1/2 a single pump and spread it throughout my long, fine hair and it worked well. Motions Sealer has a light scent to it that is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 5 stars if it was all natural or mostly comprised of natural ingredients. Some of the ingredients besides RUNUS AMYGDALUS DULCIS (SWEET ALMOND) OIL, ARGANIA SPINOSA KERNEL OIL, HYDROLYZED KERATIN are questionable? I often wonder these are and why are they in this hair product? INGREDIENTS: CYCLOPENTASILOXANE, ISOHEXADECANE, DIMETHICONOL, PHENYL TRIMETHICONE, AMODIMETHICONE, , CYCLOHEXASILOXANE, ALPHA-ISOMETHYL IONONE, BUTYLPHENYL METHYLPROPIONAL, CITRONELLOL, HEXYL CINNAMAL, HYDROXYISOHEXYL 3-CYCLOHEXENE CARBOXALDEHYDE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Motions Sealer works fine when used sparsely but uncertain if I will purchase this again when I could buy Jason or Giovanni organic hair care line instead.</li>
            <li> Helps a Lot with Straightening and Defrizzing without drying out the hair. I use this along with the motions conditioner and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Product surprisingly worked amazing. About a year ago, I stopped receiving relaxers for the purpose of trying to get my hair back to it&#x27;s healthy state. I guess I had relaxers for too long and forgot how thick my hair really was. When going to use my normal products, nothing would work, my hair would stay straight for one day and it would be back all over my head. I wanted to continue to keep the harsh chemicals of relaxers out of my hair, but I really missed the relaxer look. This product helped me get it back. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week and it works great! It can also be used as a daily moisturizer. I was afraid that it would leave me with that stringy, weighed down look, but it was far from that. My hair was straight and bouncy, like I just left the shop. I encourage all women to try this sealer!</li>
