            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>Works great for rash and as a barrier.</li>
            <li>A great price isn&#x27;t great if you don&#x27;t get what you paid for.</li>
            <li>Another great use?</li>

            <li>Amazing relief!  </li>
            <li>Great product, good price - would buy again</li>
            <li>The review for the 3/pack said this product works great on eczema, and this gave me hopes to try something doesn&#x27;t cntent steroids but still work good.</li>
            <li>Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It also happens to have the benefit of being really pleasant in the arousing area.</li>
            <li>The process of ordering was easy and the product gives excellent results.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, and creates an excellent moisture barrier for your baby.&lt;br</li>
            <li>For this product, Calmoseptine, I feel that it wasn&#x27;t just good, it was miraculous.  </li>
            <li>Bought for my infant grandson and is a good diaper rash product.</li>
            <li>In the morning you&#x27;ll be good as new.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really happy with how effective it was for a diaper rash that otherwise just would not go away.  </li>
            <li>Calmoseptine Diaper Rash Ointment is a good diaper rash product.</li>
            <li>Serves its purpose well of soothing and healing, a good product.</li>
            <li>That was the good part.  </li>
            <li>Good for cuts, stings, itchy skin.etc</li>
            <li>Guess it might be good for diaper rashes, bug bites, but just not eczema.</li>
            <li>Good product and works well.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>is a good value</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work out so great for that use - though the menthol-feel was nice</li>
            <li>I use it  myself now, but originally it was the absolutely best thing I ever found for diaper rash on my children!!!!</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product</li>
            <li>GREAT FOR YEAST INFECTION,  OF WHICH I HAVE MANY.  </li>
            <li>And the price was good, and the tube is huge, so its a great money</li>
            <li>And, after 36 hours the bed sore looks like a healthy, healing scrape!</li>
            <li>stuff is okay!  </li>
            <li>Works wonderfully on our dog who often gets hot spots.</li>
            <li>Nothing works better!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>No matter how many times we changed his diaper, the ulcers weren&#x27;t going away!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>it is soothes &amp; protects phenomenally!</li>
            <li>and she gave me a Sample of this amazing stuff..</li>
            <li>, it stays chalky on the skin, and so it wasn&#x27;t great for use on my hands (where my eczema primarily surfaces).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also has menthol which cools the skin, perhaps offering some kind of numbing at the area of the rash.  </li>
            <li>item of note, Calmoseptine will not be effective with yeast rashes since they require air exposure and anti fungal medication which needs to be prescribed by your pediatrician.</li>
            <li>This product is good for enhancing the healing of most skin irritations.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the BEST!!!</li>
            <li>diaper rashes be gone thanks for being the best</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used better products for hemorrhoids, but this is good for every day care.</li>
            <li>It is very soothing and the best product on the market.  </li>
            <li>Works on almost any kind of rash or skin irritation.</li>
            <li>I used it for cycling saddle sores, works great to keep the affected area covered and clean.</li>
            <li>Great for diaper rash - clears it right up, scrapes and hemorrhoids!</li>
            <li>but it should be because this works great, best, top, only product I&#x27;ll ever use</li>
            <li>I am impressed not only w/ the amount but great service, the products were here very very quick.</li>
            <li>Excellent skin protectant for sensitive and often exposed skin.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve gotten for him.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best cream I have ever used for babies diaper rash!</li>
            <li>Best thing ever for exercise chafe and what is even better - NO mess or smell!</li>
            <li>The huge plus to this product is the calamine, which I remembered was very good for certain skin problems like ulcers.</li>
            <li>But this worked better than anything else I tried.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Much better that the baby rash products I was using.</li>
            <li>; as being a bit translucent like Vaseline or A &amp; D ointment, however this &amp;#34;ointment&amp;#34; is opaque like many pastes and creams.</li>
            <li>While BHA is regarded as safe by the FDA,  (cough, cough)</li>
            <li>so you keep buying more and more...which is better?</li>
            <li>Love this for diaper rash.  </li>
            <li>I have used many products like this and via prescription</li>
            <li>The relief is instantaneous and most often thorough.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>This is the best I have ever found I have Crohn&#x27;s disease and is the only ointment I have found to work.</li>
            <li>but it wouldn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li>We love this stuff and will always keep it on hand.</li>
            <li>Cleared my son&#x27;s diaper rash in 2 treatments! :)</li>
            <li>Packaging was appropriate.</li>
            <li>I will buy more if needed  because it works</li>
            <li>We have been using this for more than 8 years now..</li>
            <li>I love this product, it helps with on any part of the body.</li>
            <li>This product has so many uses...and has a proven track record.  </li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>He loves this stuff and asked me to get more.</li>
            <li>THIS MORE YEARS</li>
            <li>My son has had many rashes over the years and this cream has worked miracles on all of them.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The stuff is okay...</li>
            <li>put this on 3-4 days top</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;product holds up better than competition</li>
            <li>Best healing ointment for open sores, diaper rash, skin irritation, moisture treatment...</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used it before, just wasn&#x27;t able to find it in store anymore.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li>This ointment is great for really itchy skin, rashes, irritation from hemorrhoids, etc.  </li>
            <li>My favorite diaper rash cream.  </li>
            <li>Probably helpful with babies as well, but I can&#x27;t attest to that :)</li>
            <li>I did eventually use the tube, but again I view this as preventative... if you are beyond that point beware, this may be a bit more than you can handle.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product and brings instant relief!</li>
            <li>so I was very excited when I found it here.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, this cream is GREAT for soothing hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or the butt-burn that comes from low-calcium levels (aka high bile levels in the stool).  </li>
            <li>Sticks to skin best if area it is being put on is completely dry before applying.</li>
            <li>I find that very cool.  </li>
            <li>this cream is the best diaper rash ointment i have ever tried, i have tried it on several different types of rashes &amp; it has worked great</li>
            <li>I was becoming frantic.</li>
            <li>It goes on and comes off easily and yet provides a barrier that lasts.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s much better than going to a store and having to have them order it and make a trip back to get it---and pay MUCH more!!  </li>
            <li>I love the cool tingle.</li>
            <li>My doctor gave me a couple of samples to use for the care of a wound, and I quickly found out that it does so much more.  </li>
            <li>Good diaper rash cream with no harsh ingredients in it!</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know how I would remain comfortable if I did not use this product.  </li>
            <li>I happily ripped open the envelope knowing what its&#x27; contents held.</li>
            <li>attending annually just to get free samples!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the stuff is cheap</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>I never wanted ointment to be an important part of my vocabulary, but it is.  </li>
            <li>but this stuff is far more effective than neosporin or even lotrimin</li>
            <li>works very well!!!</li>
            <li>She looked at his diaper rash and said very calmly \\&quot;Go</li>
            <li>It is not just for babies as it was originally formulated for.</li>
            <li>So even though I didn&#x27;t get to make use of the original idea I had for it, it still ended up saving my butt... in a literal sense.</li>
            <li>Afterwards it bonds to you, so you need to scrub your hand with hot soapy water (liquid soap works better than bar or foam)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keeps her nice and dry and easy to clean since she&#x27;s just a tad chunky and can&#x27;t quite reach there ...  :)</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t clean it after using it .</li>
            <li>Clean skin</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it, my pharmacy has to special order it</li>
            <li>It cleared it right up - within 2 days!</li>
            <li>On time priced right!</li>
            <li>I squeezed the cool tube of miracle bum cream again and again.</li>
            <li>and calmoseptine is the one product that I keep going back to because others are not any good.  </li>
            <li>This is a very soothing ointment, if you&#x27;ve got a problem area, this is the stuff, get some you&#x27;ll feel better.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product and helps to clear up pressure sores quickly.  </li>
            <li>While we tried several different options and discovered this worked best.</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF IS SUPER....</li>
            <li>Even the doctor commented on how well it turned around so quickly after my suggestion of using it.  </li>
            <li>I recieved it quickly and after one application, I noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li>It helps tremendously.</li>
            <li>Not only is this the best product I&#x27;ve used for skin issues, as a wheelchair user, it is the only product I can use with my allergies, it heals so fast, it has a pleasant odor and it works like no other product of this type.</li>
            <li>Very fast ship and smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>The item was exactly how it was described and came very fast!!</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply, has no odor and is appreciated by the patient</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>Everyone needs to have one at home, belongs to the first aid kit!</li>
            <li>This product is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>My son is now 5, but when he was a baby, he had the most sensitive skin I had ever seen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to stain clothing once applied and rubbed in, but do beware of getting the tiniest touch of it on clothing fresh out of the tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But its worth it</li>
            <li>After using it daily for about 10 days, my condition cleared up nicely</li>
            <li>my skin is clear and healthy.</li>
            <li>This product is worth a chance.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>One use, and this stuff went right into the trash.</li>
            <li>I wear diapers so great for diaper rash, I also use it on small cuts and burns, it works on all of this stuff.</li>
            <li>I quickly awoke to that old familiar feeling.</li>
            <li>My daughter has sensitive skin and gets blistering diaper rashes easily and often.</li>
            <li>Because of a issue, I have some problems sleeping at night and this has very much helped me.</li>
            <li>Our son was in the NICU for the first two weeks of his life and</li>
            <li>But at the first sign of irritation I put this on and he never gets diaper rash.</li>
            <li>I love this product, can&#x27;t find locally</li>
            <li>Thankfully my magic potion arrived shortly thereafter.</li>
            <li>My grandson is post transplant and is at a higher risk for developing cancer.</li>
            <li>We get it fast!  </li>
            <li>A family member who had a terminally ill spouse told me that this product was the best and was recommended by hospitals for bed-ridden patients.</li>
            <li>I wish it weren&#x27;t so thick and sticky but it works great.</li>
            <li>Keep ours at home and in first aid kit.</li>
            <li>(at least for me, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work that great)</li>
            <li>, Calmoseptine applied, 24 hours later skin healed or much much better.  </li>
            <li>Not really expensive for the uses it heals.</li>
            <li>This to me is a wonder cream for many different ouchies!</li>
            <li>and she was not wrong.  </li>
            <li>I first used this product as a sample</li>
            <li>but it didnt do the miracle it did the first time...</li>
            <li>so if you have a little one you will want to have this on hand because you won&#x27;t be able to go out and grab it quickly on a whim!</li>
            <li>For adults, children, aliens, and possibly small dogs, this product is by far the most amazing ointment.</li>
            <li>Great for intense rashes that are hard to get rid of</li>
            <li>My grandson is post transplant and is at a higher risk for developing cancer.y Program links it to certain cancers and toxicities.</li>
            <li>When we left the NICU they gave us the little container to take home, but it ran out so quickly, so I bought more, a lot more.</li>
            <li>I put some in a small screw top container for easy discret transport.</li>
            <li>In my case it had pretty much no effect</li>
            <li>You know at that age there is a certain stage of their digestive system wherein their poop is so acidic that it causes a rash onto their skin almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>the 11th edition of the Report on Carcinogens by the National Toxicology Program links it to certain cancers and toxicities.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t relief any symptoms from with intense itching associated with yeast and BV.</li>
            <li>The burning was intense.</li>
            <li>She is incontinent and this product really helps soothe and protect her skin on her bottom.</li>
            <li>This cream works very well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It holds moisture in place or something else as it is very sticky and does not just get wiped away by the rubbing diaper.  </li>
            <li>He also gave us samples, for which I was very grateful.</li>
            <li>It cleans up the infected area very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As has become the norm when ordering from Amazon, the item arrived fast and within its estimated delivery time.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for your product.</li>
            <li>i have been using this product on my bug bites and rashes and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thankfully, it is available at local drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>Very recommended for discomfort or protection.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly to anyone!</li>
            <li>There is no use trying anything else, this stuff really works for rashes.</li>
            <li>As a woman, I can tell you if you use too much that menthol gets into areas that you don&#x27;t want it to get.  </li>
            <li>menthol is very soothing&lt;br /&gt;price</li>
            <li>She had tried numerous products that at best just kept the sore and rashes from getting worse, there was no healing.  </li>
            <li>For our one-month old we found that a pea size amount of this particular cream covered the affected area adequately.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing, I would gaurantee it for chaffing (just apply a small amount at night and</li>
            <li>This is like a magical cream invented by a wizard and bestowed down to the rest of humanity.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very thick cream that provides great coverage to clear up diaper rash.</li>
            <li>and I only wish more health care providers were doing the same because it is-</li>
            <li>and the pain quickly dissipated after minutes of topical application.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Came highly recommended by VNA nurse.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for my patients and friends.</li>
            <li>Irecomment it highly</li>
            <li>Highly recommended by home health nurses.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this to try and use it as a barrier cream to hold in moisture on my extremely dry, patchy eczema.  </li>
            <li>Best product for bad diaper rash.  </li>
            <li>I have squeezed the last sample dry and am looking to purchase more.</li>
            <li>Sharing with family and friends and given to neice for her new baby...</li>
            <li>I give it to new moms at showers and they become believers too.</li>
            <li>I can now live a cool,and tingly life.</li>
            <li>and I tell all my new mom&#x27;s and dad&#x27;s to have this at home-</li>
            <li>We recommend Calmoseptine to any new parents as this product works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li>This product was hard to find in stores but was very easy to find on amazon.  </li>
            <li>My 29 week preemie with very sensitive skin would get diaper rash that looked like burn marks</li>
            <li>I use a wheelchair full time, I can&#x27;t afford skin breakdown, this heals as long as someone gets it on me before I have a full breakage at the skin is red and sores starting stage</li>
            <li>We first tried Calmoseptine in the hospital when she had open sores just from wearing Pampers.</li>
            <li>not sure why...maybe the diaper rash was so much more severe...than the infection on the penis.</li>
            <li>I very highly recommend this product as I am older than dirt and finally found something that does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li>This lotion effectively soothes and heals diaper rashes whereas many other types of emolients fail.  </li>
            <li>If my baby gets a diaper rash, it is clear within the day using this cream.</li>
            <li>I bought the ointment for my elderly mother and it is helping her rash clear up.</li>
            <li>We got a sample of this stuff from our pediatrician because our one-month old had a severe diaper rash.  </li>
            <li>I was just too busy to bother with it.</li>
            <li>We purchased this based on a recommendation from a home health nurse after my husband developed pressure sores.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Despite all recommended, researched, and natural precautions my immune system went out the window</li>
            <li>My daughter has extremly sensitive skin since birth and the doctor suggested we use this cream.  </li>
            <li>but I do use it myself as an adult.</li>
            <li>Complete relief every time I use it.</li>
            <li>Nice, thick cream that protects places in diaper area from further breakdown.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has come in handy for its intended purpose and other odd things like keeping cuts, scratches and minor injuries dry and calm under band aids (or a paper towel with packing tape) in tropical conditions where one is consistently exposed to general sogginess - perpetual humidity, sudden thunderstorms, sweat, watering yourself while watering the garden, etc.  </li>
            <li>but no more pricey than some of the others and consider this: $5 or $6 for one tube of Calmoseptine that will work the first time around or $3 or $4 for a cream that won&#x27;t cure it the first time around</li>
            <li>much better then regular protectant, clears up rash and redness in a few days!</li>
            <li>I finally took him to a new pediatrician after the old one recommended Nystatin</li>
            <li>The product looks more like a thick cream than your standard oily ointment.  </li>
            <li>We have been using this for over a year for major skin problems.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, we are completely satisfied with this product and will not hesitate to recommend it to others, just as it was to us!</li>
            <li>contents are very thick so depending on what I am putting it on I usually wrap a clean bandage on top of the affected area to keep the contents from rubbing away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great as it stopped my rash from becomeing something ugly.</li>
            <li>one thing put only a light and small amout on the baby but...</li>
            <li>It will clear it up before the next diaper change.  </li>
            <li>At 16 months, he breaks our with baby sunblock or baby hand creams - he has such sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a MUST HAVE baby item as all babies will suffer from diaper rash, especially when teething and they have acidic, frequent stool.  </li>
            <li>It works for my dear daughter Emily, who was only 13 months old.</li>
            <li>Calmoseptine has zinc oxide in it, just like Desitin and Balmax, at a little higher level.  </li>
            <li>I did buy a box of individual packets of Calmoseptine from Amazon that are so much easier to pop in my purse with my other perinatal products.</li>
            <li>its messy (gooey, and chalky), while applying if you accidentally get it on something (like your clothing) you need to wipe it off with hot soapy water</li>
            <li>Like a cool lube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is rather thick and stains underwear though, so if you&#x27;re to use this on anything but a baby don&#x27;t use fancy underwear.</li>
            <li>HAVE BEEN USING FOR 4 YEARS FOR EVERYTHING FROM DIAPER RASH FOR GRANDSON TO MINOR SCRAPES AND MAJOR BURNS....</li>

            <li> Works great</li>
            <li> Works great for rash and as a barrier.</li>
            <li> A great price isn&#x27;t great if you don&#x27;t get what you paid for.</li>

            <li> The review for the 3/pack said this product works great on eczema, and this gave me hopes to try something doesn&#x27;t cntent steroids but still work good.</li>
            <li> Pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It also happens to have the benefit of being really pleasant in the arousing area.</li>
            <li> The process of ordering was easy and the product gives excellent results.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, and creates an excellent moisture barrier for your baby.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For this product, Calmoseptine, I feel that it wasn&#x27;t just good, it was miraculous.  </li>
            <li> Bought for my infant grandson and is a good diaper rash product.</li>
            <li> In the morning you&#x27;ll be good as new.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really happy with how effective it was for a diaper rash that otherwise just would not go away.  </li>
            <li> Calmoseptine Diaper Rash Ointment is a good diaper rash product.</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose well of soothing and healing, a good product.</li>
            <li> That was the good part.  </li>
            <li> Good for cuts, stings, itchy skin.etc</li>
            <li> Guess it might be good for diaper rashes, bug bites, but just not eczema.</li>
            <li> Good product and works well.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  </li>
            <li> is a good value</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work out so great for that use - though the menthol-feel was nice</li>
            <li> I use it  myself now, but originally it was the absolutely best thing I ever found for diaper rash on my children!!!!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR YEAST INFECTION,  OF WHICH I HAVE MANY.  </li>
            <li> And the price was good, and the tube is huge, so its a great money</li>
            <li> And, after 36 hours the bed sore looks like a healthy, healing scrape!</li>
            <li> stuff is okay!  </li>
            <li> Works wonderfully on our dog who often gets hot spots.</li>
            <li> Nothing works better!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> No matter how many times we changed his diaper, the ulcers weren&#x27;t going away!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> it is soothes &amp; protects phenomenally!</li>
            <li> and she gave me a Sample of this amazing stuff..</li>
            <li> , it stays chalky on the skin, and so it wasn&#x27;t great for use on my hands (where my eczema primarily surfaces).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also has menthol which cools the skin, perhaps offering some kind of numbing at the area of the rash.  </li>
            <li> item of note, Calmoseptine will not be effective with yeast rashes since they require air exposure and anti fungal medication which needs to be prescribed by your pediatrician.</li>
            <li> This product is good for enhancing the healing of most skin irritations.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the BEST!!!</li>
            <li> diaper rashes be gone thanks for being the best</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used better products for hemorrhoids, but this is good for every day care.</li>
            <li> It is very soothing and the best product on the market.  </li>
            <li> Works on almost any kind of rash or skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I used it for cycling saddle sores, works great to keep the affected area covered and clean.</li>
            <li> Great for diaper rash - clears it right up, scrapes and hemorrhoids!</li>
            <li> but it should be because this works great, best, top, only product I&#x27;ll ever use</li>
            <li> I am impressed not only w/ the amount but great service, the products were here very very quick.</li>
            <li> Excellent skin protectant for sensitive and often exposed skin.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve gotten for him.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best cream I have ever used for babies diaper rash!</li>
            <li> Best thing ever for exercise chafe and what is even better - NO mess or smell!</li>
            <li> The huge plus to this product is the calamine, which I remembered was very good for certain skin problems like ulcers.</li>
            <li> But this worked better than anything else I tried.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Much better that the baby rash products I was using.</li>
            <li> ; as being a bit translucent like Vaseline or A &amp; D ointment, however this &amp;#34;ointment&amp;#34; is opaque like many pastes and creams.</li>
            <li> While BHA is regarded as safe by the FDA,  (cough, cough)</li>
            <li> so you keep buying more and more...which is better?</li>
            <li> Love this for diaper rash.  </li>
            <li> I have used many products like this and via prescription</li>
            <li> The relief is instantaneous and most often thorough.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li> This is the best I have ever found I have Crohn&#x27;s disease and is the only ointment I have found to work.</li>
            <li> but it wouldn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li> We love this stuff and will always keep it on hand.</li>
            <li> Cleared my son&#x27;s diaper rash in 2 treatments! :)</li>
            <li> Packaging was appropriate.</li>
            <li> I will buy more if needed  because it works</li>
            <li> We have been using this for more than 8 years now..</li>
            <li> I love this product, it helps with on any part of the body.</li>
            <li> This product has so many uses...and has a proven track record.  </li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> He loves this stuff and asked me to get more.</li>
            <li> THIS MORE YEARS</li>
            <li> My son has had many rashes over the years and this cream has worked miracles on all of them.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The stuff is okay...</li>
            <li> put this on 3-4 days top</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;product holds up better than competition</li>
            <li> Best healing ointment for open sores, diaper rash, skin irritation, moisture treatment...</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve used it before, just wasn&#x27;t able to find it in store anymore.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
            <li> This ointment is great for really itchy skin, rashes, irritation from hemorrhoids, etc.  </li>
            <li> My favorite diaper rash cream.  </li>
            <li> Probably helpful with babies as well, but I can&#x27;t attest to that :)</li>
            <li> I did eventually use the tube, but again I view this as preventative... if you are beyond that point beware, this may be a bit more than you can handle.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and brings instant relief!</li>
            <li> so I was very excited when I found it here.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this cream is GREAT for soothing hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or the butt-burn that comes from low-calcium levels (aka high bile levels in the stool).  </li>
            <li> Sticks to skin best if area it is being put on is completely dry before applying.</li>
            <li> I find that very cool.  </li>
            <li> this cream is the best diaper rash ointment i have ever tried, i have tried it on several different types of rashes &amp; it has worked great</li>
            <li> I was becoming frantic.</li>
            <li> It goes on and comes off easily and yet provides a barrier that lasts.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s much better than going to a store and having to have them order it and make a trip back to get it---and pay MUCH more!!  </li>
            <li> I love the cool tingle.</li>
            <li> My doctor gave me a couple of samples to use for the care of a wound, and I quickly found out that it does so much more.  </li>
            <li> Good diaper rash cream with no harsh ingredients in it!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how I would remain comfortable if I did not use this product.  </li>
            <li> I happily ripped open the envelope knowing what its&#x27; contents held.</li>
            <li> attending annually just to get free samples!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the stuff is cheap</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> I never wanted ointment to be an important part of my vocabulary, but it is.  </li>
            <li> but this stuff is far more effective than neosporin or even lotrimin</li>
            <li> works very well!!!</li>
            <li> She looked at his diaper rash and said very calmly \\&quot;Go</li>
            <li> It is not just for babies as it was originally formulated for.</li>
            <li> So even though I didn&#x27;t get to make use of the original idea I had for it, it still ended up saving my butt... in a literal sense.</li>
            <li> Afterwards it bonds to you, so you need to scrub your hand with hot soapy water (liquid soap works better than bar or foam)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keeps her nice and dry and easy to clean since she&#x27;s just a tad chunky and can&#x27;t quite reach there ...  :)</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t clean it after using it .</li>
            <li> Clean skin</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find it, my pharmacy has to special order it</li>
            <li> It cleared it right up - within 2 days!</li>
            <li> On time priced right!</li>
            <li> I squeezed the cool tube of miracle bum cream again and again.</li>
            <li> and calmoseptine is the one product that I keep going back to because others are not any good.  </li>
            <li> This is a very soothing ointment, if you&#x27;ve got a problem area, this is the stuff, get some you&#x27;ll feel better.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and helps to clear up pressure sores quickly.  </li>
            <li> While we tried several different options and discovered this worked best.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS SUPER....</li>
            <li> Even the doctor commented on how well it turned around so quickly after my suggestion of using it.  </li>
            <li> I recieved it quickly and after one application, I noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> It helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> Not only is this the best product I&#x27;ve used for skin issues, as a wheelchair user, it is the only product I can use with my allergies, it heals so fast, it has a pleasant odor and it works like no other product of this type.</li>
            <li> Very fast ship and smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly how it was described and came very fast!!</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply, has no odor and is appreciated by the patient</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Everyone needs to have one at home, belongs to the first aid kit!</li>
            <li> This product is nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li> My son is now 5, but when he was a baby, he had the most sensitive skin I had ever seen.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to stain clothing once applied and rubbed in, but do beware of getting the tiniest touch of it on clothing fresh out of the tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But its worth it</li>
            <li> After using it daily for about 10 days, my condition cleared up nicely</li>
            <li> my skin is clear and healthy.</li>
            <li> This product is worth a chance.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> One use, and this stuff went right into the trash.</li>
            <li> I wear diapers so great for diaper rash, I also use it on small cuts and burns, it works on all of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I quickly awoke to that old familiar feeling.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin and gets blistering diaper rashes easily and often.</li>
            <li> Because of a issue, I have some problems sleeping at night and this has very much helped me.</li>
            <li> Our son was in the NICU for the first two weeks of his life and</li>
            <li> But at the first sign of irritation I put this on and he never gets diaper rash.</li>
            <li> I love this product, can&#x27;t find locally</li>
            <li> Thankfully my magic potion arrived shortly thereafter.</li>
            <li> My grandson is post transplant and is at a higher risk for developing cancer.</li>
            <li> We get it fast!  </li>
            <li> A family member who had a terminally ill spouse told me that this product was the best and was recommended by hospitals for bed-ridden patients.</li>
            <li> I wish it weren&#x27;t so thick and sticky but it works great.</li>
            <li> Keep ours at home and in first aid kit.</li>
            <li> (at least for me, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work that great)</li>
            <li> , Calmoseptine applied, 24 hours later skin healed or much much better.  </li>
            <li> Not really expensive for the uses it heals.</li>
            <li> This to me is a wonder cream for many different ouchies!</li>
            <li> and she was not wrong.  </li>
            <li> I first used this product as a sample</li>
            <li> but it didnt do the miracle it did the first time...</li>
            <li> so if you have a little one you will want to have this on hand because you won&#x27;t be able to go out and grab it quickly on a whim!</li>
            <li> For adults, children, aliens, and possibly small dogs, this product is by far the most amazing ointment.</li>
            <li> Great for intense rashes that are hard to get rid of</li>
            <li> My grandson is post transplant and is at a higher risk for developing cancer.y Program links it to certain cancers and toxicities.</li>
            <li> When we left the NICU they gave us the little container to take home, but it ran out so quickly, so I bought more, a lot more.</li>
            <li> I put some in a small screw top container for easy discret transport.</li>
            <li> In my case it had pretty much no effect</li>
            <li> You know at that age there is a certain stage of their digestive system wherein their poop is so acidic that it causes a rash onto their skin almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> the 11th edition of the Report on Carcinogens by the National Toxicology Program links it to certain cancers and toxicities.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t relief any symptoms from with intense itching associated with yeast and BV.</li>
            <li> The burning was intense.</li>
            <li> She is incontinent and this product really helps soothe and protect her skin on her bottom.</li>
            <li> This cream works very well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It holds moisture in place or something else as it is very sticky and does not just get wiped away by the rubbing diaper.  </li>
            <li> He also gave us samples, for which I was very grateful.</li>
            <li> It cleans up the infected area very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As has become the norm when ordering from Amazon, the item arrived fast and within its estimated delivery time.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for your product.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product on my bug bites and rashes and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thankfully, it is available at local drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> Very recommended for discomfort or protection.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly to anyone!</li>
            <li> There is no use trying anything else, this stuff really works for rashes.</li>
            <li> As a woman, I can tell you if you use too much that menthol gets into areas that you don&#x27;t want it to get.  </li>
            <li> menthol is very soothing&lt;br /&gt;price</li>
            <li> She had tried numerous products that at best just kept the sore and rashes from getting worse, there was no healing.  </li>
            <li> For our one-month old we found that a pea size amount of this particular cream covered the affected area adequately.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I would gaurantee it for chaffing (just apply a small amount at night and</li>
            <li> This is like a magical cream invented by a wizard and bestowed down to the rest of humanity.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very thick cream that provides great coverage to clear up diaper rash.</li>
            <li> and I only wish more health care providers were doing the same because it is-</li>
            <li> and the pain quickly dissipated after minutes of topical application.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Came highly recommended by VNA nurse.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for my patients and friends.</li>
            <li> Irecomment it highly</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by home health nurses.  </li>
            <li> I originally bought this to try and use it as a barrier cream to hold in moisture on my extremely dry, patchy eczema.  </li>
            <li> Best product for bad diaper rash.  </li>
            <li> I have squeezed the last sample dry and am looking to purchase more.</li>
            <li> Sharing with family and friends and given to neice for her new baby...</li>
            <li> I give it to new moms at showers and they become believers too.</li>
            <li> I can now live a cool,and tingly life.</li>
            <li> and I tell all my new mom&#x27;s and dad&#x27;s to have this at home-</li>
            <li> We recommend Calmoseptine to any new parents as this product works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product was hard to find in stores but was very easy to find on amazon.  </li>
            <li> My 29 week preemie with very sensitive skin would get diaper rash that looked like burn marks</li>
            <li> I use a wheelchair full time, I can&#x27;t afford skin breakdown, this heals as long as someone gets it on me before I have a full breakage at the skin is red and sores starting stage</li>
            <li> We first tried Calmoseptine in the hospital when she had open sores just from wearing Pampers.</li>
            <li> not sure why...maybe the diaper rash was so much more severe...than the infection on the penis.</li>
            <li> I very highly recommend this product as I am older than dirt and finally found something that does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This lotion effectively soothes and heals diaper rashes whereas many other types of emolients fail.  </li>
            <li> If my baby gets a diaper rash, it is clear within the day using this cream.</li>
            <li> I bought the ointment for my elderly mother and it is helping her rash clear up.</li>
            <li> We got a sample of this stuff from our pediatrician because our one-month old had a severe diaper rash.  </li>
            <li> I was just too busy to bother with it.</li>
            <li> We purchased this based on a recommendation from a home health nurse after my husband developed pressure sores.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Despite all recommended, researched, and natural precautions my immune system went out the window</li>
            <li> My daughter has extremly sensitive skin since birth and the doctor suggested we use this cream.  </li>
            <li> but I do use it myself as an adult.</li>
            <li> Complete relief every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Nice, thick cream that protects places in diaper area from further breakdown.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has come in handy for its intended purpose and other odd things like keeping cuts, scratches and minor injuries dry and calm under band aids (or a paper towel with packing tape) in tropical conditions where one is consistently exposed to general sogginess - perpetual humidity, sudden thunderstorms, sweat, watering yourself while watering the garden, etc.  </li>
            <li> but no more pricey than some of the others and consider this: $5 or $6 for one tube of Calmoseptine that will work the first time around or $3 or $4 for a cream that won&#x27;t cure it the first time around</li>
            <li> much better then regular protectant, clears up rash and redness in a few days!</li>
            <li> I finally took him to a new pediatrician after the old one recommended Nystatin</li>
            <li> The product looks more like a thick cream than your standard oily ointment.  </li>
            <li> We have been using this for over a year for major skin problems.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, we are completely satisfied with this product and will not hesitate to recommend it to others, just as it was to us!</li>
            <li> contents are very thick so depending on what I am putting it on I usually wrap a clean bandage on top of the affected area to keep the contents from rubbing away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great as it stopped my rash from becomeing something ugly.</li>
            <li> one thing put only a light and small amout on the baby but...</li>
            <li> It will clear it up before the next diaper change.  </li>
            <li> At 16 months, he breaks our with baby sunblock or baby hand creams - he has such sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a MUST HAVE baby item as all babies will suffer from diaper rash, especially when teething and they have acidic, frequent stool.  </li>
            <li> It works for my dear daughter Emily, who was only 13 months old.</li>
            <li> Calmoseptine has zinc oxide in it, just like Desitin and Balmax, at a little higher level.  </li>
            <li> I did buy a box of individual packets of Calmoseptine from Amazon that are so much easier to pop in my purse with my other perinatal products.</li>
            <li> its messy (gooey, and chalky), while applying if you accidentally get it on something (like your clothing) you need to wipe it off with hot soapy water</li>
            <li> Like a cool lube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is rather thick and stains underwear though, so if you&#x27;re to use this on anything but a baby don&#x27;t use fancy underwear.</li>
            <li> HAVE BEEN USING FOR 4 YEARS FOR EVERYTHING FROM DIAPER RASH FOR GRANDSON TO MINOR SCRAPES AND MAJOR BURNS....</li>
            <li> My poor son has endured a pretty some pretty rough diaper rash following diarrhea from antibiotics.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t calm down my sever breakouts, can only slightly release some itchings.</li>
            <li> That said I was in need of relief and putting this on some raw skin cause a considerable amount of discomfort  for me... considerable.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, I&#x27;m an adult, and not dependent on other people&#x27;s product choices.</li>
            <li> This stuff really puts the cure on raw, irritated skin.</li>
            <li> A very little really goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got this because I was desperate for a different hemorrhoid ointment, and many of the reviews mentioned they used this for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For totally \\&quot;cured\\&quot;, takes same long days as other treatments need.</li>
            <li> It is a bit hard to get out of the tube and the smell leaves much to be desired.</li>
            <li> It works like magic on the burning and itching that was driving me crazy.  </li>
            <li> It also lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> (if I had a baby, this could be a product we could both use, and I would have an excuse to carry it with me; but that isn&#x27;t the case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ointment is thick and a sort of pink color which can stain undies and clothing so just be aware.  </li>
            <li> The only rash cream that ever worked for my children - went through A&amp;D and every other one.  </li>
            <li> it will dry.</li>
            <li> This product has been a game changer with our first child.  </li>
            <li> I tried several different creams, but this one takes it away quickly, usually within a day or so, and was doctor recommended.</li>
            <li> A very thin application is adequate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Inactive Ingredients: Calamine, Chlorothymol, Glycerin, Lanolin, Phenol, Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda), and Thymol in a suitable ointment base.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Label does NOT list what the base ingredients might be such as Beeswax, Petroleum, Mineral Oil, Shea Butter, water, or any number of other ingredients.</li>
            <li> &quot; menthol was just even more painful against his diaper rash.</li>
            <li> For those who suffer digestive problems which are not cureable and which are not very manageable.</li>
            <li> Definitely a product that has saved me a few times.</li>
            <li> Be careful that you don&#x27;t get it on your clothes and use gloves when applying.</li>
            <li> I ordered two tubes of this, which had the same name as on the tube he showed me, but when it arrived, the paste was thick, white and dryish.</li>
            <li> At last my raw nether regions could be soothed.</li>
            <li> I know the zinc would make this product white as it does in &amp;#34;Desitin, I&#x27;m not sure where the pink color comes from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We first git a free sample of this from our daughters pediatrician when she was a newborn baby with the worst diaper rash you have ever seen.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> IT WAS A REALLY BAD SUPER RED FROM SOME INFECTION....</li>
            <li> It is everything that the other raters say it is....</li>
            <li> You only have to apply a small amount of the product to the area needing treatment.  </li>
            <li> We tried all the other creams (Butt paste, A&amp;D, etc..).     </li>
            <li> Nothing else has ever worked as well as this stuff, and it will always be my go-to for rashes and other skin issues that require healing and a protective barrier.</li>
            <li> Someone suggested using this for my baby when other creams wouldn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> I tried other creams before finding this one; they dont come close to calmoseptine.  </li>
            <li> It does get all over your clothes and can be difficult to wash out, so be aware.</li>
            <li> Nothing that I have tried works this well on poison ivy or other rashes.</li>
            <li> A little gurgle quickly turns into a mad dash to the toilet.</li>
            <li> I received Calmoseptine from my pediatrician&#x27;s office 6 years ago for my daughter&#x27;s diaper rash when she was suffering from loose, harsh stools.</li>
            <li> As at least one reviewer posted, one tube will last forever!  </li>
            <li> It is thick and stays on the skin to prevent further irritation and heals the skin.  </li>
            <li> The sample he gave me was a creamy, pale pink color.</li>
            <li> hand&#x27;s down-</li>
            <li> Package arrived empty!!</li>
            <li> My grandson is quite red and raw around his G-tube, so I started using this thick, pink, paste immediately on him.  </li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t worth sacrificing clothes over--that is expensive!</li>
            <li> His bleeding diaper rash was GONE in less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> The ointment has a slight odor, but nothing too bothersome.</li>
            <li> Slight improvement for 2-3 days, but hit a plateau.</li>
            <li> Tubes of ointment were not completely full.</li>
            <li> Creates a mess.</li>
            <li> Other creams only keep a rash from getting worse once she has it.</li>
            <li> I started taking care of a client that has had a minor but irritating pressure area on his behind for the 8 months prior to my arival and after using Calmseptine, it is gone after only a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> At last I squeezed and applied the pale pink paste to my blazing behind.</li>
            <li> she started to develop little sores.</li>
            <li> Further, it is a very thick ointment and was continually soiling my undergarments.  </li>
            <li> it is very very thick and a very giant tube of product.</li>
            <li> I can also see this being useful for treating burns or bad rashes like from poison ivy.  </li>
            <li> Between the leakage from the tube and the intense itching of the allergic rash in the area surrounding the tube we were desperate.</li>
            <li> For me, there could be a few things that could come up where I would use it.</li>
            <li> I passed the secret on to my sister who has used it on her baby for not only diaper rash, but rash on his face from drool, and even cuts...it heals it all within hours!</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago my husband had a temporary nephrostomy tube placed and he had an allergic reaction to the dressing adhesive.</li>
            <li> It works well to relieve itching , but is rather messy to apply.</li>
            <li> if your situation does not fit the conditions that are listed for the product&#x27;s use,&lt;br /&gt;try</li>
            <li> My doctor gave me samples of this product a few years ago when there was talk of me having to have surgery on my anal sphincter.</li>
            <li> Buy a few</li>
            <li> I had become very ill after being forced to take antibiotics, which I generally refuse to take, after a major emergency dental surgery.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is a little costly to use for each and every diaper change but when your little one is suffering then this is the stuff to have!  </li>
            <li> very mess we can&#x27;t use it .</li>
            <li> IT has saved my baby little butt so many times from nasty rashes...</li>
            <li> I would recommend to everyone who&#x27;s little one has a sore bottom!</li>
            <li> It may be a little messy but that is a very small price to pay.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, I just expect products to work as advertised.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s not carried in stock at the usual places like CVS, Walgreens or</li>
            <li> Please see past reviews.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if anyone else has every used this stuff, but I swear by it.</li>
            <li> When I put it on his diaper rash, he screamed bloody murder for a half hour straight.  </li>
            <li> It coats and is near impossible to wash off or away and will stay on clothing through the wash.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find in stores.....</li>
            <li> Hard to find in the stores, so grateful to find it here</li>
            <li> My 10 month old daughter had a diaper rash that got so bad</li>
            <li> and I believe it helped ameliorate the desperation of a common infection that refused to go away.  </li>
            <li> In the middle of a really bad bout of IBS</li>
            <li> Sadly, as I sat there, i knew something was missing.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t catch dirty diapers within just a few minutes, he broke out with bleeding diaper rash.</li>
            <li> It got worse and continued to bleed.</li>
            <li> though that she just cannot wear Huggies as the rash would be even worse when she wears those.</li>
            <li> The menthol in this seems really unnecessary.</li>
            <li> It burns my poor baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> have issues down there, I have genital vitiligo, the skin swells and breaks sometimes when the lesions/spots spread and it&#x27;s rather painful.</li>
            <li> My firstborn had terrible diaper rash a few times and this thick paste soothed his raw skin.</li>
            <li> I guarantee that you will not be sorry if you buy this.</li>
            <li> Both my younger kids get really bad diaper rash, and this clears it up with just one application!!  </li>
            <li> Has helped me sleep at night during some very irritating skin flares.  </li>
            <li> and he got this nasty rash with bumps and really dry skin...</li>
            <li> My wife required continued bandaging of a surgical wound which was very slow to heal and the tape required to accomplish this caused a painful skin irritation.</li>
            <li> stuff helped me not go entirely crazy with pain and itching.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was desperate for some relief and made my way through almost every diaper cream on the market.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I was so over joyed and the relief, ahhhhhhh!</li>
            <li> If you are a mom with a baby who has a raw bottom, you know how miserable and painful it can be to change baby&#x27;s diaper.</li>
            <li> and she didn&#x27;t have a bad rash since then.</li>
            <li> The bad part was that they promised delivery in 7-10 days.  </li>
            <li> I got this after it was recommended when I was having a bad bout with hemmorhoids.  </li>
            <li> (well, except some painful, burning sensation after application.)</li>
            <li> The ointment works well, but I was disappointed in the amount of the medication in the tube.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Bourdeux buttpaste in a pinch and it is worthless compared to Calmoseptine.</li>
            <li> I just called the company at 800-800-3405 and asked what the base ingredients were, was told if they publicized that info their product would be copied, so I started asking if ingredients I myself naming were in it, and I got a yes to Beeswax, Petroleum, Mineral Oil, a no to water and was told no preservative is used, that one wasn&#x27;t needed and this product does not expire, hence no expiration or use by date on tube.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying to have to order it through the pharmacy or through amazon and to wait a week to get it.  </li>
            <li> It was so bad bleeding ulcers would appear!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> My daughter had terrible diaper rush and we tried almost everything (lansinoh, mustela, butt paste, desitin, A+D).</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s pediatrician recommended this to me when he had horrific diaper rashes as an infant.</li>
            <li> I had a nasty grease burn that I treated with&lt;br /&gt;Calmoseptine</li>
            <li> I was suffering from the worst episode of hemmroids for about a month</li>
            <li> I used this on my 10 mo terrible diaper rash.</li>
            <li> My son had terrible diaper rash.</li>

            <li> This helped my \\&quot;butt-burn\\&quot; that I was experiencing after my J-pouch surgery. Re-apply after every bathroom visit and I am no longer trying to figure out ways to discretely scratch my butt in public. lol!</li>
            <li> Calmoseptine Diaper Rash Ointment protects the skin from the ravages of feces and urine. It is easy to apply, has no odor and is appreciated by the patient</li>
            <li> This stuff really puts the cure on raw, irritated skin. It is cooling without freezing and soothing without being unduly greasy. A very thin application is adequate.</li>
            <li> My daughter had terrible diaper rush and we tried almost everything (lansinoh, mustela, butt paste, desitin, A+D). I got sample of calmoseptine from my doc and then ordered on amazon. It&#x27;s absolutely amazing! Diaper rush has gone immediately!</li>
            <li> This ointment is the best for chafing, bug bites, and all sorts of skin irritations!</li>
            <li> I do not write review often...this product deserves it&#x27;s 5 stars...It is everything that the other raters say it is....I have used this product on and off for about 10 years. One thing to pass on is that I do travel with a tube in my suitcase.  For me, there could be a few things that could come up where I would use it. In our area it is not carried in our stores...They order it for me...</li>
            <li> I have two digestive illnesses.  Don&#x27;t know how I would remain comfortable if I did not use this product.  For those who suffer digestive problems which are not cureable and which are not very manageable. Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Came highly recommended by VNA nurse.  Works great as it stopped my rash from becomeing something ugly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, I just expect products to work as advertised. For this product, Calmoseptine, I feel that it wasn&#x27;t just good, it was miraculous.  My sister had been treating a bed sore and rashes on my ailing mother. She had tried numerous products that at best just kept the sore and rashes from getting worse, there was no healing.  Mom remembered that a year or so ago my cousin mentioned that she was using Calmoseptine for my uncle&#x27;s bedsores.  We bought a tube and applied the ointment to the sore and rashes. After 12 hours there was no redness and the pain of the rashes has gone away. After 24 hours the bed sore that wouldn&#x27;t heal has begun to scab over. And, after 36 hours the bed sore looks like a healthy, healing scrape!</li>
            <li> I used this on my 17 month-old&#x27;s diaper rash. It is a bit hard to get out of the tube and the smell leaves much to be desired. But this worked better than anything else I tried.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful as a diaper cream.  Our son was in the NICU for the first two weeks of his life and the nurses there used it at any sign of diaper rash.  When we left the NICU they gave us the little container to take home, but it ran out so quickly, so I bought more, a lot more.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000GOVYE6 Calmoseptine Ointment to Prevent &amp; Heal Skin Irritations 4 oz]] Excellent skin protectant for sensitive and often exposed skin.</li>
            <li> Sharing with family and friends and given to neice for her new baby...she commented it works beautifully for diaper rash.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best for diaper rash. My 29 week preemie with very sensitive skin would get diaper rash that looked like burn marks and this was the only cream the would work. They used it in the NICU and it is the only thing I trust. At 16 months, he breaks our with baby sunblock or baby hand creams - he has such sensitive skin. But at the first sign of irritation I put this on and he never gets diaper rash. I&#x27;ve used Bourdeux buttpaste in a pinch and it is worthless compared to Calmoseptine. I promise this is the best thing you will ever find for diaper rash, ever. I give it to new moms at showers and they become believers too.</li>
            <li> A doctor referred this to a friend of mine, so I decided to try it.  It is soothing and help relive the symptoms for about a couple of hour.</li>
            <li> I have IBS coupled with occassioal hemorrhoids and this is the only product that not only soothes, it actually lasts!  My doctor gave me a couple of samples to use for the care of a wound, and I quickly found out that it does so much more.  From time to time, I also get an excema rash on my back.  This stuff clears it within a week.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> We got a sample of this stuff from our pediatrician because our one-month old had a severe diaper rash.  You know at that age there is a certain stage of their digestive system wherein their poop is so acidic that it causes a rash onto their skin almost immediately.  Calmoseptine has zinc oxide in it, just like Desitin and Balmax, at a little higher level.  It also has menthol which cools the skin, perhaps offering some kind of numbing at the area of the rash.  This stuff is a little costly to use for each and every diaper change but when your little one is suffering then this is the stuff to have!  For our one-month old we found that a pea size amount of this particular cream covered the affected area adequately.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> The ointment works well, but I was disappointed in the amount of the medication in the tube.  Over one third of the tube was air.  Probably will not reorder it again.[[ASIN:B000GOVYE6 Calmoseptine Ointment to Prevent &amp; Heal Skin Irritations 4 oz]]</li>
            <li> I love this product, can&#x27;t find locally</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t relief any symptoms from with intense itching associated with yeast and BV.</li>
            <li> It had been one of those days...A rather routine day for us crohnies. I quickly awoke to that old familiar feeling. A little gurgle quickly turns into a mad dash to the toilet.Sadly, as I sat there, i knew something was missing. Where is my Calmoseptine? The email said it had been shipped. Had someone hi-jacked my mail box? Had the mailman kept it for himself? The burning was intense. DARN! Out of baby wipes, now what?&lt;br /&gt;  Thankfully my magic potion arrived shortly thereafter. I happily ripped open the envelope knowing what its&#x27; contents held. YES, it&#x27;s here. At last my raw nether regions could be soothed.I gingerly took off the protective plastic wrapper and opened the lid.I squeezed the cool tube of miracle bum cream again and again. BLAST!!I forgot to remove the tamper resistant foil cover under the lid. At last I squeezed and applied the pale pink paste to my blazing behind. AAHH!! Relief! My Peeps at Crohn&#x27;s forum did not exaggerate. This stuff is the nectar of the gods. I can now live a cool,and tingly life.</li>
            <li> Bought for my infant grandson and is a good diaper rash product.</li>
            <li> I received Calmoseptine from my pediatrician&#x27;s office 6 years ago for my daughter&#x27;s diaper rash when she was suffering from loose, harsh stools. If you are a mom with a baby who has a raw bottom, you know how miserable and painful it can be to change baby&#x27;s diaper. This stuff was a LIFE SAVER! I found one store in my area that actually carried the cream (It&#x27;s not carried in stock at the usual places like CVS, Walgreens or Rite Aid)- so if you have a little one you will want to have this on hand because you won&#x27;t be able to go out and grab it quickly on a whim! It&#x27;s a MUST HAVE baby item as all babies will suffer from diaper rash, especially when teething and they have acidic, frequent stool.  Not only am I a mother but I am also a nurse on a Mother/Baby unit and I tell all my new mom&#x27;s and dad&#x27;s to have this at home- and I only wish more health care providers were doing the same because it is- hand&#x27;s down- the best remedy you will find on the market for sore bottoms.  Look no further! This stuff ROCKS!</li>
            <li> Great product, good price - would buy again</li>
            <li> Great for intense rashes that are hard to get rid of</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I would gaurantee it for chaffing (just apply a small amount at night and In the morning you&#x27;ll be good as new.)&lt;br /&gt;this product is also very necessary for physical ailments like bedsores/rashes/itching/etc.&lt;br /&gt;I have patients/clients that use this product for skin problems and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> This ointment is excellent for healing and protection.</li>
            <li> This product has worked out great for my Mom who is in a nursing home.  She is incontinent and this product really helps soothe and protect her skin on her bottom.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product which I have used for years.  I use it  myself now, but originally it was the absolutely best thing I ever found for diaper rash on my children!!!!</li>
            <li> I got a great deal for the money. I thgt I&#x27;d get 1 tube for the price and ended up w/ 2 tubes. I am impressed not only w/ the amount but great service, the products were here very very quick. I will buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Stays where I put it and helps relieve burning caused by constant diarrhea. Much better that the baby rash products I was using.</li>
            <li> The Calmoseptine Ointment arrived yesterday.  It&#x27;s label states &amp;#34;one&amp;#34; of its uses is for &amp;#34;G-tube sites&amp;#34;. My grandson is quite red and raw around his G-tube, so I started using this thick, pink, paste immediately on him.  I&#x27;ve taken pictures knowing &#x27;before and after&#x27; images of the affected area will help me see how well a product performs. Hoping this Calmoseptine Paste lives up to its reputation, I&#x27;ve got my fingers crossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always think of &amp;#34;ointments&amp;#34; as being a bit translucent like Vaseline or A &amp; D ointment, however this &amp;#34;ointment&amp;#34; is opaque like many pastes and creams. I know the zinc would make this product white as it does in &amp;#34;Desitin, I&#x27;m not sure where the pink color comes from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the rear label:&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Active Ingredients: Menthol (0.44%)...... Purpose: External analgesic/Anti-itch&lt;br /&gt;Zinc Oxide: (20.6%).....................................Skin protectant/Anorectal astringent&lt;br /&gt;Inactive Ingredients: Calamine, Chlorothymol, Glycerin, Lanolin, Phenol, Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda), and Thymol in a suitable ointment base.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Label does NOT list what the base ingredients might be such as Beeswax, Petroleum, Mineral Oil, Shea Butter, water, or any number of other ingredients. I just called the company at 800-800-3405 and asked what the base ingredients were, was told if they publicized that info their product would be copied, so I started asking if ingredients I myself naming were in it, and I got a yes to Beeswax, Petroleum, Mineral Oil, a no to water and was told no preservative is used, that one wasn&#x27;t needed and this product does not expire, hence no expiration or use by date on tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the non use of a preservative is a plus. I was using Desitin Maximum Strength but stopped when I found it contained BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole)  a preservative that is added to prevent fat spoilage. While BHA is regarded as safe by the FDA,  (cough, cough) the 11th edition of the Report on Carcinogens by the National Toxicology Program links it to certain cancers and toxicities. My grandson is post transplant and is at a higher risk for developing cancer.y Program links it to certain cancers and toxicities. My grandson is post transplant and is at a higher risk for developing cancer.</li>
            <li> Best product ever for mosquito bites.  Put it on and instantly they stop itching and you never know you have a bite.</li>
            <li> My son is now 5, but when he was a baby, he had the most sensitive skin I had ever seen. If I didn&#x27;t catch dirty diapers within just a few minutes, he broke out with bleeding diaper rash. I watched in tears as he screamed through Nystatin, Aveeno, A&amp;D, Neosporin, and Balmex (or bag balm as some people call it). NOTHING worked. It got worse and continued to bleed. I finally took him to a new pediatrician after the old one recommended Nystatin and it did nothing. She looked at his diaper rash and said very calmly \\&quot;Go to Walgreens and get a tube of Calmoseptine\\&quot;. His bleeding diaper rash was GONE in less than 24 hours. I passed the secret on to my sister who has used it on her baby for not only diaper rash, but rash on his face from drool, and even cuts...it heals it all within hours! I guarantee that you will not be sorry if you buy this. Yes, its pricey...but no more pricey than some of the others and consider this: $5 or $6 for one tube of Calmoseptine that will work the first time around or $3 or $4 for a cream that won&#x27;t cure it the first time around so you keep buying more and more...which is better? Exactly...buy it!!</li>
            <li> Excellent soothing cream!</li>
            <li> This product was hard to find in stores but was very easy to find on amazon.  The process of ordering was easy and the product gives excellent results.</li>
            <li> We have been using this for over a year for major skin problems.  It is wonderful! We keep some all the time.  We like ordering it from Amazon. We get it fast!  That&#x27;s so convenient.  That&#x27;s much better than going to a store and having to have them order it and make a trip back to get it---and pay MUCH more!!  Great product!!</li>
            <li> This cream works very well.  Highly recommend it.  It is not a cure, but is a great barrier.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this product.  It advertised that it would take care of puritis ani, but it did nothing to improve my condition.  Further, it is a very thick ointment and was continually soiling my undergarments.  I could deal with the soiling, but not if it doesn&#x27;t help the condition.  I would suggest thta you spend your money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product. If my baby gets a diaper rash, it is clear within the day using this cream.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders. Try it on burns too!</li>
            <li> Package arrived empty!!</li>
            <li> Love this for diaper rash.  It goes on and comes off easily and yet provides a barrier that lasts.  Really happy with how effective it was for a diaper rash that otherwise just would not go away.  Would definitely purchase again should the need arise.</li>
            <li> A family member who had a terminally ill spouse told me that this product was the best and was recommended by hospitals for bed-ridden patients. He squirted some in a plastic bag for me to try on my grandson who had a severe case of diaper rash. The sample he gave me was a creamy, pale pink color. I ordered two tubes of this, which had the same name as on the tube he showed me, but when it arrived, the paste was thick, white and dryish. Not at ALL like he had shown me, and it also didn&#x27;t seem to work well at all! I don&#x27;t know why it was different than what I thought I was getting, but I am stuck with it and don&#x27;t want to use it for anything. I wish I would have taken time to complain because I bet Amazon would have refunded my money. I was just too busy to bother with it. Shame on me, I guess.</li>
            <li> For adults, children, aliens, and possibly small dogs, this product is by far the most amazing ointment. I have used many products like this and via prescription but none provide the same relief. The relief is instantaneous and most often thorough.</li>
            <li> We purchased this based on a recommendation from a home health nurse after my husband developed pressure sores. While we tried several different options and discovered this worked best. We now keep it on hand.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent product to use before a colonoscopy.</li>
            <li> Best thing ever for exercise chafe and what is even better - NO mess or smell! LOVE IT.  Will always have a tube just on hand.</li>
            <li> This is the best I have ever found I have Crohn&#x27;s disease and is the only ointment I have found to work. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Wow. My 10 month old daughter had a diaper rash that got so bad she started to develop little sores. We kept putting all different kinds of diaper rash creams &amp; baby powder on her &amp; changed her all of the time but it wouldn&#x27;t get better. Then I found a couple of samples of Calmoseptine that her pediatrician had given us months ago. We thought it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try. Boy were we happy we did. It cleared it right up - within 2 days! We love this stuff and will always keep it on hand. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who has a wee one. Or for bug bites/itchy rashes. Cleared my son&#x27;s diaper rash in 2 treatments! :)</li>
            <li> Calmoseptine Diaper Rash Ointment is a good diaper rash product. I bought the ointment for my elderly mother and it is helping her rash clear up. The product looks more like a thick cream than your standard oily ointment.  You only have to apply a small amount of the product to the area needing treatment.  A little goes a long way.  The ointment has a slight odor, but nothing too bothersome. The product is well priced for the amount you receive. My order arrived within a couple of days. Packaging was appropriate. I would buy this ointment again.</li>
            <li> As at least one reviewer posted, one tube will last forever!  I find that very cool.  A very little really goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is okay!  It does have a calming effect and I believe it helped ameliorate the desperation of a common infection that refused to go away.  I had become very ill after being forced to take antibiotics, which I generally refuse to take, after a major emergency dental surgery.  Despite all recommended, researched, and natural precautions my immune system went out the window and I was suddenly privy to a host of infections I hadn&#x27;t had in well over a decade.  Nothing OTC worked and the medical establishment merely insisted on throwing more, stronger antibiotics at me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff helped me not go entirely crazy with pain and itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t seem to stain clothing once applied and rubbed in, but do beware of getting the tiniest touch of it on clothing fresh out of the tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has come in handy for its intended purpose and other odd things like keeping cuts, scratches and minor injuries dry and calm under band aids (or a paper towel with packing tape) in tropical conditions where one is consistently exposed to general sogginess - perpetual humidity, sudden thunderstorms, sweat, watering yourself while watering the garden, etc.  Works for mosquito bites too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the cat&#x27;s itchy butt when she got fleas.  Keeps her nice and dry and easy to clean since she&#x27;s just a tad chunky and can&#x27;t quite reach there ...  :)</li>
            <li> It works for my dear daughter Emily, who was only 13 months old. I will buy more if needed  because it works</li>
            <li> This lotion effectively soothes and heals diaper rashes whereas many other types of emolients fail.  It holds moisture in place or something else as it is very sticky and does not just get wiped away by the rubbing diaper.  So, it stays on to heal.</li>
            <li> shipment arrived on time.. We have been using this for more than 8 years now.. Using this for my dad who was bedridden for prevention of bedsores and diaper rashes.. Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Best stuff you could use for skin irritations</li>
            <li> Nice, thick cream that protects places in diaper area from further breakdown. Pleasant smell. Sticks to skin best if area it is being put on is completely dry before applying.</li>
            <li> Best stuff for stubborn diaper rashes! I wish I knew about it sooner!</li>
            <li> I love this product, it helps with on any part of the body.</li>
            <li> Serves its purpose well of soothing and healing, a good product.</li>
            <li> takes a while to work, but the ointment is very, very good!! Recommended!!</li>
            <li> Excellent!  Works on all types of skin irritations on people.  Goes along way.  Works wonderfully on our dog who often gets hot spots.</li>
            <li> Please see past reviews.  I buy six tubes monthly and think it&#x27;s the best.  Calmoseptiine has been my product of choice for years.  I did buy a box of individual packets of Calmoseptine from Amazon that are so much easier to pop in my purse with my other perinatal products.</li>
            <li> Great for diaper rash - clears it right up, scrapes and hemorrhoids! I wish it weren&#x27;t so thick and sticky but it works great.</li>
            <li> Our baby girl would constantly get diaper rashes. We tried different creams, switching her diapers, let her play with no diaper on, skipped babay wipes, etc.. We though that she just cannot wear Huggies as the rash would be even worse when she wears those. We tried all the other creams (Butt paste, A&amp;D, etc..).     Our pediatrician gave us some samples of this miracle cream and the diaper rash is gone!  We can even put on Huggies rotating with Pampers and she didn&#x27;t have a bad rash since then. It&#x27;s such a relieve to see her skin white again!</li>
            <li> The product came in as ordered.  That was the good part.  The bad part was that they promised delivery in 7-10 days.  It arrived 20 days later.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews but had to on this product. its a best seller and it should be rated #1 on the market. IT has saved my baby little butt so many times from nasty rashes... thank you calmoseptine!</li>
            <li> I tried several different creams, but this one takes it away quickly, usually within a day or so, and was doctor recommended.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the product</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s pediatrician recommended this to me when he had horrific diaper rashes as an infant. He also gave us samples, for which I was very grateful. Calmoseptine worked both as an excellent barrier ointment and also promoted healing of the affected skin. Nothing else has ever worked as well as this stuff, and it will always be my go-to for rashes and other skin issues that require healing and a protective barrier.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and provides great relief. They don&#x27;t sell it in stores anymore. But its worth it</li>
            <li> This product has so many uses...and has a proven track record.  Keep ours at home and in first aid kit. Good for cuts, stings, itchy skin.etc.. Go to product website to see all the uses.  Highly recommend for my patients and friends.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. The item was exactly how it was described and came very fast!! Defiantly would order and recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Love this. I&#x27;ve used it in my healthcare work for years! Miracle cream for itching &amp; burning!</li>
            <li> This is like a magical cream invented by a wizard and bestowed down to the rest of humanity.&lt;br /&gt;I use this on cuts, bites and whatever else. It cleans up the infected area very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;1 tube can last for years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contents are very thick so depending on what I am putting it on I usually wrap a clean bandage on top of the affected area to keep the contents from rubbing away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used it on my grandmothers bed sores and they were cleared up very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I went out on a camping trip and my legs got all bitten up. I covered my legs in this and wrapped it in an Ace bandage and in a couple days you could not even tell I had been eaten alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also relives itching from what I recall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If I were a baby, I&#x27;d howl if someone put this on me. It burns. Fortunately, I&#x27;m an adult, and not dependent on other people&#x27;s product choices. One use, and this stuff went right into the trash.</li>
            <li> Found some of this at discount store and bought it. Husband had poison oak so I gave it for him to try. O my how great it is. Then my grandson had poison oak and the Dr. gave him a bottle that cost $52.00.. This gave him no relief from the itching so I pulled out the calmoseptine. Was a life saver for my grandson as he had the poison from head to waist. He loves this stuff and asked me to get more. I did and will keep it in the medicine cabinet from now on. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream.  My daughter has extremly sensitive skin since birth and the doctor suggested we use this cream.  It works so well.  It is hard to find in stores.....so I was so happy when I found out I could orderit on Amazon.com!!  Yeah!!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000GOVYE6 Calmoseptine Ointment to Prevent &amp; Heal S kin Irritations 4 oz]]     THIS STUFF IS SUPER....HAVE BEEN USING FOR 4 YEARS FOR EVERYTHING FROM DIAPER RASH FOR GRANDSON TO MINOR SCRAPES AND MAJOR BURNS....USED IT UNDER ELTA MELTING MOISTURIZER AFTER LAZER TREATMENT....IT WAS A REALLY BAD SUPER RED FROM SOME INFECTION....HEALS IT IN TWO DAYS..YOU CAN SEE THE REACTION IN A DAY....ALSO FOR ABRASIONS AND ANYTHING ELSE EFFECTING  SKIN IRRITATION.....GREAT STUFF</li>
            <li> Used in hospitals for years-best for road rash and diaper rash.</li>
            <li> This product has been a game changer with our first child.  We recommend Calmoseptine to any new parents as this product works as advertised.  It is easy to apply, and creates an excellent moisture barrier for your baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One item of note, Calmoseptine will not be effective with yeast rashes since they require air exposure and anti fungal medication which needs to be prescribed by your pediatrician.</li>
            <li> The menthol in this seems really unnecessary. It burns my poor baby&#x27;s bottom.</li>
            <li> On time priced right!</li>
            <li> I care for my elderly mom who sometimes gets pressure sores.  This is an amazing product and helps to clear up pressure sores quickly.  We use it once or twice a day.  Always before bed and sometimes in the am when getting dressed.  Nothing works better!</li>
            <li> Someone suggested using this for my baby when other creams wouldn&#x27;t work... this clears up diaper rash in no time!</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin and gets blistering diaper rashes easily and often. Other creams only keep a rash from getting worse once she has it. Calmoseptine is the only cream that I have found that will actually help her heal. We first tried Calmoseptine in the hospital when she had open sores just from wearing Pampers. When we got home we couldn&#x27;t find it in any of the local stores so I was very excited when I found it here.</li>
            <li> I used it for cycling saddle sores, works great to keep the affected area covered and clean. Inexpensive as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent product as advertized</li>
            <li> This product is good for enhancing the healing of most skin irritations. My wife required continued bandaging of a surgical wound which was very slow to heal and the tape required to accomplish this caused a painful skin irritation. This product was recommended by a relative who had a similar experience and so we ordered it, as it was unavailable locally. Within days the irritation was healed and we continued to use this product to prevent farther irritation from developing, which it did. Needless to say, we are completely satisfied with this product and will not hesitate to recommend it to others, just as it was to us! As has become the norm when ordering from Amazon, the item arrived fast and within its estimated delivery time.</li>
            <li> very mess we can&#x27;t use it . you can&#x27;t clean it after using it .</li>
            <li> The review for the 3/pack said this product works great on eczema, and this gave me hopes to try something doesn&#x27;t cntent steroids but still work good. I just bought one tube for testing. The result isn&#x27;t that great as others said. It doesn&#x27;t calm down my sever breakouts, can only slightly release some itchings. For totally \\&quot;cured\\&quot;, takes same long days as other treatments need. Guess it might be good for diaper rashes, bug bites, but just not eczema. (at least for me, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work that great)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t help me with my skin rash/Pruritus Ani. Maybe it&#x27;s my fault thinking that it will. In my case it had pretty much no effect (well, except some painful, burning sensation after application.) But again, it was just a test on my part. I don&#x27;t blame the seller.</li>
            <li> Best cream ever for a baby but ..&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing put only a light and small amout on the baby but...</li>
            <li> Good product and works well.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I swear by it! I don&#x27;t know that I would use it as diaper rash cream on a baby because it is tingly but I do use it myself as an adult. It also has helped my kids when they needed it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product a lot and have been using it on a patient at a Community Care facility..I have been bragging the calmoseptine up to everyone I know..and when I run low, I will be ordering again..Thanks so much for your product.</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR YEAST INFECTION,  OF WHICH I HAVE MANY.  I&#x27;VE USED THIS MORE YEARS THEN I CAN REMEMBER.  CAN&#x27;T DO WITHOUT IT.</li>
            <li> My son has had many rashes over the years and this cream has worked miracles on all of them.  Works great</li>
            <li> I received a package of Calmoseptine samples as I toured the displays at the American Public Health Association annual meeting. I had no idea what Calmoseptine was used for.  A few weeks ago my husband had a temporary nephrostomy tube placed and he had an allergic reaction to the dressing adhesive. Between the leakage from the tube and the intense itching of the allergic rash in the area surrounding the tube we were desperate. The Calmoseptine eased the itching, helped heal the rash and protected the skin from the leakage of the nephrostomy tube. I have squeezed the last sample dry and am looking to purchase more.</li>
            <li> This product truly works miracles. I have been a CNA caregiver for 15 years and calmoseptine is the one product that I keep going back to because others are not any good.  It is thick and stays on the skin to prevent further irritation and heals the skin.  I started taking care of a client that has had a minor but irritating pressure area on his behind for the 8 months prior to my arival and after using Calmseptine, it is gone after only a few weeks.  Even the doctor commented on how well it turned around so quickly after my suggestion of using it.  If you don&#x27;t have it on hand get it!</li>
            <li> i have been using this product on my bug bites and rashes and it works very well. it is very very thick and a very giant tube of product. a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Used this after my jpouch surgery and it was a God send. I tried other creams before finding this one; they dont come close to calmoseptine.  Theres always a tube in my home. Absolutely the BEST!!!</li>
            <li> Works great for rash and as a barrier. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It works well to relieve itching , but is rather messy to apply.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin cream on the market.  It is not just for babies as it was originally formulated for. Any red irratated skin will respond to this cream.  Clean skin, Calmoseptine applied, 24 hours later skin healed or much much better.  This is a barier cream that WORKS.  Babies to Geriatrics this is it.  Skin folds irritations, feeding tubes, rectal issues, mosquito bites are all going to respond to this cream.</li>
            <li> This is a cure-all product!&lt;br /&gt;Most reviews were for Calmoseptine&#x27;s use with bed sores, diaper rash, and the like.&lt;br /&gt;I use this stuff to soothe burns! I had a nasty grease burn that I treated with&lt;br /&gt;Calmoseptine and the pain quickly dissipated after minutes of topical application.&lt;br /&gt;I discovered samples of this product at a public health conference and I almost feel&lt;br /&gt;like attending annually just to get free samples!&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, it is available at local drug stores.&lt;br /&gt;Even if your situation does not fit the conditions that are listed for the product&#x27;s use,&lt;br /&gt;try it anyway and you&#x27;ll be suprised at the results!</li>
            <li> Tubes of ointment were not completely full. A great price isn&#x27;t great if you don&#x27;t get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is like a peppermint pattie! Very recommended for discomfort or protection. You will not regret. I put some in a small screw top container for easy discret transport.</li>
            <li> I used to get samples in the mail and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere locally.  Imagine my joy when I found it on AMAZON!!  Both my younger kids get really bad diaper rash, and this clears it up with just one application!!  I recommend it highly to anyone!</li>
            <li> My doctor gave me samples of this product a few years ago when there was talk of me having to have surgery on my anal sphincter. I was constantly having anal fissures and the medication he was prescribing wasn&#x27;t working like it was supposed to. I used all the samples as it relieved the itching associated with the fissures and provided a barrier for when I was having a bowel movement and prevented burning in the fissures. I absolutely love this stuff. Another great use? Chafing.</li>
            <li> my son cried that this burned</li>
            <li> This product is nothing short of amazing. My firstborn had terrible diaper rash a few times and this thick paste soothed his raw skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very soothing ointment, if you&#x27;ve got a problem area, this is the stuff, get some you&#x27;ll feel better.</li>
            <li> The stuff is okay...it is basically Desitin with Calamine lotion.  Therein lies the problem.  If you get this on your clothes, as they say in Jersey, \\&quot;Fuggedabout it,\\&quot; because it isn&#x27;t coming out.  The company says Clorox 2 will help get it out but it simply doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the stuff is cheap it isn&#x27;t worth sacrificing clothes over--that is expensive!</li>
            <li> this cream is the best diaper rash ointment i have ever tried, i have tried it on several different types of rashes &amp; it has worked great</li>
            <li> There is no use trying anything else, this stuff really works for rashes. It may be a little messy but that is a very small price to pay. I very highly recommend this product as I am older than dirt and finally found something that does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Just what the doctor ordered.  I had problems getting this product locally, so decicided to order it thru the internet.  Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to help my dad was a rash on his bottom because of his incontinence.  This works great!</li>
            <li> I was suffering from the worst episode of hemmroids for about a month I was in severe pain and ended up in the emergency room. All they gave me was stool softners and it still didn&#x27;t relieve the pain. I went to my doctor and told her to PLEASE help me and she gave me a Sample of this amazing stuff.. Needless to say I was so over joyed and the relief, ahhhhhhh! I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Instantly provides comfort from chaffing, itching, feels like it starts healing immediately! I wish everyone knew of this wonderful cream!</li>
            <li> This ointment is the only thing that works on my toddler&#x27;s diaper rash.  It&#x27;s annoying to have to order it through the pharmacy or through amazon and to wait a week to get it.  So now we keep it on hand at all times.</li>
            <li> The only rash cream that ever worked for my children - went through A&amp;D and every other one.  This promotes healing and protects the skin.</li>
            <li> I got this after it was recommended when I was having a bad bout with hemmorhoids.  It works like magic on the burning and itching that was driving me crazy.  It has a bit of menthol in it so there&#x27;s an immediate cooling sensation.  It only takes a tiny bit though.  As a woman, I can tell you if you use too much that menthol gets into areas that you don&#x27;t want it to get.  The cooling sensation is wonderful though when itching is driving you insane and the effect lasts for hours. The ointment is thick and a sort of pink color which can stain undies and clothing so just be aware.  After using it daily for about 10 days, my condition cleared up nicely but I will definitely keep this on hand for any future issues.  I can also see this being useful for treating burns or bad rashes like from poison ivy.  You&#x27;d just have to cover the area to keep it from smearing onto clothing, etc.  I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;d never heard of this before but it is truly a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> Not only is this the best product I&#x27;ve used for skin issues, as a wheelchair user, it is the only product I can use with my allergies, it heals so fast, it has a pleasant odor and it works like no other product of this type. I wish that it were easier to buy. I can&#x27;t find it, my pharmacy has to special order it and I have to pay for it out of pocket not covered by insurance but it should be because this works great, best, top, only product I&#x27;ll ever use and so I pay a lot of money to have plenty at all times. I use a wheelchair full time, I can&#x27;t afford skin breakdown, this heals as long as someone gets it on me before I have a full breakage at the skin is red and sores starting stage put this on 3-4 days top my skin is clear and healthy. I wear diapers so great for diaper rash, I also use it on small cuts and burns, it works on all of this stuff. Awesome product. Wish I could find manufacturing company to find out where to get it bulk and cheaper.</li>
            <li> Too think. Can not wash it off with water. Creates a mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a problem with irritation for 30 years.  Never mind where.  This stuff is the only product I ever tried that actually works.  Complete relief every time I use it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Goes on well and keeps the moisture away.  It also lasts for a long time. Irecomment it highly</li>
            <li> I used this on my 10 mo terrible diaper rash. It worked wonders!! I would recommend to everyone who&#x27;s little one has a sore bottom!</li>
            <li> After tring multiple products for my heat rash, I ordered this.  I recieved it quickly and after one application, I noticed a difference.  It&#x27;s been about three days and my heat rash has cleared. This product is worth a chance.</li>
            <li> protects fragile skin from friction and burning&lt;br /&gt;the menthol is very soothing&lt;br /&gt;price is a good value&lt;br /&gt;product holds up better than competition</li>
            <li> Best healing ointment for open sores, diaper rash, skin irritation, moisture treatment... Everyone needs to have one at home, belongs to the first aid kit!</li>
            <li> It works really great! We&#x27;ve used it before, just wasn&#x27;t able to find it in store anymore. You&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this to try and use it as a barrier cream to hold in moisture on my extremely dry, patchy eczema.  It didn&#x27;t work out so great for that use - though the menthol-feel was nice, it stays chalky on the skin, and so it wasn&#x27;t great for use on my hands (where my eczema primarily surfaces).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this cream is GREAT for soothing hemorrhoids, anal fissures, or the butt-burn that comes from low-calcium levels (aka high bile levels in the stool).  I imagine it&#x27;d also be terrific for soothing bums irritated by IBS, Krohns, etc.  So even though I didn&#x27;t get to make use of the original idea I had for it, it still ended up saving my butt... in a literal sense.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF IT WORKS miracles and i use it on my son feeding tube as well diaper rashes be gone thanks for being the best</li>
            <li> This ointment is great for really itchy skin, rashes, irritation from hemorrhoids, etc.  Has helped me sleep at night during some very irritating skin flares.  It does get all over your clothes and can be difficult to wash out, so be aware.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for those who may have Ulcerative Colitis or Chrons Disease. Definitely a product that has saved me a few times.</li>
            <li> My daughter had problems with diaper rash and my wife and I were recommended this product. It worked wonderfully and healed my daughters rash quicker than anything else</li>
            <li> My son had terrible diaper rash. It was so bad bleeding ulcers would appear! I couldn&#x27;t bear hearing him whimper as we cleaned him up, anymore so I went all out. I tried both the blue and purple Desitin. No improvement. I&#x27;ve tried Balmex. Slight improvement for 2-3 days, but hit a plateau. I&#x27;ve tried Bag Balm. Nothing. I&#x27;ve tried organic stuff, and still nothing. I was becoming frantic. No matter how many times we changed his diaper, the ulcers weren&#x27;t going away! Oh, but this was a God send. The huge plus to this product is the calamine, which I remembered was very good for certain skin problems like ulcers. I bought the product, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be trying anything else anymore. This is by far the best product I&#x27;ve gotten for him. I can&#x27;t express how grateful I am to this product for helping him. He actually enjoys diaper changes now! How about that! This is definitely a great product!</li>
            <li> Not sure if anyone else has every used this stuff, but I swear by it. I have itchy rashes at times, rub this on and by the next day, gone rash! I have used it on burns, which amazed me in the healing powers of this product. My Mother  had told me about it and let me try some she had. Well, I immediately went on Amazon and found the product. Not really expensive for the uses it heals. This to me is a wonder cream for many different ouchies!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this stuff. Because of a issue, I have some problems sleeping at night and this has very much helped me. I love the cool tingle. Very fast ship and smooth transaction. I will continue to buy this next time I need it.</li>
            <li> Dr recommended and work like a charm.</li>
            <li> Good diaper rash cream with no harsh ingredients in it!</li>
            <li> Cures just about everything. Don&#x27;t know why but this stuff is far more effective than neosporin or even lotrimin</li>
            <li> I got this because I was desperate for a different hemorrhoid ointment, and many of the reviews mentioned they used this for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works. And the price was good, and the tube is huge, so its a great money value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, its messy (gooey, and chalky), while applying if you accidentally get it on something (like your clothing) you need to wipe it off with hot soapy water ASAP or it will dry. Afterwards it bonds to you, so you need to scrub your hand with hot soapy water (liquid soap works better than bar or foam)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The messiness, and the giant tube make it so it&#x27;s not a hemorrhoid product I can take along with me (if I had a baby, this could be a product we could both use, and I would have an excuse to carry it with me; but that isn&#x27;t the case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used better products for hemorrhoids, but this is good for every day care.</li>
            <li> I apologize in advance for the graphic details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have issues down there, I have genital vitiligo, the skin swells and breaks sometimes when the lesions/spots spread and it&#x27;s rather painful. My mother had brought this cream home from working at the hospital. It helps tremendously. It also happens to have the benefit of being really pleasant in the arousing area. Like a cool lube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is rather thick and stains underwear though, so if you&#x27;re to use this on anything but a baby don&#x27;t use fancy underwear.</li>
            <li> We first git a free sample of this from our daughters pediatrician when she was a newborn baby with the worst diaper rash you have ever seen.  Ever since we tried it with her we will never do without it.  It&#x27;s supposed to be used for bed sores but it works great on baby too.  It&#x27;s got calamine and menthol in it so it soothes and cools.  Fabulous product.  Sorry more people don&#x27;t know about it.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best cream I have ever used for babies diaper rash! Stays on well and cures it quicker than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried!  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> works very well!!! much better then regular protectant, clears up rash and redness in a few days!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended by home health nurses.  Works well, but does stain items of clothing.</li>
            <li> My favorite diaper rash cream.  My pediatrician said this was the best and she was not wrong.  Very thick cream that provides great coverage to clear up diaper rash.</li>
            <li> I never wanted ointment to be an important part of my vocabulary, but it is.  This product was recommended to me by my proctologist (never wanted one of those either), to help out in the case of chafing/rashes.  Works great, solves discomfort almost immediately with a protective effect.  A 4 ounce tube will last for a year or two.  Probably helpful with babies as well, but I can&#x27;t attest to that :)</li>
            <li> In the middle of a really bad bout of IBS I was desperate for some relief and made my way through almost every diaper cream on the market.  This one will stay with you... even after you want it to leave!  It coats and is near impossible to wash off or away and will stay on clothing through the wash.  If you need a preventive coating this will do wonders.  That said I was in need of relief and putting this on some raw skin cause a considerable amount of discomfort  for me... considerable.  I did eventually use the tube, but again I view this as preventative... if you are beyond that point beware, this may be a bit more than you can handle.</li>
            <li> Best product for bad diaper rash.  It will clear it up before the next diaper change.  Hard to find in the stores, so grateful to find it here</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t beat CALMOSEPTINE for sore &amp;#34;Tush&amp;#34; or Hemorrhoids.  It is very soothing and the best product on the market.  Buy a few so you have them on hand.  It is about 1/3 what it cost at Walgreens!</li>
            <li> My poor son has endured a pretty some pretty rough diaper rash following diarrhea from antibiotics.  I was told this is the best stuff out there so I ordered it overnight.  When I put it on his diaper rash, he screamed bloody murder for a half hour straight.  I tried it again the next day with the same result.  I suspect the \\&quot;soothing, tingling\\&quot; menthol was just even more painful against his diaper rash.</li>
            <li> I first used this product as a sample and it worked miracles when my son had an infection on his penis because he is uncircumsized. Then I had my baby and he got this nasty rash with bumps and really dry skin...i tried everything under the sun to cure this until i remember this cream...it has been great and helped him heal but it didnt do the miracle it did the first time...not sure why...maybe the diaper rash was so much more severe...than the infection on the penis. However, i would recoment and buy again.</li>
            <li> I have used this since surgery and it does the trick. Surgeon recommended. Be careful that you don&#x27;t get it on your clothes and use gloves when applying.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product and brings instant relief! Amazing relief!  Well worth the cost. Stops burning and pain immediately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on both my children as infants/toddlers (ages 6&amp;1) &amp; nothing compares! it is soothes &amp; protects phenomenally!</li>
            <li> For adults as well as babies. Works on almost any kind of rash or skin irritation. I wouldn&#x27;t be without a tube in my medicine cabinet. Nothing that I have tried works this well on poison ivy or other rashes. I&#x27;d give it a 10, if that was a choice.</li>
    </ol>
