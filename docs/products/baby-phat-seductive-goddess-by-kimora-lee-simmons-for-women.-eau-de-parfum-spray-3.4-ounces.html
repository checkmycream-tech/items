            <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>All guys I&#x27;ve known love this even those who don&#x27;t like perfume.</li>
            <li>I love the way this perfume smells.</li>
            <li>Love it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased to have found it anywhere.  </li>
            <li>I find a product I love</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>This has always been an outstanding product.  </li>
            <li>this fragrance is strong and spicy like cologne</li>
            <li>So unique thinks its the leather.</li>
            <li>I am attracted to things that are different/unique and when I first wiffed this perfume I immediately fell in love.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite scent!</li>
            <li>but it also has a sweet smell so it is indeed still feminine.</li>
            <li>and it does have a nice deep but light scent after it dries on your skin</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sexy and bold, intriguing and mysterious.  </li>
            <li>, the smell will still linger and easily rubs off onto my other clothes which I actually love.</li>
            <li>The perfume lasts long, and is very strong.</li>
            <li>this \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; smells exactly like mens cologne.</li>
            <li>At first I was concerned that the product had been diluted;however,</li>
            <li>I actually had someone come up to me and tell me that they didn&#x27;t know what I was wearing but it smells Fantabulous. :)</li>
            <li>bergamot, citrus, black rose, purple violet, leather, vanilla, labdanum and patchouli</li>
            <li>So I ordered a bottle for my self and was so excited to get it - Now that I have it I am so dissapointed that the smell dose not last at all and can&#x27;t even return it as it is liqued and non returnable.</li>
            <li>It is strong and bold but not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend anyone to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this but have only smelled the pink one which is more citrus.</li>
            <li>Also, the 3.4 ounce bottle lasts a long time because this perfume is so strong you only need one spray</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sultry, yet classy.</li>
            <li>Men seem drawn to it because it isn&#x27;t a headache inducing bright floral scent (like many perfumes), but rather a complex fragrance that&#x27;s hard to pin down.</li>
            <li>I am a 26 year old female btw.</li>
            <li>Seductive Goddess has some similarities to Prada Intense, although PI is a slightly \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; scent.</li>

            <li> Baby Phat nailed a sensual-musky scent that is great for night time......ANY Night!  Wear it all the time....At night-Of Course!</li>
            <li> My mom bought me this perfume for my Birthday, I&#x27;ve been wearing it everyday since. I get a LOT of compliments from wearing it. The perfume lasts long, and is very strong. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance.  It is long lasting and lingering.  It is strong and bold but not overwhelming.  Perfect sexy wear.</li>
            <li> this \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; smells exactly like mens cologne. i wanted to throw it on the sidewalk. the only thing im going to use it for is to make my curtains have a scent! disgusting i dont know what kimora was thinking. these stupid mens smelling \\&quot;perfumes\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I had smelled this perfume on a co worker and loved it-So I ordered a bottle for my self and was so excited to get it - Now that I have it I am so dissapointed that the smell dose not last at all and can&#x27;t even return it as it is liqued and non returnable.I won&#x27;t order perfume from Amazon agine and will use a reliable perfumary instead....</li>
            <li> This is not in stores anymore. All guys I&#x27;ve known love this even those who don&#x27;t like perfume. So unique thinks its the leather. But not manly just spicy and woody no fruit or flowers so sick of all the cotton candy perfumes. 10 stars!</li>
            <li> I bought this but have only smelled the pink one which is more citrus. This is heavenly with a hint of vanilla and spices. I get compliments all of the time.</li>
            <li> I love the way this perfume smells. I finally ran out of the bottles I had in stock and found it on here. People compliment me all the time.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents! It&#x27;s sultry, yet classy. Love it &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> At first I was concerned that the product had been diluted;however, considering I can no longer find the product in stores I&#x27;m pleased to have found it anywhere.  Everytime I find a product I love they discontinue it after a while like this one and Victoria Secrets Country Apple lotion.</li>

            <li> I love this perfume. I actually had someone come up to me and tell me that they didn&#x27;t know what I was wearing but it smells Fantabulous. :)</li>
            <li> This has always been an outstanding product.  I would highly recommend anyone to purchase it.  Never had a problem with receiving the product when having it shipped to me either.</li>
            <li> Ma blonde est très satisfaite</li>
            <li> Great fragrance:) I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
            <li> I am attracted to things that are different/unique and when I first wiffed this perfume I immediately fell in love. I don&#x27;t like fruity/candy smells and this fragrance is strong and spicy like cologne but it also has a sweet smell so it is indeed still feminine. I wore this perfume everyday for about three years and I refused to wear anything else and I got non stop compliments whenever I wore it. Will soon be ordering again. Also, the 3.4 ounce bottle lasts a long time because this perfume is so strong you only need one spray and it does not fade during the day and even when I don&#x27;t spray it on my clothes that day, the smell will still linger and easily rubs off onto my other clothes which I actually love. I am rarely impressed and this one nailed it. I am a 26 year old female btw.</li>
            <li> the boyfriend loves this scent on me, makes him wanna kiss my neck lol and it does have a nice deep but light scent after it dries on your skin</li>
