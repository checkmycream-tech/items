            <li>The tongue foam didn&#x27;t really do that much but the brush is great!</li>
            <li>I do not feel this is effective, it seems to just lightly brush my tongue rather than clean away the gunk like the BreathRX scraper does.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend using this and a tongue scraper in addition to brushing and mouth wash.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>I found it for free when you pay shipping (like 4 bucks) on an ad on youtube</li>

            <li>I feel super clean after using it.. better than using mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen any significant difference.  </li>
            <li>Brushing would help but this tongue cleaner and foam leave your mouth feeling fresh and thoroughly clean.</li>
            <li>I feel that it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I will be back for more.</li>
            <li>I like the tongue cleaners that actually crape the most as I think they remove a better amount of the deposits on your tongue.</li>
            <li>The tongue cleaner really gets all the \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; off your tongue much better than a normal toothbrush  and the foam is really minty and leves your mouth feeling super clean!</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fantastic service</li>
            <li>I wanted this product because I felt that it was useful.</li>
            <li>but I got braces recently and have become kind of OCD about dental hygiene.</li>
            <li>Orabrush Tongue Cleaner with Tongue Foam works really well at making your mouth feel clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It really works to clean everything off the tongue.  </li>
            <li>The plastic bristles really scrape your tongue well, and I&#x27;m in love with the 100% natural tongue foam.</li>
            <li>I love the freshness it leaves in my mouth after using it and all that bacteria and extra gunk</li>
            <li>and i dont see much difference from brushing my tongue with my oral-b electric brush.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care too much for the foam</li>
            <li>The foam really has no purpose for me.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the breathrx tongue scraper.</li>
            <li>I would ABSOLUTELY repurchase this.</li>
            <li>I like this product it does a fair job of cleaning my tongue, but I use it as my secondary cleaner.</li>
            <li>It really does clean my tongue, of course if used properly.</li>
            <li>Since I started using this so many people have commented on how much more white my teeth look lately.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it..</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I really recommend the Orabrush to everyone it really is well worth the money spent .</li>
            <li>Similar to brushing with baking soda or rinsing with peroxide but without the residue that baking soda leaves or the funny taste.</li>
            <li>I love this product it really gets a dirty mouth clean .</li>
            <li>The bristles on this seem too soft, softer than a toothbrush to scrape away anything...</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying these for my whole family .</li>
            <li>It works pretty well without the foam, so if I felt it necessary to add something I would definitely just use toothpaste.</li>

            <li> It must have something to do with the nasty bacertia that was sitting on my tongue.</li>

            <li> I just got mine today and instantly am a fan. Bad news first - I&#x27;m not a fan of the tongue foam. I&#x27;m still getting over my gag reflex while using the Orabrush, so adding foam into it just makes me feel like I&#x27;m gonna vomit for some reason. It works pretty well without the foam, so if I felt it necessary to add something I would definitely just use toothpaste. Also the foam leaked in shipment which was kinda sticky and gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I love the Orabrush itself. I&#x27;ve had tongue scrapers before and this one is easier and very effective. I feel super clean after using it.. better than using mouthwash. I would highly recommend it.. I found it for free when you pay shipping (like 4 bucks) on an ad on youtube so I&#x27;ll definitely do that next time cos the price is a little steep for what it is but hopefully it doesn&#x27;t need replacing often.</li>
            <li> The more I Use it the cleaner my tongue gets.&lt;br /&gt; I am happy with the product. Will purchase more cleaner.</li>
            <li> ive been using it for a few weeks and i dont see much difference from brushing my tongue with my oral-b electric brush.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this item. It works really well and leaves a wonderful taste in your mouth. :) I&#x27;ll be buying one for my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> Orabrush Tongue Cleaner with Tongue Foam works really well at making your mouth feel clean and fresh. I was skeptical about this purchase but I really love it!! I&#x27;m having issues with acid reflux which can often leave a horrible taste in my mouth. Brushing would help but this tongue cleaner and foam leave your mouth feeling fresh and thoroughly clean. Similar to brushing with baking soda or rinsing with peroxide but without the residue that baking soda leaves or the funny taste. I would recommend this to anyone who suffers with dry mouth, acid reflux, or who takes meds that leave a metallic taste in your mouth. Foam doesn&#x27;t have an overpowering flavor so it made the experience really nice. I will repurchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered this.  This is an additional tool to have when it comes to oral hygiene.  Definitely will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I wanted this product because I felt that it was useful. I don&#x27;t care too much for the foam but I love the oral brush. It really does clean my tongue, of course if used properly. The foam really has no purpose for me. I feel that it absorbs quickly. Maybe its suppose to do that but me personally I love a product that I can feel that&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I love this tongue cleaner and was amazed at how well it worked. Thanks for the fantastic service and I&#x27;m sure I will be back for more.</li>
            <li> OK, I think everyone needs one of these in their bathroom.  It feel really nice on the tongue and the foam does not have a awful taste.  It really works to clean everything off the tongue.  I am glad I tried this, the brush is so much better than a scraper.  Great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for everybody! Excellent produts, both. I had alread the Orabrush tongu but I bought another one.The foam is nice because doesn&#x27;t irritate your mouth.</li>
            <li> I like this product it does a fair job of cleaning my tongue, but I use it as my secondary cleaner. I like the tongue cleaners that actually crape the most as I think they remove a better amount of the deposits on your tongue. This with the foam and brush is a nice follow up to really freshen your breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have problems with bad breath I would strongly recommend using this and a tongue scraper in addition to brushing and mouth wash. After a couple days of use you will notice a world of diffence.</li>
            <li> I love this tongue brush. My breath has never been fresher and my tongue is actually pink instead of having white crud on it. Since I started using this so many people have commented on how much more white my teeth look lately. It must have something to do with the nasty bacertia that was sitting on my tongue. I&#x27;ll never be without this!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product. It definitely works. The tongue foam didn&#x27;t really do that much but the brush is great! Give it a try.</li>
            <li> Your toothbrush can accomplish the same result.  All you need to do is get your teeth cleaned twice a year.</li>
            <li> I love my orabrush. Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad breath or anything like that but I got braces recently and have become kind of OCD about dental hygiene. The tongue cleaner really gets all the \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; off your tongue much better than a normal toothbrush  and the foam is really minty and leves your mouth feeling super clean! I use this before bed and wake up with ZERO bad morning breath :)</li>
            <li> I had the product for about two weeks.  I haven&#x27;t seen any significant difference.  I will continue to use it and hope for the best.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the breathrx tongue scraper. The bristles on this seem too soft, softer than a toothbrush to scrape away anything...so then why not just use a toothbrush? I do not feel this is effective, it seems to just lightly brush my tongue rather than clean away the gunk like the BreathRX scraper does.</li>
            <li> This product couldn&#x27;t have been made better. I love everything about it. The plastic bristles really scrape your tongue well, and I&#x27;m in love with the 100% natural tongue foam. I would ABSOLUTELY repurchase this.</li>
            <li> The best mouth brush! highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this product it really gets a dirty mouth clean . I love the freshness it leaves in my mouth after using it and all that bacteria and extra gunk I just couldn&#x27;t ever seem to get off with a toothbrush . I will definitely be buying these for my whole family . My product was even delivered to my door within the next day of purchase . I really recommend the Orabrush to everyone it really is well worth the money spent .</li>
