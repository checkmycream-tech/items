            <li>I also really enjoyed the free eye mask!</li>
            <li>and she said she was glad I bought it for her</li>
            <li>that was more like dollar store junk.</li>
            <li>Elegant provided this sample fore testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to try it on a tub yet</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m feeling confident that it&#x27;ll keep</li>

            <li>I LOVE THIS PILLOW.</li>
            <li>I have a tendency to fall asleep in the bath, and this makes it so its not totally awful.</li>

            <li>I received my order quickly and it was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>you can relax and enjoy your elegant bath.</li>
            <li>I used my new bath pillow today and I must say it felt soooo nice!</li>
            <li>I received this pillow as a gift from my friend and it&#x27;s so cool!</li>
            <li>so it stays in place but is easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>(as can be seen in the picture), no matter how many ways I tried and products I used to attempt to clean it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to attach to my bathtub and the strong suction cups keep it in place.</li>
            <li>It has a strong hold</li>
            <li>the suction cups are strong so you won&#x27;t slip...</li>
            <li>Sellers were quick!</li>
            <li>Absolute favorite bath pillow!</li>
            <li>- they don&#x27;t come off like some of the cheap pillows tend to.</li>
            <li>After her bath she said it was comfortable</li>
            <li>Even has instructions for some free relaxing music.</li>
            <li>The company offered me to visit the company website for a free download of Spa music while relaxing in the tub.</li>
            <li>Try one, I promise you will enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>product appears to be made of a quality foam material with a smooth and supple sort of vinyl coating.</li>
            <li>This fabulous pillow.</li>
            <li>This fabulous pillow.</li>
            <li>Plus the product comes with instructions to download free spa music on their site.</li>
            <li>Thus far, this is by far the BEST one I have tried.</li>
            <li>Thanks to my friend for the lovely and thoughtful gift.  </li>
            <li>, I LOVE this fantastic product and highly recommend</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for girls like me who doesn&#x27;t like getting their hair wet.</li>
            <li>My latest request  was a much needed bath pillow.</li>
            <li>I would say that this is a good product overall.</li>
            <li>I was worried about getting this to fit my bathtub, but when I got a coupon to try it, AND there was the face mask I thought it would be totally worth it to try.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and just the right size.</li>
            <li>It is high quality and very comfortable as a headrest in the tub.</li>
            <li>This was by far the most comfortable may I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Quick release  and quickly dries out to avoid mold and mildew and getting stinky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sturdy, exactly as described, and comfortable.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a bath, jacuzzi or hot tub pillow - Get this pillow, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li>The mask that it came with was nothing special but the pillow itself was much higher quality</li>
            <li>Many other plastic/foam pillows have a strong plastic/chemical smell, but this one is just fine right out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and supports very well.</li>
            <li>Now this bath pillow is sooo nice and such an upgrade.</li>
            <li>The suction cups work and the eye gel mask is such a nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Going to try it warm next.</li>
            <li>With a first impression such as this, AND a significantly lower price than the BB&amp;B product, I LOVE this fantastic product and highly recommend</li>
            <li>Thanks for the bonus eye mask!</li>
            <li>When I first brought it I thought it would be one I had to blow up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what I&#x27;ll get next :)</li>
            <li>My purchase arrived fast, and thank goodness it did!</li>
            <li>To be able to have the pillow and the mask is an extra plus.  </li>
            <li>The top portion is moveable so even if you don&#x27;t have a back edge to your bathtub (like me), you can flip it up and use the suction on it to stick it to the wall.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to use my pillow after having a busy day at work I needed to relax.</li>
            <li>My BB&amp;B pillow was tossed straight to the trash after my first bath session with this pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My BB&amp;B pillow was tossed straight to the trash after my first bath session with this pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a women of a certain age</li>
            <li>The suction cups are generously large.  </li>
            <li>This product absolutely exceeded my expections.  </li>
            <li>so the stress of the day can really get to me.</li>
            <li>The suction cups hold it in place very well</li>
            <li>I am the type to really use my bath time as a time to reflect and chill out</li>
            <li>(I tried it on my bed because I really wanted to see).</li>
            <li>I feels much comfier than my blow up bath</li>
            <li>It was shipped and received shortly after my order was confirmed.</li>
            <li>The first two I tried were plasticy, cheap, blow-up air ones that weren&#x27;t comfortable, practical, or long lasting.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this bath pillow!</li>
            <li>so I just stick the suction cups &amp; whole pillow into tub,</li>
            <li>The seam is folded flat and make for an exceptionally comfortable bath-lying position.</li>
            <li>Much more high quality than I expected.</li>
            <li>Easy to dry off.</li>
            <li>I put mine in the  freezer so it would get nice and cold :)</li>
            <li>Needless to say, when the opportunity to fortunately receive this product at a discounted rate for the purposes of testing it and posting a completely honest and unbiased review, I was beyond excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As always I have to high five this company.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive, quality bath pillow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and the suction cups work very well on my tub.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and very comfy.  </li>
            <li>The foam is not hard plastic that one believes it will be from just the pictures.</li>
            <li>We all deserve a little peace and quiet so a hot relaxing bath, lit candles and a glass of your favorite wine with the Serenity</li>
            <li>Just received my new bath pillow.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing overall, highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The pillow is very soft and durable.</li>
            <li>It is soft and works well in both our normal tub and garden tub.  </li>
            <li>It appears to be a fine quality product, but haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if it endures the test of time, I will update as time goes on.</li>
            <li>It is a very high quality pillow and really feels like you spent a fortune on it.  </li>
            <li>Soft and</li>
            <li>It seems to work well with the suction cups it comes with so far.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re set to go and have a complete relaxation in your bathtub.</li>
            <li>This luxury pillow is SOOO soft.</li>
            <li>Only part that doesn&#x27;t work well is our bathtub doesn&#x27;t have a wide flat part at the top</li>
            <li>Compared to the more expensive Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond version, that requires much finagling to ensure a decent suction.</li>
            <li>its full purpose.&lt;br /&gt;The pillow&#x27;s cushion is firm yet soft</li>
            <li>When closed the door and was transcended to a peaceful relaxing atmosphere.</li>
            <li>and I like that I have something this soft to lean back on.</li>
            <li>I recently received this bath pillow and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>My jacuzzi garden tub is large and I slide down when trying to relax.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy, exactly as described, and comfortable.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a bath, jacuzzi or hot tub pillow - Get this pillow, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> The mask that it came with was nothing special but the pillow itself was much higher quality</li>
            <li> Many other plastic/foam pillows have a strong plastic/chemical smell, but this one is just fine right out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and supports very well.</li>
            <li> Now this bath pillow is sooo nice and such an upgrade.</li>
            <li> The suction cups work and the eye gel mask is such a nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Going to try it warm next.</li>
            <li> With a first impression such as this, AND a significantly lower price than the BB&amp;B product, I LOVE this fantastic product and highly recommend</li>
            <li> Thanks for the bonus eye mask!</li>
            <li> When I first brought it I thought it would be one I had to blow up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what I&#x27;ll get next :)</li>
            <li> My purchase arrived fast, and thank goodness it did!</li>
            <li> To be able to have the pillow and the mask is an extra plus.  </li>
            <li> The top portion is moveable so even if you don&#x27;t have a back edge to your bathtub (like me), you can flip it up and use the suction on it to stick it to the wall.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use my pillow after having a busy day at work I needed to relax.</li>
            <li> My BB&amp;B pillow was tossed straight to the trash after my first bath session with this pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My BB&amp;B pillow was tossed straight to the trash after my first bath session with this pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a women of a certain age</li>
            <li> The suction cups are generously large.  </li>
            <li> This product absolutely exceeded my expections.  </li>
            <li> so the stress of the day can really get to me.</li>
            <li> The suction cups hold it in place very well</li>
            <li> I am the type to really use my bath time as a time to reflect and chill out</li>
            <li> (I tried it on my bed because I really wanted to see).</li>
            <li> I feels much comfier than my blow up bath</li>
            <li> It was shipped and received shortly after my order was confirmed.</li>
            <li> The first two I tried were plasticy, cheap, blow-up air ones that weren&#x27;t comfortable, practical, or long lasting.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this bath pillow!</li>
            <li> so I just stick the suction cups &amp; whole pillow into tub,</li>
            <li> The seam is folded flat and make for an exceptionally comfortable bath-lying position.</li>
            <li> Much more high quality than I expected.</li>
            <li> Easy to dry off.</li>
            <li> I put mine in the  freezer so it would get nice and cold :)</li>
            <li> Needless to say, when the opportunity to fortunately receive this product at a discounted rate for the purposes of testing it and posting a completely honest and unbiased review, I was beyond excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As always I have to high five this company.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive, quality bath pillow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and the suction cups work very well on my tub.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and very comfy.  </li>
            <li> The foam is not hard plastic that one believes it will be from just the pictures.</li>
            <li> We all deserve a little peace and quiet so a hot relaxing bath, lit candles and a glass of your favorite wine with the Serenity</li>
            <li> Just received my new bath pillow.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing overall, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The pillow is very soft and durable.</li>
            <li> It is soft and works well in both our normal tub and garden tub.  </li>
            <li> It appears to be a fine quality product, but haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if it endures the test of time, I will update as time goes on.</li>
            <li> It is a very high quality pillow and really feels like you spent a fortune on it.  </li>
            <li> Soft and</li>
            <li> It seems to work well with the suction cups it comes with so far.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re set to go and have a complete relaxation in your bathtub.</li>
            <li> This luxury pillow is SOOO soft.</li>
            <li> Only part that doesn&#x27;t work well is our bathtub doesn&#x27;t have a wide flat part at the top</li>
            <li> Compared to the more expensive Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond version, that requires much finagling to ensure a decent suction.</li>
            <li> its full purpose.&lt;br /&gt;The pillow&#x27;s cushion is firm yet soft</li>
            <li> When closed the door and was transcended to a peaceful relaxing atmosphere.</li>
            <li> and I like that I have something this soft to lean back on.</li>
            <li> I recently received this bath pillow and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> My jacuzzi garden tub is large and I slide down when trying to relax.</li>
            <li> The third one, the most expensive of the 4 (purchased from Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond for $25) and the one I&#x27;ve been using for quite some time, while passing the longevity test, had countless other issues that lead me to begin the search for a 4th.</li>
            <li> It is completely sealed (not filled with holes)</li>
            <li> I am a changed woman I can now rest in my tub and leisurely take a bath after a hard day ready for a evening out refreshed and renewed all without wet hair.  </li>
            <li> It remains dry and mold-free; we don&#x27;t even bother removing it after each use; the water drains out from the gap between the tub and pillow;&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a foam like material soft to the touch and its thick</li>
            <li> We bought this bath pillow to replace something similar we were using previously.  </li>
            <li> The pillow I was using prior to this one (see picture, from Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond) has holes that soak up water, making it heavy and susceptible to mold</li>
            <li> She has had other bath pillows and said as soon as she took it out of the package that It felt &amp;#34;well made&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Since I have a lot of migrants it feels great cold (and stays cold).</li>
            <li> , I was almost concerned that it would be difficult remove, but the suction cups have these handy little tabs to pull and make removal a breeze (lacking in my expensive BB&amp;B one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I burned a few candles drew me a soothing mint bubble bath and my Serenity pillow.</li>

            <li> My jacuzzi garden tub is large and I slide down when trying to relax. This pillow was perfect. It stayed put and kept me perched. It&#x27;s comfortable and just the right size. Sellers were quick! Thanks for the bonus eye mask!</li>
            <li> This product absolutely exceeded my expections.  It is a very high quality pillow and really feels like you spent a fortune on it.  Tried out the eye mask as well...amazing!!!  Great for a gift or to add to a spa basket gift or just to pamper yourself!!!</li>
            <li> Just received my new bath pillow. It&#x27;s very comfortable and provides great support.  It has a strong hold so it stays in place but is easy to remove.  It&#x27;s also great for girls like me who doesn&#x27;t like getting their hair wet. Which is an extra star in my book.</li>
            <li> I received the Serenity Now Pillow as a gift and was very happy with the quality. The pillow is very soft and durable. The suction held to my tub without slipping which helped me to relax and the bonus mask helped my tired eyes. I&#x27;m a women of a certain age so the stress of the day can really get to me. We all deserve a little peace and quiet so a hot relaxing bath, lit candles and a glass of your favorite wine with the Serenity Now Pillow is just what you need. When closed the door and was transcended to a peaceful relaxing atmosphere. Thanks to my friend for the lovely and thoughtful gift.  I’m going to pay it forward and buy one for friend so she can share my experience. :)  </li>
            <li> This bath pillow is just as it says....Luxury! It is high quality and very comfortable as a headrest in the tub. The suction cups hold it in place very well - they don&#x27;t come off like some of the cheap pillows tend to. Eye mask bonus is very nice. Simply Elegant Company &amp; Customer Service is also 5 Stars! If your looking for a bath, jacuzzi or hot tub pillow - Get this pillow, you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I received this pillow as a gift from my friend and it&#x27;s so cool! I am the type to really use my bath time as a time to reflect and chill out and I like that I have something this soft to lean back on. I tried it with the eye mask and it felt so soothing. The music download was a plus that I didn&#x27;t count on and I tried it when I docked it on my player in the bathroom. The songs were not distracting they were actually what I&#x27;m used to hearing when I go to the spa.</li>
            <li> This was by far the most comfortable may I&#x27;ve ever used. The two part cushions make it even more comfy and conforming to your body. I also really enjoyed the free eye mask! Very relaxing overall, highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: received product at discount for review. Ordered for my wife, she loves it. She has had other bath pillows and said as soon as she took it out of the package that It felt &amp;#34;well made&amp;#34;.  After her bath she said it was comfortable and she said she was glad I bought it for her</li>
            <li> I tried out a piece-o-crap blow up pillow a couple of weeks ago that was more like dollar store junk. Now this bath pillow is sooo nice and such an upgrade. It&#x27;s comfortable and supports very well. It feels like it has memory foam in it, but it&#x27;s covered in a waterproof plastic.The suction cups work and the eye gel mask is such a nice addition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this bath pillow set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply Elegant provided this sample fore testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to try it on a tub yet but I&#x27;m taking it on vacation with me where they&#x27;ll have jets so I can&#x27;t wait to try this to its full purpose.&lt;br /&gt;The pillow&#x27;s cushion is firm yet soft so I&#x27;m feeling confident that it&#x27;ll keep it&#x27;s shape. (I tried it on my bed because I really wanted to see). I feels much comfier than my blow up bath pillow.&lt;br /&gt;With it being summer and my apartment being so toasty, I tried my mask with the freezer. Felt great on my forehead. Going to try it warm next.</li>
            <li> This spa pillow is great! Soft and the suction cups are strong so you won&#x27;t slip...you can relax and enjoy your elegant bath.</li>
            <li> I was very shocked when I got this in the mail. When I first brought it I thought it would be one I had to blow up. Well I was very wrong . It a very nice pillow. It&#x27;s soft and the suction cups work very well on my tub. Easy to dry off. I love the eye mask. I put mine in the  freezer so it would get nice and cold :)</li>
            <li> I used my new bath pillow today and I must say it felt soooo nice! I felt so pampered! Great purchase and the cooling mask really sweetened the deal</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. Especially after a surgery. It came in quite handy. The materials appear to be made of good quality and the mask is a great bonus. It&#x27;s comfy for me. I love it. Even has instructions for some free relaxing music. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> As always I have to high five this company. I received my Serenity pillow in two days, as well as a bonus; a gel mask. I was so excited to use my pillow after having a busy day at work I needed to relax. As I was opening my package I noticed yet another bonus. The company offered me to visit the company website for a free download of Spa music while relaxing in the tub. So I burned a few candles drew me a soothing mint bubble bath and my Serenity pillow. WOW, just delightful. I can&#x27;t wait to take a bath again tomorrow. I&#x27;m turning my bathroom into a spa every night</li>
            <li> We bought this bath pillow to replace something similar we were using previously.  This is much better in many ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It does not retain water.  It remains dry and mold-free; we don&#x27;t even bother removing it after each use; the water drains out from the gap between the tub and pillow;&lt;br /&gt;2. It does not smell.  Many other plastic/foam pillows have a strong plastic/chemical smell, but this one is just fine right out of the package.&lt;br /&gt;3. It is soft and works well in both our normal tub and garden tub.  Shape and size are ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel mask is a nice bonus but we haven&#x27;t used it at all.  Loving the pillow though.</li>
            <li> Simply Elegant is absolutely amazing! Any product that you need can be purchased on Amazon from this company. They have such a variety. The products are of great quality and very affordable. My latest request  was a much needed bath pillow. It was shipped and received shortly after my order was confirmed. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what I&#x27;ll get next :)</li>
            <li> I picked up one of these for my wife and she loved it... ONE  HAPPY HUSBAND!!!!!</li>
            <li> OMG! This was the relaxation apparatus that I have been searching for!! I am a changed woman I can now rest in my tub and leisurely take a bath after a hard day ready for a evening out refreshed and renewed all without wet hair.  I give this pillow 5 ***** stars count them 5. Try one, I promise you will enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed after working 10 hour days... Very comfortable and thinking of buying more as gifts....</li>
            <li> I recently received this bath pillow and was pleasantly surprised. The mask that it came with was nothing special but the pillow itself was much higher quality then I was expecting. It seems to work well with the suction cups it comes with so far. I would say that this is a good product overall.</li>
            <li> My purchase arrived fast, and thank goodness it did! It has become a asset during bath time. Thank you simply elegant!</li>
            <li> This is the fourth bath pillow I have tried. Thus far, this is by far the BEST one I have tried. The first two I tried were plasticy, cheap, blow-up air ones that weren&#x27;t comfortable, practical, or long lasting. The third one, the most expensive of the 4 (purchased from Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond for $25) and the one I&#x27;ve been using for quite some time, while passing the longevity test, had countless other issues that lead me to begin the search for a 4th. Needless to say, when the opportunity to fortunately receive this product at a discounted rate for the purposes of testing it and posting a completely honest and unbiased review, I was beyond excited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product appears to be made of a quality foam material with a smooth and supple sort of vinyl coating. It is completely sealed (not filled with holes) so that water cannot seep into the foam inside. The pillow I was using prior to this one (see picture, from Bed, Bath, &amp; Beyond) has holes that soak up water, making it heavy and susceptible to mold (as can be seen in the picture), no matter how many ways I tried and products I used to attempt to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the material, I love the shape of this pillow. The seam is folded flat and make for an exceptionally comfortable bath-lying position. Unlike my previous pillow, which had no foldable seams, made my neck have to arch in an unnatural and uncomfortable way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really love the suction cups of this pillow. They easily attached to my tub very securely and effortlessly. Compared to the more expensive Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond version, that requires much finagling to ensure a decent suction. This pillow attached so well, I was almost concerned that it would be difficult remove, but the suction cups have these handy little tabs to pull and make removal a breeze (lacking in my expensive BB&amp;B one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, no stinky smell or manual blowing up required! With a first impression such as this, AND a significantly lower price than the BB&amp;B product, I LOVE this fantastic product and highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.- While I have not yet used the eye mask or downloaded the music content, I&#x27;m am pretty impressed with their inclusion as bonuses and will update this review once I have had the opportunity to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.P.S- My BB&amp;B pillow was tossed straight to the trash after my first bath session with this pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Quality Material&lt;br /&gt;- Perfect Shape&lt;br /&gt;- Very Comfortable&lt;br /&gt;- Perfect Tub Fit&lt;br /&gt;- Quality Suction Cups&lt;br /&gt;- Bonus Products Included&lt;br /&gt;- No Stinky Smell&lt;br /&gt;- No Blowing Up Required&lt;br /&gt;- Very Fair Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-NONE to report at this time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Picture 4: This fabulous pillow.

Pictures 1, 2, &amp; 3: The BB&amp;B pillow.)</li>
            <li> Wow, this bath pillow is the best! It&#x27;s easy to attach to my bathtub and the strong suction cups keep it in place. It&#x27;s designed wonderfully for full comfort. It&#x27;s soft and very comfy.  Very well made. Quick release  and quickly dries out to avoid mold and mildew and getting stinky. The bonus eye gel mask is awesome! Just put it in the fridge/freezer for a few minutes and you&#x27;re set to go and have a complete relaxation in your bathtub. Got this product at  a great discount to try and review. I highly recommend this bath pillow!</li>
            <li> I was worried about getting this to fit my bathtub, but when I got a coupon to try it, AND there was the face mask I thought it would be totally worth it to try. I LOVE THIS PILLOW. I have a tendency to fall asleep in the bath, and this makes it so its not totally awful. Also, only put the mask in the fridge DO NOT FREEZE IT. It makes it head ache inducing cold.</li>
            <li> Finally, a bath pillow I don&#x27;t have to blow up.  They always disappoint.  This pillow is softly solid with support for both my head and my neck.  The suction cups are generously large.  Plus..bonus...a gel mask for while I&#x27;m soaking.  Doesn&#x27;t get better than that.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product</li>
            <li> This luxury pillow is SOOO soft. It adds extra comfort for me when I&#x27;m taking a bath. The face mask is also a bonus. It&#x27;s a extra treat that just relaxes me. I am so in love. This is a MUST HAVE. Great product.</li>
            <li> Absolute favorite bath pillow! Very comfortable &amp; loves that it comes with gel mask! Only part that doesn&#x27;t work well is our bathtub doesn&#x27;t have a wide flat part at the top so I just stick the suction cups &amp; whole pillow into tub,</li>
            <li> The foam is not hard plastic that one believes it will be from just the pictures. It&#x27;s actually a foam like material soft to the touch and its thick so it&#x27;s not cheaply made. The mask looks well made too and the head strap is off good sturdy material. Can&#x27;t wait to try it out tonight. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s meant to be a hot gel mask or freeze it. I suppose you have options ! Plus the product comes with instructions to download free spa music on their site. Bonus.</li>
            <li> This product from Simply Elegant is Simply Awesome! To be able to have the pillow and the mask is an extra plus.  Comfort at it&#x27;s best!</li>
            <li> Much more high quality than I expected. Really nice size and material construction.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product if you&#x27;re looking for an inexpensive, quality bath pillow. I received my order quickly and it was packaged nicely. It&#x27;s sturdy, exactly as described, and comfortable.The top portion is moveable so even if you don&#x27;t have a back edge to your bathtub (like me), you can flip it up and use the suction on it to stick it to the wall. The mask was a great addition. Since I have a lot of migrants it feels great cold (and stays cold).</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the pillow for my weekly baths.  The material is smooth, not slippery and having arthritis in my neck, the cushions are of perfect comfort for my head.  It appears to be a fine quality product, but haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see if it endures the test of time, I will update as time goes on.</li>
