            <li>Came in a surprisingly nice box too.</li>
            <li>and it makes nice bubbles while scenting the air.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice not to have to deal with face cleanser, body cleanser, and shampoo - one and done.</li>
            <li>wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice, but I think it should be stronger.</li>

            <li>Also has a mild pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I like suave shampoo because it gets my hair clean and it smells good, too.  </li>
            <li>Winning combination.</li>
            <li>Not my favorite smelling one (I prefer fruits)</li>
            <li>Considering that shampoo like this costs about $6 at the drug store, It&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>The bottle is the perfect shape and size that is easy to hold on to and the cap is easy to open when your hands are</li>
            <li>I just want clean and shiny hair, and this shampoo gives me that!</li>
            <li>so girls like me can still enjoy taking showers.:)</li>
            <li>A good shampoo for the whole family.</li>
            <li>Smells good and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>I really love the clean scent it gives my hair.</li>
            <li>I like a thorough, refreshing clean, and Wen doesn&#x27;t bring it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair looking clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>always keep it on hand for the obvious reasons its inexpensive good and kids need their own bottles of shampoo</li>
            <li>The only shampoo you&#x27;ll ever need at a great price.</li>
            <li>price was on point and my teenage son loves this product and it smells great too.</li>
            <li>I know you are just buying this because its dirt cheap.  </li>
            <li>just keep it clean.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>The cap takes a fair amount of effort to pop open and then it doesn&#x27;t ever seem to seal all the way.</li>
            <li>this Waterfall Scent is super clean smelling and invigorating.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild</li>
            <li>Bought it as a filler item to get super saver shipping.</li>
            <li>Overall an excellent bargain for a basic shampoo.</li>
            <li>This is cheap shampoo that seems to work pretty well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the full price, and sometimes Amazon drops the price to $1 a bottle, which is a bargain.  </li>
            <li>I use it around five days a week (give or take) and my hair seems pretty clean.</li>
            <li>If your skin is sensitive, YMMV, but I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this on my face.  </li>
            <li>Suave conditioners are really effective and fragrant too, so if basic shampoo dries your hair, the conditioners fix that problem.</li>
            <li>Then I get in and wash my face, hair, and body with it, fast and easy, and jump out ready for the day.  </li>
            <li>It works nicely on my face - shampoo is a good choice for washing your face as long as the pH is neutral to slightly acid, because it&#x27;s not a soap and will not clog your pores.  </li>
            <li>haha!</li>
            <li>This is a nice basic shampoo lots of lather, but not worth $6.59, I baught it last week for $1 as a fill in to get my order to $25 for free shipping.</li>
            <li>Only need to use a small amount because it really foams up good.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t make it live again, so I figure,</li>
            <li>For the amount of shampoo my kids go through it doesn&#x27;t make sense to buy expensive stuff when this works just as good.</li>
            <li>Somebody complained about paying full price for this once when it was clearly only worth $1 a bottle.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product for $1.00 at a Dollar General Store.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love Suave Waterfall Mist shampoo! I have never been one to pay a lot for hair care products. I just want clean and shiny hair, and this shampoo gives me that! I really love the clean scent it gives my hair. I especially love the affordable price.</li>
            <li> Cleanses hair well, although slightly drying.</li>
            <li> Cheaper than Walmart on Subscribe and Save...and I don&#x27;t have to step foot in Walmart. Double-bonus. A good shampoo for the whole family. The scent is mild so it works on men, women and kids, and it does great on a variety of hair types.</li>
            <li> Why buy expensive shampoo for $6...If you&#x27;re looking for affordable bath products this is the way to go. Also has a mild pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a filler item to get super saver shipping. Considering that shampoo like this costs about $6 at the drug store, It&#x27;s a pretty good deal. Came in a surprisingly nice box too. Smells good.</li>
            <li> This is cheap shampoo that seems to work pretty well. I use it around five days a week (give or take) and my hair seems pretty clean.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo you&#x27;ll ever need at a great price.</li>
            <li> This is a nice basic shampoo lots of lather, but not worth $6.59, I baught it last week for $1 as a fill in to get my order to $25 for free shipping. I&#x27;d buy it again when the price drops back down.</li>
            <li> Suave brand has been a good value for decades.  It gets the job done.  Has a pleasant aroma.  This product has a good lather.  I sometimes use this a a bubble bathe.</li>
            <li> Used to buy this at my local convenience store and decided to one day see if Amazon sold it. Of course Amazon sells this, what don&#x27;t they sell? haha! Anyways, this stuff gets the job of shampooing done and it smells great. Only need to use a small amount because it really foams up good. Not much else to say about shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reason why I gave it 4 stars and not 5? I CANNOT STAND THE CAP ON THIS BOTTLE! The cap takes a fair amount of effort to pop open and then it doesn&#x27;t ever seem to seal all the way. Always some soap residue on the bottle from it leaking a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Favorite shampoo&lt;br /&gt;-Smells great&lt;br /&gt;-Good price&lt;br /&gt;-Gets the job done&lt;br /&gt;-Foams up good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Beware the cap</li>
            <li> my husband loves this stuff so I keep buying it for him.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and this Waterfall Scent is super clean smelling and invigorating. I&#x27;ll be reordering. Suave brand has been a value for decades.</li>
            <li> cleans good, smells good, and was super cheap! For the amount of shampoo my kids go through it doesn&#x27;t make sense to buy expensive stuff when this works just as good.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. price was on point and my teenage son loves this product and it smells great too. Winning combination.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, the lather, all of it. Not sure why people pay so much money for shampoo when products like this work just as well.  I will keep ordering this as my go-to shampoo</li>
            <li> Somebody complained about paying full price for this once when it was clearly only worth $1 a bottle.  That&#x27;s stupid.  It&#x27;s worth the full price, and sometimes Amazon drops the price to $1 a bottle, which is a bargain.  The last time I noticed that, I bought three bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I squirt a little in the tub as I&#x27;m running my bath and it makes nice bubbles while scenting the air.  Then I get in and wash my face, hair, and body with it, fast and easy, and jump out ready for the day.  It works nicely on my face - shampoo is a good choice for washing your face as long as the pH is neutral to slightly acid, because it&#x27;s not a soap and will not clog your pores.  If your skin is sensitive, YMMV, but I&#x27;ve enjoyed using this on my face.  It&#x27;s nice not to have to deal with face cleanser, body cleanser, and shampoo - one and done.</li>
            <li> Way overpriced! You can get three for this price in the supermarket.</li>
            <li> This is part of my Amazon monthly subscription order -- so glad i don&#x27;t have to remember to pick up shampoo at the grocery!</li>
            <li> Not my favorite smelling one (I prefer fruits) but it&#x27;s what they had. Still works good though.</li>
            <li> I am not picky about brand and this was on sale. It works well and I would buy it again if it was at a good price.</li>
            <li> Our son has used this shampoo exclusively for several years and loves it.  It does a good job cleaning, lathers up nicely, and smells good.  Of course, we like the price!  Overall an excellent bargain for a basic shampoo.</li>
            <li> makes my hair silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;honestly I know you are just buying this because its dirt cheap.  If you wait it will eventually go on sale for like a dollar a bottle.  So i&#x27;ll be rocking suave for a while unless mane and tail slashes its price.  I&#x27;m a simple kinda guy if you can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very nice. Smells good and cleans very well. I would highly recommend it. I ordered it for my wife who tells me it is excellent.</li>
            <li> I knew what I was ordering, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything different. I just threw these into my order because I needed them.</li>
            <li> always keep it on hand for the obvious reasons its inexpensive good and kids need their own bottles of shampoo</li>
            <li> I reviewed Suave Daily Clarifying shampoo and gave it five stars. I&#x27;m giving this five also because: great fragrance, lathers well, doubles as a face and body wash, cleans well, and contains no silicones or oils. These are some of the last shampoos that are just SHAMPOO, not a weirdo mixture of conditioners and \\&quot;nutrition\\&quot; which are not needed, since hair is dead. You can&#x27;t make it live again, so I figure, just keep it clean. Suave conditioners are really effective and fragrant too, so if basic shampoo dries your hair, the conditioners fix that problem. My mom is on the Wen bandwagon but I can&#x27;t ride with her. I like a thorough, refreshing clean, and Wen doesn&#x27;t bring it. This does. I hope Suave keeps their basic formula here so girls like me can still enjoy taking showers.:)</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean. It leaves my hair looking clean and healthy. The bottle is the perfect shape and size that is easy to hold on to and the cap is easy to open when your hands are wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is nice, but I think it should be stronger. I would give it 5 stars if the scent was stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great product are the price you pay.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for $1.00 at a Dollar General Store.  Save your money.  It is not worth the $6.00 they are asking.</li>
            <li> I like suave shampoo because it gets my hair clean and it smells good, too.  It is a good value.</li>
