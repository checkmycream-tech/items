    <ol>
            <li>it is one of the best shavers i ever used &amp;</li>
            <li>all  around its a real good shaver..............</li>
            <li>This travel shaver does an excellent job of shaving.  </li>
            <li>I am happy!</li>
            <li>Man, I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li>This shaver is great!  </li>
            <li>would be my choice for world&#x27;s best battery shaver.</li>
            <li>A bonus was the zippered carrying case, which is perfectly fitted .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect travel shaver.</li>
            <li>Battery life has been very good.</li>
            <li>I found the product very good for me.</li>
            <li>That said, it is a great shaver - the best out there for all of you road warriors.(see my review for the PQ208/40).</li>
            <li>Perfect for the job, very pleased with this, lightweight and</li>
            <li>The shaver works great and is a bargain.  </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>These batteries have great shelf life in or out of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the money a great item for the person on the go.</li>
            <li>Great price for a great shave every time.  </li>
            <li>he used it and was happy with it.</li>
            <li>I had great anticipation to receive this shaver given the good number of reviews.</li>
            <li>no, it&#x27;s not as good, but it&#x27;s a close rival.</li>
            <li>I used a travel foil-shaver before and wasn&#x27;t as good as this.</li>
            <li>but still I think that this product will be good for every one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: a good buy</li>
            <li>My husband said it works surprisingly well.  </li>
            <li>Good to take on travel.  </li>
            <li>great product, much better than the Norelco Shaver I&#x27;ve had for 7 years.</li>
            <li>good points of this model are its compactness and amazing battery life.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like using it for a full shave because it takes forever and doesn&#x27;t do a very good job on my cheeks.     </li>
            <li>What more can one ask for!?</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love this shaver!</li>
            <li>Thanks Philips, I&#x27;m very happy with my HQ40!</li>
            <li>Razor was nicely made.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything great, but after using this on a couple of trips I decided that I didn&#x27;t have to use this as a backup and now use it full time for travel.  </li>
            <li>I had used many AA battery shavers and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>These are the two failings of most battery-powered shavers.    </li>
            <li>i have way more costly shavers &amp;</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t fall for the hype; you get nothing more.</li>
            <li>powered by two AAA&#x27;s) which worked infinitely better than this razor, for a weekly shave.  </li>
            <li>Works better than Remington</li>
            <li>/&gt;While the unit does fit nicely into my hand and palm, it does not cut well, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>bought it after having good success with a 3-shaving head system, but as a travel razor it does not meet my minimum requirements.  </li>
            <li>This saves me 20 minutes a day being able to shave on my way to work.</li>
            <li>I collect compact automatic razors, both antique and modern, and this is a great product for someone who does not have a beard or mustache-- with a trimmer, I would give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t be able to trim your sideburns, so</li>
            <li>But the design was so elegant that I&#x27;ve kept buying Norelco products ever since.  </li>
            <li>It was okay.</li>
            <li>I bought it as a gift for my partner and he really pleased.</li>
            <li>Norelco has been in our household for many, many years.</li>
            <li>: well made, works well, comfortable, blades are really easy to clean (no tools required), compact, good battery life (</li>
            <li>My brother says it does a good job, but he liked his old one better.</li>
            <li>I thought, from the great reviews, that it would work well for all purposes, but it clearly doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Looking for a replacement, I first looked at the admittedly very elegant, smallest of Panasonic&#x27;s shavers.</li>
            <li>The thing is reliable and I dont take the greatest care (field use in Afghanistan among other places)</li>
            <li>It has two rotary heads, can easily be cleaned by blowing it out, or using the supplied brush.</li>
            <li>Cleaning of heads is easy.  </li>
            <li>but this is more than adequate.</li>
            <li>I have have used this great little shaver and its predecessor for many, many years.</li>
            <li>The plastic cover/protector snaps over the heads too lightly and can come off in your travel bag.</li>
            <li>It spoils the otherwise fabulous ergonomic design.</li>
            <li>Also, light-weight, easy to clean, and although made of plastic, a quality precision assembly.    </li>
            <li>It is important that you practice this product for some time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s greatest virtue is that unlike some single-foil razors (like the Braun M60) it does not miss hairs, so you won&#x27;t have a few stray hairs growing</li>
            <li>1)Its not as comfortable to use</li>
            <li>Both are important for travel gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Battery life seems good so far.  </li>
            <li>This latest version is very efficient, and just as elegant.  </li>
            <li>Batteries make this excellent because of no or less cords in the bathroom!</li>
            <li>Thanks !!!</li>
            <li>It is great for a full shave or a last minute touch up.  </li>
            <li>This [type of] razor only works if you are getting clean-shaven every day; in that case, it does work quickly, and gives you a very nice, smooth, close shave.      </li>
            <li>After receiving it from Amazon, I can now say, I was very right.</li>
            <li>A pleasant surprise, REALLY quiet.</li>
            <li>The on off switch should be relocated to the bottom or provided with a more positive stop.  </li>
            <li>My only niggle is I&#x27;d like a more secure fitting travel cap, or maybe a pouch, but the shaver itself is fine.</li>
            <li>True.. this razor does not shave as close as a blade shaver</li>
            <li>I now have this shaver for a back up or for traveling purpose, It has good power for a battery run shaver.</li>
            <li>It shaves as close as my full size Norelco.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is good and the heads are standard Norelco parts sold just about anywhere in the world.</li>
            <li>figure this is only good for four or five days on the road.  </li>
            <li>The switch locks in the off position, so it won&#x27;t turn on your luggage and freak out the TSA at the airport, and it comes with a nice soft case.  </li>
            <li>I dont use it everyday-mostly in the field or for a quick \\&quot;car\\&quot; shave.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Norelco HQ40/33 Shave on the Go Battery Razor for two reasons: as a quick way to address 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and to use while traveling.   </li>
            <li>Although the HQ40/33 doesn&#x27;t have a large coverage area, it nonetheless works fine for what I need.  </li>
            <li>this is a great little shaver for the price.  </li>
            <li>Great little razor for the travel bag.  </li>
            <li>Great little shaver.  </li>
            <li>well worth the price to</li>
            <li>This inconvenience is worth it because there is no cord or</li>
            <li>We do not give it 5 STARS, only because it does not come with an effective protector cap for the \\&quot;on/ off\\&quot; switch and for the shave-head</li>
            <li>It is also a good idea if you wet your face with water just before 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Of course it&#x27;s not as nice and ergonomic as the larger 3-head \\&quot;pro\\&quot; shavers</li>
            <li>I would say that one is slightly better for feel and finished appearance of the shave but neither is anywhere near comparable to the full-size Norelcos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>make sure you keep it clean and use hair clipper oil such as Wahl.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for 50 years and hoped this little one would be as good as their full size versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope.</li>
            <li>And right again about the cover.</li>
            <li>If you want a small razor for trips under 5 days, and you don&#x27;t have a beard or mustache, this is the best unit I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>It was to upgrade my old Norelco and give me a battery option with it; however, my old Norelco did a better job and not as noisy!</li>
            <li>The little $20 Philips gives a great, close shave in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li>Its performance was surprisingly good -- has a good shave, is quiet, was kind to my face, contains the shaved hairs, cleans easily with a toothbrush and occasional disinfectant, and survived several hard re-packings and jostling without problems.  </li>
            <li>It is too easy to accidentally turn off the razor while shaving, which frequently happens or to accidentally turn on the razor while traveling, which has not yet happened.  </li>
            <li>It gives a pretty good shave, obviously not as good as a blade, but definitely good enough for business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>Looks like the only way for my husband is to spend more on an upgraded model.</li>
            <li>The latest PocketGo P-70 isn&#x27;t bad--it actually might do my neck a tiny bit better than my Pulsonic--</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described, and exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for travel since it&#x27;s light, gives a great shave and you can just pop in new batteries when it&#x27;s dead without having to wait for a charge!</li>
            <li>I dropped my corded shaver a while back and needed a replacement head and could only find the blades, the price of this shaver was less than the blades, plus the head fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>It gives a very close shave-- not as close as you&#x27;d get with some modern $145 three-head high-tech razor, but quite adequate for a 10-hour work day.  </li>
            <li>liked the other one, and this one I can just swap out</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much hopeless.    </li>
            <li>Most importantly, it does not slow down on the neck and takes care of my multidirectional neck hairs with ease.  </li>
            <li>It runs for a long time on alkaline batteries and is handy and compact enough to store anywhere for a quick touch-up.  </li>
            <li>Unlike grand pianos, they&#x27;re all small and fit into a corner of a bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li>: none I can think of really - my previous model also came with a sideburn trimmer which would be nice addition</li>
            <li>it gives a pretty decent shave, I kept it in the car</li>
            <li>this one works just as good if not better than the high end ones.</li>
            <li>It takes a bit longer than my 120 volt powered triple header to shave, but not by much.  </li>
            <li>That shaver had 3 batteries and lasted much longer.  </li>
            <li>Many remote places do not have 24-hour electrical power (e.g. in Africa, Iraq, while hiking and boating).</li>
            <li>This shaver gets the job done very well.  </li>
            <li>I tried it for ~ 2 years and well, it takes as much time as shaving and never gives the close shave you get with a razor.</li>
            <li>He really likes it and uses it.  </li>
            <li>Lack of a fold-out trimmer is a reasonable compromise for compactness.</li>
            <li>I miss having a trimmer, but other than that it works as good as my big razor.  </li>
            <li>It gets surprisingly good power from the batteries, and it is very small and lightweight.</li>
            <li>I can get a decent shave without much problem.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of the HQ40 and highly recommend it as a small, light, travel version of your home Norelco.  </li>
            <li>The fact that the unit is small and doesn&#x27;t require any wiring or charging apparatus will come in handy as well.</li>
            <li>This one shaves faster and leaves my skin smoother (perhaps by the fact my previous was a foil and this one is a rotary, which in my opinion is much better).    </li>
            <li>This is a clever twist on the age-old Norelco electric shaver design.  </li>
            <li>But let&#x27;s get to the main point:  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a norelco nicad replacement for an older one&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It cuts decent</li>
            <li>Again, this Philips-Norelco razor would definitely work better for a daily shave, but that&#x27;s not what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Since my last trip, I&#x27;ve started using the HQ40 at home on occasion, since I&#x27;m starting to think it gives me a better shave than my pricey Pulsonic.    </li>
            <li>The shave is smooth, quiet, and makes no difference if you&#x27;re removing a 5-o&#x27;clock shadow or a two week old beard.</li>
            <li>And because it is so light, I don&#x27;t loose any shaving time.</li>
            <li>I guess you get what you pay for, and this just wasn&#x27;t worth the money, or the time it took to get it or send it back.</li>
            <li>It used four AA batteries that looked a lot like the new HQ40, except was more square and probably four times as heavy.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take long to see how quickly and painlessly my Dad shaved</li>
            <li>I would say the finished appearance is good enough for casual tourism but not good enough for business travel where you want to look your best.</li>
            <li>The fact that this shaver has two instead of the usual three heads should be no deterrent; this razor is really about as fast as the others, is light, portable, and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>They shoould last for 10 or 15 shaves, then be replaced or recharged; I use a charger that can bring them back up almost to original level.</li>
            <li>This is a complete ripoff!</li>
            <li>The only thing I withhold the fifth star for is the lack of a trimmer to clean up the side burns, or to nip off the occasional missed whisker.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought I would just purchase the new smaller and lighter Norelco GyroFlex to replace my old floating head version, but didn&#x27;t want to give up the convenience of battery power.  </li>
            <li>At this price, I only brought one for the car I most often drive, and use old fashion disposable shaver instead at other locations.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have much experience with electrical razors, actually this is my second one and first rotary.  </li>
            <li>The whole new travel razor was only $14.99 at Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have been using electric for many years and was torn (sometimes literally) between them; they are all quite noisy and could disturb a sleeper nearby, but this little Norelco has a very low-level hum and produces minimal vibration.</li>
            <li>While it takes a little longer to shave compared to the triple header, it does a decent job and the batteries last for a couple weeks easily.</li>
            <li>I use it when I travel and so far I have no complaints.</li>
            <li>it has to be about 7yrs old now</li>
            <li>Then I looked on eBay to see if I could find the old battery powered Norelco</li>
            <li>As a bonus it is easier to clean with the little brush they give you than my PocketGo is.</li>
            <li>This was for my husband who used the shaver, and after 15 minutes couldn&#x27;t get a decent shave, and had to stop because his face got red from the heat of the product.    </li>
            <li>But priced too high or else I would buy some for gifts to all the male in my family.</li>
            <li>I have used the Braun 370 as my travel razor for the last ten or fifteen years, because it is small and light, is battery powered and generally shaves pretty well.  </li>
            <li>The neck beard is what finally drove me to look for a new travel razor.  </li>
            <li>I took one like it to Europe on a month tour and shaved every day for the month and used the same two AA batteries the complete time.</li>
            <li>If I just place it over my skin then it barely does it&#x27;s work.  </li>
            <li>With savings from odd jobs, I bought my first, a two header battery powered Norelco.  </li>
            <li>It was very durable, like all Norelco razors, and I used it as my only razor through high school, through college almost to a PhD and for a few years in between.  </li>
            <li>you are on a budget or have light facial hair, you might consider this as an everyday shaver, although it&#x27;s a dry shave</li>
            <li>I regularly use a Norelco/Philips floating head, three cutting head re-chargeable electric shaver at home, and assumed that this &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; battery razor would be be a good choice for taking on vacation; I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To be comprehensive, here are my less positive observations.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it, and it is exactly the same shaver as the PQ208/40 (which I also have) that costs $10 less.</li>
            <li>next time i&#x27;ll avoid these non-amazon suppliers they do not hold to any apparent standards.  </li>
            <li>some  of the high end make my face brake out or give me razor burn, but this  does not do any of those things and the other ones are heaver &amp; bulkier &amp; this one is none of those things.  </li>
            <li>With the Face Saver the shave is much closer with less passes.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> good points of this model are its compactness and amazing battery life.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like using it for a full shave because it takes forever and doesn&#x27;t do a very good job on my cheeks.     </li>
            <li> What more can one ask for!?</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this shaver!</li>
            <li> Thanks Philips, I&#x27;m very happy with my HQ40!</li>
            <li> Razor was nicely made.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything great, but after using this on a couple of trips I decided that I didn&#x27;t have to use this as a backup and now use it full time for travel.  </li>
            <li> I had used many AA battery shavers and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> These are the two failings of most battery-powered shavers.    </li>
            <li> i have way more costly shavers &amp;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for the hype; you get nothing more.</li>
            <li> powered by two AAA&#x27;s) which worked infinitely better than this razor, for a weekly shave.  </li>
            <li> Works better than Remington</li>
            <li> /&gt;While the unit does fit nicely into my hand and palm, it does not cut well, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> bought it after having good success with a 3-shaving head system, but as a travel razor it does not meet my minimum requirements.  </li>
            <li> This saves me 20 minutes a day being able to shave on my way to work.</li>
            <li> I collect compact automatic razors, both antique and modern, and this is a great product for someone who does not have a beard or mustache-- with a trimmer, I would give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be able to trim your sideburns, so</li>
            <li> But the design was so elegant that I&#x27;ve kept buying Norelco products ever since.  </li>
            <li> It was okay.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my partner and he really pleased.</li>
            <li> Norelco has been in our household for many, many years.</li>
            <li> : well made, works well, comfortable, blades are really easy to clean (no tools required), compact, good battery life (</li>
            <li> My brother says it does a good job, but he liked his old one better.</li>
            <li> I thought, from the great reviews, that it would work well for all purposes, but it clearly doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Looking for a replacement, I first looked at the admittedly very elegant, smallest of Panasonic&#x27;s shavers.</li>
            <li> The thing is reliable and I dont take the greatest care (field use in Afghanistan among other places)</li>
            <li> It has two rotary heads, can easily be cleaned by blowing it out, or using the supplied brush.</li>
            <li> Cleaning of heads is easy.  </li>
            <li> but this is more than adequate.</li>
            <li> I have have used this great little shaver and its predecessor for many, many years.</li>
            <li> The plastic cover/protector snaps over the heads too lightly and can come off in your travel bag.</li>
            <li> It spoils the otherwise fabulous ergonomic design.</li>
            <li> Also, light-weight, easy to clean, and although made of plastic, a quality precision assembly.    </li>
            <li> It is important that you practice this product for some time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s greatest virtue is that unlike some single-foil razors (like the Braun M60) it does not miss hairs, so you won&#x27;t have a few stray hairs growing</li>
            <li> 1)Its not as comfortable to use</li>
            <li> Both are important for travel gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Battery life seems good so far.  </li>
            <li> This latest version is very efficient, and just as elegant.  </li>
            <li> Batteries make this excellent because of no or less cords in the bathroom!</li>
            <li> Thanks !!!</li>
            <li> It is great for a full shave or a last minute touch up.  </li>
            <li> This [type of] razor only works if you are getting clean-shaven every day; in that case, it does work quickly, and gives you a very nice, smooth, close shave.      </li>
            <li> After receiving it from Amazon, I can now say, I was very right.</li>
            <li> A pleasant surprise, REALLY quiet.</li>
            <li> The on off switch should be relocated to the bottom or provided with a more positive stop.  </li>
            <li> My only niggle is I&#x27;d like a more secure fitting travel cap, or maybe a pouch, but the shaver itself is fine.</li>
            <li> True.. this razor does not shave as close as a blade shaver</li>
            <li> I now have this shaver for a back up or for traveling purpose, It has good power for a battery run shaver.</li>
            <li> It shaves as close as my full size Norelco.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is good and the heads are standard Norelco parts sold just about anywhere in the world.</li>
            <li> figure this is only good for four or five days on the road.  </li>
            <li> The switch locks in the off position, so it won&#x27;t turn on your luggage and freak out the TSA at the airport, and it comes with a nice soft case.  </li>
            <li> I dont use it everyday-mostly in the field or for a quick \\&quot;car\\&quot; shave.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Norelco HQ40/33 Shave on the Go Battery Razor for two reasons: as a quick way to address 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and to use while traveling.   </li>
            <li> Although the HQ40/33 doesn&#x27;t have a large coverage area, it nonetheless works fine for what I need.  </li>
            <li> this is a great little shaver for the price.  </li>
            <li> Great little razor for the travel bag.  </li>
            <li> Great little shaver.  </li>
            <li> well worth the price to</li>
            <li> This inconvenience is worth it because there is no cord or</li>
            <li> We do not give it 5 STARS, only because it does not come with an effective protector cap for the \\&quot;on/ off\\&quot; switch and for the shave-head</li>
            <li> It is also a good idea if you wet your face with water just before 5 minutes</li>
            <li> Of course it&#x27;s not as nice and ergonomic as the larger 3-head \\&quot;pro\\&quot; shavers</li>
            <li> I would say that one is slightly better for feel and finished appearance of the shave but neither is anywhere near comparable to the full-size Norelcos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> make sure you keep it clean and use hair clipper oil such as Wahl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for 50 years and hoped this little one would be as good as their full size versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope.</li>
            <li> And right again about the cover.</li>
            <li> If you want a small razor for trips under 5 days, and you don&#x27;t have a beard or mustache, this is the best unit I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> It was to upgrade my old Norelco and give me a battery option with it; however, my old Norelco did a better job and not as noisy!</li>
            <li> The little $20 Philips gives a great, close shave in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
            <li> Its performance was surprisingly good -- has a good shave, is quiet, was kind to my face, contains the shaved hairs, cleans easily with a toothbrush and occasional disinfectant, and survived several hard re-packings and jostling without problems.  </li>
            <li> It is too easy to accidentally turn off the razor while shaving, which frequently happens or to accidentally turn on the razor while traveling, which has not yet happened.  </li>
            <li> It gives a pretty good shave, obviously not as good as a blade, but definitely good enough for business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> Looks like the only way for my husband is to spend more on an upgraded model.</li>
            <li> The latest PocketGo P-70 isn&#x27;t bad--it actually might do my neck a tiny bit better than my Pulsonic--</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described, and exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for travel since it&#x27;s light, gives a great shave and you can just pop in new batteries when it&#x27;s dead without having to wait for a charge!</li>
            <li> I dropped my corded shaver a while back and needed a replacement head and could only find the blades, the price of this shaver was less than the blades, plus the head fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> It gives a very close shave-- not as close as you&#x27;d get with some modern $145 three-head high-tech razor, but quite adequate for a 10-hour work day.  </li>
            <li> liked the other one, and this one I can just swap out</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much hopeless.    </li>
            <li> Most importantly, it does not slow down on the neck and takes care of my multidirectional neck hairs with ease.  </li>
            <li> It runs for a long time on alkaline batteries and is handy and compact enough to store anywhere for a quick touch-up.  </li>
            <li> Unlike grand pianos, they&#x27;re all small and fit into a corner of a bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> : none I can think of really - my previous model also came with a sideburn trimmer which would be nice addition</li>
            <li> it gives a pretty decent shave, I kept it in the car</li>
            <li> this one works just as good if not better than the high end ones.</li>
            <li> It takes a bit longer than my 120 volt powered triple header to shave, but not by much.  </li>
            <li> That shaver had 3 batteries and lasted much longer.  </li>
            <li> Many remote places do not have 24-hour electrical power (e.g. in Africa, Iraq, while hiking and boating).</li>
            <li> This shaver gets the job done very well.  </li>
            <li> I tried it for ~ 2 years and well, it takes as much time as shaving and never gives the close shave you get with a razor.</li>
            <li> He really likes it and uses it.  </li>
            <li> Lack of a fold-out trimmer is a reasonable compromise for compactness.</li>
            <li> I miss having a trimmer, but other than that it works as good as my big razor.  </li>
            <li> It gets surprisingly good power from the batteries, and it is very small and lightweight.</li>
            <li> I can get a decent shave without much problem.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of the HQ40 and highly recommend it as a small, light, travel version of your home Norelco.  </li>
            <li> The fact that the unit is small and doesn&#x27;t require any wiring or charging apparatus will come in handy as well.</li>
            <li> This one shaves faster and leaves my skin smoother (perhaps by the fact my previous was a foil and this one is a rotary, which in my opinion is much better).    </li>
            <li> This is a clever twist on the age-old Norelco electric shaver design.  </li>
            <li> But let&#x27;s get to the main point:  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a norelco nicad replacement for an older one&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It cuts decent</li>
            <li> Again, this Philips-Norelco razor would definitely work better for a daily shave, but that&#x27;s not what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Since my last trip, I&#x27;ve started using the HQ40 at home on occasion, since I&#x27;m starting to think it gives me a better shave than my pricey Pulsonic.    </li>
            <li> The shave is smooth, quiet, and makes no difference if you&#x27;re removing a 5-o&#x27;clock shadow or a two week old beard.</li>
            <li> And because it is so light, I don&#x27;t loose any shaving time.</li>
            <li> I guess you get what you pay for, and this just wasn&#x27;t worth the money, or the time it took to get it or send it back.</li>
            <li> It used four AA batteries that looked a lot like the new HQ40, except was more square and probably four times as heavy.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take long to see how quickly and painlessly my Dad shaved</li>
            <li> I would say the finished appearance is good enough for casual tourism but not good enough for business travel where you want to look your best.</li>
            <li> The fact that this shaver has two instead of the usual three heads should be no deterrent; this razor is really about as fast as the others, is light, portable, and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> They shoould last for 10 or 15 shaves, then be replaced or recharged; I use a charger that can bring them back up almost to original level.</li>
            <li> This is a complete ripoff!</li>
            <li> The only thing I withhold the fifth star for is the lack of a trimmer to clean up the side burns, or to nip off the occasional missed whisker.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought I would just purchase the new smaller and lighter Norelco GyroFlex to replace my old floating head version, but didn&#x27;t want to give up the convenience of battery power.  </li>
            <li> At this price, I only brought one for the car I most often drive, and use old fashion disposable shaver instead at other locations.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much experience with electrical razors, actually this is my second one and first rotary.  </li>
            <li> The whole new travel razor was only $14.99 at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been using electric for many years and was torn (sometimes literally) between them; they are all quite noisy and could disturb a sleeper nearby, but this little Norelco has a very low-level hum and produces minimal vibration.</li>
            <li> While it takes a little longer to shave compared to the triple header, it does a decent job and the batteries last for a couple weeks easily.</li>
            <li> I use it when I travel and so far I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> it has to be about 7yrs old now</li>
            <li> Then I looked on eBay to see if I could find the old battery powered Norelco</li>
            <li> As a bonus it is easier to clean with the little brush they give you than my PocketGo is.</li>
            <li> This was for my husband who used the shaver, and after 15 minutes couldn&#x27;t get a decent shave, and had to stop because his face got red from the heat of the product.    </li>
            <li> But priced too high or else I would buy some for gifts to all the male in my family.</li>
            <li> I have used the Braun 370 as my travel razor for the last ten or fifteen years, because it is small and light, is battery powered and generally shaves pretty well.  </li>
            <li> The neck beard is what finally drove me to look for a new travel razor.  </li>
            <li> I took one like it to Europe on a month tour and shaved every day for the month and used the same two AA batteries the complete time.</li>
            <li> If I just place it over my skin then it barely does it&#x27;s work.  </li>
            <li> With savings from odd jobs, I bought my first, a two header battery powered Norelco.  </li>
            <li> It was very durable, like all Norelco razors, and I used it as my only razor through high school, through college almost to a PhD and for a few years in between.  </li>
            <li> you are on a budget or have light facial hair, you might consider this as an everyday shaver, although it&#x27;s a dry shave</li>
            <li> I regularly use a Norelco/Philips floating head, three cutting head re-chargeable electric shaver at home, and assumed that this &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; battery razor would be be a good choice for taking on vacation; I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To be comprehensive, here are my less positive observations.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it, and it is exactly the same shaver as the PQ208/40 (which I also have) that costs $10 less.</li>
            <li> next time i&#x27;ll avoid these non-amazon suppliers they do not hold to any apparent standards.  </li>
            <li> some  of the high end make my face brake out or give me razor burn, but this  does not do any of those things and the other ones are heaver &amp; bulkier &amp; this one is none of those things.  </li>
            <li> With the Face Saver the shave is much closer with less passes.</li>
            <li> Some adaptors (UK, China, Europe, Australia) are MUCH bulkier than two small AAs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, works well, and is very compact.</li>
            <li> the charge hold plenty long enough.  </li>
            <li> Once upon a time, Norelco offered a tiny razor that ran on two AA batteries, but long before the Lift-And-Cut technology improved the performance.  </li>
            <li> And if you&#x27;ve gone a few days without shaving (for a normal person; or a week, for me) and you try to use this thing, it&#x27;s hopeless.  </li>
            <li> If your face is soft or your beard lays down you need to use Remington Face Saver before shaving.</li>
            <li> this product cost nearly half as much to ship as it cost, and i supposed it would come regally packaged, however, it was sent in a box ten times too large for it with a loose sheet of bubble wrap thrown inside, that&#x27;s not what i expect for $12 shipping expense, a total rip-off,</li>
            <li> Then, after a couple of days of use, I find a few hairs which I&#x27;ve missed on previous shaves, and can&#x27;t do much about, until they grow large enough to be cut with small scissors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first began shaving, following my older brother&#x27;s footsteps, using a Gillette safety razor, brush applied shaving foam and painfully applied Old Spice aftershave.  </li>
            <li> so long you can&#x27;t cut them on a trip longer than a day or two.  </li>
            <li> The product includes 2 AA batteries which last long enough, since then I use 2 rechargable ones and it takes quite some time to get them discharged unlike my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> However, the razor was less expensive when I purchased it - more like $25.</li>
            <li> Also, the Braun PocketGo can be used wet, where this Philips Norelco is dry use only.</li>
            <li> This keeps the blades sharp and they will last longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you want to shave and let it dry by it self.</li>
            <li> Still in all, I have not found a small battery-operated shaver that shaves nearly as well.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised with the shaving results from this small shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to take a trip to Europe, and the fact that the unit is small and uses AA batteries I&#x27;m expecting will make it be quite functional for traveling in areas with different electrical outlets since you simply don&#x27;t have to use those outlets.  </li>
            <li> There should be groves in the casing for the heads to make it easier to grip when tapping to empty shavings.  </li>
            <li> (It gets wet quite a bit).</li>
            <li> I usually wet shave</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exceptionally fast, and you have to cover the same area several times, but that&#x27;s typical of small razors, from 1952 wind-ups to battery units like these.  </li>
            <li> Positively, no built-in chargers for me.  </li>
            <li> For any Norelco user, and all the other shavers who should be, this is the travel razor for you.  </li>
            <li> That is when I first saw the HQ40 and didn&#x27;t see how I could go wrong.  </li>
            <li> The other commenters are correct when talking about the placement of the on/off switch.</li>
            <li> I have three different battery-operated Braun travel shavers that were made over the last 15-20 years, but I&#x27;m not completely happy with any of them.</li>
            <li> This shaver is either too rough on the skin or not effective enough.  </li>
            <li> I truly dislike conventional blade shaving</li>
            <li> When it finally got dull, I tried to get replacement heads.  </li>
            <li> Or at least buy an extra one for a car</li>
            <li> Lack of third head makes it a slow job though.</li>
            <li> had that was slowing down, not holding the charge so well,</li>
            <li> Not convincing: loud, heavy, slow, and it hurt my skin.    </li>
            <li> I previously used a cheapo $15 Remington flat-edged buzzer (like they use for haircuts, but travel-size: half-width, and</li>
            <li> and the shaver wasn&#x27;t particularly efficient, but then my beard wasn&#x27;t particularly difficult either.  </li>
            <li> This little shaver is the closest to a blade shaver --</li>
            <li> That was the review, but here is a little about why I bothered to review the HQ40.</li>
            <li> This little Norelco HQ40/33 works off battery like a charm.</li>
            <li> If I put a little pressure on it then it irritates my skin.  </li>
            <li> But blades were ineffective on what little stubble I have.  </li>
            <li> However, my beard grows very slowly, and I only have to shave once a week or so</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a very thick beard but just enough to go from chin to each sideburn and some moustache.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I saw this Philips Norelco HQ40 battery shaver on Amazon and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> After 1 year, it just dead.</li>
            <li> when it starts to slow down [ losing the charge ]&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li> so the Braun Pulsonic usually stays at home.</li>
            <li> no more shaving while taking a shower or stuff like that (on the pool if you&#x27;re into that).</li>
            <li> As long as you are not thinking it will be equal to a $100 razor you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably shaved at least 15 times with it</li>
            <li> It was too late to return it to Amazon, so it&#x27;s collecting dust in a drawer somewhere.</li>
            <li> Not good for me.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I used this Philips Norelco HQ40/33, it really didn&#x27;t work for me...</li>
            <li> Wife bought me a $100.00 plus Gillete that I couldn&#x27;t believe the noise and poor shave.</li>
            <li> the shaver was a gift, hope it wasn&#x27;t damaged by the poor and over-priced shipping.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> so it is nearly useless.</li>

            <li> This is a clever twist on the age-old Norelco electric shaver design.  It uses 2 AA batteries which are in a compartment that won&#x27;t accidentally open.  And the switch has a lock on it to keep it from turning on accidentally.  These are the two failings of most battery-powered shavers.    For occasional use (I carry mine in my truck and use it once or twice a week) this is a great little shaver for the price.  No, it doesn&#x27;t work as well as my big Norelco, but it doesn&#x27;t cost $60 and require an electrical outlet, either.</li>
            <li> i like it a lot for the price it is one of the best shavers i ever used &amp; well worth the price to i have way more costly shavers &amp; this one works just as good if not better than the high end ones. some  of the high end make my face brake out or give me razor burn, but this  does not do any of those things and the other ones are heaver &amp; bulkier &amp; this one is none of those things.  all  around its a real good shaver..............</li>
            <li> True.. this razor does not shave as close as a blade shaver but it does work. I use it when I travel and so far I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> This travel shaver does an excellent job of shaving.  The only thing I withhold the fifth star for is the lack of a trimmer to clean up the side burns, or to nip off the occasional missed whisker.</li>
            <li> I have a collection of unwanted electric (and one windup) shavers. Unlike grand pianos, they&#x27;re all small and fit into a corner of a bathroom cabinet.I have been using electric for many years and was torn (sometimes literally) between them; they are all quite noisy and could disturb a sleeper nearby, but this little Norelco has a very low-level hum and produces minimal vibration. But let&#x27;s get to the main point:  This little shaver is the closest to a blade shaver -- no, it&#x27;s not as good, but it&#x27;s a close rival. I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months now. It has two rotary heads, can easily be cleaned by blowing it out, or using the supplied brush. The thing runs on 2 alkali AAA&#x27;s supplied. They shoould last for 10 or 15 shaves, then be replaced or recharged; I use a charger that can bring them back up almost to original level. This inconvenience is worth it because there is no cord or bathroom-based charger being kept plugged in.  The fact that this shaver has two instead of the usual three heads should be no deterrent; this razor is really about as fast as the others, is light, portable, and inexpensive. If you want a trouble-free, inexpensive way to shave, avoid the high-end units; I&#x27;ve seen the reviews. I bought this thing for about $20!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a norelco nicad replacement for an older one&lt;br /&gt;I had that was slowing down, not holding the charge so well, when I&lt;br /&gt;spotted this thing, [ I can&#x27;t remember where I seen it ]&lt;br /&gt;and after giving it a moment or so, I said what the heck&lt;br /&gt;I liked the other one, and this one I can just swap out&lt;br /&gt;rechargeables when it starts to slow down [ losing the charge ]&lt;br /&gt;Well it gives a pretty decent shave, I kept it in the car so&lt;br /&gt;I could shave on the way to work when necessary.&lt;br /&gt;I switched back n forth between a shick slim-twin and the norelco&lt;br /&gt;and it has to be about 7yrs old now and the heads are still cutting.&lt;br /&gt;I think I paid 35 dollars for it back then.&lt;br /&gt;I never regretted getting this, and from the reviews on other&lt;br /&gt;pricier shavers, this one is a bargain. It cuts decent&lt;br /&gt;and keeps running! What more can one ask for!?</li>
            <li> October 2, 2011: The Norelco HQ40 shaves fantastically.  It takes a bit longer than my 120 volt powered triple header to shave, but not by much.  Most importantly, it does not slow down on the neck and takes care of my multidirectional neck hairs with ease.  I am a huge fan of the HQ40 and highly recommend it as a small, light, travel version of your home Norelco.  To be comprehensive, here are my less positive observations.  The plastic cover/protector snaps over the heads too lightly and can come off in your travel bag. There should be groves in the casing for the heads to make it easier to grip when tapping to empty shavings.  The on off switch should be relocated to the bottom or provided with a more positive stop.  It is too easy to accidentally turn off the razor while shaving, which frequently happens or to accidentally turn on the razor while traveling, which has not yet happened.  For any Norelco user, and all the other shavers who should be, this is the travel razor for you.  That was the review, but here is a little about why I bothered to review the HQ40. My Norelco history starts almost 50 years ago, using my Dad&#x27;s Norelco, which was a battery powered, two head unit, attached by a coiled wire to a battery pack with a mirror on one side.  I first began shaving, following my older brother&#x27;s footsteps, using a Gillette safety razor, brush applied shaving foam and painfully applied Old Spice aftershave.  It didn&#x27;t take long to see how quickly and painlessly my Dad shaved and I asked to try his Norelco.  With savings from odd jobs, I bought my first, a two header battery powered Norelco.  It used four AA batteries that looked a lot like the new HQ40, except was more square and probably four times as heavy.  It was very durable, like all Norelco razors, and I used it as my only razor through high school, through college almost to a PhD and for a few years in between.  The Norelco HQ40 was purchased to replace a Braun 370, battery powered foil type travel razor.  I have used the Braun 370 as my travel razor for the last ten or fifteen years, because it is small and light, is battery powered and generally shaves pretty well.  It does not, however, shave the stubborn beard on my neck, which grows seemingly parallel to the skin from all directions.  Thank goodness the Braun has a pop up trimmer with which I can scrub it to stubble, so it can then be shaved.  The neck beard is what finally drove me to look for a new travel razor.  At first, I thought I would just purchase the new smaller and lighter Norelco GyroFlex to replace my old floating head version, but didn&#x27;t want to give up the convenience of battery power.  Then I looked on eBay to see if I could find the old battery powered Norelco I started out with all those years ago.  That is when I first saw the HQ40 and didn&#x27;t see how I could go wrong.  After receiving it from Amazon, I can now say, I was very right.</li>
            <li> This is a complete ripoff! I ordered it, and it is exactly the same shaver as the PQ208/40 (which I also have) that costs $10 less. Don&#x27;t fall for the hype; you get nothing more. That said, it is a great shaver - the best out there for all of you road warriors.(see my review for the PQ208/40).</li>
            <li> The shaver works great and is a bargain.  I miss having a trimmer, but other than that it works as good as my big razor.  I am ordering another one to leave at work.</li>
            <li> Great product. I had used many AA battery shavers and this one is by far the best. But priced too high or else I would buy some for gifts to all the male in my family. Or at least buy an extra one for a car I sometime drive and one at work. At this price, I only brought one for the car I most often drive, and use old fashion disposable shaver instead at other locations.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the job, very pleased with this, lightweight and the charge hold plenty long enough.  Batteries make this excellent because of no or less cords in the bathroom!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this after forgetting to bring my regular Norelco shaver on a trip.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything great, but after using this on a couple of trips I decided that I didn&#x27;t have to use this as a backup and now use it full time for travel.  It shaves almost as well as my 3 head Norelco 8240XL!  Highly recommend this for travel since it&#x27;s light, gives a great shave and you can just pop in new batteries when it&#x27;s dead without having to wait for a charge!</li>
            <li> This [type of] razor only works if you are getting clean-shaven every day; in that case, it does work quickly, and gives you a very nice, smooth, close shave.      However, my beard grows very slowly, and I only have to shave once a week or so (plus my wife likes some shadow).  And if you&#x27;ve gone a few days without shaving (for a normal person; or a week, for me) and you try to use this thing, it&#x27;s hopeless.  It snags constantly and the batteries don&#x27;t have enough power to get through it; you have to keep pulling it away and shaking it to restart it.  It&#x27;s pretty much hopeless.    I previously used a cheapo $15 Remington flat-edged buzzer (like they use for haircuts, but travel-size: half-width, and powered by two AAA&#x27;s) which worked infinitely better than this razor, for a weekly shave.  Again, this Philips-Norelco razor would definitely work better for a daily shave, but that&#x27;s not what I was looking for.  I thought, from the great reviews, that it would work well for all purposes, but it clearly doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I dropped my corded shaver a while back and needed a replacement head and could only find the blades, the price of this shaver was less than the blades, plus the head fit perfectly. I now have this shaver for a back up or for traveling purpose, It has good power for a battery run shaver. I am happy!</li>
            <li> I bought it for a trip to Europe because it runs on AA batteries. It gets surprisingly good power from the batteries, and it is very small and lightweight.</li>
            <li> I had great anticipation to receive this shaver given the good number of reviews. This was for my husband who used the shaver, and after 15 minutes couldn&#x27;t get a decent shave, and had to stop because his face got red from the heat of the product.    That notwithstanding the fact that it was rather plasticky flimsy, and he had some time getting the battery cover back on properly. I guess you get what you pay for, and this just wasn&#x27;t worth the money, or the time it took to get it or send it back. Looks like the only way for my husband is to spend more on an upgraded model.</li>
            <li> Wife bought me a $100.00 plus Gillete that I couldn&#x27;t believe the noise and poor shave. It was to upgrade my old Norelco and give me a battery option with it; however, my old Norelco did a better job and not as noisy! This little Norelco HQ40/33 works off battery like a charm. Love it!</li>
            <li> I keep it in my car glove box all the time.  Would never be without it.  It is great for a full shave or a last minute touch up.  I took one like it to Europe on a month tour and shaved every day for the month and used the same two AA batteries the complete time. It was stolen from my car one night when I did oot lock my car.  I instantly bought another.    Bud</li>
            <li> I have used this model for several years and wanted to throw my 10 cents in:&lt;br /&gt;1- If your face is soft or your beard lays down you need to use Remington Face Saver before shaving. The powder stick gets your hair to stick up and covers the oil in your skin. Believe me I cant even use an electric without it-I just cut up my face.&lt;br /&gt;2- make sure you keep it clean and use hair clipper oil such as Wahl. This keeps the blades sharp and they will last longer.&lt;br /&gt;3- I put in Lithium photo batteries- they last a Loooonnnng time. I dont use it everyday-mostly in the field or for a quick \\&quot;car\\&quot; shave. These batteries have great shelf life in or out of the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the money you cant beat this razor. With the Face Saver the shave is much closer with less passes. I can get a decent shave without much problem. The thing is reliable and I dont take the greatest care (field use in Afghanistan among other places) I just throw it in my kit and dont worry (It gets wet quite a bit). As long as you are not thinking it will be equal to a $100 razor you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great little razor for the travel bag.  Seems to give a close shave.  Battery life seems good so far.  One might want to keep an extra set of batteries just in case.  Cleaning of heads is easy.  For the money a great item for the person on the go.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Norelco HQ40/33 Shave on the Go Battery Razor for two reasons: as a quick way to address 5 o&#x27;clock shadow and to use while traveling.   Although the HQ40/33 doesn&#x27;t have a large coverage area, it nonetheless works fine for what I need.  I&#x27;m about to take a trip to Europe, and the fact that the unit is small and uses AA batteries I&#x27;m expecting will make it be quite functional for traveling in areas with different electrical outlets since you simply don&#x27;t have to use those outlets.  The fact that the unit is small and doesn&#x27;t require any wiring or charging apparatus will come in handy as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver as a replacement for a Norelco battery operated shaver purchased by my brother years ago.  That shaver had 3 batteries and lasted much longer.  Also, the shaver is much smaller than I thought it would be.  My brother says it does a good job, but he liked his old one better.</li>
            <li> I started using the \\&quot;travel razor\\&quot; on a trip and never stopped.  It worked significantly better than the 3 headed expensive razor.  When it finally got dull, I tried to get replacement heads.  It turns out the price of replacement heads was $28 - $32.  The whole new travel razor was only $14.99 at Amazon. Go figure.</li>
            <li> The other commenters are correct when talking about the placement of the on/off switch. I have yet to shave without accidentally turning it off two or three times. One must learn to hold it like you hold a beer can. It spoils the otherwise fabulous ergonomic design. And right again about the cover. It pops off with the slightest push. It often comes off in my shave kit so it is nearly useless. Still in all, I have not found a small battery-operated shaver that shaves nearly as well.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised with the shaving results from this small shaver. And because it is so light, I don&#x27;t loose any shaving time.</li>
            <li> Great little shaver.  No problems</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for about 20 years, and currently use a Series 7 Pulsonic.  I travel quite a bit for work, and I like to pack as lightly as possible so the Braun Pulsonic usually stays at home. I have three different battery-operated Braun travel shavers that were made over the last 15-20 years, but I&#x27;m not completely happy with any of them. The latest PocketGo P-70 isn&#x27;t bad--it actually might do my neck a tiny bit better than my Pulsonic--but I don&#x27;t like using it for a full shave because it takes forever and doesn&#x27;t do a very good job on my cheeks.     A few months ago I saw this Philips Norelco HQ40 battery shaver on Amazon and decided to give it a try. Man, I&#x27;m impressed! The little $20 Philips gives a great, close shave in a reasonable amount of time. As a bonus it is easier to clean with the little brush they give you than my PocketGo is. Since my last trip, I&#x27;ve started using the HQ40 at home on occasion, since I&#x27;m starting to think it gives me a better shave than my pricey Pulsonic.    My only niggle is I&#x27;d like a more secure fitting travel cap, or maybe a pouch, but the shaver itself is fine. Also, the Braun PocketGo can be used wet, where this Philips Norelco is dry use only. Battery life has been very good. I&#x27;ve probably shaved at least 15 times with it and I&#x27;m still using the set of Philips alkaline AAs that came with it.    Thanks Philips, I&#x27;m very happy with my HQ40!</li>
            <li> Works better than Remington MSC-140 Men&#x27;s Titanium Battery Operated Foil Travel Shaver that I also bought. Lack of third head makes it a slow job though.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great!  It shaves as close as my full size Norelco.  I also have a Remington travel razor that will not touch a two day beard.  You could trim your lawn with this Norelco!</li>
            <li> Braun&#x27;s Marketing have discontinued the \\&quot;370\\&quot; travel shaver. Looking for a replacement, I first looked at the admittedly very elegant, smallest of Panasonic&#x27;s shavers. Not convincing: loud, heavy, slow, and it hurt my skin.    Looking further, we discovered the Philips HQ40/ 33. A pleasant surprise, REALLY quiet. So quiet in fact that initially I thought it did not shave. Also, light-weight, easy to clean, and although made of plastic, a quality precision assembly.    We do not give it 5 STARS, only because it does not come with an effective protector cap for the \\&quot;on/ off\\&quot; switch and for the shave-head: I am paranoid it would switch itself \\&quot;on\\&quot; in the travel bag.    ---  P.S. I prefer a TRAVEL shaver to use Alkaline (or rechargeable NiMH) AAs. Positively, no built-in chargers for me.  Concerns, does the shaver re-charge from a 110/ 120V AND a 220/ 240V outlet? (e.g. Ireland, Europe, China, parts of Japan, Australia) Some adaptors (UK, China, Europe, Australia) are MUCH bulkier than two small AAs. Many remote places do not have 24-hour electrical power (e.g. in Africa, Iraq, while hiking and boating).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a very thick beard but just enough to go from chin to each sideburn and some moustache. I don&#x27;t have much experience with electrical razors, actually this is my second one and first rotary.  So take that into account while reading this review.     I use a non-electric razor once a week and this shaver the rest of the week. This shaver gets the job done very well.  I used a travel foil-shaver before and wasn&#x27;t as good as this. This one shaves faster and leaves my skin smoother (perhaps by the fact my previous was a foil and this one is a rotary, which in my opinion is much better).    The one thing I don&#x27;t like about this model is that you can&#x27;t use it under water, so ... no more shaving while taking a shower or stuff like that (on the pool if you&#x27;re into that). Still I&#x27;ll definitely pick the Phillips Norelco HQ40/33.    The product includes 2 AA batteries which last long enough, since then I use 2 rechargable ones and it takes quite some time to get them discharged unlike my previous shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver is either too rough on the skin or not effective enough.  If I just place it over my skin then it barely does it&#x27;s work.  If I put a little pressure on it then it irritates my skin.  Not good for me.  Sending it back.</li>
            <li> Either this shaver or a Chinese knock-off called the Flyco (Both sold by Amazon) would be my choice for world&#x27;s best battery shaver. The shave is smooth, quiet, and makes no difference if you&#x27;re removing a 5-o&#x27;clock shadow or a two week old beard. Practically NO skin irritation from this type of shaver head either. Battery life is good and the heads are standard Norelco parts sold just about anywhere in the world. I love this shaver!</li>
            <li> I found the product very good for me. However, I don&#x27;t have plenty of hair on my face but still I think that this product will be good for every one. It is important that you practice this product for some time. It is also a good idea if you wet your face with water just before 5 minutes you want to shave and let it dry by it self.</li>
            <li> I regularly use a Norelco/Philips floating head, three cutting head re-chargeable electric shaver at home, and assumed that this &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; battery razor would be be a good choice for taking on vacation; I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the unit does fit nicely into my hand and palm, it does not cut well, in my opinion. Perhaps it&#x27;s the non-floating  head, or lack of third cutter head, but I find it takes several passes to get a cut which even gets close to what I get with my 3-cutter head home system.  Then, after a couple of days of use, I find a few hairs which I&#x27;ve missed on previous shaves, and can&#x27;t do much about, until they grow large enough to be cut with small scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it after having good success with a 3-shaving head system, but as a travel razor it does not meet my minimum requirements.  It was too late to return it to Amazon, so it&#x27;s collecting dust in a drawer somewhere.</li>
            <li> great product, much better than the Norelco Shaver I&#x27;ve had for 7 years. This saves me 20 minutes a day being able to shave on my way to work.</li>
            <li> After 1 year, it just dead. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually wet shave but I also carry this when traveling and use it when in a rush sometimes. I have have used this great little shaver and its predecessor for many, many years. It gives a pretty good shave, obviously not as good as a blade, but definitely good enough for business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: well made, works well, comfortable, blades are really easy to clean (no tools required), compact, good battery life (2 x AAs)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none I can think of really - my previous model also came with a sideburn trimmer which would be nice addition (but I am being picky here!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: a good buy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, works well, and is very compact. Of course it&#x27;s not as nice and ergonomic as the larger 3-head \\&quot;pro\\&quot; shavers but this is more than adequate. I truly dislike conventional blade shaving so I had to get another electric shaver!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I used this Philips Norelco HQ40/33, it really didn&#x27;t work for me...&lt;br /&gt;It would be more expensive to send this item back, so instead I gave it away to the Goodwill Store (hope someone else will benefit from it).</li>
            <li> I tried it for ~ 2 years and well, it takes as much time as shaving and never gives the close shave you get with a razor. I stopped working so I didn&#x27;t replace it.</li>
            <li> I collect compact automatic razors, both antique and modern, and this is a great product for someone who does not have a beard or mustache-- with a trimmer, I would give it 5 stars.  It gives a very close shave-- not as close as you&#x27;d get with some modern $145 three-head high-tech razor, but quite adequate for a 10-hour work day.  It&#x27;s not exceptionally fast, and you have to cover the same area several times, but that&#x27;s typical of small razors, from 1952 wind-ups to battery units like these.  You won&#x27;t be able to trim your sideburns, so figure this is only good for four or five days on the road.  It&#x27;s greatest virtue is that unlike some single-foil razors (like the Braun M60) it does not miss hairs, so you won&#x27;t have a few stray hairs growing so long you can&#x27;t cut them on a trip longer than a day or two.  The switch locks in the off position, so it won&#x27;t turn on your luggage and freak out the TSA at the airport, and it comes with a nice soft case.  If you want a small razor for trips under 5 days, and you don&#x27;t have a beard or mustache, this is the best unit I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> My husband said it works surprisingly well.  Good to take on travel.  He really likes it and uses it.  Thanks !!!</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, Norelco offered a tiny razor that ran on two AA batteries, but long before the Lift-And-Cut technology improved the performance.  I&#x27;d just begun to shave, which makes it sometime around 1950 or so (well, I did say &#x27;once upon a time&#x27;) and the shaver wasn&#x27;t particularly efficient, but then my beard wasn&#x27;t particularly difficult either.  But the design was so elegant that I&#x27;ve kept buying Norelco products ever since.  This latest version is very efficient, and just as elegant.  It runs for a long time on alkaline batteries and is handy and compact enough to store anywhere for a quick touch-up.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Great price for a great shave every time.  Boyfriend uses it at home and also travels with it.  Like that it is battery operated so that it does not take up counter space for recharging.</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift. It came as advertised. he used it and was happy with it. It was okay.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my partner and he really pleased. I got one for his place and one for mine.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described, and exactly what I wanted.  A bonus was the zippered carrying case, which is perfectly fitted .</li>
            <li> I use this razor for travel since it is easier than carrying the charging cord for my regular, heavier Norelco rotary razor. While it takes a little longer to shave compared to the triple header, it does a decent job and the batteries last for a couple weeks easily. However, the razor was less expensive when I purchased it - more like $25.</li>
            <li> this product cost nearly half as much to ship as it cost, and i supposed it would come regally packaged, however, it was sent in a box ten times too large for it with a loose sheet of bubble wrap thrown inside, that&#x27;s not what i expect for $12 shipping expense, a total rip-off, next time i&#x27;ll avoid these non-amazon suppliers they do not hold to any apparent standards.  the shaver was a gift, hope it wasn&#x27;t damaged by the poor and over-priced shipping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco shavers for 50 years and hoped this little one would be as good as their full size versions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nope. 1)Its not as comfortable to use, it can tug and scrape. 2)It doesn&#x27;t shave as close. I would say the finished appearance is good enough for casual tourism but not good enough for business travel where you want to look your best. Lack of a fold-out trimmer is a reasonable compromise for compactness. I keep a lightweight disposable razor in my shaving kit to trim sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good points of this model are its compactness and amazing battery life. Both are important for travel gear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a while I bought the similar Remington rechargeable travel shaver. I would say that one is slightly better for feel and finished appearance of the shave but neither is anywhere near comparable to the full-size Norelcos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: I would like to see a response or another review here that points out a preferable alternative. I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect travel shaver.</li>
            <li> Sorry, folks.  Razor was nicely made.  But blades were ineffective on what little stubble I have.  It looks like I need to buy replacement heads.  Not happy.</li>
            <li> My regular shaver is too bulky and delicate-looking for extended travel, so I took the HQ40 on a six-week trip. Its performance was surprisingly good -- has a good shave, is quiet, was kind to my face, contains the shaved hairs, cleans easily with a toothbrush and occasional disinfectant, and survived several hard re-packings and jostling without problems.  After six weeks it&#x27;s on the same set of lithium AA&#x27;s (you can also use rechargeable AA&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are on a budget or have light facial hair, you might consider this as an everyday shaver, although it&#x27;s a dry shave only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only qualms are the lack of a travel shut-off switch (I&#x27;d suggest packing with the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch protected or putting some paper between the battery contacts so the power switch won&#x27;t accidentally turn on), and the inability to trim sideburns.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something of quality to take with me on travels and this fits the bill.  No electricity needed.  Norelco has been in our household for many, many years.</li>
