            <li>It is so kind of them.</li>
            <li>The powder doesn&#x27;t dissolve easily in Rose Water or even bottled order.</li>

            <li>I surely shop from them again.</li>
            <li>would love to buy more, but I wanna find a cheaper route...</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product..</li>
            <li>I am from India and I can tell you there are much better sandalwood powders we get.</li>
            <li>Apply favorite moisturizer (mine is coconut oil).  </li>
            <li>so I will have to order more.</li>
            <li>Gave up antibiotics and working on keeping my skin healthy with ayurvedic remedies.</li>
            <li>the smell is nice and sweet like woman recomend</li>
            <li>It is much more grainy and doesn&#x27;t glide on skin smoothly like I am used to.</li>
            <li>Absolute staple to use for gorgeous skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVED this product so much that I immediately ordered more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>powder worked fine and would purchase again</li>
            <li>Even a pinch of it gives the pack an amazing fragrance, n it leaves your skin fresh and soft :)</li>
            <li>but when you wash it off your face it feels so soft and looks very nice and clear.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not for face.smell is bit ok but not as pure as what we get in India</li>
            <li>I use this mask at night and leave it on as long as I want, over an hour for sure, then I rinse it off with luke warm water.</li>
            <li>mix with rose water and few drops of lemon for amazing effect on face.</li>
            <li>Quick Deliverly....</li>
            <li>so next morning I wash my face with a gentle cleanser and result is amazing!</li>
            <li>I leave the mask on my face for 1 - 2 hours, twice a week; &amp; use warm water &amp; mild soap to remove the yellow stain out of my face.</li>
            <li>This works great in my natural facial products.</li>
            <li>Let dry (15-20 minutes) and then rinse with warm water then cool.  </li>
            <li>But can have other good uses.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing and it leaves my skin super soft like no other soap, exfoliator or store bought product has ever done.</li>
            <li>This was the first time I ordered sandalwood powder from this company.</li>
            <li>would recommend using licorice extract first for one week ....</li>
            <li>and it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>It did NOT smell anything like Pure Sandalwood Powder, as described by this seller.  </li>
            <li>The consistency was fine but the smell of the sandalwood powder was almost non existent, though this was the only item I have ordered from this company, I would not order it from them again.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering this again real soon.</li>
            <li>it doesnt really have much of a smell at all.</li>
            <li>I did not see much change in the look of my skin.</li>
            <li>This is nowhere close to the smell or quality of the real thing.</li>
            <li>This product arrived fast.</li>
            <li>Straight from India.</li>
            <li>For the quantity and price.....i feel there is no quality and did not meet my high expectations I had about this product.</li>
            <li>Highly disapointed.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for quality sandlewood powder.</li>
            <li>It calms down the inflammation significantly and evens out complection.</li>
            <li>Soft skin within 2 uses.</li>
            <li>So far I have used it 4 times and I have noticed&lt;br</li>
            <li>it stays put and doesn&#x27;t drip, no mess at all.</li>
            <li>This was supposed to take away facial discoloration, but I don&#x27;t think it really made a difference after several uses.</li>
            <li>It comes to a thick paste so when I aply it on clean face</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel very soft, however, I gave up using it after I used up the package because it was so messy to use; clumps would drop on the floor and it was hard to clean out of the sink.</li>

            <li> It brightens face right away, nothing significant irritation or painful sensation.</li>
            <li> My ayurvedic doctor&#x27;s concoctions are great but very expensive, so I decided to play with raw ingredients myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experiencing mild rosacea for the past few years.</li>
            <li> (careful with essential oils.)</li>
            <li> Powder is not soft.</li>
            <li> I wish I listened to the other reviewer who said the same thing.</li>
            <li> It gave my skin a natural glow and reduced the small pimples which occurs during the summer season.</li>
            <li> but I when tried it the second time i immediately saw and felt a difference on my OVER STUBBORN dark spot that I have been having problem with for 14 months&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I make a facial mask and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I mix half a tea spoon of Manuka honey, one third of sandalwood powder and a pinch of turmeric.</li>
            <li> Do this every other day .</li>
            <li> I mix with a little water, spread on face and let dry.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the price at all.</li>
            <li> using morning and evening and then apply sandalwood making a paste with water and put on dark spot ...leave on for 45 mins .</li>
            <li> Using it has cut down on my acne and has helped with my oily skin.  </li>
            <li> half of the power was all over the box</li>
            <li> I mix it with rosewater and apply it on my face &amp; neck everyday.</li>
            <li> I leave it on for a few hours&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> This morning when I woke up my acne was all dried up..</li>
            <li> Waste of time and Money.</li>
            <li> While the mixture really softens the acne scarred areas it is temporary and very difficult to mix.</li>
            <li> I think they have no more the small bags</li>
            <li> I have had acne for the past 5 years and bought everything on the market and nothing helped..</li>
            <li> Wasted 12 dollars!</li>
            <li> Delivery was a little slow but as advertised!</li>
            <li> looks weird dry</li>
            <li> It is very very expensive, the bag is tiny.</li>
            <li> Very small size for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> Its not Sandalwood powder, Its some shallow saw dust infused with aroma which fades away.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I lost the little zip lock bag</li>
            <li> Didnt do so much as a facial for me :(</li>
            <li> Apply thin layer to skin.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of using medicated creams everytime a pimple popped up.</li>
            <li> Too expensive) with yogurt, honey, oil or lemon juice.</li>
            <li> Even the charcoal heat failed to coax an aroma from this.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this had no fragrance at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is disappointing to find a product this spurious on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is definitely bad quality sandalwood powder.</li>
            <li> This was the worst Sandalwood I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This works great in my natural facial products. Plus my daughter loves it.  Will be ordering this again real soon.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. I mix it with rosewater and apply it on my face &amp; neck everyday. It gave my skin a natural glow and reduced the small pimples which occurs during the summer season. Daily use of it also makes skin evenly toned. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I really love this powder.  I make a facial mask and a little goes a long way. I mix with a couple drops of tea tree oil.  I have also used it mixing with just water.  I have definately noticed a difference in my skin.  Using it has cut down on my acne and has helped with my oily skin.  It has also brightened my skin.  I will definately continue to use this product!</li>
            <li> Great for face packs! Even a pinch of it gives the pack an amazing fragrance, n it leaves your skin fresh and soft :)</li>
            <li> Good smell! Didnt do so much as a facial for me :( But can have other good uses. :)</li>
            <li> Great for home maid facials. I mix with 1/4 tsp of turmeric some yogurt or milk to make a paste the can be spreed. Some times I add 2 or 3 drops of essential oil. (careful with essential oils.) Leaves your skin feeling and looking great</li>
            <li> I also add turmeric powder for better result. I leave the mask on my face for 1 - 2 hours, twice a week; &amp; use warm water &amp; mild soap to remove the yellow stain out of my face. Some people said you have to use the mask longer than just 15 - 30 minutes to make it work.</li>
            <li> I love this sandalwood powder. I used it in a facial &amp; it worked well &amp; who can resist the scent? It stays w/you.</li>
            <li> I used to have a sandalwood billet back home in India. Absolute staple to use for gorgeous skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sandalwood powder comes close. Loved it. Soft skin within 2 uses. mix with rose water and few drops of lemon for amazing effect on face.</li>
            <li> I use this as a facial mask.  I mix with a little water, spread on face and let dry.  I try to leave it on for an hour.  Great results!  You must try this!</li>
            <li> I heard about this type of powder on the Dr. Oz show and tried using it as a mask (mixed with water) as he recommended.  It made my skin feel very soft, however, I gave up using it after I used up the package because it was so messy to use; clumps would drop on the floor and it was hard to clean out of the sink.</li>
            <li> The bag of sandalwood powder opened inside the package. All of the content spilled out.</li>
            <li> i used this for soap making. it doesnt really have much of a smell at all. it does give the soap a textured feel though, for those of you who dont want \\&quot;too slippery\\&quot; soap. recipe turned out ok.</li>
            <li> This was the worst Sandalwood I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!!  It did NOT smell anything like Pure Sandalwood Powder, as described by this seller.  It honestly smelled like some king of acid and I&#x27;m supposed to put this on my face as a mask.</li>
            <li> I love this item i mix it with rose water glycerin and it does wonders for my skin. I wish they came together</li>
            <li> I use this as mask on my face I leave it on for a few hours&lt;br /&gt;on my day off. So far I have used it 4 times and I have noticed&lt;br /&gt;a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I did not see much change in the look of my skin. I am not a big fan of this product.</li>
            <li> Powder is not soft. It&#x27;s not for face.smell is bit ok but not as pure as what we get in India</li>
            <li> Delivery was a little slow but as advertised!</li>
            <li> I order 41 bags of 1/2 oz sandal powder because they were on sale and I love the sandal wood smell. However, they shipped 6 bags of 100g powder. I think they have no more the small bags but they still fulfill their order by replace them with different size. It is so kind of them. I surely shop from them again.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to take away facial discoloration, but I don&#x27;t think it really made a difference after several uses.</li>
            <li> It is very very expensive, the bag is tiny. I use it for DIY facial, mixing a quarter tea spoon (can&#x27; t use a lot! Too expensive) with yogurt, honey, oil or lemon juice. It brightens face right away, nothing significant irritation or painful sensation. It smells like just a wood bark.&lt;br /&gt;I would love to buy more, but I wanna find a cheaper route...</li>
            <li> pure sandlewood powder is a great product for holistic use.  I would truly recommend this product to others living holistic.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product...Quick Deliverly....I have had acne for the past 5 years and bought everything on the market and nothing helped..Someone told me about sandalwood so I decided to try it. I recieved it yesterday and I used it as a face mask last night. This morning when I woke up my acne was all dried up..I could not believe the results...I am so glad I found this product..I will order again and again...</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product.  Purchased it to make a lightening mask.  It works well.</li>
            <li> This is not sandalwood powder! It has a sawdust like smell and whatever it is, it is not sandalwood! The picture of the product which says &#x27;Ayurvedic Grade&#x27; and what I got are completely different. Wasted 12 dollars! Don&#x27;t buy from this seller!</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and it leaves my skin super soft like no other soap, exfoliator or store bought product has ever done.</li>
            <li> I am from India and I can tell you there are much better sandalwood powders we get. For the quantity and price.....i feel there is no quality and did not meet my high expectations I had about this product. Highly disapointed.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this product so much that I immediately ordered more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells amazering and does what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing. I would buy it again, I like to use it in making homemade beauty care items.</li>
            <li> Arrived within the scheduled time, was exactly what I was looking for and the price was excellent. I didn&#x27;t need a large amount so this was perfect. Thank you.</li>
            <li> great  price for quality  inscense .  perfecto forany and all rites  ,eg, that call for this  . recommend buying  your different resin&#x27;s if you are a praticing magus....</li>
            <li> Forgot what I purchased it for but I still have it if I ever need it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely bad quality sandalwood powder. I have been using it for years on my face when family brings it back from India. This is nowhere close to the smell or quality of the real thing. It is much more grainy and doesn&#x27;t glide on skin smoothly like I am used to. Will not be purchasing from this seller again. I wish I listened to the other reviewer who said the same thing. Not worth the price at all.</li>
            <li> I use this for my facial masks.  It is great quality. I would highly recommend this product if you are looking for quality sandlewood powder.</li>
            <li> While the mixture really softens the acne scarred areas it is temporary and very difficult to mix. The powder doesn&#x27;t dissolve easily in Rose Water or even bottled order.</li>
            <li> I loved this as a mask.  Just add water, rose water, cucumber water or milk to powder.  Apply thin layer to skin.  Let dry (15-20 minutes) and then rinse with warm water then cool.  Apply favorite moisturizer (mine is coconut oil).  This powder (as a mask) smooths, brightens, and gets rid of acne.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> I know what sandalwood smells like; what I received is NOT sandalwood. Even the charcoal heat failed to coax an aroma from this. It is nothing but sawdust with no fragrance whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;It is disappointing to find a product this spurious on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I ordered sandalwood powder from this company. The consistency was fine but the smell of the sandalwood powder was almost non existent, though this was the only item I have ordered from this company, I would not order it from them again.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work great. Unfortunately I lost the little zip lock bag it came in so I will have to order more.</li>
            <li> Makes me think what would I do without these.I was tired of using medicated creams everytime a pimple popped up.With the use of sandalwoodpowder I don&#x27;t have to use anything else.It dries up the acne so well.But it does take 1-2 days.</li>
            <li> This product arrived fast. I used this mixed with a bit of water on my face.&lt;br /&gt;It looks weird dry but when you wash it off your face it feels so soft and looks very nice and clear.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the fast shipping as well.</li>
            <li> I hesitate to buy this product but I when tried it the second time i immediately saw and felt a difference on my OVER STUBBORN dark spot that I have been having problem with for 14 months&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using licorice extract first for one week ....using morning and evening and then apply sandalwood making a paste with water and put on dark spot ...leave on for 45 mins . Do this every other day .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been experiencing mild rosacea for the past few years. Gave up antibiotics and working on keeping my skin healthy with ayurvedic remedies. My ayurvedic doctor&#x27;s concoctions are great but very expensive, so I decided to play with raw ingredients myself. I mix half a tea spoon of Manuka honey, one third of sandalwood powder and a pinch of turmeric. It comes to a thick paste so when I aply it on clean face it stays put and doesn&#x27;t drip, no mess at all. I use this mask at night and leave it on as long as I want, over an hour for sure, then I rinse it off with luke warm water. Turmeric stains a bit, so next morning I wash my face with a gentle cleanser and result is amazing! It calms down the inflammation significantly and evens out complection.</li>
            <li> Sorry, but this had no fragrance at all.  I got it to make my own sandalwood oil, but all that prep work produced nothing usable.</li>
            <li> half of the power was all over the box</li>
            <li> Very small size for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> in my opinion is very good  i use almost every day the smell is nice and sweet like woman recomend</li>
            <li> Straight from India. great buy</li>
            <li> Its not Sandalwood powder, Its some shallow saw dust infused with aroma which fades away. Also it took a month to receive this product. Waste of time and Money.</li>
            <li> I used it make a facial mask and it worked pretty well.  I used it as part of anAyurveda routine for skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this powder to use as an ingredient in a facial mask.  powder worked fine and would purchase again</li>
