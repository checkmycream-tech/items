            <li> My daughter has be looking for Elige which can not be purchased at Mary Kay because it was discontinued as this company loves to do.

My daughter was so happy that Amazon.com allows the story of the love of a sense to live on until the supply and demand runs dry. Thanks Amazon.com for your support!!</li>
