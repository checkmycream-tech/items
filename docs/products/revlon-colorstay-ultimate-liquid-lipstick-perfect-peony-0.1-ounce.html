            <li> Goes fast even applying only once a day.</li>
            <li> This product is long lasting and does not dry out my lips.....</li>
            <li> It is a one process application, not two, like some long lasting types</li>
            <li> Only downside that I find, is that there is not much product in the tube.  </li>
            <li> All day long, through 2 meals it stays on!  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry our your lips and it does stay on.</li>
            <li> Was really not</li>
            <li> It is getting harder to find in the stores</li>
            <li> The lipstick wears all day without touch ups but can dry a little so you may want a lip balm.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick but when I got my last order, this was an old thick and gooey lipstick~very disappointed!</li>
            <li> seems to be a little cakey</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not available in the stores anymore.  </li>
            <li> Just dab on a little vaseline - it will feel like all you have on your lips is the vaseline!  </li>
            <li> I ordered two and only rec&#x27;d one :-(&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the Peach lipstick though.</li>

            <li> I have this liquid lipstick in many colors and love its staying power.  All day long, through 2 meals it stays on!  Your lips will feel dry if you don&#x27;t put anything on top of it.  Just dab on a little vaseline - it will feel like all you have on your lips is the vaseline!  And underneath, the color still stays on.</li>
            <li> My friend has looked for this particular color for months.  It&#x27;s not available in the stores anymore.  When I gave her several tubes, she was ecstatic.  I can always depend on Amazon.com to carry hard-to-find items at a fair price.</li>
            <li> I love the revlon lip stains, they&#x27;re the best &amp; last all day long!</li>

            <li> I love this product.  Great service.</li>
            <li> This lipstick literally stays on ALL day when I apply it in the morning. Sometimes it stays until the next day. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Use it everyday, great lip color that last all day! I also use Cover Girl Outlast lip color. Both are great products I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have only put it on to see if I like the color...I haven&#x27;t put it on for the entire day so I couldn&#x27;t answer that questions, therefore it got 4*</li>
            <li> Once in a while a product lives up to it&#x27;s hype. This one does. It doesn&#x27;t dry our your lips and it does stay on.</li>
            <li> It stays on all day, but leaves a kind of cakey residue that&#x27;s hard to remove with just soap and water.</li>
