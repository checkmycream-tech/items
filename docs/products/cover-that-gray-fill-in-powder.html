    <ol>
            <li>wonderful option between coloring it...</li>
            <li>This product is awesome!</li>
            <li>this works the best.</li>
            <li>Excellent idea!</li>
            <li>You have to use a lot to get it to cover and it doesn&#x27;t look very good.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think it worked very good.</li>
            <li>That has very good reviews though it&#x27;s pricier.</li>
            <li>I was used to using Joan Rivers Great Hair Day</li>
            <li>It totally is a great product.</li>
            <li>I used it for a week or so, and it just didn&#x27;t go on or even stay on as well as Great Hair Day.  </li>
            <li>And this is a great price</li>
            <li>I love using this color on my eyebrows!!</li>
            <li>Companies have been caught paying people to write good reviews about their products.</li>
            <li>Overall,Claudia Steven&#x27;s hair powder is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay on as good as Joan Rivers.</li>
            <li>The colors are a good choice, though.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Joan Rivers product</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>a good product for the price, however the bristles on the brush keep falling out.</li>
            <li>(I am light-haired), but, it does a reasonably good job of masking your scalp shining through at people taller than you</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, couldn&#x27;t have worked better.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just amazing.</li>
            <li>Bet this is as good as the one Joan Rivers sells for more than twice the price.</li>
            <li>The color is much better than another kind I used to use.</li>
            <li>But this powder is good, I use a semi perm ash blonde hair color and this blends beautifully.</li>
            <li>Use it sparingly to start with then add more if you need to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I realized that it is better for covering gray roots.</li>
            <li>do like it, but I wish it came in more colors.</li>
            <li>But Style Edit is a magic in a bottle...</li>
            <li>The darker seems to be better for blondes with roots.</li>
            <li>and if I don&#x27;t love it, I will by the Joan River&#x27;s brand that I saw on Amazon.</li>
            <li>You have to use more of it.</li>
            <li>love it...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Much better product than Joan Rivers, at a lower cost and</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>more importantly ... available!</li>
            <li>I looked like I had dark roots - not an attractive look!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to give you a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>Never would have considered using it to fill in the slight thinning areas; it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li>Just a little covers great and lasts all day (even when I brush my hair).</li>
            <li>but as the years go by I&#x27;ve been finding that the grey along my partline was becoming prominent after just a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>Color WOW better</li>
            <li>Im not crazy about it.  </li>
            <li>The product description states &amp;#34;cover that gray&amp;#34; which one would assume it would be for root touch ups in between the salon visit, right?  </li>
            <li>If your scalp is white, the available lighter and darker colors blend really well on your scalp to provide the illusion of more hair.  </li>
            <li>It works a little better than most products out there, to cover thinning areas (mine is thinning from a drug I have to take, so I have tried a lot of these)</li>
            <li>The lighter color in the compact is for very light blonde hair.</li>
            <li>However, when applied only to the hair roots and not the scalp, it looks SO much better.</li>
            <li>It was labeled blonde but it was more brown.</li>
            <li>Wish I tried it about 2 years ago when I first started losing my hair.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really certain if this product would work for my needs.  </li>
            <li>certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>For this reason I really scrubbed that brush into the powder before applying and then I realized that it is nothing at all like eye shadow.</li>
            <li>It worked much better on the wet area.</li>
            <li>I really like this powder.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product, it cost about half the price of Joan Rivers Great Hair Day ( my usual product )</li>
            <li>This product really works great to cover bald spots, particularly if you have blonde to dark blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fifty year old woman with light to moderate hair loss, which is the reason for purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>I have a light reddish brown color, so medium brown is too dark and blonde way too light.</li>
            <li>I will use it a few more weeks</li>
            <li>It is a really small package, and most likely will go quickly.</li>
            <li>It is so natural appearing and lasts until I wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It was worth a try but not worth the money.</li>
            <li>This does the same job as the more expensive versions but has the advantage of having two colors in one package so you can mix the right color for your hair without having to buy two separate colors at twice the expense.</li>
            <li>but when I found this for half the price I thought it would be worth a try.</li>
            <li>First off, always, always, ALWAYS check reviewers to see if they have ever written other reviews.</li>
            <li>if you have a lot of bare patches.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results, it definitely camouflages the loss and works as a cover up in thin hair areas.</li>

            <li> so don&#x27;t waste your money, buck up and go to the salon on a regular basis or go natural!!  </li>
            <li> Thanks anyway, but I&#x27;ll stick with my usual.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long - perhaps 5 applications-</li>
            <li> The 2nd time I used it I wet the area on my scalp and then dabbed the powder.</li>
            <li> Someone told me there were products that could cover the grey between my trips to the salon.</li>
            <li> I have one thin spot right in front, so I got it to fill that</li>
            <li> I actually only need to use it afte washing my hair which is every other day, sometimes even go two mornings wihtout washing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark blonde</li>
            <li> I received my powder a few days ago and have already used it several times.</li>
            <li> It is a little dark (the blonde)</li>
            <li> It did not stick to my hair... nor did the other two powder products I also purchased.  </li>
            <li> If they have not, it is unlikely that they are real reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s odd though because the picture on the box indicates that it is to fill in bald/thin spots and</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look all that natural and as an evening wore on, only the edges of the scalp still had the powder and the roots, leaving what looked to be a dirty head.</li>
            <li> cannot answer for the black</li>
            <li> Color was a little off for me</li>
            <li> So now after using this product for a few months...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and dense, so a little of it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A lot of it is needed to cover grey roots and it is a very dull shade so it doesnt blend well with the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> Covers what needs to be covered, but it&#x27;s a little dull and powdery.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> The thin spot looked odd when I used it.</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> Be wary of glowing reviews and check to see what else they have reviewed.</li>
            <li> Laughable.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> (yes, it makes me crazy, never thought I​ would lose my hair!)</li>
            <li> Wrong, the box states its for filling in thinning areas!!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> You have to use a lot to get it to cover and it doesn&#x27;t look very good.</li>
            <li> First off, always, always, ALWAYS check reviewers to see if they have ever written other reviews. If they have not, it is unlikely that they are real reviews. Companies have been caught paying people to write good reviews about their products. Be wary of glowing reviews and check to see what else they have reviewed. Even check ME out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I bought this via Sally&#x27;s. I would have bought it here had I guessed that Amazon sold it. When I first got it, I was disappointed. It just looked like a brown matte eye shadow (mine is medium brown). For this reason I really scrubbed that brush into the powder before applying and then I realized that it is nothing at all like eye shadow. It&#x27;s very thick and dense, so a little of it goes a long way. Use it sparingly to start with then add more if you need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s odd though because the picture on the box indicates that it is to fill in bald/thin spots and even Sally&#x27;s says that is what it is for, even though it is called \\&quot;Cover That Gray\\&quot;. I have one thin spot right in front, so I got it to fill that in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once it arrived and I tried using it, I realized that it is better for covering gray roots. The thin spot looked odd when I used it. It didn&#x27;t look all that natural and as an evening wore on, only the edges of the scalp still had the powder and the roots, leaving what looked to be a dirty head. However, when applied only to the hair roots and not the scalp, it looks SO much better. The end result is that I do like it for gray roots and only for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot answer for the black that reviewer Aya said made it look grayish, nor for the blonde. I can only say that the brown doesn&#x27;t look grayish at all, on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like it, but I wish it came in more colors. I have a light reddish brown color, so medium brown is too dark and blonde way too light. I don&#x27;t believe mixing colors would work, since it&#x27;s a powder.</li>
            <li> I was used to using Joan Rivers Great Hair Day but when I found this for half the price I thought it would be worth a try. It was worth a try but not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Color was a little off for me</li>
            <li> I reviewed too soon before. So now after using this product for a few months... I want to say it works. I even mix it with my Joan Rivers one. I love using this color on my eyebrows!! So I get double uses for a low price... And it works. It totally is a great product. You won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> Laughable.  I can&#x27;t imagine how this could ever work.  It did not stick to my hair... nor did the other two powder products I also purchased.  But Style Edit is a magic in a bottle...couple of sprays and it covered beautifully...perfect for in-between salon visits.  Out of all the products I purchased to covers the grays...this one worked.</li>
            <li> The product description states &amp;#34;cover that gray&amp;#34; which one would assume it would be for root touch ups in between the salon visit, right?  Wrong, the box states its for filling in thinning areas!!  I don&#x27;t have thinning areas but I tried it anyway, I ordered the blonde but I received medium brown shade so go figure.  It didn&#x27;t do a thing and I couldn&#x27;t even see where I applied it so don&#x27;t waste your money, buck up and go to the salon on a regular basis or go natural!!  I want my money plus shipping costs refunded!!</li>
            <li> I received my powder a few days ago and have already used it several times. I bought the blonde shade. The lighter color in the compact is for very light blonde hair. The darker seems to be better for blondes with roots.The 1 st time I used it I didn&#x27;t think it worked very good. The 2nd time I used it I wet the area on my scalp and then dabbed the powder. It worked much better on the wet area.I will use it a few more weeks and if I don&#x27;t love it, I will by the Joan River&#x27;s brand that I saw on Amazon. That has very good reviews though it&#x27;s pricier. Overall,Claudia Steven&#x27;s hair powder is a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay on as good as Joan Rivers. You have to use more of it. The colors are a good choice, though.</li>
            <li> I really like this powder. It lasts until you wash your hair. The color is much better than another kind I used to use. It was labeled blonde but it was more brown. I looked like I had dark roots - not an attractive look!</li>
            <li> wonderful option between coloring it... love it...</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product, it cost about half the price of Joan Rivers Great Hair Day ( my usual product ) I used it for a week or so, and it just didn&#x27;t go on or even stay on as well as Great Hair Day.  Thanks anyway, but I&#x27;ll stick with my usual.</li>
            <li> Good product. Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I actually only need to use it afte washing my hair which is every other day, sometimes even go two mornings wihtout washing it. This product is awesome!</li>
            <li> I have my hair colored every five weeks but as the years go by I&#x27;ve been finding that the grey along my partline was becoming prominent after just a couple of weeks. Someone told me there were products that could cover the grey between my trips to the salon. I found this one and it&#x27;s just amazing. I&#x27;m a dark blonde and so I use the darker of the two colors. Just a little covers great and lasts all day (even when I brush my hair). I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried all the powders, fibers, and sprays and this works the best. Wish I tried it about 2 years ago when I first started losing my hair. At the rate I&#x27;m going, I will have to change to a topper/hairpiece soon enough. But this powder is good, I use a semi perm ash blonde hair color and this blends beautifully. Also, I recommend a makeup sponge vs. the included brush for application.</li>
            <li> This does the same job as the more expensive versions but has the advantage of having two colors in one package so you can mix the right color for your hair without having to buy two separate colors at twice the expense. Excellent idea!</li>
            <li> Bet this is as good as the one Joan Rivers sells for more than twice the price. Never would have considered using it to fill in the slight thinning areas; it&#x27;s really great.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really certain if this product would work for my needs.  It&#x27;s great, couldn&#x27;t have worked better.  I use this when my gray roots start to show at the front of my hair.  It is so natural appearing and lasts until I wash it out.&lt;br /&gt;Will certainly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> if you are blond, you will definitely need to mix the colors. It doesn&#x27;t last long - perhaps 5 applications- if you have a lot of bare patches. But it does work</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Color WOW better</li>
            <li> Never do without this item. And this is a great price</li>
            <li> This product really works great to cover bald spots, particularly if you have blonde to dark blonde hair. It&#x27;s not going to give you a full head of hair. If your scalp is white, the available lighter and darker colors blend really well on your scalp to provide the illusion of more hair.  It’s basically providing a darker background for your hair to blend with. It is a really small package, and most likely will go quickly. But at this price I would buy several at a time. Much better product than Joan Rivers, at a lower cost and more importantly ... available!</li>
            <li> Not as good as Joan Rivers product</li>
            <li> It was ok. Im not crazy about it.  Probably would not recommend. Like i said. Its ok. Not great. Good luck</li>
            <li> A lot of it is needed to cover grey roots and it is a very dull shade so it doesnt blend well with the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> a good product for the price, however the bristles on the brush keep falling out.</li>
            <li> It works a little better than most products out there, to cover thinning areas (mine is thinning from a drug I have to take, so I have tried a lot of these) It is a little dark (the blonde) And, it does say it is for &amp;#34;covering gray&amp;#34; (as opposed to &amp;#34;filling in&amp;#34;--but it shows someone with thinning hair??) I don&#x27;t have the gray yet (I am light-haired), but, it does a reasonably good job of masking your scalp shining through at people taller than you (yes, it makes me crazy, never thought I​ would lose my hair!)</li>
            <li> Covers what needs to be covered, but it&#x27;s a little dull and powdery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fifty year old woman with light to moderate hair loss, which is the reason for purchasing this product. I am pleased with the results, it definitely camouflages the loss and works as a cover up in thin hair areas.</li>
