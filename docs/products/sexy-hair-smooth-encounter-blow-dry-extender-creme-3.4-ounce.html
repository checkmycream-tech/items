            <li> Excellent! I have fine natural curly hard to smooth hair. While trying to find &amp;#34;Darn Straight&amp;#34; by Sexy Hair I read reviews on this because the other item was discontinued. This works even better for me! I am so glad that I found it!

            <li> I used Sexy Straight Darn Straight to control my curls (rather than straightening them) for years.  I really loved that product and was so sad when I learned it wasn&#x27;t being made anymore.  A comment on this product led to trialing this stuff and it is AWESOME.  It is not the same product as I&#x27;ve read someone say; it is different but better. I&#x27;ve used it twice and gotten compliments both times.  My hair is very soft and not weighted down or frizzy and it doesn&#x27;t take much product to get good control.  I&#x27;m happy to have found this and hope it is on the market for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It is ok not the I expected</li>
            <li> Loved it and couldn&#x27;t beat the price anywhere</li>
            <li> smells good, but wish there was less &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Thought it would have smelled better.</li>
            <li> The best stuff I&#x27;ve ever put in my hair. My hairdresser was amazed how soft and silky my hair was. I get lots of complements on my hair. My hair is naturally curly and frizzes easily in the very humid climate I live in. This tames the frizz to wear curly, or assists in straightening for a sleek, smooth look that is utterly touchable. My husband touches my hair all the time now.</li>
            <li> This product has made my hair super soft and shiny. It is way cheaper than purchasing it as some of the usual stores I frequent which makes me happy! I use it every time I wash my hair (a few times a week) and this helps it maintain its freshly washed feel and look. Coconut oil is so good for many things - and apparently hair is among them! I would definitely recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> This amazing product smells soooooo delicious.  I love it.  A little amount goes a long way.  It leaves your hair smooth, super shiny and smelling amazing.  I get lots of compliments on my dark black long hair.  I am buying more for sure.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel so soft and kept my hair straight all day! Smells nice as well!</li>
