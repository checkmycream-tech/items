            <li>The color was perfect.</li>
            <li>If you just want to have some color to your lashes for the times when you do not wear mascara, than is GREAT!  </li>
            <li>and I have to say it looks great!  </li>
            <li>Best of luck.</li>
            <li>&quot; (for cleaning braces) was a perfect applicator, and</li>
            <li>and I have the best control over where the tint goes; I did attach a picture so you can compare the sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great!  </li>
            <li>I was nervis to buy and to try this but its great!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t elongate or thicken like a mascara would, but it is not advertised that it does, so it is great!</li>

            <li>The product is ABSOLUTELY excellent!!!</li>
            <li>Great eyelash/eyebrow tint!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with the permanent eyelash tint kit by Godefroy.  </li>
            <li>this is also a great tip for applying mascara!</li>
            <li>and I got excellent results.</li>
            <li>OMG---This product is the best.  </li>
            <li>This was the perfect tool for applying the tint.</li>
            <li>I figured it was my best bet.</li>

            <li>Very happy!</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are so happy not to have to wear mascara!</li>
            <li>Very happy!</li>
            <li>However, it was amazing on my eyebrows!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to wake up already looking made up!  </li>
            <li>This product is so so at best.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>But after all, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m very happy with the results&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>And yes I followed the directions perfectly.</li>
            <li>works great on eyebrows!</li>
            <li>I bought the disposable mascara brushes, it fits PERFECTLY in the hole of the plug for the no 1 Activator jar, scrapes the excess off too.  </li>
            <li>At best, I look like a brunette without eye make-up.</li>
            <li>GREAT!!</li>
            <li>I am duly impressed with my results!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>That is the BEST suggestion</li>
            <li>Great price, too!</li>
            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>So although the &amp;#34;permanent pencil&amp;#34; look fades, it is wonderful for a weekend trip.  </li>
            <li>so I completed the process twice and am very happy with the results!</li>
            <li>My mother and best friend are now eager to try it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The price is great too !!!</li>
            <li>I have very fair eyelashes</li>
            <li>Very very good product.</li>
            <li>However, based on how things are going, I&#x27;d say there is a very good chance it would.</li>
            <li>so I should have been an ideal candidate for this product.  </li>
            <li>good luck!</li>
            <li>Good Luck!</li>
            <li>I like waking up in the morning and looking good!</li>
            <li>Soon you&#x27;ll have beautiful lashes at a fraction of the cost at a salon.</li>
            <li>Mascara brush didn&#x27;t work and the applicator isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>Definately has a great color.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the results for about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>then this is great.  </li>
            <li>this will be great to not add mascara every day.</li>
            <li>AND YOUR EYELASHES WILL LOOK GREAT.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great; don&#x27;t have to think about it, off we go.</li>
            <li>and the results are great.</li>
            <li>the price this stuff is great....</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li>This product worked great for eyebrows but my lashes did not change...</li>
            <li>Appreciate the great service.  </li>
            <li>LOL AT PERMENANT.</li>
            <li>I am sooooo happy that I decided to dye them.</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>Great results.</li>
            <li>My lashes were blond and invisible, but now look great.</li>
            <li>Oh and the price is great too.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes look great</li>
            <li>This product is GREAT.</li>
            <li>My wife reports the product&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>The seller was great and shipped it immediately.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li>The product for eyebrows works great</li>
            <li>I have no problem with the seller, great, prompt transaction.  </li>
            <li>he may have just been trying to make me happy...</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I will continue using it.</li>
            <li>Like me!&lt;br /&gt;**i also use this brand eyebrow tint and it is great as well.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the price too.</li>
            <li>This was great</li>
            <li>I have experienced no irritation whatsoever with Godefroy.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m SOOO happy</li>
            <li>Great for summer if you don&#x27;t want to use mascara every day in the heat.</li>
            <li>and I used this to darken that spot and it worked great.</li>
            <li>works great</li>
            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>This product work great.  </li>
            <li>It probably works best on very very light lashes.</li>
            <li>I have very light eyelashes and thought this was going to be wonderful.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li>My lashes and brows look amazing!</li>
            <li>so I am sure I did a perfect application.  </li>
            <li>I tried both a cotton swab and a mascara brush but wasn&#x27;t overly successful.  </li>
            <li>and I really liked it!</li>
            <li>It was so easy to apply and looks great!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and awesome results.</li>
            <li>is the best product and easy to use if you take your time and have a magnifying mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I debated on this for a good couple weeks before buying.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found a good brush to use.</li>
            <li>good luck and remember</li>
            <li>Wanting a good tint, I applied it three days in a row.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of staining the skin on your fingers and around your eyelashes though.  </li>
            <li>Good product-- does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>It darken lashes fairly well.</li>
            <li>The product does a good job but in the information it says it can be used on eyebrows also.  </li>
            <li>Lasts about 3 good weeks.  </li>
            <li>The burning and tearing lasted a good 15 minutes afterwards and the redness stayed through the end of the night.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps this product works well for fair haired people, but heaven help you if you get it in your eye.</li>
            <li>I got good results with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used mascara on my bottom lashes, so this was a good improvement.</li>
            <li>It would be good for blonds that want darker lashed</li>
            <li>I got fair to good results.</li>
            <li>It does dye lashes good but applicator provided is not helpfull.</li>
            <li>Instructions are good and the end result of the application is quite satisfactory.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think my experiences with this product were good</li>
            <li>However, it is good to note in no way</li>
            <li>Delivery was good.</li>
            <li>To be fair, the product admits this could be an issue and advises pads and oil barriers, but that hinders the application&#x27;s effectiveness to a degree.</li>
            <li>I just dyed my eyelashes using this product with good results.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was a good candidate for this product...</li>
            <li>This is a good one.</li>
            <li>, I have to repeat every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise good product.</li>
            <li>So when I wake up in the morning or go to yoga and don&#x27;t feel like putting on make-up, I still look good.</li>
            <li>I tried using it 3 times, on clean lashes, and the result is spotty at best.</li>
            <li>Very good, easy to use and gives long-lasting result.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>Interesting it was great for brows</li>
            <li>I was also very pleased to find out that this product is made in Sweden, which lessened my fear that it would damage or hurt my eyes.</li>
            <li>of Day 1 - I am very pleased with this product - 5</li>
            <li>Co. Bigelow (at Bath &amp; Body Works) produces a lovely rose fragranced balm which I&#x27;ve discovered works splendidly.  </li>
            <li>Once that&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s just a matter of barely touching your lashes with the colorant gel and presto!</li>
            <li>I thought that I would soak my hands, and the try to file off the top layers of my skin with a nail file (does work, but not sufficiently to rob a bank!).    </li>
            <li>this works BETTER!</li>
            <li>I love this tint!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>What is better is that I save time and money (and avoid discomfort!)</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>in conclusion, I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>They look outstanding!</li>
            <li>So in conclusion, I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>They look outstanding!</li>
            <li>Results are OK!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I have applied this one time and got it perfect from the first time.</li>
            <li>I have read so many reviews for and against and the just &#x27;so-so&#x27;s&#x27;, but I will tell you I have put this on my lashes--and brows!  </li>
            <li>There are better products out there!</li>
            <li>I love waking up looking like I&#x27;ve done my eyes!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This is fantastic!!</li>
            <li>Definitely love it on my eyebrows!</li>
            <li>Great, easy to use product.</li>
            <li>so I need not wear mascara in Mexico easy to do works great and lasts</li>
            <li>The stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Because there are times I use this, and my lashes look amazing after; and then there are times I use it, and</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Thinking perhaps I had made some kind of mistake</li>
            <li>(and I do my own gel nails, too)  </li>
            <li>Since I own it now, I&#x27;ll give it another try at some point.</li>
            <li>eye\\&quot; kind of eyeliner way, either...</li>
            <li>&quot; kind of way.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never had that kind of lash fall-out before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>more time consuming but good for accuracy.    </li>
            <li>Once that happens, the product is no longer effective.  </li>
            <li>and I loved being able to roll out of bed and not think about mascara or raccoon eyes after a swim.  </li>
            <li>i liked the product.  </li>
            <li>I am thrilled w/the results.</li>
            <li>The product may have accomplished that - but slightly at best.</li>
            <li>Do it in your own home and not spend money to have someone do it for you at spa.</li>
            <li>This was easier than that process but just not as effective.  </li>
            <li>Nice color.</li>
            <li>I keep a bottle of saline handy and rinse my eye if that happens.</li>
            <li>it is so nice to not have to wear mascara - which I was always rubbing off resulting in \\&quot;racoon</li>
            <li>I liked the product, it works...</li>
            <li>Keep Q tips handy to remove smudges on eyelids.</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t have a problem with applying this product.</li>
            <li>but I used my own.</li>
            <li>and I did come up nice.</li>
            <li>eye did kind of sting when I put on the activator...</li>
            <li>one lash at a time kind...</li>
            <li>That way you eyelid will create a nice seal.</li>
            <li>Nice to have it  at home, ...</li>
            <li>I probably did not get it as close to the roots as I would have liked -</li>
            <li>but it does add a nice bit of color that frames my eyes when I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t expect to like this product, but I thought I&#x27;d order it and give it a try.  </li>
            <li>wait another min and go wash your eyelashes off with warm water.  </li>
            <li>and I used my own mascara wand.</li>
            <li>but, I found that the applicator in the package was really the best tool.</li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t help with the \\&quot;fine\\&quot; issue, but the darker color is nice.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes did stay tinted for weeks, it was nice, I liked it.</li>
            <li>If you have someone who has a steady hand and you can trust, it would be best if they apply it for you.    </li>
            <li>You may have tinted your lower lashes successfully, but not appreciate that fact as you are not using a sufficient light or magnification to see them.  </li>
            <li>I rub the two coats in well each time, ensuring a longer-lasting, full hair-length application - and my brows look great.  </li>
            <li>This is amazing and so easy to apply!  </li>
            <li>I thought the applicator that came with it was better than a mascara brush, was more pinpoint and turning it sideways did good.</li>
            <li>Why cheaper than getting it done at a salon and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I purchased disposable mascara brushes so it was very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Instructions were very easy to read and follow.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>1 coat is more than okay!</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s best just to go to a professional salon and have them do the tinting or just use mascara.</li>
            <li>I purchased thie product in hopes to be able to do my own lashes at home rather than in a spa   </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear mascara unless I&#x27;m going out, so it&#x27;s really nice to have more visible lashes all the time.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>kayak, hike - outdoorys stuff that isn&#x27;t always convenient to apply/remove/clean up mascara, (or cool!!....</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply and stays on for weeks without reapplication!</li>
            <li>It was easy!</li>
            <li>thinking if I dye them twice it will work better.&lt;br /&gt;Was really easy to apply &amp; had no problems with it!</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, the application is so easy!  </li>
            <li>They are also very fine.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I took off a star because i think the instrusctions and materials givent o use it oculd have been better, but with the purchase of my own i love it.</li>
            <li>This is a great, highly effective product, and if you use it correctly it will absolutely work.</li>
            <li>I have pretty great coverage.  </li>
            <li>It worked great the first time, although I had to leave it on for 35 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>it dyed it just  fine!</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are very light colored.  </li>
            <li>I have very light eyelashes &amp; am a Redhead.</li>
            <li>They were helpful but after a couple of hours all I&#x27;ve gotten is some very lightly dyed eyelashes and my eyes are burning like a son of a *</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and ahead of schedule, in good condition.  </li>
            <li>As others have said, a mascara brush would probably be better than the swabs supplied if your lashes are very light.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased got it quick too very happy Thanks</li>
            <li>More like 14 days</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy this again for sure and</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li>In any case, it&#x27;s a week later, my eyelase still look awesome</li>
            <li>: OK so I love this stuff now.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Then I tried it my way, worked much better, but still nothing.  </li>
            <li>Okay, I purchased this through my Dads amazon for the prime shipping.</li>
            <li>It was ok-I ended up dying my fingers more than my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Use gloves, the stains won&#x27;t come off your nails for 3 weeks or more.</li>
            <li>and I was satisfied with my transaction.  </li>
            <li>I am SO glad I did.</li>
            <li>eyeliner butm lashes are barely more visible than before.</li>
            <li>but I like how my eyes are more defined with darker lashes, so I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>when I wiped it off, since in doing so, it got in my eyes a bit, but I will continue to use this product to see if I can master the application process and hopefully more noticeable lashes over time.</li>
            <li>Hope this helped:)</li>
            <li>I used three coats to make sure the lashes were saturated.</li>
            <li>I was able to go over the lashes a couple of times.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>I, however, have just come to realize that I rely on mascara for much more than just color, but also to add volume and length.  </li>
            <li>I did apply it so that it would look like eyeliner (top lid) if it did stain</li>
            <li>Works ok for applying the activator but not the color gel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It felt safe, no sting.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this product.</li>
            <li>Works much better.</li>
            <li>But I think that&#x27;s more about my lash turnover than the product.  </li>
            <li>I have had my lashes tinted at the salon over many years.  </li>
            <li>I decided to go for it anyway, and am glad I did.    </li>
            <li>I wear reading glasses, and I was able to wear them WHILE I tinted my lashes, and also used a magnifying makeup mirror (one with a stand).  </li>
            <li>Do one eye at a time was much better for me...</li>

            <li>I love being able to do this treatment at home.  </li>
            <li>Does not stay more than 12 hours.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I may try it again, taking the noted precautions, just to see if it works better.</li>
            <li>It honestly didn&#x27;t make a difference at all, and I have light lashes.</li>
            <li>Okay, so, yes, this stuff did tint my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer needs to develop an easier and  better application technique for this product.</li>
            <li>They now include more functional tools to apply it with and improved the formula as well</li>
            <li>so it goes on better.</li>
            <li>I love semi-permanent time saving fixes.</li>
            <li>I have used this kit about 3 times, and after each time I have used it, many more eyelashes fall out than the norm, and this continues for weeks.  </li>
            <li>i had more product in my eyes than on my eye lashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But if you&#x27;re someone who is really good at figuring these things out (or have a colorist&#x27;s background and know your stuff), then this is worth trying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure most people wouldn&#x27;t think anything of it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it probably takes me well under 10 minutes to do both eyes, one at a time, top and bottom.</li>
            <li>so the process was more efficient.</li>
            <li>This is okay per the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it did not do much better.  </li>
            <li>I think it would be better called a stain rather than dye.  </li>
            <li>I worked in a salon for years and have had my lashes dyed many times.  </li>
            <li>I found I was much better at keeping it out of my eyes and treating the problem once it did get in my eyes than the pro.</li>
            <li>#34;done up&amp;#34; just to feel comfortable!</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>and I am so satisfied.  </li>
            <li>The results will really make you happy as it did me.  </li>
            <li>I have never written a review before, but I am so pleased with this product that I have to share it.</li>
            <li>Since using this most times I don&#x27;t even need mascara.</li>
            <li>It would be wonderful to have a way to buy these separately, or have the kit hold a slightly larger amount.</li>
            <li>I have more control at home</li>
            <li>Since I despise mascara, i thought I&#x27;d give this a try, and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li>But I wasn&#x27;t...&#x3D;)</li>

            <li>But I wasn&#x27;t...&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I love this mascara tint.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>You may even want to do top and lower lashes separate rather than trying to do one eye at a time.  </li>
            <li>It needs a better applicator as those wands could be improved.</li>
            <li>I read many reviews and use a mini mascara wand to apply both the color and activator.</li>
            <li>If the color touched my skin, I made sure to wipe it off immediately so it didn&#x27;t stain like others have said it does.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>If I had thicker eyelashes it would have probably been much better.  </li>
            <li>I just wanted to make sure.</li>
            <li>I rinsed that eye really good after that and tried again with success.</li>
            <li>I must admit I tried to use the cotton eye shields, but they were more of a hindrance</li>
            <li>Product is ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I only did one application (as apposed to two to make it even darker) and am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>I love this eyelash tint.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE PRODUCT, IT HAS MADE ME LOOK FORWARD</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten better results with Olay&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li>I thought this would darken my eye lashes more than it does.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all about preference though :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just over the top.</li>
            <li>I then used a separate lash wand and the coverage was much better.  </li>
            <li>I hope it does a better job</li>
            <li>I was able to get it almost all the way to the roots and didn&#x27;t even use a shield.</li>
            <li>I did put lots of moisturizer around my eyes so I would be able to wipe them off, but didn&#x27;t end up needing to.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually did it twice on my lashes--upper and lower and got really beautiful results!</li>
            <li>Much better experience  </li>
            <li>and it worked better.  </li>
            <li>If you curl your lashes afterwards with a eyelash curler, your lashes will look more pronounced.</li>
            <li>elaborate usage</li>
            <li>Not having to apply mascara daily has been priceless!!!</li>
            <li>but I found out disposable mascara applicators work better</li>
            <li>This worked better than trying to do the top and the bottom separately--that&#x27;s when the stuff got in my eye.</li>
            <li>but I had to do the application many times to get the desired results.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for the application, it went on as described (plus I watched a video online for more info).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will get better as time goes on.</li>
            <li>For me though anything is better than nothing.</li>
            <li>I love Godefroy&#x27;s eyebrow tint, so I decided to try this</li>
            <li>This is my favorite never-be-without beauty product.</li>
            <li>I like this product works better on eyebrow but</li>
            <li>I kept it on my eyebrow &amp; eyelash more than 30mins</li>
            <li>Yes I would recommend this product :-)</li>
            <li>This is my solution to not being able to wear mascara-</li>
            <li>also there is no flaking, smearing, or racoon eyes like many non allergic mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It does burn if you get it in your eye, but not horribly.</li>
            <li>I have ordered once before and was impressed enough to order again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m okay with admitting that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this product &amp; will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m sure the reviews did), I would have proceeded with more caution.</li>
            <li>(Straight A&#x27;s lol...).</li>
            <li>Make sure you cover your counters when you use this.</li>
            <li>It does &#x27;TINT&#x27; the eyelashes, however, I was expecting it to be more of a mascara.  </li>
            <li>In the directions it says \\&quot;apply to top of lashes\\</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>You can notice the difference more if you curl your lashes.</li>
            <li>I tried this because I can&#x27;t be bothered to do more than a powder foundation most mornings...</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Easy &amp; great product, a dream come true for gals or guys with light eyelashes.</li>
            <li>lashes look very natural and beautiful.</li>
            <li>(test on skin first like they suggest!!!)  </li>
            <li>I then used a MASCARA BRUSH to apply the gel---I got pretty good coverage...  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at it.</li>
            <li>This does a pretty good job of making my lashes darker.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 55 and still have pretty good eyelashes.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to find this on pinterest and purchase here!  </li>
            <li>It makes this product SO user friendly!</li>
            <li>The new improvements are great.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with the results, here are a few tips that I think will help you achieve great results too:     1)</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure how easy it would be to do this myself</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fair hair, fair skin, blue eyes....</li>
            <li>but it brings them all out and makes me feel more confident and comfortable to just go out without make up or some vitamin</li>
            <li>I was paying twice this much for one eyelash dye job at a salon, this works as good or better than those.</li>
            <li>I applied it with a clean mascara brush, per another positive review, and it worked great.</li>
            <li>to clean smudges and got all the lashes!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfectly fine if they do, just keep applying and make sure you get every lash.</li>
            <li>and I can get a much better, cleaner and precise application than using the tools provided.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not all that impressed.</li>
            <li>Of course, I&#x27;m careful with the application and it does take practice, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem and my lashes look awesome for about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Works great but easier to use and old mascara application brush to apply.</li>
            <li>Make sure your lashes are completely free of any residue from makeup or makeup remover/soap.</li>
            <li>There were too many precautions and your eyes are too important to be trying unsafe products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a light stain.</li>
            <li>If you are in a brightly lit room (good bathroom light), and use a makeup mirror that magnifies, you will see that your lashes are actually longer than you think.  </li>
            <li>loved the idea of a tint that would darken my eyelashes for a month, but I find regular mascara to be much more effective.</li>
            <li>Follow the  directions, it is a very easy and quick process.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, I still wear mascara for sure, but this helps my very light lashes be seen when I&#x27;m on a quick no make up errand.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to a T, and I have a very steady hand and am good at fine motor skills.  </li>
            <li>Very important be have clean lashes, no oils on it.</li>
            <li>so I was really excited for this :)</li>
            <li>(just make sure to clean the excess color with Qtip immediately) but not so well with eyelashes.</li>
            <li>This product is not as easy to use as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I find this really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t think it was at all easy to apply</li>
            <li>did work for me very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Got the product very quickly &amp; it worked well.</li>
            <li>Although easy to use, I would not recommend to my friends or buy it again</li>
            <li>Applicator is easy to use, and directions are easy to follow.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use.  </li>

            <li>and it was really easy to use.  </li>
            <li>lasts about 4-6 weeks, easy to use.</li>
            <li>recommend NOT using the applicator brush provided but to use dentek easy brush cleaners (toothbrush aisle) to apply.</li>
            <li>I found this product really easy to use.</li>
            <li>Overall - I am pleased and will continue to use this - great for those days when I want to skip make-up</li>

            <li>This product is quite easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I colored my lashes about 3 weeks ago, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about two weeks in and still going strong.</li>
            <li>ordered  this item for a freind she liked very much</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t see that great out of the eye I got it in to for about four days, so apparently it dies your eyeball too, just not hair.</li>
            <li>I tried using the included applicator sticks, and also an eyelash brush, and an eyeshadow brush - trying to find a better way to control the application of the dye and still could not get full coverage.     </li>
            <li>I bought this and while I am not let down I must say that it isn&#x27;t the best of the best.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>but once I got the hang of it, it worked out fine.</li>
            <li>and I have waited more than a minute not sure which works the best as they seem to all</li>
            <li>That is perfectly fine with me.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Black is best.</li>
            <li>Applying the activator with the cotton swab works fine.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s wonderful especially if you are outdoorsy, spend a lot of time in the sun, or are &amp;#34;low maintenance&amp;#34; and want to feel pretty without being all done up.</li>
            <li>Now I use my eyelash curler and you can see my lashes fine.</li>
            <li>and they stayed just fine.</li>
            <li>This works just fine.  </li>
            <li>If you have someone helping you it might be just fine.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps there&#x27;s a fine line between the ratio of the two items that create a bond on the eyelash (to dye it).  </li>
            <li>Thank you for having a product that is easy to do for my light eye lashes.</li>
            <li>It really helped saturate my lashes with the developer, then after I washed it I was able to put on the gel very cleanly and easily.  </li>
            <li>No waiting for the dye to develop, which was a huge plus.</li>
            <li>The pads for under the eyes are huge and I quit trying to hassel with them and put Vaseline under my eyes.</li>
            <li>My test area looked like a huge bruise  inside of my elbow and was there for over a week.</li>
            <li>I still use it on occasion, but for being on the go it is great especially for light colored lashes.</li>
            <li>my lashes are light brown), I&#x27;m great at following directions</li>
            <li>(jeez I just sound like a wreck</li>
            <li>I applied lightly.</li>
            <li>Remind you: the color I used was brown(on brown lashes), may work for light lashes.</li>
            <li>Great for the tiny corner lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have light lashes</li>

            <li>if that) on a two inch handle (just happened to see one in the bathroom drawer and had a Light Bulb Moment).  </li>
            <li>They work great on the upper lashes too, but those are the easier lashes to tint anyway.    </li>
            <li>Take the advice of the detailed reviews on here</li>
            <li>Reapplying every few weeks seems to work best.</li>
            <li>5) Lightly cover your hands in the petroleum jelly  6)</li>
            <li>it looks fantastic.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am allergic to all mascara (tried them all from cheap to exhorbitant) and the result is itchy eyes each time.</li>
            <li>It looks like I have really smooth mascara on.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for anyone who has light to brown eyelashes.</li>
            <li>This product works great if you have blonde eyelashes like I do.</li>
            <li>It is intended for those of us with light colored lashes/brows.  </li>
            <li>This is going to sound like I got paid to leave a review...</li>
            <li>If my eyelashes were thickier and light the effect would be a knock out</li>
            <li>I have shorter, light brown eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I could see how this would work for light lashes.</li>
            <li>I have light eyelashes</li>
            <li>If you have blonde eye lashes , this product works great ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a great deal--at Sally&#x27;s Beauty they have a different brand for $45!!!</li>
            <li>I have light brown lashes and did two applications (labor intensive) and the difference is negligible.</li>
            <li>I was really confident at this point that I was on the road to success.</li>
            <li>I have light eyelashes even though I have darker hair.</li>
            <li>The lashes are still light on the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have reddish hair and naturally light brown lashes.</li>
            <li>However, on the plus side, Roux includes a stain remover vial as well, which works fairly well (but never gets the dye off completely in all areas).    </li>
            <li>I bought this several months ago, and although it does do a good job tinting the blond ends of my eyelashes, I think it also makes more of them fall out.  </li>
            <li>So far so good -</li>
            <li>So good so far.</li>
            <li>So far so good with this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using lash conditioner at night to make them more healthy too and that has really made a difference too.  </li>
            <li>(I, too, was sure I would do it right</li>
            <li>Applied better, but again, after the allotted time, product washed right off.  </li>
            <li>(not too many just the right amount</li>
            <li>For someone with no visible lashes to actually seeing them, it is very nice.  </li>
            <li>Its super easy to use</li>
            <li>you will LOVE this product and wont be able to live without it.</li>
            <li>This works fast (instantly!) is easy to use and color lasts for 30 days or more.</li>
            <li>A small synthetic fan brush seems to work best</li>
            <li>laugh&#x27;s on me!).  </li>
            <li>Do the bottom lash first and wash off then do the top lash.</li>

            <li>So when you start make sure you wear gloves, be aware it stains EVERYTHING</li>
            <li>so I was excited to try this product.      </li>
            <li>My bathroom sink was covered in dye, and I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>Love this product when it first goes on</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly each time and never got more than 3 days wear.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m not close to rich.</li>
            <li>feeling is that it is pretty safe.  </li>
            <li>I was excited about this product because I have a LOT of lashes</li>
            <li>Well, I ran home when I got it all excited to use it and put it on.  </li>
            <li>It makes the dying process twice as long, and doesn&#x27;t even do as great of a job.</li>
            <li>This made me feel more comfortable in my own skin, I don&#x27;t look so ghostly anymore, and it really is lasting.</li>
            <li>It is true - this product will color your lashes a darker shade - a great concept if you have nice thick lashes that are light colored.</li>
            <li>In other words, if you can apply mascara, you can use this easily and will be happy you did.</li>
            <li>I even did it again with clean eyelashes (washed with soap and water).  </li>
            <li>start to finish, including clean up, it took maybe 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>I tried again but this time without vaseline, without pads, just unsing a clean mascara brush for both activator and colorant (just washed it well between the two applications).</li>
            <li>I applied, clean it all off and applied again.  </li>
            <li>Then brush my eyelashes with a clean mascara brush (which I bought separately).</li>
            <li>Amazing able to use myself and definitely had color that lasted.  </li>
            <li>I have long and full lashes, so I&#x27;m as happy as can be about it.</li>
            <li>so my lashes are super light.</li>
            <li>Although this last package was the best so far.  </li>
            <li>This stuff does a great job of tinting my very blonde eyelashes, but be prepared to take some time to do this right.  </li>
            <li>somewhere special for an event</li>
            <li>I was hoping this item would be my solution to wanting my lashes tinted for special events</li>
            <li>&quot; I did a two week challenge and have decided to not wear makeup again except for special occasions like family holidays.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was able to get very close to the lash line and cover the skin without getting goopy vaseline all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But for a first shot at doing this, I was beyond pleased and I am sure I will only get better as I go.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t explain the good reviews, but I do know if you buy this, you will come back to my review and say, \\&quot;Why didn&#x27;t I listen to her?\\&quot;  What the heck</li>
            <li>But they are not so good for applying the second step, the colorant gel, because this solution is the one that stings, and the one that stains.  </li>
            <li>I used the left over Roux stain remover, and it worked fairly well for the stains I ended up with from the 28 Day Mascara tinting.  </li>
            <li>Take it slow and it works GREAT!!</li>
            <li>You need to repeat the process Of tinting many times before real results.</li>
            <li>I did it two more times, leaving it on much longer than a minute each of those times.  </li>
            <li>but overall it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I really like being able to do this at home.    </li>
            <li>Nothing leaked through.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the q-tips are really only good for applying the vaseline, and the activator.</li>
            <li>I have had good results that last for weeks and weeks.  </li>
            <li>Its much easier and works much better.</li>
            <li>If you have light colored eyelashes, this product is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m normally a natural product kind of girl</li>
            <li>I think I was putting too much of the activator on though to be sure I covered all the lashes...</li>
            <li>The effects are not comparable to true mascara.</li>
            <li>Instead, moving full speed ahead, I was in a lot of pain during the dying part of the procedure.</li>
            <li>I left it on for a good 5 min.</li>
            <li>Suggested to reuse at least once a week, for best results use twice weekly.</li>
            <li>It will stain my skin for a day or so but not bad.    </li>
            <li>I successfully applied the product to my left eye as directed, but accidentally got a DROP of product in my right eye and that was the end of it.  </li>
            <li>I repeated the process for my top lashes right away because I didn&#x27;t get all the lashes the first time.</li>
            <li>I was able to use a clean mascara brush instead of the older &amp;#34;Q-tip&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>used one of those Dentek brushies to apply the product and it was really easy to get it exactly on my lash and not my skin.</li>
            <li>I found it pretty easy to use because I didn&#x27;t feel the need to go all the way to the roots.  </li>
            <li>This is a tremendous help in applying the petroleum with true accuracy so as to avoid getting it on your lashes.  </li>
            <li>I will say, the bottled labeled first solution is easy to apply and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the staining at that point.</li>
            <li>i did it a few times and loved it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;like so many other reviewers said, it&#x27;s best to use a mascara brush (I was able to avoid staining my skin that way) and it takes a little practice if you&#x27;ve never dyed your lashes before.</li>
            <li>The swabs included in the kit are fine for applying the developer solution, the first step.  </li>
            <li>After applying the product, my top lashes are a bit darker, but as I get older, they are getting thinner, so I am also going to try out a product to help thicken and lengthen them.  </li>
            <li>So you can get the dye off your skin quickly.</li>
            <li>The best way I&#x27;ve found to do it is the same way I dye my hair, and at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>Seemed like a good idea at the time, after receiving it and reading the instructions decided it was more trouble</li>
            <li>Make sure you get all the lashes nice and wet with this stuff because if you don&#x27;t, some lashes wont change colors.</li>
            <li>so the effect is becoming more apparent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to be super drastic.</li>
            <li>and i find the product is worthy of 5 stars.</li>
            <li>tip that I learned quickly, DONT use the pads they give you for the under eye.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this, I have light blonde eyelashes</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the product works okay, and is way better than having white eyelashes, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have another brand or option.</li>
            <li>I was super nervous about staining and getting it all over the place.</li>
            <li>got here quick and is just as it said.</li>
            <li>I can speak from personal experience that your results are 100% user-facilitated, meaning that if you don&#x27;t get good results, it&#x27;s because you didn&#x27;t do it right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that after a month, my lashes are still dark</li>
            <li>They look great -- better than drawn on with pencil, actually -- and the dye lasts for several days before it comes off the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great product - I can&#x27;t wear mascara, so I am happy to have dark lashes again.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this</li>
            <li>I have to leave it on for about 4 min, but its a good idea to start at 1 1/2 min, then check about every minute until you know how long it takes for you.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product, it doesn&#x27;t last a whole month but other than that it&#x27;s pretty good....</li>
            <li>The dye worked great and her lashes were black.</li>
            <li>For the first time I see such a good eye lashes color.</li>
            <li>It was easy &amp; fast to use --</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it really covered my gray lashes.</li>
            <li>I even tried it with the pads underneath, but they didn&#x27;t stay in place, so the dye from my lower lashes got absorbed by the cotton pad, then it shifted around and got the dye underneath and below my lower lashes (luckily the dye came off my skin.)  </li>
            <li>But just like so many commercials it is very far from reality.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and eyes and surprisingly I didn&#x27;t have much of a reaction the first time.  </li>
            <li>This product really works!!  </li>
            <li>This product works pretty well!</li>
            <li>This application (first time) was a Breeze!</li>
            <li>but for 2 years I&#x27;ve used Beauty Lash and went from literally &#x27;sparse stubs&#x27; for eyelashes to getting them for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair and this is great because you can see my eyelashes even when I am not wearing mascara (which is pretty much all the time).  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I went the first 30 years of my life without dying my eyelashes!  </li>
            <li>Easy but messy to use but got good results.</li>
            <li>I have very light lashes and have been getting them dyed professionally for years.</li>
            <li>but my first attempt was shaky at best.</li>
            <li>First off, this came super quick.  </li>
            <li>I use Just For Men Beard &amp; Mustache dye for my eyebrows, so this was intriguing.  </li>
            <li>I keep the pointed swabs handy in case I do get a bit on my skin, they are better than round ones.</li>
            <li>I love how they look when I wear mascara, but my eyes are sensitive and I always end up rubbing them and smearing mascara all over.</li>
            <li>The first eye I did, did not come out quite as fully dyed as the second, as there is a bit of a learning curve, but they both looked pretty good.</li>
            <li>~ that was nice, but it only lasts a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>A professional lash tint will be better in this respect.</li>
            <li>Okay, as far as the coloring aspect, yes it lasts for 28 days.</li>
            <li>You cannot tint them and then expect to suddenly see them clearly without good light and magnification.  </li>
            <li>my camper friends make fun of me; I don&#x27;t care).</li>
            <li>Chapstick Fresh Effects</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get the paper skin protector things to work worth a dime.  </li>
            <li>IF YOU LAUGH IT RUNS...</li>
            <li>Seriously---this product is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The best and easiest way to apply the gel is to put it on the OUTSIDE CURVED part of the mascara brush, this way you can apply it to the harder to get to areas like the corners and lower lashes.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>then it was worth.  </li>
            <li>remember tho its just a dye, it dose not thicken the hairs, but for those of us with blonde hairs, its nice to see them when you cant put mascara on.</li>
            <li>I must have still had some kind of oil or even makeup remover residue left in my lashes.</li>
            <li>ITS WORTH IT</li>
            <li>Beautiful dark lashes that really show up now.  </li>
            <li>Really, the key is using good applicators.</li>
            <li>Either way, totally worth a shot.</li>
            <li>So, if you take it for what it is (not mascara), it&#x27;s worth the $20.</li>
            <li>This product is good for someone (like me) who has blonde eyelashes and wants to darken them so you can go without makeup (like at the beach or pool) and still have some lashes.</li>
            <li>When rinsing with warm water - I did feel a brief stinging in each eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was super easy to use and my lashes came out a nice black shade and it appears that I have some type of mascara on.</li>
            <li>I could tell after the first application, however, the ends of the lashes still seemed pretty light.</li>
            <li>hardly worth the effort it takes to apply.  </li>
            <li>It is much better than the professional product I have used for years.</li>
            <li>try to do all your lashes at the same time, if you have really light lashes I reccomend leaving it on for more like 2min.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have my own gloves, I recommend getting some at the local drug store in the correct size, will help a lot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has now been 2 weeks and the color is just as fresh as day one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>oh well, it was worth a shot</li>
            <li>If anybody from Godefroy is reading this right now, I&#x27;m not mad-</li>
            <li>The application takes a little getting used to, would love to see each tube with a mascara brush - would make it more user friendly.</li>
            <li>If you are an active lady, or even a guy who wants darker lashes without wearing makeup, a tint is great.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with this product and glad I made the low cost investment which will save me quite a bit of time and money now</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even going to attempt to do my right....</li>
            <li>all right but not your hair.</li>
            <li>Took a bit to figure out right amount to use &amp; a LOT of patience is required.</li>
            <li>Came right on time.  </li>
            <li>She put it on the lashes of my right eye, so we could compare.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;dye&amp;#34; washes right off.</li>
            <li>Even with the eye shields, because the product soaks right thru them.  </li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t do this right before you are going to a party or something.  </li>
            <li>The dye came right off after one wash.</li>
            <li>right after I order a couple boxes of it to stock up on it in case</li>
            <li>I just wiped it off right away.</li>
            <li>(I have tried applying the colorant right after which worked best for getting my skin as dark as possible, and I have waited a minute</li>
            <li>and I have had them tinted in the past with great success.</li>
            <li>I would advise using a clean mascara wand to apply vs. the provided applicator - much easier.</li>
            <li>Will wait to see how long the color lasts but great so far.</li>
            <li>I have been tinting my own eyelashes for over 10 years with other products so am familiar with the process.</li>
            <li>It is hard to see them just looking in a mirror - you need the good light (you&#x27;re tinting your lashes because they are pale, so without good light you won&#x27;t see them).  </li>
            <li>here I am, happy to have these lovely dark lashes and brows~and though it&#x27;s not quite the same effect as adding mascara--I feel pretty</li>
            <li>lashes are dark right along the lash line, but the tips are fair.</li>
            <li>so I pulled them off and was just more careful to not touch skin with gel #2(which can easily stain the skin).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a video where the person used a small paint brush to apply the color, which I think would be a great applicator.  </li>
            <li>This leaves me with a nicely dyed section in the middle of my top lashes with the rest blonde.  </li>
            <li>After applying the solutions, it barely dyed the top lashes and the color on the bottom lashes washed off.</li>
            <li>(I love the Godefrey brow dye, and apparently you can use this product on your brows as well.</li>
            <li>But what really sold me was I decided to try it on my thinning eye brows, instant LOVE!  </li>
            <li>I squeeze a very small amount on the end of the brush and then blot lightly on paper towel before applying with a very light touch to the top lashes.  </li>
            <li>It takes some time to get a good technique down using this</li>
            <li>I would suspect that unless you have really light lashes - this won&#x27;t do much for you - and it certainly doesn&#x27;t add volume as a mascara would.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t cover quite enough to be able to go completely without mascara but that might just be my own personal prefferance, it has really shortened up my makeup routine though :)</li>
            <li>It makes life a little more convenient, since I now can dye my lashes at home :).</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t add thickness or length, but since I hardly wear makeup it was perfect for me, because it looks so natural</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are nice and long, but you could never see them!</li>
            <li>After reading other reviews I bought some dental picks to use as applicators, not the kind for flossing, the kind with the tiny comb.</li>
            <li>Did use the &amp;#34;applicator&amp;#34; the first attempt, but the product washed right off.</li>
            <li>I bought the tiny brushes used for braces and they work great, you can get all of the upper and lower lashes coated!</li>
            <li>Also I don&#x27;t wear mascara anymore and really like the more natural look.</li>
            <li>Clear instructions and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>make sure lashes are clean and dry.</li>
            <li>This will work good if your lashes are of a brown color or less.</li>
            <li>This is a simple process to tint my eyelashes and has great lasting quality.  </li>
            <li>why not.&lt;br /&gt;This was so easy, even my 10yr old could have done it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big</li>
            <li>and honestly, with some practice, i feel like i can do a better job because i can keep my eyes open and really coat each individual</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I HAVE VERY LIGHT ALMOST BLONDE EYE LASHES.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blonde, so my lashes are very light and look non-existent without mascara.</li>
            <li>So, just to have some kind of definition to my face in stead of looking like a polar bear in a snowstorm, i have to wear make up.</li>
            <li>This product was simple to use and dyed my lashes quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>This was quick and easy to use, so I can see myself using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t fit very good and make it hard to get close enough to your lash line without getting any lashes under the pad.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, nothing spectacular it makes your eyelashes a little darker but if you are looking for the wow factor then this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time today.</li>
            <li>and if you get one this enough, will go through your lashes while applying for a more even coat.</li>
            <li>-I used a q-tip to put on the first step</li>
            <li>like regular mascara I made sure to cover both sides and got the bottom lashes as well.  </li>
            <li>so I will be sure to remember that next time!  </li>
            <li>Just used this for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I found so much FREEDOM in using this product!  </li>
            <li>The trick is to make sure you use the 1st chemical several times and allow it to soak through the hair&#x27;s cuticle.</li>
            <li>What I did get on my lashes (mostly on my lids) definitely didn&#x27;t stay on for 28 days.  </li>
            <li>, it does nothing for volume, whichis ok for daily use.  </li>
            <li>Used exactly as described in instructions</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was going for.</li>
            <li>Both my top and bottom lashes are as blonde as they were before.  </li>
            <li>I did one eye first to compare the before &amp; after affects.  </li>
            <li>me first start by saying that I have never before taken the time to post an unfavorable review.  </li>
            <li>I sit here typing this review feeling like the RCA dog with a lovely ring around my left eye.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m opening a my first studio, (NubangZ Studio)</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Another product I purchased at local beauty supply outlet did a much better job.</li>
            <li>I tried this product exactly according to package directions.  </li>
            <li>more a \\&quot;I can&#x27;t go out in public like this\\</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure the second application caused this</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.  </li>
            <li>So overall it was ok.  </li>
            <li>the top lashes put the activator on both the back and front of lashes.</li>
            <li>My lower lashes touch the skin below the eyelid, and any Vaseline would travel up higher as I tried to tint them.  </li>
            <li>The instructions state you should apply the first solution 2 to 3 times over each lash.  </li>
            <li>Like a magical layer of darkness stemming from the front of my lashes to the back.  </li>
            <li>and it REALLY helps improve results!  </li>
            <li>Use the first chemical liberally(Get it all covered..</li>
            <li>Wipe away any stain fast and it will not cause a problem!    </li>
            <li>Use the q-tips to apply petroleum jelly on both top and bottom lid, get them as close to the hair line as possible without getting any on your lashes.  </li>
            <li>Apply the colorant with the second bush, both side of the top lashes and then the bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li>it says it colors instantly, but it made me feel better.  </li>
            <li>Then I tried an \\&quot;Inter-tooth\\&quot; brush picks(available at most drug stores), that is much smaller</li>
            <li>Applying step 2 is not an exact science.  </li>
            <li>It does nothing the first application.  </li>
            <li>I have brown hair, and the tips of my lashes are blonde, so this made my eyelashes microscopically more visible.  </li>
            <li>It took so much of it to cover my lashes!</li>
            <li>I regularly use Godefroy eyebrow tint, and I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li>You have so much more potential than this.</li>
            <li>I even repeated the application the next day, the results weren&#x27;t any better.  </li>
            <li>Be aware when you feel that pain your eyes will close, and if you don&#x27;t use the eye shields your face will be colored for almost a week.</li>
            <li>I bought color remover for skin and it worked pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I worked in a spa/salon for many years and had my eyelashes tinted by the esthetician on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>First of all, the DVD did not play, neither in my computer nor in my DVD player.</li>
            <li>That was the first clue.</li>
            <li>The quality is consistent and the product does what it claims.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t last more than 4 days let alone 4 weeks.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>even though i am pretty low-maintence.</li>
            <li>First time user.</li>
            <li>Thanks Godefroy!</li>
            <li>I am a first time user</li>
            <li>this is the first time that I have used any product like this.</li>
            <li>My mascara wand came from my \\&quot;Imju Fiberwig Tiny Sniper\\&quot; mascara, but you could find a wand like this at most beauty supply stores like Sephora or Ulta</li>
            <li>This product works exactly as it says it will.</li>
            <li>Dye did not last more than a couple of days.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is because my eye lashes are already brown because those with blonde eyelashes in the reviews seemed to have satisfied results.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well, in that it makes your eyelashes darker.</li>
            <li>As many have stated, this only COLORS your lashes.</li>
            <li>First you put the dye on and then you have to put the developer on - and with the eyebrow stuff you just mix it all together and slap it on.</li>
            <li>I made sure that I didn&#x27;t have any of the first solution on my eye lid before applying the 2nd.</li>
            <li>I was pretty worried about how to rinse it off the lashes.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>who knows ;).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the color that goes on first..</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I would advise mixing the color and the developer prior to application,  rather than layering the developer on top of the color.</li>
            <li>Althouh, I had to put the gel first &amp; then the color because it didn&#x27;t work for me at first.</li>
            <li>It did not cover my gray lashes on the first try.</li>
            <li>and I feel they make the application so much easier!</li>
            <li>Since I have more applications left, I will do it again but scrape the vaseline and eye shields.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work well when first applied</li>
            <li>favorite mascara was taken off the market back in 2000.</li>
            <li>but I apply to both eyes first before applying the activator.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>Lasted 28 days or more possibly for my lashes.</li>
            <li>Followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product a year ago (2011).  </li>
            <li>However, the kit does say you may need 2 applications the first time.</li>
            <li>first time I used it</li>
            <li>Maybe we will keep trying and hopefully with practice we will finally get a better result.</li>
            <li>The first time was a disaster.  </li>
            <li>This really works and lasts!  </li>
            <li>First, do yourself a favor and dont use the applicator stick that it comes with...</li>
            <li>I suggest wiping away the petroleum jelly first because it kinda gets in the way when you try to remove the gel from your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>and whenever I run out will most definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>Just used this product for the first time.</li>
            <li>I do lower lashes first to keep the chapstick coating on my top lashes intact.&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ve gotten to the point of doing both my lower lashes at the same time</li>
            <li>After the second, it was darker and much better.</li>
            <li>did exactly what the directions suggested and rinsed my lashes afterward.  </li>
            <li>What it doesn&#x27;t mention in the directions, and would have been VERY helpful to me is: the gel colorant will bring tears to your eyes and stings like the dickens!</li>
            <li>Also, I won&#x27;t be so ambitious as to try to color the lower lashes.</li>
            <li>Instead of mixing the dye and activator together, you have to apply the dye to your lashes first, then the activator.</li>
            <li>(the first time you&#x27;d always have some lashes that weren&#x27;t reached/didn&#x27;t take)</li>
            <li>IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li>and I will forever use it.&lt;br /&gt;Couple of tips: apply to the top&lt;br /&gt;Do one eye at a time, think of it like a 4 section process, do the top lash, then bottom, then move to the next eye and repeat the process.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Another draw back is the two step process, you apply the colorant to the lashes first then the activator, each time having to make sure you get every lash root to tip.</li>
            <li>I do use the Godefroy Brown Eyebrow tint regularly and love it.  </li>
            <li>did the lower lashes first on one eye.</li>
            <li>The upper lashes are better than the lower.  </li>
            <li>All I have to buy are more tiny dental brushes.</li>
            <li>This eyelash dye was very easy to apply and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>It was very fast and easy to use - the containers and applicators make sure none of the product is wasted (and there is enough product for many uses).</li>
            <li>I have red hair and very fair skin, and I find that black looks</li>
            <li>To have them a nice dark dark brown/black all the way to the tips it super amazing.  </li>
            <li>I made sure to get all the lashes wet, and then I put more of the solution on the q-tip and did it again, just to be sure, and then let it set in for about a minute and a half.</li>
            <li>I used an old mascara brush that I cleaned and soaked first, which really helped to distribute the tint easily.  </li>
            <li>Also with this new kind, you have to wait a minute or so for the second gel to set.  </li>
            <li>I have light blond hair and bought Godefroy in black and LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is super easy and the color lasts a long time and also give my lashes body.  </li>
            <li>I love that suddenly I have longer eyelashes because the tips apparently were light.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for dying eyebrows but does next to nothing for eyelashes (at most, my eyelashes look tinted for a couple of days and have the &amp;#34;sand in eye&amp;#34; feel like when you leave mascara on for too long).</li>
            <li>so I did exactly what the directions said and found it was far superior to any other way, what a concept haha!</li>
            <li>I am a red head, to the fullest extent, I have bright copper red hair, freckles</li>
            <li>, clean your face and eye area with soap and water so your natural oils wont hinder the dye.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li>i am glad i tried it and will use it again, especially on vacation when i&#x27;m going to be swimming, not wearing much makeup etc.</li>
            <li>It definitely worked for me and did last a good 2 weeks though swimming in a chlorinated pool.  </li>
            <li>This does a good job of coloring eyelashes, but it doesn&#x27;t give the extra fullness or length you get from regular mascara.  </li>
            <li>When all is done, lashes last a good 3 - 4 weeks before next app......</li>
            <li>Use the Vaseline to keep it from dyeing your skin and getting the white sheet to stick, but really make sure you don&#x27;t get any on the lashes.</li>
            <li>Give yourself at least 30 minutes, more time is even better.</li>
            <li>Really did not darken my lashes very much.</li>
            <li>However, it cleaned up beautifully and only my lashes are black.  </li>
            <li>so I did get it pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li>The application,though, was very tricky for me the first time.</li>
            <li>I am very well aware that lash tint does not give length or fullness, so that is NOT what I am complaining about.  </li>
            <li>Use the first mascara brush to apply the activator don&#x27;t saturate it too much</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of time the first time, but really gets faster and easier with each</li>
            <li>, it really went pretty well.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes are already kind of dark</li>
            <li>my eyelashes (although very long) are super light.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel a little better about myself, that&#x27;s never a bad thing.</li>
            <li>I tried it twice, and both times it made little or no difference to my eyelashes, and did not stay on for more than 2 days!</li>
            <li>but I figure a little is better than nothing!  </li>
            <li>If you have light eyelashes or light tips on your dark lashes etc</li>
            <li>THAT time I had irritation and 3 days later as I was taking off make-up, I had more than the normal amount of eye lashes fall out.  </li>
            <li>First and foremost the most careful of people cannot avoid staining with this stuff.</li>
            <li>Once my under eye skin color went back to normal, I enjoyed having my lashes permanantly tinted.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend this idea unless you have a very steady hand, which I do.</li>
            <li>Really easy to use now, although I did forget to wash my hands after the last time and ended up with a brown stained thumb.  </li>
            <li>did notice very mild irritation of the skin, and that&#x27;s the only thing I got out of it.  </li>
            <li>I used this 3 weeks ago, and my eyelashes still have a nice, lush, long look.</li>
            <li>Looks good as soon as the stuff is applied but doesn&#x27;t really last for long.</li>
            <li>It is not a dramatic difference, but it is a difference.  </li>
            <li>better than paying $25 for a single salon job.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought a single application before investing in a large pack of 25 applications.</li>
            <li>Reading the reviews, I saw that there was a large disagreement between reviewers, with some stating that there was no color added to their lashes at all.  </li>
            <li>I wil certainly be ordering it again.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it and certainly wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.  </li>
            <li>It certainly doesn&#x27;t take the place of mascara, which thickens and lengthens.  </li>
            <li>This has been great and lasts at least two months on my lashes!</li>
            <li>I still have to wear mascara to look good; but I dye my hair black, and I&#x27;ve used this on my eyebrows to make them look like they naturally match my hair color.  </li>
            <li>It is very important to be careful as it stains the skin immediately.</li>
            <li>Have a clean, dry swab at the ready to quickly remove any staining blobs as they occur -</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use any of the pads and found if you have a pretty steady hand, you don&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li>I was older!</li>
            <li>Since getting older my beautiful long, dark eyelashes have grayed and shortened somewhat.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, since I also tint my eye brows (with an entirely different product), I had a gentle stain remover in my cupboard which has helped in lightening the blow.  </li>
            <li>I spent more time trying to get vasaline around my eyes and not on the lashes than anything</li>
            <li>and I can rub my eyes as much as I want.</li>
            <li>This makes it much easier to get all the lashes without getting it on your skin.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to rely so much on mascara when I go to the beach.</li>
            <li>They are very mini mascara wands.  </li>
            <li>Get some disposable mascara wands, it&#x27;s much easier that way.</li>
            <li>The only question I have is why doesn&#x27;t the pipet fit all the way into the Activator bottle?  </li>
            <li>The product went into my eyes and it hurt so much</li>
            <li>I have to say that it worked very well with eyebrows</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t expect too much from this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not blond, but I am only light brown.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if you are very blond, it might make a difference, but otherwise, I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money.</li>
            <li>The tint actually needs to have a pin stuck in the opening of the tube which is not mentioned, but fortunately, I had one close.</li>
            <li>Really thought this product worked well.</li>
            <li>I can now tell that mascara is the real answer for me. . . .</li>
            <li>Used too much Vaseline, or got Vaseline on their lashes.  </li>
            <li>I knew that I could not use Vaseline under my lower lashes without getting some on the lashes, thus defeating the whole intent of coloring them.  </li>
            <li>These tiny brushes are available in the toothpaste/floss section of any drug store in packs of multiples - much cheaper than the mascara wands, and much easier to use for the lower lashes than anything else.  </li>
            <li>This didn&#x27;t really do much to amend that.</li>
            <li>(I actually use the free baby \\&quot;chapstick\\</li>
            <li>It does not thicken or lengthen, nor does it purport to do so, but it does really color, and</li>
            <li>For eyelashes, this doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>Youtube even has instructions how to do it, really helpful.</li>
            <li>It was very efficient in making my lashes darker.</li>
            <li>, then I no longer could really see it.  </li>
            <li>I have no pros, so I&#x27;ll go straight to the cons list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try cleaning it with any real cleaners yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>cuz I really don&#x27;t wear much make up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;28 day mascara does not dye your eyelashes well, basically just the center on the top gets and stays colored.</li>
            <li>If the company wants to send me a replacement package I will try again and modify this review.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and when I did not see any difference I repeated the whole process all over.</li>
            <li>Be careful and you will love the results.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t tell that my lashes are tinted at all really.  </li>
            <li>This is much easier.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it works for women with very blond lashes, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li>My lashes are very blond.</li>
            <li>Did not work very well.  </li>
            <li>Dyed my lashes twice and couldn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product twice and didn&#x27;t really see results either time.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like mascara</li>
            <li>thy&#x27;re light colored, especially at the tips-</li>
            <li>It also says the pads can be trimmed to fit, if necessary.</li>
            <li>It was, and I HIGHLY suggest it!</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this product, just READ the directions and follow them!</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this product, just READ the directions and follow them!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see very well</li>
            <li>I have red hair and light eye lashes.</li>
            <li>I was very intrigued when I came across this.</li>
            <li>Ifeel like my lashes don&#x27;t fall out as fast</li>
            <li>It really shouldn&#x27;t be called mascara.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes was really really light blonde that It looked like I had no eyelashes at all (without the</li>
            <li>I have very blond, translucent eyelashes</li>
            <li>Worked very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: After over one month of using I am ready to reorder.  </li>
            <li>My lashes are visible to the very tip.  </li>
            <li>It is really just a dye.</li>
            <li>I have had my eye on this tint for my lashes for awhile--just couldn&#x27;t really afford til now.</li>
            <li>got everything ready beforehand...</li>
            <li>so my brows have really lightened up and thinned out--</li>
            <li>I really, REALLY wanted this to work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m much rather do this myself at home.</li>
            <li>I really like how my lashes look once it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li>and she said would order again if nee be shipping is always on time thanks so much</li>
            <li>It takes a bit of practice to put it on without creating much staining around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>One box is close to how much doing it twice at the salon costs.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I think part of the problem is if you get too much Vaseline, it prevents your lashes from getting the dye on them.</li>
            <li>If you miss its very permanent and since I cant see very well</li>
            <li>I did not goop too much on at once - worrying about getting it in my eye.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li>This product does not work very well on eye lashes -</li>
            <li>This product really does work darkening lighter hairs, but every person we tried it on had the unwanted side effect of dye runoff into the skin.</li>
            <li>Did not work for me, I followed instructions but did not make much of a difference in the color of my lashes.</li>
            <li>this product is so much cheaper than going to a salon...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I have light blonde hair and my eyelashes are light brown to blonde in spots.</li>
            <li>so it didn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>It makes life so much easier not having to use mascara...</li>
            <li>I have light eyelashes and always preferred putting on mascara before I left the house.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t see too much difference</li>
            <li>I spent more time trying to get the product off my skin than getting the product on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I spent about an hour trying to dye them and ended up with nothing better than what I started with.</li>
            <li>and I know it really works</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The applicators were much easier to use to apply the tint.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to reorder in black and try again, I found the application quick and easy, if it works- it would save alot of time.</li>
            <li>I have had my eyelashes professionally tinted numerous times always love the results.  </li>
            <li>Yes, my lashes are darker and it&#x27;s better than the natural blonde color they have.  </li>
            <li>Well, I used only what came in the box in addition to non-petroleum jelly (more natural form of vaseline)</li>
            <li>It does take a few applications to achieve the desired color, but I honestly don&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Essentially, this product is a great back-up plan - if you sleep in one morning and don&#x27;t have time to apply makeup, at least you won&#x27;t look completely washed out.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get a real rich charcoal black color.</li>
            <li>I had nice black eyelash when I was finished!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and had gorgeous black lashes (mine are very blonde) for 26 days.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Better but not black enough.  </li>
            <li>Super messy, everything is bound to get in your eye, it only looks nice n easy in their commercial.</li>
            <li>I have permanent eyeliner (willing to try something new)</li>
            <li>I live in Florida hot and humid.  </li>
            <li>You can purchase tint remover for your skin at any beauty supply store, for when you use hair dye, and it&#x27;s not very expensive.  </li>
            <li>The next time I was more careful using the comb (enclosed) and a disposable clean (can get at beauty supply places)</li>
            <li>but it is certainly not as easy or effective as described on the package.       </li>
            <li>I was excited to get it before I left for vacation thinking</li>
            <li>did the other lower lid with nothing but the activator and color gel and turned out much better...</li>
            <li>I am glad that I had read some of the other reviews, this made it easier to do.</li>
            <li>Honestly, if it only lasted a week, it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li>I have used many lash tint products and this is easier due to the gel consistency.</li>
            <li>If you have dark black lashes already then this product will probably not do very much for you, but it is great for lighter lashes.</li>
            <li>I have dark lashes but the tips are very light.  </li>
            <li>-use a tiny, angled (clean) mascara wand to apply the tint</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going to take me some time to get the hang of this, mainly because my eyes water so much when I use it.  </li>
            <li>I used the \\&quot;black\\&quot; shade - and it wasn&#x27;t as dark as my salon tint had been - but looks nice and natural.  </li>
            <li>I am very picky about beauty products, but I plan on using this one again and again, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>, so it is definitely worth doing if you have eyelashes that are not very dark.  </li>
            <li>I do right eye first then left then repeat.</li>
            <li>My lashes are very light &amp; I used black.</li>
            <li>have lashes that are naturally very light brown, this product immediately made them black (which is the color of the product).  </li>
            <li>I also recommend applying the petroleum jelly as indicated, especially under your eyes, very close to lash line and cover the entire top lid</li>
            <li>not sure if this is that effective.  </li>
            <li>First thing, there was NOWHERE NEAR 25 APPLICATIONS IN THE TUBE.</li>
            <li>I live this product!</li>
            <li>I used the product for the first time last month and the others were right about how hard it is so apply to your own eyes.  </li>
            <li>My eyelashes are very long and light brown/blonde.</li>
            <li>(I was very careful to make sure my lashes were clean and dry)</li>
            <li>This product costs less than one trip to salon for eyelash tinting and has MANY uses in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It just works better for me that way, and find I use less of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This lasts more like 14 days or less, not 28; but after the color wears off the skin</li>
            <li>Just be careful when using and wear gloves as it can easily stain your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have super blonde eyelashes</li>
            <li>just need to have a steady hand.</li>
            <li>I was able to reach the upper lashes from above my glasses.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like that my lower lashes show now as I&#x27;ve always despised using mascara on those.  </li>
            <li>Seriously, do not get it in your eye.</li>
            <li>The key is to be sure to apply a lot of petroleum jelly or similar product to the surrounding eye area.  </li>
            <li>as a natural blonde, i always felt like i could not leave the house without my eyebrows filled in and some mascara on...</li>
            <li>The main act according to instructions.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it, I just read the directions and did exactly what they say to do, except I bought disposable mascara brushes to apply the gel, but I&#x27;ll get back to that</li>
            <li>I will most likely go back to the salon and pay to have them do it</li>
            <li>Also, I applied to the top and bottom of each upper and lower lash, and left it on for 15 minutes before removing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a bit older</li>
            <li>I plan to re tint my lashes and it has been only two weeks but want to see if the color takes better the second time.</li>
            <li>it is strong and you do need to be careful not to get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li>very natural looking!</li>
            <li>Since eyebrow hairs are so thick and close together, this product works perfectly to make eyebrows dark and still look natural, with no clumping as with mascara or unnatural lines as with brow pencil.  </li>
            <li>Read lots of reviews and never was able to get this to stick to my eyelashes and keep them dark for more than a few days.</li>
            <li>reason for three stars is that the price is way to high for the amount given and the color is brown not black.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product, but I suggest you try another one that&#x27;s cheaper and gives a deeper color result.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and have not had any problem applying if I take my time.  </li>
            <li>high recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Anyone who has minimal hand-to-eye  coordination can apply this product successfully, w/o ANY mess or fuss.  </li>
            <li>(yeah, okay, and a little lipgloss, too.</li>
            <li>and hopefully it will just be better with a little practice.  </li>
            <li>AND IT DID - COMPLETELY!!  </li>
            <li>You will love your dark lashes!</li>
            <li>The process is a bit messy and you should make sure you have a steady hand before applying.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how easy it will be to get the Activator out after several applications and the bottle is less full.  </li>
            <li>But, it is so easy to apply, I wouldn&#x27;t even mind applying every other week.</li>
            <li>I have long lashes that are generally blonde-ish, and this worked great to add a little color.</li>
            <li>It is hard to apply but I am willing to try it again maybe with a friend to help me apply it to see if that works better.</li>
            <li>But, when I do dye them, I do the process of colorant and activator 3 times just to make sure I get every lash and to ensure that they are very dark.</li>
            <li>More than anything this stuff made my eyelids bright red and burn like crazy.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not forced to devise some miraculous cosmetic plan to cover up the damage for work.  </li>
            <li>The mascara wand makes for precise application with minimal to no</li>
            <li>This works fast, lasts  for couple of weeks, and looks absolutely natural.</li>
            <li>with thoroughly clean and dry eyelashes, skip the vaseline under the eyes  </li>
            <li>have been growing like crazy and are getting really full (nice ;-)</li>
            <li>But maybe they&#x27;ll become more \\&quot;porous\\&quot; after a few applications?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such an inexpensive product and it says you get alot of applications with it, totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I sure wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my funds.</li>
            <li>It is more trouble to do it yourself</li>
            <li>and they were pretty much the same after 3 applications.</li>
            <li>I have normal length eyelashes</li>
            <li>By the third time I had learned to use it very carefully(within a mask of Vaseline)  to draw on eyebrows exactly like I was putting on eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li>I got better at it after a few times.</li>
            <li>Make sure to use vaseline on your skin prior to dying because it&#x27;s really easy to get a tiny bit on your lash line and it will stain for a few days.</li>
            <li>After the first few applications it was just as easy as putting on regular mascara maybe just a minute longer prep time but lasted much longer of course!  </li>
            <li>&amp;Uuml; ) I&#x27;ve used the lash growth on the brows as well, for all those new pretty, long lashes and brows grow in -white!&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it is not hard at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not terribly hard to put on with a mirror, vaseline, and the skin shields.</li>
            <li>The stuff they give you is also very difficult to use, so I tried a clean mascara applicator and it worked slightly better, but you have to use more of the product which means it doesn&#x27;t last for 25 applications.</li>
            <li>I got it on our white sink and rinsed it with water right away...</li>
            <li>I do my right eye then left</li>
            <li>Best are salon treatments, if available - in MA it is now illegal (another ridiculous MA law), so it&#x27;s a hassle to find a place that will still do it.</li>
            <li>Yes, this is a true \\&quot;dye\\&quot;, and is permanent in that it does darken the lashes significantly and slowly wears off over four to six weeks.  </li>
            <li>-I didn&#x27;t bother with the Vaseline because I have a pretty steady hand and with the tiny mascara wands</li>
            <li>TO APPLY DYE AND DEVELOPER, YOU CAN EVEN WASH THEM AND REUSE OR JUST TOSS AND USE NEW EACH TIME.</li>
            <li>Live and learn.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Live and learn!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This is a new staple in my make up case.  </li>
            <li>Be very careful and you can have fantastic results.</li>
            <li>As most of the body hair bleach brands use the same materials, I&#x27;m sure that Jolene or any other similar hair bleach system (using a dry powder bleach you mix with a creme activator) will work.    </li>
            <li>I have very light and thin lashes and it seems like a lot of work to barely see this tint on my lashes and it does not seem to last more than a day for me.</li>
            <li>product is worth the money and it will last a very long time~ which makes it worth</li>
            <li>This was easy to apply (I followed cleaning and application advice from a previous user)</li>
            <li>To be clear, the stinging sensation was only on my actual eyeballs, and I expect it was just because of the fumes of the strong dye.</li>
            <li>sure that the swab is really wet and re-wet it for each of the 3 applications you will do prior to using the colorant gel.    </li>
            <li>I have blonde hair, so this product is very helpful and appreciated.  </li>
            <li>I have blonde eyelashes, and while this doesn&#x27;t thicken them, I can go without mascara - a nice, natural black color.</li>
            <li>I do one eye at a time, keeping it closed, so I&#x27;m dying the top and the bottom at the same time.</li>
            <li>Way more control of where that balm/petroleum gel goes; little to none on the stuff I am trying  to tint!</li>
            <li>I have pale blonde lashes, and my lower ones/the fine lashes in the corners of my eyes didn&#x27;t take very well on the first try.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d have to do one hand at a time, but the bleach stays good for quite a long time after you mix it up, and you can reuse the same bleach on the other hand.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Additional Tools I Use: I also use a 1) high magnification mirror to do this work, 2) clear lipstick [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a pain in the rear to apply, easy to make a mess, and unlike mascara doesn&#x27;t lengthen or thicken your lashes.</li>
            <li>A little got into my eyes and burned a lot the first time which then bled onto my skin but no blindness and no staining so as long as you use the Vaseline as directed you will be ok.</li>
            <li>I am sitting here looking at very black, completely colored lashes, top and bottom.  </li>
            <li>First I thoroughly cleaned and dried my lashes, using a mild cleanser</li>
            <li>However, if you clean the stains off immediately with a clean, dry swab (no stain remover until you are done tinting) as they occur, there will be less staining to deal with at the end.    </li>
            <li>IT ONLY WORKED THE FIRST TIME.   </li>
            <li>And ideally, especially if it&#x27;s your first attempt at it, don&#x27;t plan on going anywhere afterward.  </li>
            <li>First, I recommend watching some videos of people applying the product or similar tinting products on Youtube.com.  </li>
            <li>And usually do 2 applications at a time to make sure everything gets dyed.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last 28 days, but for my purposes, it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>the first time i used this product it didn&#x27;t seem to work, but the second time it did.  </li>
            <li>Apply the gel on the back of lashes first (also where the tinting brush is needed to get closer to the lid)then on the front of the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>used the white undereye guard on the first eye.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, it nearly burned my eyes out!</li>
            <li>I am 26 and a natural light yellow blonde.</li>
            <li>To put it simply, this product does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to the letter during the first two applications last night.</li>
            <li>i found this product and realized it was the exact same one they used on me at the salon!</li>
            <li>I left the color portion on for 3 minutes rather than one after the first application, and that helped a lot.  </li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t do much for my eyelashes-it was difficult to apply and it kind of burned my eyes.  </li>
            <li>that t he product has been opened and used I am not getting the same results as the first time.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it caused a red itchy rash under my bottom eyelid.</li>
            <li>and I used it last night for the first time.</li>
            <li>Upper first then lower lashes.  </li>
            <li>It comes with more instructions this time, but the photos are so small</li>
            <li>The pads that came with it to go under your eyes felt odd and got in the way, so I took them off and was fine without them.</li>
            <li>I have blonde lashes, so I often get them tinted at my salon, but that costs a pretty penny.  </li>
            <li>I like having at least a slightly visible eye lash, looks pretty good when I use my curler on them.  </li>
            <li>Using this was very messy, and it was mostly washed off in one day.</li>
            <li>mascara stuff was not only kind of hard to use, but mainly it just didnt do anything.</li>
            <li>the black  color is too light like almost brown.</li>
            <li>Colored my light brown lashes to black and hopefully will keep the color for the 28 days as advertised.</li>
            <li>Process quick but lashes not much darker than before.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear mascara anymore and wanted my eyelashes to be dark enough to be able to see them.  </li>
            <li>First, my order arrived much quicker than expected.  </li>
            <li>I did that but found it worked much easier if I added activator gel #2 to an individual mascara applicator (you can buy a package of 20 for very little) which applied the #2 gel much more efficiently.  </li>
            <li>took other reviewers&#x27; advice and used an old (clean) mascara wand.  </li>
            <li>Recently, I accidentally spilled the color vial in my Roux kit, and would have had to purchase a whole new kit to replace it.  </li>
            <li>This new formula is much messier and totally DID NOT WORK!  </li>
            <li>It worked so well and no mess!  </li>
            <li>Doing the lower lashes on one eye first, you can then compare them to the other eye&#x27;s lower lashes, and you will see that, if you did it correctly, the tinted lashes are much darker than the untinted ones.    </li>
            <li>but it certainly does not last 28 days for me.  </li>
            <li>one point I got a little too comfortable with the application and managed to poke myself in the eye...</li>
            <li>I took off one star because I didn&#x27;t feel the black color was as rich as it could be.</li>
            <li>It does have a little bit of a lengthening effect because most lashes are lighter at the tip, and this colors the entire lash.</li>
            <li>It will burn your eyes if you get the activator in it, but a warm wash cloth will wipe it away and it isn&#x27;t a lasting burn (I learned the hard way).</li>
            <li>I sometimes use clear mascara to still get the thickening and curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are practically clear but I&#x27;m prone to eye infections</li>
            <li>the faster you clean it off the less it will stain.    </li>
            <li>fortified clear mascara.</li>
            <li>clear-</li>
            <li>(I buy clear ones to dye my eyebrows)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I have silver/clear eyelashes (natural redhead).</li>
            <li>As far as duration, I just did it today, so I don&#x27;t know yet...    </li>
            <li>I saw this in the schwarzkopf professional supply store.</li>
            <li>going to try to get someone to help me with it but have been too busy to do it yet.</li>
            <li>However the second time was much smoother keeping these things in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you have ever had a professional eyelash tint</li>
            <li>I just want to see what I have naturally, so tinting is still my preference.    </li>
            <li>Using the mirror as well gave me a complete, clear view of each lash on my lower lid.  </li>
            <li>And it has to saturate each lash completely, hence the reapplications before moving on to the coloring step.  </li>
            <li>Yes, that brush is now kept in the kit&#x27;s box, so he doesn&#x27;t use it by mistake, but the tinting solution cleaned off completely.  </li>
            <li>Comes as complete kit with everything you need to do the job.   </li>
            <li>Although my eyes are extremely sensitive, none of the product got in my eyes or stained my skin.  </li>
            <li>I found the application process simple and it didn&#x27;t sting as much as the salon version.  </li>
            <li>liquid (activator), then #2 step of brushing on gel (colorant) directly on the lashes.</li>
            <li>A totally ineffective product that can cause you much discomfort.  </li>
            <li>I endorse the 28 day mascara completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an Esthetician and have used the professional dye for years, it lasts longer</li>
            <li>Also anywhere it touches on your skin around your eye is permanent for at least three days, so better have \\&quot;extreme\\&quot; coverage makeup.</li>
            <li>I screamed so loud.</li>
            <li>(A spider surprised me in the bathroom and my hand twitched</li>
            <li>when i found out about lash tinting, i found a salon near my house that did it for $25.</li>
            <li>bleach).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seriously sensitive eyes and it doesn&#x27;t bother them at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 58 years old woman and</li>
            <li>if I can do it with a professional look then anyone can do it.  </li>
            <li>only did them once but ready to do them again.</li>
            <li>The key is to do one eye at a time and to not put on too much product at once.    </li>
            <li>I read all of the reviews on how to make this stuff work (the instructions in the kit are completely inadequate).  </li>
            <li>So without mascara, the length is completely lost.</li>
            <li>I had NO trouble at all doing it this way, all my lashes dyed beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product does work, don&#x27;t listen to the obviously obtuse reviewers who claim it stains the whole bathroom and their hands/face, but can&#x27;t go on the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>- it works very well (and has also stayed on my eyelashes for the last three weeks) - although it does sting your eyes a bit from the chemicals.</li>
            <li>The packaging looked old as well.</li>
            <li>But then, if they did that, they wouldn&#x27;t sell much of the actual product.  </li>
            <li>and it was NOT messy.  </li>
            <li>I have had my lashes tinted professionally for years.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to start doing them at home to save money but this dye in no way compares to how they look after I have them done professionally from the salon.</li>
            <li>This stuff works really well and gives you the same results that you could get from a spa.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not at ALL someone with sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve never had that reaction</li>
            <li>It burns the eyes, even there is no harm and it says it&#x27;s a &#x27;natural&#x27; product</li>
            <li>I have short brown lashes and it really didn&#x27;t make a difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li>do it for me at the salon.rand, or have a professional</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this product</li>
            <li>if you ask me) and damn near clear eyelashes and brows.</li>
            <li>use an old mascara wand for the corners I feel</li>
            <li>Does not last 28 days as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Apply like mascara - will work much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I did not cover every lash very well, but it makes a big difference for me .</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical of this item after reading the different reviews, but glad I went ahead and tried it.&lt;br /&gt;Fairly simple to use, just take your time and make sure all directions are clear before you start.</li>
            <li>All I ended up with is eyelashes so dark and now full</li>
            <li>If you choose to give this product a shot you MUST make sure the petroleum-based product you coat the skin around your eye with before starting the tinting process is heavy on the petroleum side.  </li>
            <li>True, this product does make you lashes dark.</li>
            <li>Make sure you take the time to prep all your supplies and only do 1 eye at a time because it can be messy and it will sting and make your eyes water.  </li>
            <li>So I reapplied the bleach on those areas again for a few more minutes and all the stains were totally gone, even around and underneath my fingernails.      </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will say that the applicator stick is kind of a pain in the butt to work with, and I personally think it sucks.</li>
            <li>I pushed wand into activator and applied to lashes (a few times to get them nice and wet) and then applied color gel to wand and wipe through lashes till covered the way I like.  </li>
            <li>The petroleum jelly was good, but it&#x27;s difficult to not get it on the eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I dont really need them, i just put a little vaseline around my eyes, if i get it on my skin it wipes right up with a cotton swab.</li>
            <li>The instructions make the application process sound easy, but if your experience is anything like mine you will get frustrated with the under-eye pads, which come loose easily even when they are coated in Vaseline.</li>
            <li>You need to devote sufficient timeto the whole tinting process, and to do only one set of lashes (upper right, lower right, upper left, lower left), at a time.  </li>
            <li>I found this product to be very easy to apply with minimal mess.  </li>
            <li>The tint was visible right after application on my left eye, but disappeared after showering the next day.  </li>
            <li>I have pale, light brown/blonde lashes and</li>
            <li>Easy to use as long as you follow directions carefully.  </li>
            <li>The reason I am editing my review is that I have stumbled across an easy way to quickly remove all dye stains from your hands, which are almost inevitable as no one can really work with those silly hair dye gloves on.  </li>
            <li>I applied the first product and let it dry...</li>
            <li>I am expecting the tint to last for about 2&amp;1/2-3 weeks, I will update this review if it lasts for a significantly shorter or longer period than expected.</li>
            <li>this product is easy to use, but I have used a lot of this stuff in the past.</li>
            <li>It was not as black and very black mascara, but I was overal very pleased with the color and  look.</li>
            <li>No mess, no pain,</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll have virtually no mess.</li>
            <li>the best - thick black mascara looks too harsh on me, but as this is just a dye, it has a soft look, doesn&#x27;t thicken or clump like mascara.</li>
            <li>I have been wanting to purchase this product for many years and the price finally came down, I could not resist!!  </li>
            <li>Be very careful applying this, but it&#x27;s well worth the effort.  </li>
            <li>It was still not black.  </li>
            <li>I took off my mascara, then washed my face, paying particular attention to my lashes, using actual soap.  </li>
            <li>I used a brush with two sides, and dropped some of the ingredients into separate small dishes, to try to be sure the contents of the two tubes stayed apart until I mixed them as directed.    </li>
            <li>Instead they look darker (but not black).</li>
            <li>Following some online advice from another site, the first time I used this I actually applied it twice.  </li>
            <li>I repeated the application of small amounts of tint until I had covered every bit of each lash, I also applied tint to both the top and bottom sides of my upper lashes.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my eyelashes dyed at the salon in the past - but wanted to dye the top lashes only -</li>
            <li>It still is not as dark as it would be with mascara, however, I am comfortable enough to go without mascara now.</li>
            <li>Then you need to wait one minute (or a little longer is OK), for the developer to dry.  </li>
            <li>I have dark hair and eyebrows, but very light eyelashes, so I thought I would give these a try, since I actively swim, jog, etc.  </li>
            <li>Did VERY little to imporove the look of my light brown lashes and the product was skimpy...</li>
            <li>Have tried several rounds of dying, trying to get the knack of it and basically can get a bit on the top row of lashes, but the bottom lashes are hardly touched  and the corner lashes are almost completely untouched.  </li>
            <li>-By being very careful and applying only small amounts of tint at a time, I was able to avoid getting very much on my skin.</li>
            <li>I always felt so self conscious about how &#x27;bare&#x27; my eyes looked without eyeliner and mascara.</li>
            <li>I usually wear brown mascara, but the brown in this product was too light.</li>
            <li>I followed all of the directions carefully, but on my first try, none of the color stayed on my lashes at all.</li>
            <li>No, my lashes are not naturally dark...</li>
            <li>However, my lash tips are blonde, and my lashes only look long and full when I use mascara.</li>
            <li>However, the color does not last more than a few showers, especially if you scrub your face the way that I do.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not dark.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I got a bit of staining (like wide eyeliner) around my eyes which looked</li>
            <li>Well, I guess that is true in two weeks when the dead skin cells fall off.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be careful notto rub your eye very much, and when drying- just gently pat your eyes dry.</li>
            <li>And the little bit you are lucky to get on the lashes doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li>My eye lashes are long, fine, and sort of dark.  </li>
            <li>The tint is fine, but the gel activator is VERY eye irritating (hurts like a MF).</li>
            <li>The product sounded good, but it was a bit messy and hard to apply.</li>
            <li>A little hard at first to get used to using, but I am getting better, and know I like it.</li>
            <li>First go left one side light and the other side a little 2 toned</li>
            <li>Try to let your lashes dry before doing too much else, and don&#x27;t wash or use makeup remover for 24 hours or so.  </li>
            <li>I can see that if you have totally blonde lashes than this will give an improvement, but if just blonde on the ends this doesn&#x27;t make them stand out much.  </li>
            <li>I could at least see it on the top lashes but didn&#x27;t make enough change to buy again.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had my lashes tinted at salons many times over the years, and this product can provide salon-quality results...but it may take you a few tries to get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>had had my eyelashes tinted professionally in the past and was truely intimidated about performing the process myself.</li>
            <li>My husband said it looks very natural and makes my almond shaped eyes look like they are open wider.</li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t figure out how a single person had issues with the application process.</li>
            <li>Afterwards it was barely noticeble &amp; what color there was washed out in two days!</li>
            <li>I have long, thick lashes, but the tips of them are light making them seem shorter and sparser than they really are.</li>
            <li>Two major drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was hopeful it would last and keep me from having to constantly wear mascara, especially during the hot sweaty summer months.</li>
            <li>If you go to YouTube and search this product, Godefroy has a video tutorial showing exactly how to apply it, and it&#x27;s extremely helpful.&lt;br /&gt;Using</li>
            <li>These last tints usually take better the second time.</li>
            <li>The included pads used to put under the eye to protect the skin need to be cut way down to fit under the eyes and don&#x27;t stick very well, even when glopped with Vaseline, as advised in the instructions, so some staining happens which takes a few days to wear off.  </li>
            <li>first you have to paste on the eye shields with petroleum jelly that you have to get yourself, the eye shields are very large and need to be cut and still make it hard to open your eyes</li>
            <li>This eyelash tint performs as described - it tints your eyelashes black, quickly, fairly easily, and not too messy if you have a steady hand.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this product for eyelashes unless you&#x27;re a very light-skinned blonde; but if you dye your hair black or dark brown from a light color, you can use this product to make your brows pop.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I felt the color (black) wasn&#x27;t as dark as I would&#x27;ve liked; but then again my blonde eyelashes are practically invisible.  </li>
            <li>The bottom lashes didn&#x27;t seem to tint as dark, but it could be that they are just so fine that it&#x27;s harder to see.      </li>
            <li>My lashes are now a deep, rich black color!</li>
            <li>This was very easy to use, but not sure I will continue to use since it didn&#x27;t make my lashes as dark as I would like.  </li>
            <li>but it was hard to tell because they&#x27;re relatively light.</li>
            <li>You get more control with the fan brush too so less mess.</li>
            <li>To apply the balm I use an actual small angled paint brush (generally available at any craft store).  </li>
            <li>Now, at 50, my lashes are still long, but not nearly as thick, and have faded to a lighter brown, with the tips almost invisible.  </li>
            <li>Especially if you curl the eyelash and then apply clear mascara.</li>
            <li>Now I just apply clear mascara over my lashes and it looks like I have on regular mascara without the running or raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li>It really does last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;ll probably just use water to completely was it off rather than trying to wipe it with a tissue.</li>
            <li>I will go back to a professional.</li>
            <li>I used an old one from my last mascara tube after washing it well)!    </li>
            <li>stings your eyes if you are not really careful.</li>
            <li>And no, I do not have extra sensitive</li>
            <li>I already have pretty dark lashes</li>
            <li>never happened when I got my eyelashes professionally tinted, so it must be this specific formula.</li>
            <li>Second time I prepped my lashes just as instructed, and used an old mascara wand to apply.</li>
            <li>the color barely showed up on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>The amount of dye was barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>My lashes barely have any color after four repeated treatments.  </li>
            <li>In fact my last application I settled for directly dying my skin so that my \\&quot;eyeliner\\&quot; matches and forgetting about getting my eyelashes dyed.</li>
            <li>If you get too much in one area, use a lash brush to redistribute while it is still wet.  </li>
            <li>As I said, only one eye was sensitive...</li>
            <li>The trick to not letting it sting you eyes is to just gently hold your eyelid closed.</li>
            <li>Holy Mary, mother of God!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the results lasted barely two weeks.</li>
            <li>Time to find a different brand, or have a professional</li>
            <li>I was careful with the petroleum jelly and the eye guards, but it turned out I didn&#x27;t really need them</li>
            <li>I apply the gel twice and the dye once finishing one eye completely before moving to the next.  </li>
            <li>my lashes look no different and my skin is completely stained.</li>
            <li>I used two different mascara brushes that I cleaned up from old mascara tubes I had laying around.  </li>
            <li>wanted mine pretty dark</li>
            <li>have only applied one application so far.</li>
            <li>They are darker but I can barely tell ...</li>
            <li>but I can barely tell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The final step where you use a damp tissue to remove the product did sting a bit but everything was back to normal within a minute.</li>
            <li>Just be careful not to get it IN your eye, somehow I managed to get a tiny bit the first time I used it</li>
            <li>Just be careful not to get it IN your eye, somehow I managed to get a tiny bit the first time I used it</li>
            <li>So for the amount of results seen on my eyelashes, wasn&#x27;t worth the effort of applying every few weeks.</li>
            <li>The application wand that comes in the package is hardly an effective tool to apply the product, and it is difficult to avoid staining your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Applying the colorant right after makes it glob a little and it looks darker</li>
            <li>Back then, the box contained q-tip like cotton applicators, a glass bottle with clear liquid (that goes on first), and a tube of black gel</li>
            <li>Recently spas in my area (W. WA) have stopped dying lashes - new laws or regulations about too much potential danger to the eyes ---</li>
            <li>With common sense, it is easy to make the necessary adjustments.  </li>
            <li>Wish It came with more applicators and was made so it was less messy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident I will be quicker and less messy.  </li>
            <li>It is tricky to use, will take a few times to get right.</li>
            <li>I have to say at first I was a little afraid of how safe this really was since both the product and petroleum jelly say not to get in eyes!</li>
            <li>If you are very careful, or can get a friend to help, this is certainly cheaper than a salon.</li>
            <li>I used the product (in black) twice on the first eye and the difference was virtually nonexistent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clearly not black even after doing the application several</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply and stays dark for at least 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li>Although it is a little tedious to put on, it worked great.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty preoccupied with dealing with the mess and may not have fully coated the lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other products that irritated too much.  </li>
            <li>and then both my upper lashes at the same time making this whole process post shower about five-ten minutes long)</li>
            <li>, they might waste a little more product though.&lt;br</li>
            <li>you have missed some lashes or it is not dark enough</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference and hard to apply</li>
            <li>Hard to apply, stings and really doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>If you get black in step one on your skin, finish applying it to your lashes and clean it up with a wet Q-tip.  </li>
            <li>Some of the reviewers have been having trouble with this product not setting or washing off, and I think the trick is to start with really clean dry lashes.  </li>
            <li>So, I tried the do-it-at-home kits, starting with Roux, the old standby, purchased at a local beauty supply store for about $32.  </li>
            <li>I usually spend about an hour in the bathroom doing this, but that&#x27;s because I love my lashes to be extremely dark</li>
            <li>I found that the tint is activated when your lashes are damp, not dry.  </li>
            <li>But I wound up going to a salon (and paying more) to have it done professionally after the two containers became useless.  </li>
            <li>But the result is nice, and I can do without mascara for a few weeks, at least.</li>
            <li>I applied the product exactly as instructed, but when I rinsed at the end, all of the product simply ran down the drain.</li>
            <li>My first try though resulted in a bit messy \\&quot;liner\\&quot;, so I&#x27;ll try a thin eye liner brush next time, as well as a mascara wand, which would probably help to reach every lash better than the provided q-tip.    </li>
            <li>This makes them dark and look fuller by catching every little hair and making them dark.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t as deep of a black tint as I&#x27;d hoped, but it was pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once you rinse the solutions off and your lashes dry, they will separate back to normal.</li>
            <li>A few hours after application my eyes do feel a bit sensitive, sort of similar to the way they feel a few hours after chopping a strong onion or swimming in a chlorinated pool.</li>
            <li>If you have really dark lashes already you probably won&#x27;t get much of a result.</li>
            <li>First time I tried it, I followed instructions and it was a total mess.</li>
            <li>I dyed my lashes today, and made a much greater mess of my hands than usual.  </li>
            <li>The tint worked well enough to get those, but really made no difference to the other parts of my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read other reviews and did the following:  used inter-dental brushes for the color and activator, they work very well.  </li>
            <li>I have very blonde eyelashes that you could barely see.</li>
            <li>Nowhere near as long as when I have it done in a salon.</li>
            <li>so I rarely use mascara (and usually end up regretting it).</li>
            <li>Oh well..... wasn&#x27;t the first time I wasted money like that.  </li>
            <li>After allowing the tint to dry for a few minutes, I washed my eyes with mild face wash (I use baby wash).</li>
            <li>Dont put too much product on, it shouldnt be running off or spilling down your face.</li>
            <li>Took a couple times to get the application down, but gets much easier.</li>
            <li>I read several comments that it was hard to apply...and they were right!  </li>
            <li>If you avoid rubbing your eyes and gently pat your eyes dry, you can get it to last a long time.     </li>
            <li>It was a little tricky the first time but by the 3rd I am a pro!</li>
            <li>The only problem I had was that when I opened the first tube, it spurted out a little.  </li>
            <li>It will not make you look as if you are wearing mascara, which thickens and adds length to lashes, but the tint will make your lashes a dark, rich black color.</li>
            <li>Next time - and I will try at least one more time - I will be VERY CAREFUL in the application of the gel colorant.</li>
            <li>My lashes are already dark brown so perhaps it was naive of me to expect any more than what I got.  </li>
            <li>, I applied liberally, three separate times, waiting for it to dry completely.  </li>
            <li>Your lashes really do get black and they stay that way.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t last long at all, also there is nowhere near 25 applications as promised.</li>
            <li>The only slightly messy part happened when I first punctured the tube of colorant, but I was expecting that, so I had a hand towel</li>
            <li>The new box contains 2 differently shaped plastic applicators (a comb type and a plain stick type), and then the black gel you put on first, and then a clear gel you put on second.  </li>
            <li>Small tube goes on first, let it dry, large tube goes on second, let it dry, wash off.</li>
            <li>It was very messy and the color came right off....would not recommend</li>
            <li>The dark patches wear off after a couple showers, and the same is true of any dark patches caused by the 28 Day mascara.  </li>
            <li>(I was afraid it would be messy after reading other reviews), but I was very happy after I finally tried it last night.</li>
            <li>I let mine dry completely before moving on to the next step.</li>
            <li>The application was not hard at all regardless of other reviews.</li>
            <li>My eyelashes are blonde and this made them slightly darker, but i felt like it was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>I only have a few grey eyelashes but don&#x27;t like mascara, it always flakes and I have tried every brand from too expensive to inexpensive and it all works the same, so this is a great solution.  </li>
            <li>it works good but stains the skin and it difficult ti use without a mess</li>
            <li>I think the main thing is to get a dark enough color so that it shows up.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave the skin dry or noticeably lightened where the bleach was applied, although it might if you left it on too long or have dark skin - just be careful to apply precisely to the stain in that case.  </li>
            <li>like I do you can use this then use a clear mascara to get the wet look.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The color was perfect.</li>
            <li> If you just want to have some color to your lashes for the times when you do not wear mascara, than is GREAT!  </li>
            <li> and I have to say it looks great!  </li>
            <li> Best of luck.</li>
            <li> &quot; (for cleaning braces) was a perfect applicator, and</li>
            <li> and I have the best control over where the tint goes; I did attach a picture so you can compare the sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great!  </li>
            <li> I was nervis to buy and to try this but its great!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t elongate or thicken like a mascara would, but it is not advertised that it does, so it is great!</li>
            <li> It was perfect for my trip.</li>
            <li> The product is ABSOLUTELY excellent!!!</li>
            <li> Great eyelash/eyebrow tint!  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with the permanent eyelash tint kit by Godefroy.  </li>
            <li> this is also a great tip for applying mascara!</li>
            <li> and I got excellent results.</li>
            <li> OMG---This product is the best.  </li>
            <li> This was the perfect tool for applying the tint.</li>

            <li> Very happy!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are so happy not to have to wear mascara!</li>
            <li> Very happy!</li>
            <li> However, it was amazing on my eyebrows!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to wake up already looking made up!  </li>
            <li> This product is so so at best.</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> But after all, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m very happy with the results&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> And yes I followed the directions perfectly.</li>
            <li> works great on eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I bought the disposable mascara brushes, it fits PERFECTLY in the hole of the plug for the no 1 Activator jar, scrapes the excess off too.  </li>
            <li> At best, I look like a brunette without eye make-up.</li>
            <li> GREAT!!</li>
            <li> I am duly impressed with my results!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> That is the BEST suggestion</li>
            <li> Great price, too!</li>
            <li> This product is great!</li>
            <li> So although the &amp;#34;permanent pencil&amp;#34; look fades, it is wonderful for a weekend trip.  </li>
            <li> so I completed the process twice and am very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> My mother and best friend are now eager to try it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The price is great too !!!</li>
            <li> I have very fair eyelashes</li>
            <li> Very very good product.</li>
            <li> However, based on how things are going, I&#x27;d say there is a very good chance it would.</li>
            <li> so I should have been an ideal candidate for this product.  </li>
            <li> good luck!</li>
            <li> Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I like waking up in the morning and looking good!</li>
            <li> Soon you&#x27;ll have beautiful lashes at a fraction of the cost at a salon.</li>
            <li> Mascara brush didn&#x27;t work and the applicator isn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li> Definately has a great color.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the results for about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> then this is great.  </li>
            <li> this will be great to not add mascara every day.</li>
            <li> AND YOUR EYELASHES WILL LOOK GREAT.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great; don&#x27;t have to think about it, off we go.</li>
            <li> and the results are great.</li>
            <li> the price this stuff is great....</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for eyebrows but my lashes did not change...</li>
            <li> Appreciate the great service.  </li>
            <li> LOL AT PERMENANT.</li>
            <li> I am sooooo happy that I decided to dye them.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  </li>
            <li> Great results.</li>
            <li> My lashes were blond and invisible, but now look great.</li>
            <li> Oh and the price is great too.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes look great</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT.</li>
            <li> My wife reports the product&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> The seller was great and shipped it immediately.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> The product for eyebrows works great</li>
            <li> I have no problem with the seller, great, prompt transaction.  </li>
            <li> he may have just been trying to make me happy...</li>
            <li> This is a great product and I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Like me!&lt;br /&gt;**i also use this brand eyebrow tint and it is great as well.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the price too.</li>
            <li> This was great</li>
            <li> I have experienced no irritation whatsoever with Godefroy.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m SOOO happy</li>
            <li> Great for summer if you don&#x27;t want to use mascara every day in the heat.</li>
            <li> and I used this to darken that spot and it worked great.</li>
            <li> works great</li>
            <li> This product is great.  </li>
            <li> This product work great.  </li>
            <li> It probably works best on very very light lashes.</li>
            <li> I have very light eyelashes and thought this was going to be wonderful.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING!</li>
            <li> My lashes and brows look amazing!</li>
            <li> so I am sure I did a perfect application.  </li>
            <li> I tried both a cotton swab and a mascara brush but wasn&#x27;t overly successful.  </li>
            <li> and I really liked it!</li>
            <li> It was so easy to apply and looks great!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and awesome results.</li>
            <li> is the best product and easy to use if you take your time and have a magnifying mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I debated on this for a good couple weeks before buying.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found a good brush to use.</li>
            <li> good luck and remember</li>
            <li> Wanting a good tint, I applied it three days in a row.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of staining the skin on your fingers and around your eyelashes though.  </li>
            <li> Good product-- does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> It darken lashes fairly well.</li>
            <li> The product does a good job but in the information it says it can be used on eyebrows also.  </li>
            <li> Lasts about 3 good weeks.  </li>
            <li> The burning and tearing lasted a good 15 minutes afterwards and the redness stayed through the end of the night.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps this product works well for fair haired people, but heaven help you if you get it in your eye.</li>
            <li> I got good results with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used mascara on my bottom lashes, so this was a good improvement.</li>
            <li> It would be good for blonds that want darker lashed</li>
            <li> I got fair to good results.</li>
            <li> It does dye lashes good but applicator provided is not helpfull.</li>
            <li> Instructions are good and the end result of the application is quite satisfactory.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think my experiences with this product were good</li>
            <li> However, it is good to note in no way</li>
            <li> Delivery was good.</li>
            <li> To be fair, the product admits this could be an issue and advises pads and oil barriers, but that hinders the application&#x27;s effectiveness to a degree.</li>
            <li> I just dyed my eyelashes using this product with good results.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was a good candidate for this product...</li>
            <li> This is a good one.</li>
            <li> , I have to repeat every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> So when I wake up in the morning or go to yoga and don&#x27;t feel like putting on make-up, I still look good.</li>
            <li> I tried using it 3 times, on clean lashes, and the result is spotty at best.</li>
            <li> Very good, easy to use and gives long-lasting result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Interesting it was great for brows</li>
            <li> I was also very pleased to find out that this product is made in Sweden, which lessened my fear that it would damage or hurt my eyes.</li>
            <li> of Day 1 - I am very pleased with this product - 5</li>
            <li> Co. Bigelow (at Bath &amp; Body Works) produces a lovely rose fragranced balm which I&#x27;ve discovered works splendidly.  </li>
            <li> Once that&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s just a matter of barely touching your lashes with the colorant gel and presto!</li>
            <li> I thought that I would soak my hands, and the try to file off the top layers of my skin with a nail file (does work, but not sufficiently to rob a bank!).    </li>
            <li> this works BETTER!</li>
            <li> I love this tint!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> What is better is that I save time and money (and avoid discomfort!)</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> in conclusion, I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> They look outstanding!</li>
            <li> So in conclusion, I LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> They look outstanding!</li>
            <li> Results are OK!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I have applied this one time and got it perfect from the first time.</li>
            <li> I have read so many reviews for and against and the just &#x27;so-so&#x27;s&#x27;, but I will tell you I have put this on my lashes--and brows!  </li>
            <li> There are better products out there!</li>
            <li> I love waking up looking like I&#x27;ve done my eyes!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> This is fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Definitely love it on my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> Great, easy to use product.</li>
            <li> so I need not wear mascara in Mexico easy to do works great and lasts</li>
            <li> The stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Because there are times I use this, and my lashes look amazing after; and then there are times I use it, and</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Thinking perhaps I had made some kind of mistake</li>
            <li> (and I do my own gel nails, too)  </li>
            <li> Since I own it now, I&#x27;ll give it another try at some point.</li>
            <li> eye\\&quot; kind of eyeliner way, either...</li>
            <li> &quot; kind of way.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never had that kind of lash fall-out before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> more time consuming but good for accuracy.    </li>
            <li> Once that happens, the product is no longer effective.  </li>
            <li> and I loved being able to roll out of bed and not think about mascara or raccoon eyes after a swim.  </li>
            <li> i liked the product.  </li>
            <li> I am thrilled w/the results.</li>
            <li> The product may have accomplished that - but slightly at best.</li>
            <li> Do it in your own home and not spend money to have someone do it for you at spa.</li>
            <li> This was easier than that process but just not as effective.  </li>
            <li> Nice color.</li>
            <li> I keep a bottle of saline handy and rinse my eye if that happens.</li>
            <li> it is so nice to not have to wear mascara - which I was always rubbing off resulting in \\&quot;racoon</li>
            <li> I liked the product, it works...</li>
            <li> Keep Q tips handy to remove smudges on eyelids.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t have a problem with applying this product.</li>
            <li> but I used my own.</li>
            <li> and I did come up nice.</li>
            <li> eye did kind of sting when I put on the activator...</li>
            <li> one lash at a time kind...</li>
            <li> That way you eyelid will create a nice seal.</li>
            <li> Nice to have it  at home, ...</li>
            <li> I probably did not get it as close to the roots as I would have liked -</li>
            <li> but it does add a nice bit of color that frames my eyes when I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect to like this product, but I thought I&#x27;d order it and give it a try.  </li>
            <li> wait another min and go wash your eyelashes off with warm water.  </li>
            <li> and I used my own mascara wand.</li>
            <li> but, I found that the applicator in the package was really the best tool.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t help with the \\&quot;fine\\&quot; issue, but the darker color is nice.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes did stay tinted for weeks, it was nice, I liked it.</li>
            <li> If you have someone who has a steady hand and you can trust, it would be best if they apply it for you.    </li>
            <li> You may have tinted your lower lashes successfully, but not appreciate that fact as you are not using a sufficient light or magnification to see them.  </li>
            <li> I rub the two coats in well each time, ensuring a longer-lasting, full hair-length application - and my brows look great.  </li>
            <li> This is amazing and so easy to apply!  </li>
            <li> I thought the applicator that came with it was better than a mascara brush, was more pinpoint and turning it sideways did good.</li>
            <li> Why cheaper than getting it done at a salon and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased disposable mascara brushes so it was very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Instructions were very easy to read and follow.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> 1 coat is more than okay!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s best just to go to a professional salon and have them do the tinting or just use mascara.</li>
            <li> I purchased thie product in hopes to be able to do my own lashes at home rather than in a spa   </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear mascara unless I&#x27;m going out, so it&#x27;s really nice to have more visible lashes all the time.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> kayak, hike - outdoorys stuff that isn&#x27;t always convenient to apply/remove/clean up mascara, (or cool!!....</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply and stays on for weeks without reapplication!</li>
            <li> It was easy!</li>
            <li> thinking if I dye them twice it will work better.&lt;br /&gt;Was really easy to apply &amp; had no problems with it!</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, the application is so easy!  </li>
            <li> They are also very fine.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I took off a star because i think the instrusctions and materials givent o use it oculd have been better, but with the purchase of my own i love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great, highly effective product, and if you use it correctly it will absolutely work.</li>
            <li> I have pretty great coverage.  </li>
            <li> It worked great the first time, although I had to leave it on for 35 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> it dyed it just  fine!</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very light colored.  </li>
            <li> I have very light eyelashes &amp; am a Redhead.</li>
            <li> They were helpful but after a couple of hours all I&#x27;ve gotten is some very lightly dyed eyelashes and my eyes are burning like a son of a *</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and ahead of schedule, in good condition.  </li>
            <li> As others have said, a mascara brush would probably be better than the swabs supplied if your lashes are very light.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased got it quick too very happy Thanks</li>
            <li> More like 14 days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy this again for sure and</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much better.</li>
            <li> In any case, it&#x27;s a week later, my eyelase still look awesome</li>
            <li> : OK so I love this stuff now.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Then I tried it my way, worked much better, but still nothing.  </li>
            <li> Okay, I purchased this through my Dads amazon for the prime shipping.</li>
            <li> It was ok-I ended up dying my fingers more than my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Use gloves, the stains won&#x27;t come off your nails for 3 weeks or more.</li>
            <li> and I was satisfied with my transaction.  </li>
            <li> I am SO glad I did.</li>
            <li> eyeliner butm lashes are barely more visible than before.</li>
            <li> but I like how my eyes are more defined with darker lashes, so I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> when I wiped it off, since in doing so, it got in my eyes a bit, but I will continue to use this product to see if I can master the application process and hopefully more noticeable lashes over time.</li>
            <li> Hope this helped:)</li>
            <li> I used three coats to make sure the lashes were saturated.</li>
            <li> I was able to go over the lashes a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> I, however, have just come to realize that I rely on mascara for much more than just color, but also to add volume and length.  </li>
            <li> I did apply it so that it would look like eyeliner (top lid) if it did stain</li>
            <li> Works ok for applying the activator but not the color gel.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It felt safe, no sting.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product.</li>
            <li> Works much better.</li>
            <li> But I think that&#x27;s more about my lash turnover than the product.  </li>
            <li> I have had my lashes tinted at the salon over many years.  </li>
            <li> I decided to go for it anyway, and am glad I did.    </li>
            <li> I wear reading glasses, and I was able to wear them WHILE I tinted my lashes, and also used a magnifying makeup mirror (one with a stand).  </li>
            <li> Do one eye at a time was much better for me...</li>

            <li> I love being able to do this treatment at home.  </li>
            <li> Does not stay more than 12 hours.  </li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> I may try it again, taking the noted precautions, just to see if it works better.</li>
            <li> It honestly didn&#x27;t make a difference at all, and I have light lashes.</li>
            <li> Okay, so, yes, this stuff did tint my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The manufacturer needs to develop an easier and  better application technique for this product.</li>
            <li> They now include more functional tools to apply it with and improved the formula as well</li>
            <li> so it goes on better.</li>
            <li> I love semi-permanent time saving fixes.</li>
            <li> I have used this kit about 3 times, and after each time I have used it, many more eyelashes fall out than the norm, and this continues for weeks.  </li>
            <li> i had more product in my eyes than on my eye lashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But if you&#x27;re someone who is really good at figuring these things out (or have a colorist&#x27;s background and know your stuff), then this is worth trying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure most people wouldn&#x27;t think anything of it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it probably takes me well under 10 minutes to do both eyes, one at a time, top and bottom.</li>
            <li> so the process was more efficient.</li>
            <li> This is okay per the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it did not do much better.  </li>
            <li> I think it would be better called a stain rather than dye.  </li>
            <li> I worked in a salon for years and have had my lashes dyed many times.  </li>
            <li> I found I was much better at keeping it out of my eyes and treating the problem once it did get in my eyes than the pro.</li>
            <li> #34;done up&amp;#34; just to feel comfortable!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> and I am so satisfied.  </li>
            <li> The results will really make you happy as it did me.  </li>
            <li> I have never written a review before, but I am so pleased with this product that I have to share it.</li>
            <li> Since using this most times I don&#x27;t even need mascara.</li>
            <li> It would be wonderful to have a way to buy these separately, or have the kit hold a slightly larger amount.</li>
            <li> I have more control at home</li>
            <li> Since I despise mascara, i thought I&#x27;d give this a try, and I&#x27;m glad</li>
            <li> But I wasn&#x27;t...&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> But I wasn&#x27;t...&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I love this mascara tint.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> You may even want to do top and lower lashes separate rather than trying to do one eye at a time.  </li>
            <li> It needs a better applicator as those wands could be improved.</li>
            <li> I read many reviews and use a mini mascara wand to apply both the color and activator.</li>
            <li> If the color touched my skin, I made sure to wipe it off immediately so it didn&#x27;t stain like others have said it does.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> If I had thicker eyelashes it would have probably been much better.  </li>
            <li> I just wanted to make sure.</li>
            <li> I rinsed that eye really good after that and tried again with success.</li>
            <li> I must admit I tried to use the cotton eye shields, but they were more of a hindrance</li>
            <li> Product is ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I only did one application (as apposed to two to make it even darker) and am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> &#x3D;)  </li>
            <li> I love this eyelash tint.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE PRODUCT, IT HAS MADE ME LOOK FORWARD</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten better results with Olay&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> I thought this would darken my eye lashes more than it does.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all about preference though :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just over the top.</li>
            <li> I then used a separate lash wand and the coverage was much better.  </li>
            <li> I hope it does a better job</li>
            <li> I was able to get it almost all the way to the roots and didn&#x27;t even use a shield.</li>
            <li> I did put lots of moisturizer around my eyes so I would be able to wipe them off, but didn&#x27;t end up needing to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually did it twice on my lashes--upper and lower and got really beautiful results!</li>
            <li> Much better experience  </li>
            <li> and it worked better.  </li>
            <li> If you curl your lashes afterwards with a eyelash curler, your lashes will look more pronounced.</li>
            <li> elaborate usage</li>
            <li> Not having to apply mascara daily has been priceless!!!</li>
            <li> but I found out disposable mascara applicators work better</li>
            <li> This worked better than trying to do the top and the bottom separately--that&#x27;s when the stuff got in my eye.</li>
            <li> but I had to do the application many times to get the desired results.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for the application, it went on as described (plus I watched a video online for more info).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I will get better as time goes on.</li>
            <li> For me though anything is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I love Godefroy&#x27;s eyebrow tint, so I decided to try this</li>
            <li> This is my favorite never-be-without beauty product.</li>
            <li> I like this product works better on eyebrow but</li>
            <li> I kept it on my eyebrow &amp; eyelash more than 30mins</li>
            <li> Yes I would recommend this product :-)</li>
            <li> This is my solution to not being able to wear mascara-</li>
            <li> also there is no flaking, smearing, or racoon eyes like many non allergic mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It does burn if you get it in your eye, but not horribly.</li>
            <li> I have ordered once before and was impressed enough to order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m okay with admitting that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this product &amp; will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m sure the reviews did), I would have proceeded with more caution.</li>
            <li> (Straight A&#x27;s lol...).</li>
            <li> Make sure you cover your counters when you use this.</li>
            <li> It does &#x27;TINT&#x27; the eyelashes, however, I was expecting it to be more of a mascara.  </li>
            <li> In the directions it says \\&quot;apply to top of lashes\\</li>
            <li> Love this stuff</li>
            <li> You can notice the difference more if you curl your lashes.</li>
            <li> I tried this because I can&#x27;t be bothered to do more than a powder foundation most mornings...</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Easy &amp; great product, a dream come true for gals or guys with light eyelashes.</li>
            <li> lashes look very natural and beautiful.</li>
            <li> (test on skin first like they suggest!!!)  </li>
            <li> I then used a MASCARA BRUSH to apply the gel---I got pretty good coverage...  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at it.</li>
            <li> This does a pretty good job of making my lashes darker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 and still have pretty good eyelashes.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to find this on pinterest and purchase here!  </li>
            <li> It makes this product SO user friendly!</li>
            <li> The new improvements are great.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the results, here are a few tips that I think will help you achieve great results too:     1)</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how easy it would be to do this myself</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fair hair, fair skin, blue eyes....</li>
            <li> but it brings them all out and makes me feel more confident and comfortable to just go out without make up or some vitamin</li>
            <li> I was paying twice this much for one eyelash dye job at a salon, this works as good or better than those.</li>
            <li> I applied it with a clean mascara brush, per another positive review, and it worked great.</li>
            <li> to clean smudges and got all the lashes!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfectly fine if they do, just keep applying and make sure you get every lash.</li>
            <li> and I can get a much better, cleaner and precise application than using the tools provided.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not all that impressed.</li>
            <li> Of course, I&#x27;m careful with the application and it does take practice, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem and my lashes look awesome for about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Works great but easier to use and old mascara application brush to apply.</li>
            <li> Make sure your lashes are completely free of any residue from makeup or makeup remover/soap.</li>
            <li> There were too many precautions and your eyes are too important to be trying unsafe products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a light stain.</li>
            <li> If you are in a brightly lit room (good bathroom light), and use a makeup mirror that magnifies, you will see that your lashes are actually longer than you think.  </li>
            <li> loved the idea of a tint that would darken my eyelashes for a month, but I find regular mascara to be much more effective.</li>
            <li> Follow the  directions, it is a very easy and quick process.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, I still wear mascara for sure, but this helps my very light lashes be seen when I&#x27;m on a quick no make up errand.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to a T, and I have a very steady hand and am good at fine motor skills.  </li>
            <li> Very important be have clean lashes, no oils on it.</li>
            <li> so I was really excited for this :)</li>
            <li> (just make sure to clean the excess color with Qtip immediately) but not so well with eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This product is not as easy to use as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I find this really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t think it was at all easy to apply</li>
            <li> did work for me very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Got the product very quickly &amp; it worked well.</li>
            <li> Although easy to use, I would not recommend to my friends or buy it again</li>
            <li> Applicator is easy to use, and directions are easy to follow.</li>

            <li> This is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and it was really easy to use.  </li>
            <li> lasts about 4-6 weeks, easy to use.</li>
            <li> recommend NOT using the applicator brush provided but to use dentek easy brush cleaners (toothbrush aisle) to apply.</li>
            <li> I found this product really easy to use.</li>
            <li> Overall - I am pleased and will continue to use this - great for those days when I want to skip make-up</li>

            <li> This product is quite easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I colored my lashes about 3 weeks ago, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about two weeks in and still going strong.</li>
            <li> ordered  this item for a freind she liked very much</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see that great out of the eye I got it in to for about four days, so apparently it dies your eyeball too, just not hair.</li>
            <li> I tried using the included applicator sticks, and also an eyelash brush, and an eyeshadow brush - trying to find a better way to control the application of the dye and still could not get full coverage.     </li>
            <li> I bought this and while I am not let down I must say that it isn&#x27;t the best of the best.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> but once I got the hang of it, it worked out fine.</li>
            <li> and I have waited more than a minute not sure which works the best as they seem to all</li>
            <li> That is perfectly fine with me.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Black is best.</li>
            <li> Applying the activator with the cotton swab works fine.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s wonderful especially if you are outdoorsy, spend a lot of time in the sun, or are &amp;#34;low maintenance&amp;#34; and want to feel pretty without being all done up.</li>
            <li> Now I use my eyelash curler and you can see my lashes fine.</li>
            <li> and they stayed just fine.</li>
            <li> This works just fine.  </li>
            <li> If you have someone helping you it might be just fine.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps there&#x27;s a fine line between the ratio of the two items that create a bond on the eyelash (to dye it).  </li>
            <li> Thank you for having a product that is easy to do for my light eye lashes.</li>
            <li> It really helped saturate my lashes with the developer, then after I washed it I was able to put on the gel very cleanly and easily.  </li>
            <li> No waiting for the dye to develop, which was a huge plus.</li>
            <li> The pads for under the eyes are huge and I quit trying to hassel with them and put Vaseline under my eyes.</li>
            <li> My test area looked like a huge bruise  inside of my elbow and was there for over a week.</li>
            <li> I still use it on occasion, but for being on the go it is great especially for light colored lashes.</li>
            <li> my lashes are light brown), I&#x27;m great at following directions</li>
            <li> (jeez I just sound like a wreck</li>
            <li> I applied lightly.</li>
            <li> Remind you: the color I used was brown(on brown lashes), may work for light lashes.</li>
            <li> Great for the tiny corner lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have light lashes</li>
            <li> I have reddish hair and light eye lashes.  </li>
            <li> if that) on a two inch handle (just happened to see one in the bathroom drawer and had a Light Bulb Moment).  </li>
            <li> They work great on the upper lashes too, but those are the easier lashes to tint anyway.    </li>
            <li> Take the advice of the detailed reviews on here</li>
            <li> Reapplying every few weeks seems to work best.</li>
            <li> 5) Lightly cover your hands in the petroleum jelly  6)</li>
            <li> it looks fantastic.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am allergic to all mascara (tried them all from cheap to exhorbitant) and the result is itchy eyes each time.</li>
            <li> It looks like I have really smooth mascara on.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this for anyone who has light to brown eyelashes.</li>
            <li> This product works great if you have blonde eyelashes like I do.</li>
            <li> It is intended for those of us with light colored lashes/brows.  </li>
            <li> This is going to sound like I got paid to leave a review...</li>
            <li> If my eyelashes were thickier and light the effect would be a knock out</li>
            <li> I have shorter, light brown eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I could see how this would work for light lashes.</li>
            <li> I have light eyelashes</li>
            <li> If you have blonde eye lashes , this product works great ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a great deal--at Sally&#x27;s Beauty they have a different brand for $45!!!</li>
            <li> I have light brown lashes and did two applications (labor intensive) and the difference is negligible.</li>
            <li> I was really confident at this point that I was on the road to success.</li>
            <li> I have light eyelashes even though I have darker hair.</li>
            <li> The lashes are still light on the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have reddish hair and naturally light brown lashes.</li>
            <li> However, on the plus side, Roux includes a stain remover vial as well, which works fairly well (but never gets the dye off completely in all areas).    </li>
            <li> I bought this several months ago, and although it does do a good job tinting the blond ends of my eyelashes, I think it also makes more of them fall out.  </li>
            <li> So far so good -</li>
            <li> So good so far.</li>
            <li> So far so good with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using lash conditioner at night to make them more healthy too and that has really made a difference too.  </li>
            <li> (I, too, was sure I would do it right</li>
            <li> Applied better, but again, after the allotted time, product washed right off.  </li>
            <li> (not too many just the right amount</li>
            <li> For someone with no visible lashes to actually seeing them, it is very nice.  </li>
            <li> Its super easy to use</li>
            <li> you will LOVE this product and wont be able to live without it.</li>
            <li> This works fast (instantly!) is easy to use and color lasts for 30 days or more.</li>
            <li> A small synthetic fan brush seems to work best</li>
            <li> laugh&#x27;s on me!).  </li>
            <li> Do the bottom lash first and wash off then do the top lash.</li>
            <li> Read my original post below for must do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts.    </li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW:</li>
            <li> So when you start make sure you wear gloves, be aware it stains EVERYTHING</li>
            <li> so I was excited to try this product.      </li>
            <li> My bathroom sink was covered in dye, and I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> Love this product when it first goes on</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly each time and never got more than 3 days wear.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not close to rich.</li>
            <li> feeling is that it is pretty safe.  </li>
            <li> I was excited about this product because I have a LOT of lashes</li>
            <li> Well, I ran home when I got it all excited to use it and put it on.  </li>
            <li> It makes the dying process twice as long, and doesn&#x27;t even do as great of a job.</li>
            <li> This made me feel more comfortable in my own skin, I don&#x27;t look so ghostly anymore, and it really is lasting.</li>
            <li> It is true - this product will color your lashes a darker shade - a great concept if you have nice thick lashes that are light colored.</li>
            <li> In other words, if you can apply mascara, you can use this easily and will be happy you did.</li>
            <li> I even did it again with clean eyelashes (washed with soap and water).  </li>
            <li> start to finish, including clean up, it took maybe 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I tried again but this time without vaseline, without pads, just unsing a clean mascara brush for both activator and colorant (just washed it well between the two applications).</li>
            <li> I applied, clean it all off and applied again.  </li>
            <li> Then brush my eyelashes with a clean mascara brush (which I bought separately).</li>
            <li> Amazing able to use myself and definitely had color that lasted.  </li>
            <li> I have long and full lashes, so I&#x27;m as happy as can be about it.</li>
            <li> so my lashes are super light.</li>
            <li> Although this last package was the best so far.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does a great job of tinting my very blonde eyelashes, but be prepared to take some time to do this right.  </li>
            <li> somewhere special for an event</li>
            <li> I was hoping this item would be my solution to wanting my lashes tinted for special events</li>
            <li> &quot; I did a two week challenge and have decided to not wear makeup again except for special occasions like family holidays.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was able to get very close to the lash line and cover the skin without getting goopy vaseline all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But for a first shot at doing this, I was beyond pleased and I am sure I will only get better as I go.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t explain the good reviews, but I do know if you buy this, you will come back to my review and say, \\&quot;Why didn&#x27;t I listen to her?\\&quot;  What the heck</li>
            <li> But they are not so good for applying the second step, the colorant gel, because this solution is the one that stings, and the one that stains.  </li>
            <li> I used the left over Roux stain remover, and it worked fairly well for the stains I ended up with from the 28 Day Mascara tinting.  </li>
            <li> Take it slow and it works GREAT!!</li>
            <li> You need to repeat the process Of tinting many times before real results.</li>
            <li> I did it two more times, leaving it on much longer than a minute each of those times.  </li>
            <li> but overall it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I really like being able to do this at home.    </li>
            <li> Nothing leaked through.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the q-tips are really only good for applying the vaseline, and the activator.</li>
            <li> I have had good results that last for weeks and weeks.  </li>
            <li> Its much easier and works much better.</li>
            <li> If you have light colored eyelashes, this product is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m normally a natural product kind of girl</li>
            <li> I think I was putting too much of the activator on though to be sure I covered all the lashes...</li>
            <li> The effects are not comparable to true mascara.</li>
            <li> Instead, moving full speed ahead, I was in a lot of pain during the dying part of the procedure.</li>
            <li> I left it on for a good 5 min.</li>
            <li> Suggested to reuse at least once a week, for best results use twice weekly.</li>
            <li> It will stain my skin for a day or so but not bad.    </li>
            <li> I successfully applied the product to my left eye as directed, but accidentally got a DROP of product in my right eye and that was the end of it.  </li>
            <li> I repeated the process for my top lashes right away because I didn&#x27;t get all the lashes the first time.</li>
            <li> I was able to use a clean mascara brush instead of the older &amp;#34;Q-tip&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> used one of those Dentek brushies to apply the product and it was really easy to get it exactly on my lash and not my skin.</li>
            <li> I found it pretty easy to use because I didn&#x27;t feel the need to go all the way to the roots.  </li>
            <li> This is a tremendous help in applying the petroleum with true accuracy so as to avoid getting it on your lashes.  </li>
            <li> I will say, the bottled labeled first solution is easy to apply and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the staining at that point.</li>
            <li> i did it a few times and loved it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;like so many other reviewers said, it&#x27;s best to use a mascara brush (I was able to avoid staining my skin that way) and it takes a little practice if you&#x27;ve never dyed your lashes before.</li>
            <li> The swabs included in the kit are fine for applying the developer solution, the first step.  </li>
            <li> After applying the product, my top lashes are a bit darker, but as I get older, they are getting thinner, so I am also going to try out a product to help thicken and lengthen them.  </li>
            <li> So you can get the dye off your skin quickly.</li>
            <li> The best way I&#x27;ve found to do it is the same way I dye my hair, and at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> Seemed like a good idea at the time, after receiving it and reading the instructions decided it was more trouble</li>
            <li> Make sure you get all the lashes nice and wet with this stuff because if you don&#x27;t, some lashes wont change colors.</li>
            <li> so the effect is becoming more apparent.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to be super drastic.</li>
            <li> and i find the product is worthy of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> tip that I learned quickly, DONT use the pads they give you for the under eye.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this, I have light blonde eyelashes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the product works okay, and is way better than having white eyelashes, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have another brand or option.</li>
            <li> I was super nervous about staining and getting it all over the place.</li>
            <li> got here quick and is just as it said.</li>
            <li> I can speak from personal experience that your results are 100% user-facilitated, meaning that if you don&#x27;t get good results, it&#x27;s because you didn&#x27;t do it right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that after a month, my lashes are still dark</li>
            <li> They look great -- better than drawn on with pencil, actually -- and the dye lasts for several days before it comes off the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great product - I can&#x27;t wear mascara, so I am happy to have dark lashes again.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with this</li>
            <li> I have to leave it on for about 4 min, but its a good idea to start at 1 1/2 min, then check about every minute until you know how long it takes for you.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, it doesn&#x27;t last a whole month but other than that it&#x27;s pretty good....</li>
            <li> The dye worked great and her lashes were black.</li>
            <li> For the first time I see such a good eye lashes color.</li>
            <li> It was easy &amp; fast to use --</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and it really covered my gray lashes.</li>
            <li> I even tried it with the pads underneath, but they didn&#x27;t stay in place, so the dye from my lower lashes got absorbed by the cotton pad, then it shifted around and got the dye underneath and below my lower lashes (luckily the dye came off my skin.)  </li>
            <li> But just like so many commercials it is very far from reality.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and eyes and surprisingly I didn&#x27;t have much of a reaction the first time.  </li>
            <li> This product really works!!  </li>
            <li> This product works pretty well!</li>
            <li> This application (first time) was a Breeze!</li>
            <li> but for 2 years I&#x27;ve used Beauty Lash and went from literally &#x27;sparse stubs&#x27; for eyelashes to getting them for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and this is great because you can see my eyelashes even when I am not wearing mascara (which is pretty much all the time).  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I went the first 30 years of my life without dying my eyelashes!  </li>
            <li> Easy but messy to use but got good results.</li>
            <li> I have very light lashes and have been getting them dyed professionally for years.</li>
            <li> but my first attempt was shaky at best.</li>
            <li> First off, this came super quick.  </li>
            <li> I use Just For Men Beard &amp; Mustache dye for my eyebrows, so this was intriguing.  </li>
            <li> I keep the pointed swabs handy in case I do get a bit on my skin, they are better than round ones.</li>
            <li> I love how they look when I wear mascara, but my eyes are sensitive and I always end up rubbing them and smearing mascara all over.</li>
            <li> The first eye I did, did not come out quite as fully dyed as the second, as there is a bit of a learning curve, but they both looked pretty good.</li>
            <li> ~ that was nice, but it only lasts a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> A professional lash tint will be better in this respect.</li>
            <li> Okay, as far as the coloring aspect, yes it lasts for 28 days.</li>
            <li> You cannot tint them and then expect to suddenly see them clearly without good light and magnification.  </li>
            <li> my camper friends make fun of me; I don&#x27;t care).</li>
            <li> Chapstick Fresh Effects</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get the paper skin protector things to work worth a dime.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU LAUGH IT RUNS...</li>
            <li> Seriously---this product is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The best and easiest way to apply the gel is to put it on the OUTSIDE CURVED part of the mascara brush, this way you can apply it to the harder to get to areas like the corners and lower lashes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> then it was worth.  </li>
            <li> remember tho its just a dye, it dose not thicken the hairs, but for those of us with blonde hairs, its nice to see them when you cant put mascara on.</li>
            <li> I must have still had some kind of oil or even makeup remover residue left in my lashes.</li>
            <li> ITS WORTH IT</li>
            <li> Beautiful dark lashes that really show up now.  </li>
            <li> Really, the key is using good applicators.</li>
            <li> Either way, totally worth a shot.</li>
            <li> So, if you take it for what it is (not mascara), it&#x27;s worth the $20.</li>
            <li> This product is good for someone (like me) who has blonde eyelashes and wants to darken them so you can go without makeup (like at the beach or pool) and still have some lashes.</li>
            <li> When rinsing with warm water - I did feel a brief stinging in each eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was super easy to use and my lashes came out a nice black shade and it appears that I have some type of mascara on.</li>
            <li> I could tell after the first application, however, the ends of the lashes still seemed pretty light.</li>
            <li> hardly worth the effort it takes to apply.  </li>
            <li> It is much better than the professional product I have used for years.</li>
            <li> try to do all your lashes at the same time, if you have really light lashes I reccomend leaving it on for more like 2min.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have my own gloves, I recommend getting some at the local drug store in the correct size, will help a lot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has now been 2 weeks and the color is just as fresh as day one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> oh well, it was worth a shot</li>
            <li> If anybody from Godefroy is reading this right now, I&#x27;m not mad-</li>
            <li> The application takes a little getting used to, would love to see each tube with a mascara brush - would make it more user friendly.</li>
            <li> If you are an active lady, or even a guy who wants darker lashes without wearing makeup, a tint is great.  </li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with this product and glad I made the low cost investment which will save me quite a bit of time and money now</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even going to attempt to do my right....</li>
            <li> all right but not your hair.</li>
            <li> Took a bit to figure out right amount to use &amp; a LOT of patience is required.</li>
            <li> Came right on time.  </li>
            <li> She put it on the lashes of my right eye, so we could compare.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;dye&amp;#34; washes right off.</li>
            <li> Even with the eye shields, because the product soaks right thru them.  </li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t do this right before you are going to a party or something.  </li>
            <li> The dye came right off after one wash.</li>
            <li> right after I order a couple boxes of it to stock up on it in case</li>
            <li> I just wiped it off right away.</li>
            <li> (I have tried applying the colorant right after which worked best for getting my skin as dark as possible, and I have waited a minute</li>
            <li> and I have had them tinted in the past with great success.</li>
            <li> I would advise using a clean mascara wand to apply vs. the provided applicator - much easier.</li>
            <li> Will wait to see how long the color lasts but great so far.</li>
            <li> I have been tinting my own eyelashes for over 10 years with other products so am familiar with the process.</li>
            <li> It is hard to see them just looking in a mirror - you need the good light (you&#x27;re tinting your lashes because they are pale, so without good light you won&#x27;t see them).  </li>
            <li> here I am, happy to have these lovely dark lashes and brows~and though it&#x27;s not quite the same effect as adding mascara--I feel pretty</li>
            <li> lashes are dark right along the lash line, but the tips are fair.</li>
            <li> so I pulled them off and was just more careful to not touch skin with gel #2(which can easily stain the skin).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a video where the person used a small paint brush to apply the color, which I think would be a great applicator.  </li>
            <li> This leaves me with a nicely dyed section in the middle of my top lashes with the rest blonde.  </li>
            <li> After applying the solutions, it barely dyed the top lashes and the color on the bottom lashes washed off.</li>
            <li> (I love the Godefrey brow dye, and apparently you can use this product on your brows as well.</li>
            <li> But what really sold me was I decided to try it on my thinning eye brows, instant LOVE!  </li>
            <li> I squeeze a very small amount on the end of the brush and then blot lightly on paper towel before applying with a very light touch to the top lashes.  </li>
            <li> It takes some time to get a good technique down using this</li>
            <li> I would suspect that unless you have really light lashes - this won&#x27;t do much for you - and it certainly doesn&#x27;t add volume as a mascara would.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t cover quite enough to be able to go completely without mascara but that might just be my own personal prefferance, it has really shortened up my makeup routine though :)</li>
            <li> It makes life a little more convenient, since I now can dye my lashes at home :).</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t add thickness or length, but since I hardly wear makeup it was perfect for me, because it looks so natural</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are nice and long, but you could never see them!</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews I bought some dental picks to use as applicators, not the kind for flossing, the kind with the tiny comb.</li>
            <li> Did use the &amp;#34;applicator&amp;#34; the first attempt, but the product washed right off.</li>
            <li> I bought the tiny brushes used for braces and they work great, you can get all of the upper and lower lashes coated!</li>
            <li> Also I don&#x27;t wear mascara anymore and really like the more natural look.</li>
            <li> Clear instructions and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> make sure lashes are clean and dry.</li>
            <li> This will work good if your lashes are of a brown color or less.</li>
            <li> This is a simple process to tint my eyelashes and has great lasting quality.  </li>
            <li> why not.&lt;br /&gt;This was so easy, even my 10yr old could have done it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big</li>
            <li> and honestly, with some practice, i feel like i can do a better job because i can keep my eyes open and really coat each individual</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY LIGHT ALMOST BLONDE EYE LASHES.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blonde, so my lashes are very light and look non-existent without mascara.</li>
            <li> So, just to have some kind of definition to my face in stead of looking like a polar bear in a snowstorm, i have to wear make up.</li>
            <li> This product was simple to use and dyed my lashes quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> This was quick and easy to use, so I can see myself using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t fit very good and make it hard to get close enough to your lash line without getting any lashes under the pad.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, nothing spectacular it makes your eyelashes a little darker but if you are looking for the wow factor then this isn&#x27;t it.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time today.</li>
            <li> and if you get one this enough, will go through your lashes while applying for a more even coat.</li>
            <li> -I used a q-tip to put on the first step</li>
            <li> like regular mascara I made sure to cover both sides and got the bottom lashes as well.  </li>
            <li> so I will be sure to remember that next time!  </li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I found so much FREEDOM in using this product!  </li>
            <li> The trick is to make sure you use the 1st chemical several times and allow it to soak through the hair&#x27;s cuticle.</li>
            <li> What I did get on my lashes (mostly on my lids) definitely didn&#x27;t stay on for 28 days.  </li>
            <li> , it does nothing for volume, whichis ok for daily use.  </li>
            <li> Used exactly as described in instructions</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was going for.</li>
            <li> Both my top and bottom lashes are as blonde as they were before.  </li>
            <li> I did one eye first to compare the before &amp; after affects.  </li>
            <li> me first start by saying that I have never before taken the time to post an unfavorable review.  </li>
            <li> I sit here typing this review feeling like the RCA dog with a lovely ring around my left eye.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m opening a my first studio, (NubangZ Studio)</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Another product I purchased at local beauty supply outlet did a much better job.</li>
            <li> I tried this product exactly according to package directions.  </li>
            <li> more a \\&quot;I can&#x27;t go out in public like this\\</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure the second application caused this</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.  </li>
            <li> So overall it was ok.  </li>
            <li> the top lashes put the activator on both the back and front of lashes.</li>
            <li> My lower lashes touch the skin below the eyelid, and any Vaseline would travel up higher as I tried to tint them.  </li>
            <li> The instructions state you should apply the first solution 2 to 3 times over each lash.  </li>
            <li> Like a magical layer of darkness stemming from the front of my lashes to the back.  </li>
            <li> and it REALLY helps improve results!  </li>
            <li> Use the first chemical liberally(Get it all covered..</li>
            <li> Wipe away any stain fast and it will not cause a problem!    </li>
            <li> Use the q-tips to apply petroleum jelly on both top and bottom lid, get them as close to the hair line as possible without getting any on your lashes.  </li>
            <li> Apply the colorant with the second bush, both side of the top lashes and then the bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li> it says it colors instantly, but it made me feel better.  </li>
            <li> Then I tried an \\&quot;Inter-tooth\\&quot; brush picks(available at most drug stores), that is much smaller</li>
            <li> Applying step 2 is not an exact science.  </li>
            <li> It does nothing the first application.  </li>
            <li> I have brown hair, and the tips of my lashes are blonde, so this made my eyelashes microscopically more visible.  </li>
            <li> It took so much of it to cover my lashes!</li>
            <li> I regularly use Godefroy eyebrow tint, and I absolutely LOVE it.</li>
            <li> You have so much more potential than this.</li>
            <li> I even repeated the application the next day, the results weren&#x27;t any better.  </li>
            <li> Be aware when you feel that pain your eyes will close, and if you don&#x27;t use the eye shields your face will be colored for almost a week.</li>
            <li> I bought color remover for skin and it worked pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I worked in a spa/salon for many years and had my eyelashes tinted by the esthetician on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> First of all, the DVD did not play, neither in my computer nor in my DVD player.</li>
            <li> That was the first clue.</li>
            <li> The quality is consistent and the product does what it claims.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last more than 4 days let alone 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> even though i am pretty low-maintence.</li>
            <li> First time user.</li>
            <li> Thanks Godefroy!</li>
            <li> I am a first time user</li>
            <li> this is the first time that I have used any product like this.</li>
            <li> My mascara wand came from my \\&quot;Imju Fiberwig Tiny Sniper\\&quot; mascara, but you could find a wand like this at most beauty supply stores like Sephora or Ulta</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as it says it will.</li>
            <li> Dye did not last more than a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is because my eye lashes are already brown because those with blonde eyelashes in the reviews seemed to have satisfied results.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well, in that it makes your eyelashes darker.</li>
            <li> As many have stated, this only COLORS your lashes.</li>
            <li> First you put the dye on and then you have to put the developer on - and with the eyebrow stuff you just mix it all together and slap it on.</li>
            <li> I made sure that I didn&#x27;t have any of the first solution on my eye lid before applying the 2nd.</li>
            <li> I was pretty worried about how to rinse it off the lashes.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> who knows ;).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the color that goes on first..</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I would advise mixing the color and the developer prior to application,  rather than layering the developer on top of the color.</li>
            <li> Althouh, I had to put the gel first &amp; then the color because it didn&#x27;t work for me at first.</li>
            <li> It did not cover my gray lashes on the first try.</li>
            <li> and I feel they make the application so much easier!</li>
            <li> Since I have more applications left, I will do it again but scrape the vaseline and eye shields.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work well when first applied</li>
            <li> favorite mascara was taken off the market back in 2000.</li>
            <li> but I apply to both eyes first before applying the activator.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> Lasted 28 days or more possibly for my lashes.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product a year ago (2011).  </li>
            <li> However, the kit does say you may need 2 applications the first time.</li>
            <li> first time I used it</li>
            <li> Maybe we will keep trying and hopefully with practice we will finally get a better result.</li>
            <li> The first time was a disaster.  </li>
            <li> This really works and lasts!  </li>
            <li> First, do yourself a favor and dont use the applicator stick that it comes with...</li>
            <li> I suggest wiping away the petroleum jelly first because it kinda gets in the way when you try to remove the gel from your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> and whenever I run out will most definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> Just used this product for the first time.</li>
            <li> I do lower lashes first to keep the chapstick coating on my top lashes intact.&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ve gotten to the point of doing both my lower lashes at the same time</li>
            <li> After the second, it was darker and much better.</li>
            <li> did exactly what the directions suggested and rinsed my lashes afterward.  </li>
            <li> What it doesn&#x27;t mention in the directions, and would have been VERY helpful to me is: the gel colorant will bring tears to your eyes and stings like the dickens!</li>
            <li> Also, I won&#x27;t be so ambitious as to try to color the lower lashes.</li>
            <li> Instead of mixing the dye and activator together, you have to apply the dye to your lashes first, then the activator.</li>
            <li> (the first time you&#x27;d always have some lashes that weren&#x27;t reached/didn&#x27;t take)</li>
            <li> IT REALLY WORKS!</li>
            <li> and I will forever use it.&lt;br /&gt;Couple of tips: apply to the top&lt;br /&gt;Do one eye at a time, think of it like a 4 section process, do the top lash, then bottom, then move to the next eye and repeat the process.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Another draw back is the two step process, you apply the colorant to the lashes first then the activator, each time having to make sure you get every lash root to tip.</li>
            <li> I do use the Godefroy Brown Eyebrow tint regularly and love it.  </li>
            <li> did the lower lashes first on one eye.</li>
            <li> The upper lashes are better than the lower.  </li>
            <li> All I have to buy are more tiny dental brushes.</li>
            <li> This eyelash dye was very easy to apply and it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> It was very fast and easy to use - the containers and applicators make sure none of the product is wasted (and there is enough product for many uses).</li>
            <li> I have red hair and very fair skin, and I find that black looks</li>
            <li> To have them a nice dark dark brown/black all the way to the tips it super amazing.  </li>
            <li> I made sure to get all the lashes wet, and then I put more of the solution on the q-tip and did it again, just to be sure, and then let it set in for about a minute and a half.</li>
            <li> I used an old mascara brush that I cleaned and soaked first, which really helped to distribute the tint easily.  </li>
            <li> Also with this new kind, you have to wait a minute or so for the second gel to set.  </li>
            <li> I have light blond hair and bought Godefroy in black and LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is super easy and the color lasts a long time and also give my lashes body.  </li>
            <li> I love that suddenly I have longer eyelashes because the tips apparently were light.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for dying eyebrows but does next to nothing for eyelashes (at most, my eyelashes look tinted for a couple of days and have the &amp;#34;sand in eye&amp;#34; feel like when you leave mascara on for too long).</li>
            <li> so I did exactly what the directions said and found it was far superior to any other way, what a concept haha!</li>
            <li> I am a red head, to the fullest extent, I have bright copper red hair, freckles</li>
            <li> , clean your face and eye area with soap and water so your natural oils wont hinder the dye.&lt;br /&gt;Next</li>
            <li> i am glad i tried it and will use it again, especially on vacation when i&#x27;m going to be swimming, not wearing much makeup etc.</li>
            <li> It definitely worked for me and did last a good 2 weeks though swimming in a chlorinated pool.  </li>
            <li> This does a good job of coloring eyelashes, but it doesn&#x27;t give the extra fullness or length you get from regular mascara.  </li>
            <li> When all is done, lashes last a good 3 - 4 weeks before next app......</li>
            <li> Use the Vaseline to keep it from dyeing your skin and getting the white sheet to stick, but really make sure you don&#x27;t get any on the lashes.</li>
            <li> Give yourself at least 30 minutes, more time is even better.</li>
            <li> Really did not darken my lashes very much.</li>
            <li> However, it cleaned up beautifully and only my lashes are black.  </li>
            <li> so I did get it pretty much everywhere</li>
            <li> The application,though, was very tricky for me the first time.</li>
            <li> I am very well aware that lash tint does not give length or fullness, so that is NOT what I am complaining about.  </li>
            <li> Use the first mascara brush to apply the activator don&#x27;t saturate it too much</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of time the first time, but really gets faster and easier with each</li>
            <li> , it really went pretty well.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are already kind of dark</li>
            <li> my eyelashes (although very long) are super light.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel a little better about myself, that&#x27;s never a bad thing.</li>
            <li> I tried it twice, and both times it made little or no difference to my eyelashes, and did not stay on for more than 2 days!</li>
            <li> but I figure a little is better than nothing!  </li>
            <li> If you have light eyelashes or light tips on your dark lashes etc</li>
            <li> THAT time I had irritation and 3 days later as I was taking off make-up, I had more than the normal amount of eye lashes fall out.  </li>
            <li> First and foremost the most careful of people cannot avoid staining with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Once my under eye skin color went back to normal, I enjoyed having my lashes permanantly tinted.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this idea unless you have a very steady hand, which I do.</li>
            <li> Really easy to use now, although I did forget to wash my hands after the last time and ended up with a brown stained thumb.  </li>
            <li> did notice very mild irritation of the skin, and that&#x27;s the only thing I got out of it.  </li>
            <li> I used this 3 weeks ago, and my eyelashes still have a nice, lush, long look.</li>
            <li> Looks good as soon as the stuff is applied but doesn&#x27;t really last for long.</li>
            <li> It is not a dramatic difference, but it is a difference.  </li>
            <li> better than paying $25 for a single salon job.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought a single application before investing in a large pack of 25 applications.</li>
            <li> Reading the reviews, I saw that there was a large disagreement between reviewers, with some stating that there was no color added to their lashes at all.  </li>
            <li> I wil certainly be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it and certainly wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.  </li>
            <li> It certainly doesn&#x27;t take the place of mascara, which thickens and lengthens.  </li>
            <li> This has been great and lasts at least two months on my lashes!</li>
            <li> I still have to wear mascara to look good; but I dye my hair black, and I&#x27;ve used this on my eyebrows to make them look like they naturally match my hair color.  </li>
            <li> It is very important to be careful as it stains the skin immediately.</li>
            <li> Have a clean, dry swab at the ready to quickly remove any staining blobs as they occur -</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use any of the pads and found if you have a pretty steady hand, you don&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li> I was older!</li>
            <li> Since getting older my beautiful long, dark eyelashes have grayed and shortened somewhat.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, since I also tint my eye brows (with an entirely different product), I had a gentle stain remover in my cupboard which has helped in lightening the blow.  </li>
            <li> I spent more time trying to get vasaline around my eyes and not on the lashes than anything</li>
            <li> and I can rub my eyes as much as I want.</li>
            <li> This makes it much easier to get all the lashes without getting it on your skin.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to rely so much on mascara when I go to the beach.</li>
            <li> They are very mini mascara wands.  </li>
            <li> Get some disposable mascara wands, it&#x27;s much easier that way.</li>
            <li> The only question I have is why doesn&#x27;t the pipet fit all the way into the Activator bottle?  </li>
            <li> The product went into my eyes and it hurt so much</li>
            <li> I have to say that it worked very well with eyebrows</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t expect too much from this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not blond, but I am only light brown.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if you are very blond, it might make a difference, but otherwise, I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money.</li>
            <li> The tint actually needs to have a pin stuck in the opening of the tube which is not mentioned, but fortunately, I had one close.</li>
            <li> Really thought this product worked well.</li>
            <li> I can now tell that mascara is the real answer for me. . . .</li>
            <li> Used too much Vaseline, or got Vaseline on their lashes.  </li>
            <li> I knew that I could not use Vaseline under my lower lashes without getting some on the lashes, thus defeating the whole intent of coloring them.  </li>
            <li> These tiny brushes are available in the toothpaste/floss section of any drug store in packs of multiples - much cheaper than the mascara wands, and much easier to use for the lower lashes than anything else.  </li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t really do much to amend that.</li>
            <li> (I actually use the free baby \\&quot;chapstick\\</li>
            <li> It does not thicken or lengthen, nor does it purport to do so, but it does really color, and</li>
            <li> For eyelashes, this doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> Youtube even has instructions how to do it, really helpful.</li>
            <li> It was very efficient in making my lashes darker.</li>
            <li> , then I no longer could really see it.  </li>
            <li> I have no pros, so I&#x27;ll go straight to the cons list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try cleaning it with any real cleaners yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> cuz I really don&#x27;t wear much make up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;28 day mascara does not dye your eyelashes well, basically just the center on the top gets and stays colored.</li>
            <li> If the company wants to send me a replacement package I will try again and modify this review.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and when I did not see any difference I repeated the whole process all over.</li>
            <li> Be careful and you will love the results.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t really work.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tell that my lashes are tinted at all really.  </li>
            <li> This is much easier.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it works for women with very blond lashes, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> My lashes are very blond.</li>
            <li> Did not work very well.  </li>
            <li> Dyed my lashes twice and couldn&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice and didn&#x27;t really see results either time.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like mascara</li>
            <li> thy&#x27;re light colored, especially at the tips-</li>
            <li> It also says the pads can be trimmed to fit, if necessary.</li>
            <li> It was, and I HIGHLY suggest it!</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this product, just READ the directions and follow them!</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this product, just READ the directions and follow them!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see very well</li>
            <li> I have red hair and light eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I was very intrigued when I came across this.</li>
            <li> Ifeel like my lashes don&#x27;t fall out as fast</li>
            <li> It really shouldn&#x27;t be called mascara.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes was really really light blonde that It looked like I had no eyelashes at all (without the</li>
            <li> I have very blond, translucent eyelashes</li>
            <li> Worked very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: After over one month of using I am ready to reorder.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are visible to the very tip.  </li>
            <li> It is really just a dye.</li>
            <li> I have had my eye on this tint for my lashes for awhile--just couldn&#x27;t really afford til now.</li>
            <li> got everything ready beforehand...</li>
            <li> so my brows have really lightened up and thinned out--</li>
            <li> I really, REALLY wanted this to work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m much rather do this myself at home.</li>
            <li> I really like how my lashes look once it&#x27;s done.</li>
            <li> and she said would order again if nee be shipping is always on time thanks so much</li>
            <li> It takes a bit of practice to put it on without creating much staining around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> One box is close to how much doing it twice at the salon costs.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I think part of the problem is if you get too much Vaseline, it prevents your lashes from getting the dye on them.</li>
            <li> If you miss its very permanent and since I cant see very well</li>
            <li> I did not goop too much on at once - worrying about getting it in my eye.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> This product does not work very well on eye lashes -</li>
            <li> This product really does work darkening lighter hairs, but every person we tried it on had the unwanted side effect of dye runoff into the skin.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me, I followed instructions but did not make much of a difference in the color of my lashes.</li>
            <li> this product is so much cheaper than going to a salon...</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have light blonde hair and my eyelashes are light brown to blonde in spots.</li>
            <li> so it didn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li> It makes life so much easier not having to use mascara...</li>
            <li> I have light eyelashes and always preferred putting on mascara before I left the house.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t see too much difference</li>
            <li> I spent more time trying to get the product off my skin than getting the product on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I spent about an hour trying to dye them and ended up with nothing better than what I started with.</li>
            <li> and I know it really works</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> The applicators were much easier to use to apply the tint.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to reorder in black and try again, I found the application quick and easy, if it works- it would save alot of time.</li>
            <li> I have had my eyelashes professionally tinted numerous times always love the results.  </li>
            <li> Yes, my lashes are darker and it&#x27;s better than the natural blonde color they have.  </li>
            <li> Well, I used only what came in the box in addition to non-petroleum jelly (more natural form of vaseline)</li>
            <li> It does take a few applications to achieve the desired color, but I honestly don&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Essentially, this product is a great back-up plan - if you sleep in one morning and don&#x27;t have time to apply makeup, at least you won&#x27;t look completely washed out.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get a real rich charcoal black color.</li>
            <li> I had nice black eyelash when I was finished!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and had gorgeous black lashes (mine are very blonde) for 26 days.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!</li>
            <li> Better but not black enough.  </li>
            <li> Super messy, everything is bound to get in your eye, it only looks nice n easy in their commercial.</li>
            <li> I have permanent eyeliner (willing to try something new)</li>
            <li> I live in Florida hot and humid.  </li>
            <li> You can purchase tint remover for your skin at any beauty supply store, for when you use hair dye, and it&#x27;s not very expensive.  </li>
            <li> The next time I was more careful using the comb (enclosed) and a disposable clean (can get at beauty supply places)</li>
            <li> but it is certainly not as easy or effective as described on the package.       </li>
            <li> I was excited to get it before I left for vacation thinking</li>
            <li> did the other lower lid with nothing but the activator and color gel and turned out much better...</li>
            <li> I am glad that I had read some of the other reviews, this made it easier to do.</li>
            <li> Honestly, if it only lasted a week, it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li> I have used many lash tint products and this is easier due to the gel consistency.</li>
            <li> If you have dark black lashes already then this product will probably not do very much for you, but it is great for lighter lashes.</li>
            <li> I have dark lashes but the tips are very light.  </li>
            <li> -use a tiny, angled (clean) mascara wand to apply the tint</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take me some time to get the hang of this, mainly because my eyes water so much when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I used the \\&quot;black\\&quot; shade - and it wasn&#x27;t as dark as my salon tint had been - but looks nice and natural.  </li>
            <li> I am very picky about beauty products, but I plan on using this one again and again, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> , so it is definitely worth doing if you have eyelashes that are not very dark.  </li>
            <li> I do right eye first then left then repeat.</li>
            <li> My lashes are very light &amp; I used black.</li>
            <li> have lashes that are naturally very light brown, this product immediately made them black (which is the color of the product).  </li>
            <li> I also recommend applying the petroleum jelly as indicated, especially under your eyes, very close to lash line and cover the entire top lid</li>
            <li> not sure if this is that effective.  </li>
            <li> First thing, there was NOWHERE NEAR 25 APPLICATIONS IN THE TUBE.</li>
            <li> I live this product!</li>
            <li> I used the product for the first time last month and the others were right about how hard it is so apply to your own eyes.  </li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very long and light brown/blonde.</li>
            <li> (I was very careful to make sure my lashes were clean and dry)</li>
            <li> This product costs less than one trip to salon for eyelash tinting and has MANY uses in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just works better for me that way, and find I use less of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This lasts more like 14 days or less, not 28; but after the color wears off the skin</li>
            <li> Just be careful when using and wear gloves as it can easily stain your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have super blonde eyelashes</li>
            <li> just need to have a steady hand.</li>
            <li> I was able to reach the upper lashes from above my glasses.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like that my lower lashes show now as I&#x27;ve always despised using mascara on those.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, do not get it in your eye.</li>
            <li> The key is to be sure to apply a lot of petroleum jelly or similar product to the surrounding eye area.  </li>
            <li> as a natural blonde, i always felt like i could not leave the house without my eyebrows filled in and some mascara on...</li>
            <li> The main act according to instructions.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it, I just read the directions and did exactly what they say to do, except I bought disposable mascara brushes to apply the gel, but I&#x27;ll get back to that</li>
            <li> I will most likely go back to the salon and pay to have them do it</li>
            <li> Also, I applied to the top and bottom of each upper and lower lash, and left it on for 15 minutes before removing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit older</li>
            <li> I plan to re tint my lashes and it has been only two weeks but want to see if the color takes better the second time.</li>
            <li> it is strong and you do need to be careful not to get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> very natural looking!</li>
            <li> Since eyebrow hairs are so thick and close together, this product works perfectly to make eyebrows dark and still look natural, with no clumping as with mascara or unnatural lines as with brow pencil.  </li>
            <li> Read lots of reviews and never was able to get this to stick to my eyelashes and keep them dark for more than a few days.</li>
            <li> reason for three stars is that the price is way to high for the amount given and the color is brown not black.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product, but I suggest you try another one that&#x27;s cheaper and gives a deeper color result.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and have not had any problem applying if I take my time.  </li>
            <li> high recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has minimal hand-to-eye  coordination can apply this product successfully, w/o ANY mess or fuss.  </li>
            <li> (yeah, okay, and a little lipgloss, too.</li>
            <li> and hopefully it will just be better with a little practice.  </li>
            <li> AND IT DID - COMPLETELY!!  </li>
            <li> You will love your dark lashes!</li>
            <li> The process is a bit messy and you should make sure you have a steady hand before applying.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how easy it will be to get the Activator out after several applications and the bottle is less full.  </li>
            <li> But, it is so easy to apply, I wouldn&#x27;t even mind applying every other week.</li>
            <li> I have long lashes that are generally blonde-ish, and this worked great to add a little color.</li>
            <li> It is hard to apply but I am willing to try it again maybe with a friend to help me apply it to see if that works better.</li>
            <li> But, when I do dye them, I do the process of colorant and activator 3 times just to make sure I get every lash and to ensure that they are very dark.</li>
            <li> More than anything this stuff made my eyelids bright red and burn like crazy.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not forced to devise some miraculous cosmetic plan to cover up the damage for work.  </li>
            <li> The mascara wand makes for precise application with minimal to no</li>
            <li> This works fast, lasts  for couple of weeks, and looks absolutely natural.</li>
            <li> with thoroughly clean and dry eyelashes, skip the vaseline under the eyes  </li>
            <li> have been growing like crazy and are getting really full (nice ;-)</li>
            <li> But maybe they&#x27;ll become more \\&quot;porous\\&quot; after a few applications?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an inexpensive product and it says you get alot of applications with it, totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I sure wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my funds.</li>
            <li> It is more trouble to do it yourself</li>
            <li> and they were pretty much the same after 3 applications.</li>
            <li> I have normal length eyelashes</li>
            <li> By the third time I had learned to use it very carefully(within a mask of Vaseline)  to draw on eyebrows exactly like I was putting on eyebrow pencil.  </li>
            <li> I got better at it after a few times.</li>
            <li> Make sure to use vaseline on your skin prior to dying because it&#x27;s really easy to get a tiny bit on your lash line and it will stain for a few days.</li>
            <li> After the first few applications it was just as easy as putting on regular mascara maybe just a minute longer prep time but lasted much longer of course!  </li>
            <li> &amp;Uuml; ) I&#x27;ve used the lash growth on the brows as well, for all those new pretty, long lashes and brows grow in -white!&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it is not hard at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not terribly hard to put on with a mirror, vaseline, and the skin shields.</li>
            <li> The stuff they give you is also very difficult to use, so I tried a clean mascara applicator and it worked slightly better, but you have to use more of the product which means it doesn&#x27;t last for 25 applications.</li>
            <li> I got it on our white sink and rinsed it with water right away...</li>
            <li> I do my right eye then left</li>
            <li> Best are salon treatments, if available - in MA it is now illegal (another ridiculous MA law), so it&#x27;s a hassle to find a place that will still do it.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is a true \\&quot;dye\\&quot;, and is permanent in that it does darken the lashes significantly and slowly wears off over four to six weeks.  </li>
            <li> -I didn&#x27;t bother with the Vaseline because I have a pretty steady hand and with the tiny mascara wands</li>
            <li> TO APPLY DYE AND DEVELOPER, YOU CAN EVEN WASH THEM AND REUSE OR JUST TOSS AND USE NEW EACH TIME.</li>
            <li> Live and learn.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Live and learn!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This is a new staple in my make up case.  </li>
            <li> Be very careful and you can have fantastic results.</li>
            <li> As most of the body hair bleach brands use the same materials, I&#x27;m sure that Jolene or any other similar hair bleach system (using a dry powder bleach you mix with a creme activator) will work.    </li>
            <li> I have very light and thin lashes and it seems like a lot of work to barely see this tint on my lashes and it does not seem to last more than a day for me.</li>
            <li> product is worth the money and it will last a very long time~ which makes it worth</li>
            <li> This was easy to apply (I followed cleaning and application advice from a previous user)</li>
            <li> To be clear, the stinging sensation was only on my actual eyeballs, and I expect it was just because of the fumes of the strong dye.</li>
            <li> sure that the swab is really wet and re-wet it for each of the 3 applications you will do prior to using the colorant gel.    </li>
            <li> I have blonde hair, so this product is very helpful and appreciated.  </li>
            <li> I have blonde eyelashes, and while this doesn&#x27;t thicken them, I can go without mascara - a nice, natural black color.</li>
            <li> I do one eye at a time, keeping it closed, so I&#x27;m dying the top and the bottom at the same time.</li>
            <li> Way more control of where that balm/petroleum gel goes; little to none on the stuff I am trying  to tint!</li>
            <li> I have pale blonde lashes, and my lower ones/the fine lashes in the corners of my eyes didn&#x27;t take very well on the first try.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to do one hand at a time, but the bleach stays good for quite a long time after you mix it up, and you can reuse the same bleach on the other hand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Additional Tools I Use: I also use a 1) high magnification mirror to do this work, 2) clear lipstick [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a pain in the rear to apply, easy to make a mess, and unlike mascara doesn&#x27;t lengthen or thicken your lashes.</li>
            <li> A little got into my eyes and burned a lot the first time which then bled onto my skin but no blindness and no staining so as long as you use the Vaseline as directed you will be ok.</li>
            <li> I am sitting here looking at very black, completely colored lashes, top and bottom.  </li>
            <li> First I thoroughly cleaned and dried my lashes, using a mild cleanser</li>
            <li> However, if you clean the stains off immediately with a clean, dry swab (no stain remover until you are done tinting) as they occur, there will be less staining to deal with at the end.    </li>
            <li> IT ONLY WORKED THE FIRST TIME.   </li>
            <li> And ideally, especially if it&#x27;s your first attempt at it, don&#x27;t plan on going anywhere afterward.  </li>
            <li> First, I recommend watching some videos of people applying the product or similar tinting products on Youtube.com.  </li>
            <li> And usually do 2 applications at a time to make sure everything gets dyed.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last 28 days, but for my purposes, it worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> the first time i used this product it didn&#x27;t seem to work, but the second time it did.  </li>
            <li> Apply the gel on the back of lashes first (also where the tinting brush is needed to get closer to the lid)then on the front of the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> used the white undereye guard on the first eye.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, it nearly burned my eyes out!</li>
            <li> I am 26 and a natural light yellow blonde.</li>
            <li> To put it simply, this product does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to the letter during the first two applications last night.</li>
            <li> i found this product and realized it was the exact same one they used on me at the salon!</li>
            <li> I left the color portion on for 3 minutes rather than one after the first application, and that helped a lot.  </li>
            <li> It really didn&#x27;t do much for my eyelashes-it was difficult to apply and it kind of burned my eyes.  </li>
            <li> that t he product has been opened and used I am not getting the same results as the first time.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it caused a red itchy rash under my bottom eyelid.</li>
            <li> and I used it last night for the first time.</li>
            <li> Upper first then lower lashes.  </li>
            <li> It comes with more instructions this time, but the photos are so small</li>
            <li> The pads that came with it to go under your eyes felt odd and got in the way, so I took them off and was fine without them.</li>
            <li> I have blonde lashes, so I often get them tinted at my salon, but that costs a pretty penny.  </li>
            <li> I like having at least a slightly visible eye lash, looks pretty good when I use my curler on them.  </li>
            <li> Using this was very messy, and it was mostly washed off in one day.</li>
            <li> mascara stuff was not only kind of hard to use, but mainly it just didnt do anything.</li>
            <li> the black  color is too light like almost brown.</li>
            <li> Colored my light brown lashes to black and hopefully will keep the color for the 28 days as advertised.</li>
            <li> Process quick but lashes not much darker than before.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear mascara anymore and wanted my eyelashes to be dark enough to be able to see them.  </li>
            <li> First, my order arrived much quicker than expected.  </li>
            <li> I did that but found it worked much easier if I added activator gel #2 to an individual mascara applicator (you can buy a package of 20 for very little) which applied the #2 gel much more efficiently.  </li>
            <li> took other reviewers&#x27; advice and used an old (clean) mascara wand.  </li>
            <li> Recently, I accidentally spilled the color vial in my Roux kit, and would have had to purchase a whole new kit to replace it.  </li>
            <li> This new formula is much messier and totally DID NOT WORK!  </li>
            <li> It worked so well and no mess!  </li>
            <li> Doing the lower lashes on one eye first, you can then compare them to the other eye&#x27;s lower lashes, and you will see that, if you did it correctly, the tinted lashes are much darker than the untinted ones.    </li>
            <li> but it certainly does not last 28 days for me.  </li>
            <li> one point I got a little too comfortable with the application and managed to poke myself in the eye...</li>
            <li> I took off one star because I didn&#x27;t feel the black color was as rich as it could be.</li>
            <li> It does have a little bit of a lengthening effect because most lashes are lighter at the tip, and this colors the entire lash.</li>
            <li> It will burn your eyes if you get the activator in it, but a warm wash cloth will wipe it away and it isn&#x27;t a lasting burn (I learned the hard way).</li>
            <li> I sometimes use clear mascara to still get the thickening and curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are practically clear but I&#x27;m prone to eye infections</li>
            <li> the faster you clean it off the less it will stain.    </li>
            <li> fortified clear mascara.</li>
            <li> clear-</li>
            <li> (I buy clear ones to dye my eyebrows)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I have silver/clear eyelashes (natural redhead).</li>
            <li> As far as duration, I just did it today, so I don&#x27;t know yet...    </li>
            <li> I saw this in the schwarzkopf professional supply store.</li>
            <li> going to try to get someone to help me with it but have been too busy to do it yet.</li>
            <li> However the second time was much smoother keeping these things in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have ever had a professional eyelash tint</li>
            <li> I just want to see what I have naturally, so tinting is still my preference.    </li>
            <li> Using the mirror as well gave me a complete, clear view of each lash on my lower lid.  </li>
            <li> And it has to saturate each lash completely, hence the reapplications before moving on to the coloring step.  </li>
            <li> Yes, that brush is now kept in the kit&#x27;s box, so he doesn&#x27;t use it by mistake, but the tinting solution cleaned off completely.  </li>
            <li> Comes as complete kit with everything you need to do the job.   </li>
            <li> Although my eyes are extremely sensitive, none of the product got in my eyes or stained my skin.  </li>
            <li> I found the application process simple and it didn&#x27;t sting as much as the salon version.  </li>
            <li> liquid (activator), then #2 step of brushing on gel (colorant) directly on the lashes.</li>
            <li> A totally ineffective product that can cause you much discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I endorse the 28 day mascara completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Esthetician and have used the professional dye for years, it lasts longer</li>
            <li> Also anywhere it touches on your skin around your eye is permanent for at least three days, so better have \\&quot;extreme\\&quot; coverage makeup.</li>
            <li> I screamed so loud.</li>
            <li> (A spider surprised me in the bathroom and my hand twitched</li>
            <li> when i found out about lash tinting, i found a salon near my house that did it for $25.</li>
            <li> bleach).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seriously sensitive eyes and it doesn&#x27;t bother them at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 58 years old woman and</li>
            <li> if I can do it with a professional look then anyone can do it.  </li>
            <li> only did them once but ready to do them again.</li>
            <li> The key is to do one eye at a time and to not put on too much product at once.    </li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews on how to make this stuff work (the instructions in the kit are completely inadequate).  </li>
            <li> So without mascara, the length is completely lost.</li>
            <li> I had NO trouble at all doing it this way, all my lashes dyed beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product does work, don&#x27;t listen to the obviously obtuse reviewers who claim it stains the whole bathroom and their hands/face, but can&#x27;t go on the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> - it works very well (and has also stayed on my eyelashes for the last three weeks) - although it does sting your eyes a bit from the chemicals.</li>
            <li> The packaging looked old as well.</li>
            <li> But then, if they did that, they wouldn&#x27;t sell much of the actual product.  </li>
            <li> and it was NOT messy.  </li>
            <li> I have had my lashes tinted professionally for years.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to start doing them at home to save money but this dye in no way compares to how they look after I have them done professionally from the salon.</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well and gives you the same results that you could get from a spa.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not at ALL someone with sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve never had that reaction</li>
            <li> It burns the eyes, even there is no harm and it says it&#x27;s a &#x27;natural&#x27; product</li>
            <li> I have short brown lashes and it really didn&#x27;t make a difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;Hard</li>
            <li> do it for me at the salon.rand, or have a professional</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this product</li>
            <li> if you ask me) and damn near clear eyelashes and brows.</li>
            <li> use an old mascara wand for the corners I feel</li>
            <li> Does not last 28 days as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Apply like mascara - will work much better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I did not cover every lash very well, but it makes a big difference for me .</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of this item after reading the different reviews, but glad I went ahead and tried it.&lt;br /&gt;Fairly simple to use, just take your time and make sure all directions are clear before you start.</li>
            <li> All I ended up with is eyelashes so dark and now full</li>
            <li> If you choose to give this product a shot you MUST make sure the petroleum-based product you coat the skin around your eye with before starting the tinting process is heavy on the petroleum side.  </li>
            <li> True, this product does make you lashes dark.</li>
            <li> Make sure you take the time to prep all your supplies and only do 1 eye at a time because it can be messy and it will sting and make your eyes water.  </li>
            <li> So I reapplied the bleach on those areas again for a few more minutes and all the stains were totally gone, even around and underneath my fingernails.      </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say that the applicator stick is kind of a pain in the butt to work with, and I personally think it sucks.</li>
            <li> I pushed wand into activator and applied to lashes (a few times to get them nice and wet) and then applied color gel to wand and wipe through lashes till covered the way I like.  </li>
            <li> The petroleum jelly was good, but it&#x27;s difficult to not get it on the eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I dont really need them, i just put a little vaseline around my eyes, if i get it on my skin it wipes right up with a cotton swab.</li>
            <li> The instructions make the application process sound easy, but if your experience is anything like mine you will get frustrated with the under-eye pads, which come loose easily even when they are coated in Vaseline.</li>
            <li> You need to devote sufficient timeto the whole tinting process, and to do only one set of lashes (upper right, lower right, upper left, lower left), at a time.  </li>
            <li> I found this product to be very easy to apply with minimal mess.  </li>
            <li> The tint was visible right after application on my left eye, but disappeared after showering the next day.  </li>
            <li> I have pale, light brown/blonde lashes and</li>
            <li> Easy to use as long as you follow directions carefully.  </li>
            <li> The reason I am editing my review is that I have stumbled across an easy way to quickly remove all dye stains from your hands, which are almost inevitable as no one can really work with those silly hair dye gloves on.  </li>
            <li> I applied the first product and let it dry...</li>
            <li> I am expecting the tint to last for about 2&amp;1/2-3 weeks, I will update this review if it lasts for a significantly shorter or longer period than expected.</li>
            <li> this product is easy to use, but I have used a lot of this stuff in the past.</li>
            <li> It was not as black and very black mascara, but I was overal very pleased with the color and  look.</li>
            <li> No mess, no pain,</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll have virtually no mess.</li>
            <li> the best - thick black mascara looks too harsh on me, but as this is just a dye, it has a soft look, doesn&#x27;t thicken or clump like mascara.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to purchase this product for many years and the price finally came down, I could not resist!!  </li>
            <li> Be very careful applying this, but it&#x27;s well worth the effort.  </li>
            <li> It was still not black.  </li>
            <li> I took off my mascara, then washed my face, paying particular attention to my lashes, using actual soap.  </li>
            <li> I used a brush with two sides, and dropped some of the ingredients into separate small dishes, to try to be sure the contents of the two tubes stayed apart until I mixed them as directed.    </li>
            <li> Instead they look darker (but not black).</li>
            <li> Following some online advice from another site, the first time I used this I actually applied it twice.  </li>
            <li> I repeated the application of small amounts of tint until I had covered every bit of each lash, I also applied tint to both the top and bottom sides of my upper lashes.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my eyelashes dyed at the salon in the past - but wanted to dye the top lashes only -</li>
            <li> It still is not as dark as it would be with mascara, however, I am comfortable enough to go without mascara now.</li>
            <li> Then you need to wait one minute (or a little longer is OK), for the developer to dry.  </li>
            <li> I have dark hair and eyebrows, but very light eyelashes, so I thought I would give these a try, since I actively swim, jog, etc.  </li>
            <li> Did VERY little to imporove the look of my light brown lashes and the product was skimpy...</li>
            <li> Have tried several rounds of dying, trying to get the knack of it and basically can get a bit on the top row of lashes, but the bottom lashes are hardly touched  and the corner lashes are almost completely untouched.  </li>
            <li> -By being very careful and applying only small amounts of tint at a time, I was able to avoid getting very much on my skin.</li>
            <li> I always felt so self conscious about how &#x27;bare&#x27; my eyes looked without eyeliner and mascara.</li>
            <li> I usually wear brown mascara, but the brown in this product was too light.</li>
            <li> I followed all of the directions carefully, but on my first try, none of the color stayed on my lashes at all.</li>
            <li> No, my lashes are not naturally dark...</li>
            <li> However, my lash tips are blonde, and my lashes only look long and full when I use mascara.</li>
            <li> However, the color does not last more than a few showers, especially if you scrub your face the way that I do.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not dark.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I got a bit of staining (like wide eyeliner) around my eyes which looked</li>
            <li> Well, I guess that is true in two weeks when the dead skin cells fall off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be careful notto rub your eye very much, and when drying- just gently pat your eyes dry.</li>
            <li> And the little bit you are lucky to get on the lashes doesn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes are long, fine, and sort of dark.  </li>
            <li> The tint is fine, but the gel activator is VERY eye irritating (hurts like a MF).</li>
            <li> The product sounded good, but it was a bit messy and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> A little hard at first to get used to using, but I am getting better, and know I like it.</li>
            <li> First go left one side light and the other side a little 2 toned</li>
            <li> Try to let your lashes dry before doing too much else, and don&#x27;t wash or use makeup remover for 24 hours or so.  </li>
            <li> I can see that if you have totally blonde lashes than this will give an improvement, but if just blonde on the ends this doesn&#x27;t make them stand out much.  </li>
            <li> I could at least see it on the top lashes but didn&#x27;t make enough change to buy again.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my lashes tinted at salons many times over the years, and this product can provide salon-quality results...but it may take you a few tries to get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> had had my eyelashes tinted professionally in the past and was truely intimidated about performing the process myself.</li>
            <li> My husband said it looks very natural and makes my almond shaped eyes look like they are open wider.</li>
            <li> really can&#x27;t figure out how a single person had issues with the application process.</li>
            <li> Afterwards it was barely noticeble &amp; what color there was washed out in two days!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick lashes, but the tips of them are light making them seem shorter and sparser than they really are.</li>
            <li> Two major drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was hopeful it would last and keep me from having to constantly wear mascara, especially during the hot sweaty summer months.</li>
            <li> If you go to YouTube and search this product, Godefroy has a video tutorial showing exactly how to apply it, and it&#x27;s extremely helpful.&lt;br /&gt;Using</li>
            <li> These last tints usually take better the second time.</li>
            <li> The included pads used to put under the eye to protect the skin need to be cut way down to fit under the eyes and don&#x27;t stick very well, even when glopped with Vaseline, as advised in the instructions, so some staining happens which takes a few days to wear off.  </li>
            <li> first you have to paste on the eye shields with petroleum jelly that you have to get yourself, the eye shields are very large and need to be cut and still make it hard to open your eyes</li>
            <li> This eyelash tint performs as described - it tints your eyelashes black, quickly, fairly easily, and not too messy if you have a steady hand.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product for eyelashes unless you&#x27;re a very light-skinned blonde; but if you dye your hair black or dark brown from a light color, you can use this product to make your brows pop.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I felt the color (black) wasn&#x27;t as dark as I would&#x27;ve liked; but then again my blonde eyelashes are practically invisible.  </li>
            <li> The bottom lashes didn&#x27;t seem to tint as dark, but it could be that they are just so fine that it&#x27;s harder to see.      </li>
            <li> My lashes are now a deep, rich black color!</li>
            <li> This was very easy to use, but not sure I will continue to use since it didn&#x27;t make my lashes as dark as I would like.  </li>
            <li> but it was hard to tell because they&#x27;re relatively light.</li>
            <li> You get more control with the fan brush too so less mess.</li>
            <li> To apply the balm I use an actual small angled paint brush (generally available at any craft store).  </li>
            <li> Now, at 50, my lashes are still long, but not nearly as thick, and have faded to a lighter brown, with the tips almost invisible.  </li>
            <li> Especially if you curl the eyelash and then apply clear mascara.</li>
            <li> Now I just apply clear mascara over my lashes and it looks like I have on regular mascara without the running or raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> It really does last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll probably just use water to completely was it off rather than trying to wipe it with a tissue.</li>
            <li> I will go back to a professional.</li>
            <li> I used an old one from my last mascara tube after washing it well)!    </li>
            <li> stings your eyes if you are not really careful.</li>
            <li> And no, I do not have extra sensitive</li>
            <li> I already have pretty dark lashes</li>
            <li> never happened when I got my eyelashes professionally tinted, so it must be this specific formula.</li>
            <li> Second time I prepped my lashes just as instructed, and used an old mascara wand to apply.</li>
            <li> the color barely showed up on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The amount of dye was barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> My lashes barely have any color after four repeated treatments.  </li>
            <li> In fact my last application I settled for directly dying my skin so that my \\&quot;eyeliner\\&quot; matches and forgetting about getting my eyelashes dyed.</li>
            <li> If you get too much in one area, use a lash brush to redistribute while it is still wet.  </li>
            <li> As I said, only one eye was sensitive...</li>
            <li> The trick to not letting it sting you eyes is to just gently hold your eyelid closed.</li>
            <li> Holy Mary, mother of God!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the results lasted barely two weeks.</li>
            <li> Time to find a different brand, or have a professional</li>
            <li> I was careful with the petroleum jelly and the eye guards, but it turned out I didn&#x27;t really need them</li>
            <li> I apply the gel twice and the dye once finishing one eye completely before moving to the next.  </li>
            <li> my lashes look no different and my skin is completely stained.</li>
            <li> I used two different mascara brushes that I cleaned up from old mascara tubes I had laying around.  </li>
            <li> wanted mine pretty dark</li>
            <li> have only applied one application so far.</li>
            <li> They are darker but I can barely tell ...</li>
            <li> but I can barely tell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The final step where you use a damp tissue to remove the product did sting a bit but everything was back to normal within a minute.</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to get it IN your eye, somehow I managed to get a tiny bit the first time I used it</li>
            <li> Just be careful not to get it IN your eye, somehow I managed to get a tiny bit the first time I used it</li>
            <li> So for the amount of results seen on my eyelashes, wasn&#x27;t worth the effort of applying every few weeks.</li>
            <li> The application wand that comes in the package is hardly an effective tool to apply the product, and it is difficult to avoid staining your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Applying the colorant right after makes it glob a little and it looks darker</li>
            <li> Back then, the box contained q-tip like cotton applicators, a glass bottle with clear liquid (that goes on first), and a tube of black gel</li>
            <li> Recently spas in my area (W. WA) have stopped dying lashes - new laws or regulations about too much potential danger to the eyes ---</li>
            <li> With common sense, it is easy to make the necessary adjustments.  </li>
            <li> Wish It came with more applicators and was made so it was less messy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident I will be quicker and less messy.  </li>
            <li> It is tricky to use, will take a few times to get right.</li>
            <li> I have to say at first I was a little afraid of how safe this really was since both the product and petroleum jelly say not to get in eyes!</li>
            <li> If you are very careful, or can get a friend to help, this is certainly cheaper than a salon.</li>
            <li> I used the product (in black) twice on the first eye and the difference was virtually nonexistent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clearly not black even after doing the application several</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to apply and stays dark for at least 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> Although it is a little tedious to put on, it worked great.  </li>
            <li> I was pretty preoccupied with dealing with the mess and may not have fully coated the lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products that irritated too much.  </li>
            <li> and then both my upper lashes at the same time making this whole process post shower about five-ten minutes long)</li>
            <li> , they might waste a little more product though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have missed some lashes or it is not dark enough</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference and hard to apply</li>
            <li> Hard to apply, stings and really doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> If you get black in step one on your skin, finish applying it to your lashes and clean it up with a wet Q-tip.  </li>
            <li> Some of the reviewers have been having trouble with this product not setting or washing off, and I think the trick is to start with really clean dry lashes.  </li>
            <li> So, I tried the do-it-at-home kits, starting with Roux, the old standby, purchased at a local beauty supply store for about $32.  </li>
            <li> I usually spend about an hour in the bathroom doing this, but that&#x27;s because I love my lashes to be extremely dark</li>
            <li> I found that the tint is activated when your lashes are damp, not dry.  </li>
            <li> But I wound up going to a salon (and paying more) to have it done professionally after the two containers became useless.  </li>
            <li> But the result is nice, and I can do without mascara for a few weeks, at least.</li>
            <li> I applied the product exactly as instructed, but when I rinsed at the end, all of the product simply ran down the drain.</li>
            <li> My first try though resulted in a bit messy \\&quot;liner\\&quot;, so I&#x27;ll try a thin eye liner brush next time, as well as a mascara wand, which would probably help to reach every lash better than the provided q-tip.    </li>
            <li> This makes them dark and look fuller by catching every little hair and making them dark.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t as deep of a black tint as I&#x27;d hoped, but it was pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once you rinse the solutions off and your lashes dry, they will separate back to normal.</li>
            <li> A few hours after application my eyes do feel a bit sensitive, sort of similar to the way they feel a few hours after chopping a strong onion or swimming in a chlorinated pool.</li>
            <li> If you have really dark lashes already you probably won&#x27;t get much of a result.</li>
            <li> First time I tried it, I followed instructions and it was a total mess.</li>
            <li> I dyed my lashes today, and made a much greater mess of my hands than usual.  </li>
            <li> The tint worked well enough to get those, but really made no difference to the other parts of my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and did the following:  used inter-dental brushes for the color and activator, they work very well.  </li>
            <li> I have very blonde eyelashes that you could barely see.</li>
            <li> Nowhere near as long as when I have it done in a salon.</li>
            <li> so I rarely use mascara (and usually end up regretting it).</li>
            <li> Oh well..... wasn&#x27;t the first time I wasted money like that.  </li>
            <li> After allowing the tint to dry for a few minutes, I washed my eyes with mild face wash (I use baby wash).</li>
            <li> Dont put too much product on, it shouldnt be running off or spilling down your face.</li>
            <li> Took a couple times to get the application down, but gets much easier.</li>
            <li> I read several comments that it was hard to apply...and they were right!  </li>
            <li> If you avoid rubbing your eyes and gently pat your eyes dry, you can get it to last a long time.     </li>
            <li> It was a little tricky the first time but by the 3rd I am a pro!</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was that when I opened the first tube, it spurted out a little.  </li>
            <li> It will not make you look as if you are wearing mascara, which thickens and adds length to lashes, but the tint will make your lashes a dark, rich black color.</li>
            <li> Next time - and I will try at least one more time - I will be VERY CAREFUL in the application of the gel colorant.</li>
            <li> My lashes are already dark brown so perhaps it was naive of me to expect any more than what I got.  </li>
            <li> , I applied liberally, three separate times, waiting for it to dry completely.  </li>
            <li> Your lashes really do get black and they stay that way.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t last long at all, also there is nowhere near 25 applications as promised.</li>
            <li> The only slightly messy part happened when I first punctured the tube of colorant, but I was expecting that, so I had a hand towel</li>
            <li> The new box contains 2 differently shaped plastic applicators (a comb type and a plain stick type), and then the black gel you put on first, and then a clear gel you put on second.  </li>
            <li> Small tube goes on first, let it dry, large tube goes on second, let it dry, wash off.</li>
            <li> It was very messy and the color came right off....would not recommend</li>
            <li> The dark patches wear off after a couple showers, and the same is true of any dark patches caused by the 28 Day mascara.  </li>
            <li> (I was afraid it would be messy after reading other reviews), but I was very happy after I finally tried it last night.</li>
            <li> I let mine dry completely before moving on to the next step.</li>
            <li> The application was not hard at all regardless of other reviews.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are blonde and this made them slightly darker, but i felt like it was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> I only have a few grey eyelashes but don&#x27;t like mascara, it always flakes and I have tried every brand from too expensive to inexpensive and it all works the same, so this is a great solution.  </li>
            <li> it works good but stains the skin and it difficult ti use without a mess</li>
            <li> I think the main thing is to get a dark enough color so that it shows up.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave the skin dry or noticeably lightened where the bleach was applied, although it might if you left it on too long or have dark skin - just be careful to apply precisely to the stain in that case.  </li>
            <li> like I do you can use this then use a clear mascara to get the wet look.</li>
            <li> I have pale (almost white) lashes and this works really well to add some color to my lashes, but it doesn&#x27;t take the place of mascara.</li>
            <li> I think repeating right away is a waste because your lashes may be wet still and won&#x27;t take the tint.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First, this product works as advertised, but is very messy.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product, I have blonde eyelashes and always have to wear mascara or false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Now that they are dark, I don&#x27;t look sleepy and it looks very natural.</li>
            <li> I bought &amp;#34;Just for Men&amp;#34; for half the price in jet black and success in just one minute.</li>
            <li> I nearly didn&#x27;t buy this product after reading other reviews, but decided to try it anyway.  </li>
            <li> Since I only applied a small amount of activator and tint at a time, I only got a little bit of the tint into my eyes, and it did sting, but luckily there was too little on my brush to cause any real pain.</li>
            <li> This product allows you to have dark lashes natural lashes all months with only one application.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes and even eyebrows are clear with a slight bit of white blond at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure any surface is not prone to staining, because it&#x27;s near impossible to get this out.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> then used a q-tip to wipe of any excess still on my lashes, although I did not have much because I used a small amount of activator.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty clumsy and fumbly, so I was iffy about trying it out on myself.</li>
            <li> I applied with one of those tooth floss brushes as I read online and worked very well as the bristles are small</li>
            <li> Doing the tips creates the effect of dark lashes without going near my skin.  </li>
            <li> Trying to vasaline a flat price of cotton onto a curved area does not work well.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a long lasting \\&quot;mascara\\&quot;; not a lash dye/tint.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll review later to see how long the tint lasts.</li>
            <li> I waited long enough for it to set, well it dies your skin</li>
            <li> I also have several white/grey lashes because I have started going grey.</li>
            <li> My eyes are not sensitive at all, and I have never felt such pain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am unsure how long it will last, but I have had them dyed for 2 weeks now</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as it says</li>
            <li> I especially like how long it has made my bottom eyelashes look.</li>
            <li> Does last as long as mascara.</li>
            <li> would last that long.</li>
            <li> My guess is that after such a long time, it expires?</li>
            <li> It looks like this package will last a long time, so that saves me a bunch of money from salon prices and tips.  </li>
            <li> I have very blonde eyelashes and have been getting them professionally tinted every 5 weeks for a little over a year.</li>
            <li> The only place that I accidentally stained with tint was a small place on my upper eyelid right above the lash line in the outer corner (I usually smear mascara in the same spot by accident).</li>
            <li> I have very long blonde eyelashes</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try tinting my lashes at home to save money, but the color did not last very long at all.</li>
            <li> It will last a very very long time.</li>
            <li> and/or is always faint enough to cover up with light foundation if it doesn&#x27;t wash off completely.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was in the rain and muggy heat one day and in the water most of 2nd day.</li>
            <li> On me black doesn&#x27;t look all that natural.</li>
            <li> I found it easy to use, but I am not impressed at all with the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long this 28 Day Mascara tint job will last, and will update this review if I think the product didn&#x27;t hold up as long as the Roux.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;d use them every single time I left the house.</li>
            <li> Sorry for the bad news girls, but if it seems too good to be true, chances are it is.</li>
            <li> I left the creme on them for about 5 minutes, and it had taken most of the stains off and reduced the really dark ones until they were faint.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to the letter, but notice only a minimal change in colour - not nearly as dark as other products.</li>
            <li> I had no problem using the old box, it never got my lashes very black, but enough that it made a difference</li>
            <li> I followed what was recommended on the box, as well as followed tips posted by others, but was very disappointed to find that not only did my lashes take on the color only minimally, but I was left with awful stains lining both my upper and lower lash lines...not in a nice \\&quot;semi-eyeliner\\&quot; kind of way, but in an \\&quot;I&#x27;ve been crying for the last hour\\&quot; kind of way.  </li>
            <li> the first time were so subtle that I had to reapply again to make it darker.  </li>
            <li> After reading other product reviews, I see that some others have had the same problem, it simply does not work.</li>
            <li> use the spoolies to apply a small amount following the directions... makes my nonexistant lashes looke like a 20 year old model&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other lash dies and they were more complicated to put on.</li>
            <li> I was very careful following the application instructions, and tried applying the product several times in a row.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous at the thought of putting chemicals near my eyes.</li>
            <li> Even though I still have a little of the product left, I chucked it in the trash and ordered a different brand (hopefully the next one will work</li>
            <li> and it does not make lashes real dark.... very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I am 50+ years old with slightly wrinkled, and loose skin around my eyes..  </li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about purchasing this product because I have very fine lashes</li>
            <li> I did it like 4 times and left the dye on for 3 to 5 minutes in order to get my eyelashes dark enough.</li>
            <li> Have gone back to regular mascara; can&#x27;t say that it stayed dark for anything over 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> but I waited too long and my return window expired.</li>
            <li> As long as you use vasoline along the lash line there will be no staining.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll see if 28 Day Mascara lasts that long.</li>
            <li> I decided I would give it a shot and be extra careful with it.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting, doesn&#x27;t stain your skin as long as you wipe up any spills asap.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> I have long, practically invisible eyelashes</li>
            <li> but they are grey so they don&#x27;t grow darker.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that it lasts as long as it says it does.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time.</li>
            <li> /right/differently to result in such a wide spectrum of, er, results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with it staining my skin for long, but it will stain your nails for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In summary, this product lasts as long as the salon treatment did.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> AT ALL, I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of it on my eyelashes, and my eyelashes are so long they brush the insides of my glasses when I blink, so</li>
            <li> Although they&#x27;re long,</li>
            <li> Just be careful to only get the vaseline on your skin, and NOT your lashes!</li>
            <li> I have long lashes</li>
            <li> I personally think this was money well spent and defintely intend to use this product again.</li>
            <li> You dont have to leave it on too long though.</li>
            <li> so i would use a magnifying mirror, kind of awkward , but it only takes a few minutes to do.</li>
            <li> then you have to put on one product which then stings your eyes so its even harder to open your eyes, then you have to put the dye on with a q tip.</li>
            <li> I am a professional and this was just a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> because I wasn&#x27;t careful enough with the product.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time too.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I knew that the pointed end of the q-tip was not going to work very well for applying the tint, so I used a tiny (no more than half an inch long), angled mascara wand specifically designed for applying mascara to the lashes in the corner of the eye.</li>
            <li> I am a traveling girl living out of a suitcase, so the fact that everything fits into a little zip lock baggie is a major bonus for me!</li>
            <li> I have thin medium brown lashes with light tips and this black tint worked -</li>
            <li> Not only were my lashes only slightly darker, but I accidentally got it on my nails.</li>
            <li> Washed off after 2 days and only left my lashes slightly darker</li>
            <li> As soon as I put the 2nd solution on the lashes, they instantly turned black.</li>
            <li> If you put it on carefully it makes your lashes completely black and natural looking.</li>
            <li> I used to never leave the house without mascara thanks to this product that&#x27;s a thing of the past!</li>
            <li> obviously doesn&#x27;t look as dramatic as mascara, but it does darken my blonde lashes and that&#x27;s exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> The first day I tried it I saw every little result on my lashes and a lot on my hand!!!</li>
            <li> The pads it comes with do need to be shaped and I folded them, so they were a little thicker and then shaped them, and they worked very well with a little vaseline on the under-side.</li>
            <li> did it with a professional lip brush (small rounded flat tip) and the comb it came with in the box.</li>
            <li> I did buy a very soft small bristled makeup brush for applying the tint (step #2  </li>
            <li> Not sure why the color would not stick to my eyelashes very well even though I cleaned and dried my face, and followed the directions properly.  </li>
            <li> As all the other reviewers have stated, it is a bit tricky to use, but I actually used the staining to my advantage and let it touch the edges of my lids where I would want eye liner anyway.  </li>
            <li> Even following directions carefully, one blink during the application process, and it&#x27;s in your eye, and it burns fiercely!</li>
            <li> The directions say to keep the different product mixes away from each other, so they do not mix, and make the dye.</li>
            <li> The cotton eye guards have sharp upper edges that kept moving around and jutting into my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A bit tricky to get the hang of and a little messy, but it really does work.</li>
            <li> It is okay a little difficult to use</li>
            <li> few negatives I have dont really affect the rating I gave it.&lt;br /&gt;For one I threw away the little pads</li>
            <li> The process was a bit messy on the first eye but much less messy on the second.  </li>
            <li> Roux&#x27;s kit is hard to use, as both the developer (1st solution applied) and the color (applied on top of developer) are thin liquids.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are very long, and I also use Latisse.</li>
            <li> I wiped the stain with a damp q-tip as soon as it happened, so it is very minor.</li>
            <li> they reccomend 1-2x letting it dry between</li>
            <li> but I did it 3-4 coats and letting it dry between)    </li>
            <li> Remember to wash and dry your lashes before applying to rid of any oils.  </li>
            <li> I tried a second time a few weeks later using an unused mascara brush and avoided the vaseline step.  </li>
            <li> It only takes a few minutes total.  </li>
            <li> The kit includes enough product for multiple applications - which you&#x27;ll need in order to practice a few times to learn how to use it.      </li>
            <li> this product was a total waste of money the only thing  am walking away with is my eyes on fire</li>
            <li> only complaint that I could have so far is that when/if it gets in your eyes</li>
            <li> ) The tint is so watery that it stained only the middle of my lashes, missing the roots and tips, even though I sponged my lashes repeatedly in attempt to cover them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, in a nutshell, the product  works, but you have to be careful with the Vaseline, keep your eye closed and maybe do a double application to your bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> I had intended to use an old mascara wand, but realized that this wouldn&#x27;t work with my method (the under-the-glasses application) as it was just too big and thick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m young and have thick eyelashes, they&#x27;re just blonde.</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to it advertisement.  </li>
            <li> This product does not live up to</li>
            <li> It takes a couple tries to apply it without getting a little messy but it really works and lasts about a month.</li>
            <li> worked but the result is a dark brown, natural looking, but I wanted black like the roots of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I have long eyelashes that are black, but the tips are very blonde</li>
            <li> In the past I have always just bit the bullet and gone into a spa to have my lashes done professionally.  </li>
            <li> Lashes did not get dark enough.  </li>
            <li> If your lashes/brows are already dark you will probably not notice a difference (same thing as if you had it done at a salon---</li>
            <li> have dark eyelashes on my upper lids</li>
            <li> I bought this and the eyebrow tint by this same line in dark brown.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> old towel on counter, cotton swabs just in case, small damp rag--just in case.</li>
            <li> I usually get at the beauty school for ten bucks, It does not seem to last as long either.</li>
            <li> So, the second time I skipped them and was just real careful with my application.  </li>
            <li> my lashes are darker, and now I can see how thin they really are!  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I was going to be a new mom and knew that it would be hard to always put on mascara.</li>
            <li> When I would get some of the black gel in the wrong spot, it was easily removed with a cotton swab.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it all the way down next to the eyelid</li>
            <li> It was messy and difficult to apply, but the new version is much easier!</li>
            <li> I want my roots to be completely covered, so that the little baby hairs around my face look naturally dark.  </li>
            <li> , only apply a small amount of tint at a time but repeat until every side of every lash is coated (apply to each lash from multiple sides)  -go slowly and carefully, applying a small bit at a time; keep plenty of q-tips on hand to quickly wipe away mistakes    </li>
            <li> It has to dry!  </li>
            <li> next time I&#x27;ll just get the black.</li>
            <li> I ordered the black and my lashes are blonde, not even a hint of color was on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I even tried it twice in the same day, thinking maybe the first time I did it wrong.</li>
            <li> I was blessed with thick, long, naturally curly lashes, of a medium brown color (I&#x27;m a redhead).  </li>
            <li> My lashes are extremely black now, and I have washed them a couple of times and have applied moisturizers several times.</li>
            <li> Changed my blonde lashes to black lashes in a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li> had blonde eyelashes; now I have black eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in black and have used it several times now.  </li>
            <li> it will simply tint your lashes black so that they are visible.</li>
            <li> It does stain your skin, enough that I look like I have black eyeliner on.</li>
            <li> It has survived my normal routines for a few days in response to a user saying it washed off after a few hours...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so slight and only lasts a day or so.  </li>
            <li> I just do one eye, then the other, and then go back to the other, etc.  </li>
            <li> hopefully I&#x27;ll get black next time.</li>
            <li> I have bone white eyelashes and like to dye them black.</li>
            <li> There is no fullness to the lashes only slight color.</li>
            <li> It actually did color my lashes black and it lasted a month as advertised.  </li>
            <li> A while ago I posted the below negative review out of sheer disappointment and quite honestly, panic, due to the stains I acquired along my lash line....</li>
            <li> It made a bigger mess with it than without.</li>
            <li> Keep eyes open and CAREFULLY apply the black-</li>
            <li> That being said, I did get a little bit on the eyelid at the base of the lashes and I added more to the \\&quot;mistake\\&quot; to create an eyeliner effect as a test to see if the \\&quot;eyeliner\\&quot; would stay and how long it would last as opposed to the actual eyelash</li>
            <li> There is a slight color difference in my bottom lashes mostly, my top ones have barely at all :(</li>
            <li> Did not properly clean their lashes prior to tinting.  </li>
            <li> I can see every little lash, even the itty bitty ones that hide in the outer and inner corners.</li>
            <li> (there should not be activator dripping off the q-tip), and I repeated this process until I had thoroughly coated every little bit of eachlash (and coated each lash multiple times).</li>
            <li> The gel that dyes comes in a little tiny squeeze bottle, and it&#x27;s a gel, so I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s getting everywhere?!?!</li>
            <li> Go slow and dont put too much activator on, it tends to splatter and will burn your eyes a little.  </li>
            <li> There is a slight tint to my extremely reddish blonde lashes.  </li>
            <li> I was very careful applying this to my eyes, but it is virtually impossible to apply without touching your skin.</li>
            <li> The tutorial suggested using small dental appliance brushes that you can generally find with the dental floss and appliance items like wax for braces.</li>
            <li> U have to be as careful as hairdye.</li>
            <li> The item is not really what I expected at all.  </li>
            <li> Did not last 28 days and application was messy and runny to apply.  </li>
            <li> No volume to lashes, just minimal tint.</li>
            <li> meaning that the containers arrive mostly empty.</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> The pads kept falling in spite of the vaseline and made it harder to put the product.</li>
            <li> By day 4 it&#x27;s not really visible.</li>
            <li> I absolutely do not recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Apply the activator liberly, but carefully.</li>
            <li> I got a glop of gel tint on the eye shield and carefully pulled away one of the layers and the glop went with the eyeshield.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use the eye pads, just apply it to my lashes as directed and wipe off with wet cotton balls after the application is done.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and ended up carefully using a mascara brush to apply the gel tint.  </li>
            <li> I found that even though I was careful NOT to contaminate (mix)</li>
            <li> a 10x magnifier mirror helped with careful application.      </li>
            <li> and it makes them water so you lashes get wet.</li>
            <li> I left it on for a few minutes after I know</li>
            <li> Repeat in a few hours or the next day until they are darker.  </li>
            <li> One tip: It will stain porcelain so be careful when using it around the sink.      </li>
            <li> but it does dye my lashes for about a week with minimal sting.  </li>
            <li> Both worked out, but as expected, the disposable brushes were quite a bit easier.</li>
            <li> Did not do what I it said it would nor as I expected.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to get it on fingernails.  </li>
            <li> The before and after difference is minimal, and I still need mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is only messy if you rush through it.  </li>
            <li> You do need to be careful when applying.</li>
            <li> I take my time and carefully apply the product using the provided</li>
            <li> I also did not get them wet in the shower.  </li>
            <li> All you have to do is cup water in your hand and basically hold your closed eye in the cupped water</li>
            <li> so be careful when applying it you your face if you choose to use it...</li>
            <li> I will come back in a few days to update this review with a one week post application review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> rate it minus 5 stars</li>
            <li> Just be careful with the product getting into your eyes.</li>
            <li> Tried to return, and seller said they did not do returns, so it was a total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> If you have thin eyelashes or medium-colored eyelashes already, you will not notice much difference.</li>
            <li> you have to be careful</li>
            <li> Some would be careful not to get the hydrogen peroxide on my skin and others would not meaning I would have a headache .  </li>
            <li> I try to be careful and protect my eyes</li>
            <li> As others have said , you have to be careful not to contaminate the two products with one another</li>
            <li> /&gt;BE CAREFUL opening the tube of colorant.  </li>
            <li> and wash the brushes with soap and water between each eye application or it will get messy and ultimately will ruin the process for you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> then wait a minute and wipe it all off with wet rag.</li>
            <li> I was just careful and basically treated it like it was mascara.</li>
            <li> This is a lot of effort with minimal results.  </li>
            <li> The lash tint effect is minimal...</li>
            <li> what had/hadnt worked for others, so I tried a few different approaches</li>
            <li> Application was easier than I expected.</li>
            <li> Unlike a  day spa where you wait 15 mins with your eyes closed for the color to take , this takes minutes.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Follow the instructions carefully.  </li>
            <li> Its kinda messy and needs a different applicator.</li>
            <li> (I wore false lashes all thru high school in the 70&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> my lashes using the qtip and then put on the activator - it&#x27;s instant black eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Maybe if you have blonde or pale lashes you would see results</li>
            <li> but the brows are two weeks darker now... and the black color was not too dark for this blonde.</li>
            <li> This is a toxic product which will damage your eyes-- plain and simple.</li>
            <li> Not a facial cream, not a makeup remover, not even a moisturizing soap, just plain soap.  </li>
            <li> It works, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> This dye is just not strong enough to dye my lashes.</li>
            <li> I believe the key to application is do not be in a hurry, go slow, and if you need to use a q-tip without cotton to apply slow and steady.  </li>
            <li> Yes it can be messy if you do not take your time and go slow and steady.  </li>
            <li> I have long thin completely transparent lashes, so the effect is minimal</li>
            <li> I removed all mascara and other substances from my lashes carefully and washed them throughly, twice.</li>
            <li> Followed directions carefully, even followed the tips given in other reviews here.  </li>
            <li> Other difference is now you wipe it off with a wet kleenex, instead of washing in the sink.  </li>
            <li> There is, however, a vague, bluish grey color under my lower lashes, which I know will fade away completely over the next day or two.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably impossible to make something like this that would be easy to use.</li>
            <li> It works-not like extensions dramatic, but it does make them look longer and much darker.  </li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t last as long as it claims (at least not on me), it beats putting on mascara every day.</li>
            <li> You will see some black come off on to the towel when patting your eye dry.     </li>
            <li> Hate the time it takes to apply mascara and have tried MANY since my long time</li>
            <li> To my surprise I woke up the next morning with some of my fingers a little black from the dye.</li>
            <li> Be CERTAIN that the (very hard to use) shields are cut firmly  and attached to ALL your under and over eye skin.</li>
            <li> The second eye, which I managed to get a bit more of the base of the lashes did leave a little dye on my lids, but it just looked like eyeliner.</li>
            <li> overall for very little darkening of the eye lashes and a lot of cleaning up and your eyes stinging for 5 minutes i would not get this again, nor requemend it.</li>
            <li> I did not experience any burning sensation since I used only a small amount of activator</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with leakage as other reviewers mentioned</li>
            <li> I had read all the horror stories from other reviewers so was a bit hesitant to buy this product.</li>
            <li> Never dripped, smudged, stained, burned or any of the other problems people have reported.</li>
            <li> However, I apply these per directions and did not experience the staining like some of the other reviewers, but also no dying either.  </li>
            <li> As with any other product, it will work for some and not others.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and also took some advice from other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> Rather than just re-order Roux, I perused other possibilities online and found this product on Amazon, 28 Day Mascara.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why other reviewers found this kit didn&#x27;t work for them, excluding those who thought tinting meant a mascara-like thickening and lengthening miracle.</li>
            <li> Did not use a small enough, or</li>
            <li> Usually after the third week I think about re-tinting,</li>
            <li> A small makeup brush helped apply vaseline, a tiny \\&quot;dental spiral brush\\</li>
            <li> I was disappointed in the product a bit...but more in how it made ME look than the product.</li>
            <li> I kept them away from each other like two rabid dogs, and somehow there still ended up being gunk in the liquid.</li>
            <li> I found this product online and read the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I could see only a small improvement.</li>
            <li> But I used a small eyeliner/brow/eyeshadow brush (which I cleaned with soap and water each time before use) to apply the color, which instantly appears (no waiting).  </li>
            <li> like other reviewers said: this is not a replacement for mascara.</li>
            <li> I skipped the eye pads and petroleum jelly (vaseline) as even a small bit of petroleum jelly will only get on the lashes and prevent the product from adhering.  </li>
            <li> -only apply small amounts of activator at a time, but keep at it until you thoroughly coat each side of every lash (then coat each lash again)  </li>
            <li> , I went ahead and bought a pack of disposable CURVED mascara brushes at Sally&#x27;s beauty Supply for about $3, due to the reviews on here</li>
            <li> When I opened the package there was only one small plastic stick to stir with which has to be used over and over again.</li>
            <li> I will say when I went to do my other eye, when I went to rinse it off, the lashes didn&#x27;t get dyed.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m leaving it because the reviews don&#x27;t seem all that glowing partly due to the messiness of the product.  </li>
            <li> As some other people stated, I also don&#x27;t use the cotton cover things.</li>
            <li> The key to using this product is to have small applicator brushes (like what comes with Latisse, like a nail polish type brush).  </li>
            <li> I sometimes use those skinny brace-flossers (I forget what they&#x27;re actually called, they&#x27;re the ones with the small bristles)</li>
            <li> I shied away from applying the recommended petroleum jelly (based on other reviewer comments).</li>
            <li> I cannot wear mascara due to allergies-</li>
            <li> usually other people can&#x27;t tell whether I am wearing mascara or not.</li>
            <li> So I read some of the other reviews and</li>
            <li> I suspect that some reviewers reported less than expected results merely because they were not looking at their newly tinted lashes properly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a blonde, but I bought the black because I have really long, thick lashes, you just can&#x27;t see them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little tedious, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I had my daughter apply it, and she followed the directions very carefully</li>
            <li> Be very careful.</li>
            <li> Also, when trying to remove, although I was very careful, it irritated all the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I tried it twice, followed directions very carefully.</li>
            <li> , I went through the steps again, and had the very same results: not a bit of color on my pale lashes!</li>
            <li> It is easy to get frustrated.</li>
            <li> Holy cow</li>
            <li> and, they are thick enough, but as I have aged, they have become ligthter colored on the ends.  </li>
            <li> it works but it takes a long time to get it done right its very frustrating and very messy also</li>
            <li> if your single and cant see up close don&#x27;t buy it!!!</li>
            <li> The product is a little tricky to apply (be careful not to get it on countertop, clothing, etc.).</li>
            <li> I have red hair which is extremely hard to dye, permanent hair dye stays in my hair 3 months tops.</li>
            <li> recommended using a small, thin makeup brush for applying the first step - the cotton swabs are a little unwieldy for that part.</li>
            <li> used the dark brown for no reason other than it was cheaper than the black.</li>
            <li> The dye is stingy ( if gets in your eye) but weak - doesn&#x27;t last as long as they claim and never gets really black on your eye lashes even after 2 or 3 repetitions.</li>
            <li> the end of the day it does tint but not as dark as it should</li>
            <li> but I guess mine are dark already.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this eyelash dye did not work very well.</li>
            <li> If you have dark eyelashes, then this product is not for you.  </li>
            <li> Really dark stains on almost every finger, including the nails.  </li>
            <li> Then, I had to mix up some hair bleach for my daughter, who hates her dark arm hair.  </li>
            <li> Just skip the Vaseline/paper cover step entirely, go slowly and carefully, and accept that you will have some minor staining for a day or so.  </li>
            <li> I have dark eyelashes and just wanted the tips darkened.</li>
            <li> and they turned really dark.  </li>
            <li> But they are in no way gorgeously dark like they appear after having this done at a salon.  </li>
            <li> My lashes are dark blond to brown...</li>
            <li> I wanted them dark.</li>
            <li> my eyelashes are blonde, and I thought this would darken them so that I wouldn&#x27;t need to put on mascara when I&#x27;m running late for work.</li>
            <li> And now my lashes are a visible dark brown/black all of the time.</li>
            <li> no difference for already dark lashes).  </li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t understand why people are saying this is so difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I also make a thin line of eyeliner with this process and while it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the lashes, it works well.  </li>
            <li> This products application was messy, to say the least, and after TWO applications, there was barely any difference.</li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t buy this again on account of my lashes being already dark, but I would buy the brown for my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> done - my lashes were uniformly dark -</li>
            <li> I am Latina with dark lashes.</li>
            <li> My lashes are dark anyway</li>
            <li> was not worth the time and hassle.</li>
            <li> Also, if you already have dark lashes, I don&#x27;t think you would see a benefit from using this.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> Allow yourself enough time to move slowly.  </li>
            <li> hate to give it even one star, as a star implies there is some redeeming quality that can be found.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> Way too messy and not much in the way of darkening eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I slowed down and took my time.</li>
            <li> suggest using a magnifying mirror, sit down and get everything together on a paper plate.</li>
            <li> I tried the glasses that turn down</li>
            <li> I have it down to an art now though&lt;</li>
            <li> I did use little dental brushes as other reviewers have mentioned - and those seemed to work well.  </li>
            <li> other reviewers have mentioned DO NOT TRY TO DO THIS IN A RUSH!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to use, you have to be careful.</li>
            <li> I ordered the less expensive brown color even though I really wanted the black</li>
            <li> I use the black for my eyelashes and the dark brown for my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> I got the lash tint in black, it is not as dark as the lash tint</li>
            <li> I  didn&#x27;t use it on my eyebrows, as black would be too dark.  </li>
            <li> Order black, because even the black isn&#x27;t quite as dark and pronounced as I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I have very blonde eyelashes and don&#x27;t like to go out without at least a little mascara on.  </li>
            <li> It wastes alot of product this way.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend due to the wastefullness of the application.</li>
            <li> As I did with the activator, I only applied a very small amount of tint at a time to avoid getting it in my eyes.</li>
            <li> It works, just be very careful!</li>
            <li> Sliding the glasses down a little on my nose, and angling the mirror so that I was looking down into it when I tilted my head, I had room to maneuver the swab soaked with the developer underneath my glasses, so between them and my eye.  </li>
            <li> If I could give less than 1 star I would.</li>
            <li> less face cleaner for cleaning up.</li>
            <li> AND I USED THE BLACK...</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is significantly less money than one salon treatment</li>
            <li> I bought this in black and couldn&#x27;t tell any difference when I used it.  </li>
            <li> I order the brown, thinking I had ordered  black.  </li>
            <li> I cut mine in half and trimmed again once it was sticking to the under eye petroleum jelly.  </li>
            <li> I took the advice of previous reviewer and used a mascara wand to apply.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s less than twenty bucks...</li>
            <li> I had black died fingers for about a week, but as soon as you do your rinse, it comes off of your hair.</li>
            <li> I recommend tearing one of the eye protectors in half and using it that way.</li>
            <li> The thicker, gel consistency of the colorant made it easier to apply than the Roux solution, so less staining.  </li>
            <li> So I used one of my son&#x27;s braces brushes - a disposable mini brush (half an inch,</li>
            <li> but I had to cut and reshape them by half for use (perhaps I&#x27;m a tad  beady-eyed).    </li>
            <li> but I would have like to have made them black black.</li>
            <li> I used black.</li>
            <li> Maybe cause I already have black eyelashes?</li>
            <li> I now have these black unattractive marks that make me look like I&#x27;m diseased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the black goop just kept wiping away...</li>
            <li> Needs 2-3 coats to get black lashes.  </li>
            <li> Previously, I was going to a salon to have my eye lashes tinted - but they recommended that I go every two weeks</li>
            <li> I used the black tint</li>
            <li> After applyin a couple times, youll kniw what works for you and the process will take less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> so I use less but still touch up my bottom lashes every so often.</li>
            <li> The fumes did not bother my eyes which has been issue for me with previous tints I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> As soon as the color stays black</li>
            <li> Each day it was less than the day before.  </li>
            <li> I got black</li>
            <li> 28 Day Mascara Black Permanent Eyelash Tint Kit Contains 25 Applicat...</li>
            <li> No complaints using this product...just don&#x27;t be in rush using it or you&#x27;ll have black spots where you don&#x27;t want them.</li>
            <li> She then dyed mine and my lashes are black now</li>
            <li> Do they just package black tar in a tube and sell it as this stuff?</li>
            <li> and they turn black using this but no additional volume or length.</li>
            <li> :B008USICDG Godefroy 28 Day Mascara Permanent Eyelash and Eyebrow Tint Kit Singles Black]]</li>
            <li> but I ordered black</li>
            <li> and my eyelashes are still black.  </li>
            <li> I did not end up with lashes like the ad displays, but I must admit that all two dozen of the lashes I have turned black.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t want black brows.)</li>
            <li> But in terms of my eyelashes - they worked on my blonde/light brown lashes and I no longer have black circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I ordered black and received brown--</li>
            <li> They were just slightly darker for about 2 days.</li>
            <li> I would not buy this product again unless they have a darker black, as is the result</li>
            <li> My lashes are black.  </li>
            <li> This is what I found worked a little for me, and they aren&#x27;t as dark as I would like them to be.</li>
            <li> This was an awful mess and didn&#x27;t make my blonde eyelashes any better.</li>
            <li> The bottom lashes are long, but hard to see.  </li>
            <li> The product did not run or get in my eyes when I did and it made less of a mess on my skin with my eyes</li>
            <li> Just apply a layer of petroleum jelly under your eyes and down to the tops of your cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions, squeeze a little bit from tube 1 onto the designated &amp;#34;brush 1&amp;#34; and apply liberally to eye lashes like you would mascara.  </li>
            <li> And I have to say I&#x27;m usually a mess with things like this.  </li>
            <li> I only put a small amount of activator (no more than a few drops) on the q-tip each time</li>
            <li> Seems to work, and I haven&#x27;t made a mess yet.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the time, trouble or expense.</li>
            <li> If you have dark lashes, don&#x27;t waste your money or time, it will do nothing for you.</li>
            <li> I did get it on my skin, but with the petroleum jelly as a barrier, it doesn&#x27;t stain at all when removed with tissue or a Q-tip as the mess ups happen.  </li>
            <li> The name is misleading, so if you already have dark lashes don&#x27;t waste your money, it is not a substitute for mascara since it doesn&#x27;t thicken lashes at all.  </li>
            <li> I also use it for my eyebrows which are sparse and basically a mess from over plucking.  </li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t make a mess at all.</li>
            <li> I have a tendency to mess</li>
            <li> You WILL make a mess with this.</li>
            <li> But for everyday, I now have some definition to my eyes with dark lashes, which I like.  </li>
            <li> I have to give it a half way mark as it did eventually make a little difference but</li>
            <li> I hope this helps people who are having trouble bc if you can get the application down</li>
            <li> (A little does go a long way, at least), and tried to dye my eyelashes tonight.</li>
            <li> I also hate when I get back home late, naturally tired, go to bed and get all comfortable only to realize I never took my mascara off...     </li>
            <li> I noticed a little sesitivity afterwards and used some soothing eye cream.</li>
            <li> Dark lashes!      </li>
            <li> have darkened the a little.</li>
            <li> But it will make your \\&quot;natural\\&quot; appearance a little prettier.</li>
            <li> and it just brightens my eyes a little.</li>
            <li> The little bottle probably had 25.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was a little uncertain but ordered this anyway...  </li>
            <li> I started with the little eye pads</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use the little under eye papers anymore.</li>
            <li> I should say I did not see any difference again, just a little gteyish color.</li>
            <li> burned a little</li>
            <li> I did get a little dye on a couple fingers and finger nails...</li>
            <li> so it bugged me a little.  </li>
            <li> My lashes (what little I have)are brown, but never got any darker.</li>
            <li> though, it splatters a little.  </li>
            <li> They appear fuller because I try to he every little lash that I can find.</li>
            <li> I refuse to leave my house or let my friends see me without even a little mascara and brow powder.</li>
            <li> to see if I could get a darker result, it helped maybe a little.</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> I  used the comb to apply the gel instead of the little sticks.</li>
            <li> I am a redhead with lighter eyelashes that are almost blonde at the roots; the roots were near impossible to get to darken.  </li>
            <li> I have blonde lashes and not very many to boot, but after using this product, I can at least see them!</li>
            <li> and I did make a few changes to make application a little bit easier.  </li>
            <li> I have used this item twice and it is a little messy</li>
            <li> and they are still very dark.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find salons that still offer lash tinting, and the price is prohibitive ($40, and a tip is expected).  </li>
            <li> but it works must be careful not to get on skin hard to remove..</li>
            <li> You have to be careful, of course, but it wasn&#x27;t that hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I let it sit for a few minutes</li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions and the results, and watched a few vidoes of helpful tips to apply it and the results</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I&#x27;m very skeptical about products doing what they say they will.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Actually, it sort of looks like thin eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Do go slowly and be careful when applying this product.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste you money like I did.</li>
            <li> I felt like I didn&#x27;t get the base lashes coated well enough and applied a second time within the same day.  </li>
            <li> Yes it dried out my skin, but as soon as I was done with the tinting, I moisturized the heck out of my face.    </li>
            <li> If you use a swab and are careful, these will work to remove or at least reduce the tinting stains.  </li>
            <li> I purchased 28 day mascara a few months ago, but  after reading the reviews, I was scared to try it.  </li>
            <li> Just get it on the lashes and go over it a few times</li>
            <li> Messy.  </li>
            <li> Simply a waste of money in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of your money.  </li>
            <li> And it took a few days to get the dye off of places where I didn&#x27;t want it.  </li>
            <li> They tinted unevenly.</li>
            <li> Unevenly.</li>
            <li> It works, just is messy.</li>
            <li> Yes, it was somewhat messy because I did tear up a few times...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy.</li>
            <li> users, this product was messy and did not color your lashes as stated on the instructions.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It was definitely a waste of time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Had them dyed by a pro a few months ago.  </li>
            <li> (I assume the skin stains will be gone in a few days).  </li>
            <li> Works well when you dont want to wear mascara everyday.</li>
            <li> I dont like to wear mascara everyday because it is drying so doing this once a month makes my eyelashes stand out.</li>
            <li> and I do not want to put mascara on everyday.</li>
            <li> : it&#x27;s helpful to put a business card on your upper eyelid and paint the solution onto your lashes with the card behind it.</li>
            <li> I just used it a few hours ago.</li>
            <li> (I washed and dried the wand thoroughly before using to apply tint).</li>
            <li> Plus I am learning how to prevent getting it into my eye at all (an option not available at the salon).</li>
            <li> Although somewhat messy, I did like this....but stopped using it because it is messy.</li>
            <li> I would like to mention that this will not give your lashes the full effect that mascara gives, so if you lack length and volume in your lashes, you might be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do that because it sounded messy and if you accidentally get that stuff on your lashes, the dye won&#x27;t take...</li>
            <li> This was messy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not THAT messy.  </li>
            <li> I hope it lasts for a few weeks but will continue to use even if it starts to fade before 28 days.  </li>
            <li> Lasts about 3 or 4 weeks and has quite a few uses in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be heavy handed or put a lot of product on your applicator.  </li>
            <li> Dried out my lashes 3.</li>
            <li> I used it a few days in a row to darken the look.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t wash off or wear off in a few days.</li>
            <li> bought as a gift and when she opened it the tint tube was opened and messy so will be returning</li>
            <li> Without mascara I look much younger and tired.</li>
            <li> can be messy.</li>
            <li> No harm, but it wasted a bit of the product and could have stained something if I had not opened over a paper</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to reapply it everyday, worry about smudging or taking it off at night.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Learning how to apply the dye without getting it all over took me a few months, but now I can dye my lashes in about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why some people have so much trouble.</li>
            <li> I know it is going to be messy--</li>
            <li> but it was so harsh on my lashes</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money again.</li>
            <li> I tried using a disposable mascara wand one time and it seemed to just waste the dye.  </li>
            <li> Too much trouble for that.</li>
            <li> While the lash tint was almost imperceptible and lasted maybe a week, I find that tinting my brows lasts about 6 weeks and defines and perfects them.</li>
            <li> I think a few people who reviewed it poorly maybe mixed up the tubes?</li>
            <li> I tried this on my sister with her laying down and did get some in her eye which stung pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> Black eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Ill never go back to the other tint again.</li>
            <li> I think that any negative reviews are due to people expecting a mascara-like product or those who do not use it correctly.</li>
            <li> Too bad they don&#x27;t make samples you can purchase for a few dollars first.  </li>
            <li> I have found that even when my lashes have been dyed twice, I cannot achieve the same dramatic effect as I would with volumizing mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not easy to use and didn&#x27;t seem to do what it was intended for.  </li>
            <li> this is not really easy to use, but I made it work.</li>
            <li> but ugh what a mess!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this, and bought it even after reading some of the other bad reviews.</li>
            <li> it is impossible to use and my upper and lower eyelids are the only thing with dye on them</li>
            <li> I have a white corian bathroom counter which now has weird black inkblot stains on it</li>
            <li> Your eyelashes turn as stay instantly dark for at least 2-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> It was a little messy but nothing that was too hard to deal with.</li>
            <li> When I would go without mascara, my eyes looked dull and people were constantly telling me I looked tired.</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is it also stains the skin behind your eyebrows for a day or two.</li>
            <li> Makes my lashes black and stays that way for at least a month.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful that it would work, but this product does exactly what it claims: it tints lashes black.</li>
            <li> A little hard to use.  </li>
            <li> This product does very little to darken your lashes and it doesn&#x27;t thicken them at all.</li>
            <li> Tried it 4 times and it added very little, if any color.</li>
            <li> I have thin pale lashes and do not want to wear mascara every day (rough on the lashes-applying and removing!).  </li>
            <li> Product was messy and hard to use.</li>
            <li> I used Roux Lash And Brow Tint for years and really didn&#x27;t like how toxic it is and how badly my eyes hurt after use, aside from the fact</li>
            <li> And I usually read the reviews before buying a product but don&#x27;t always listen.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, like many others, I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Sometimes there&#x27;s a bit of dye on the skin under my lower lashes, but it usually fades away after a face wash or two</li>
            <li> and that all these other reviews are dumb people...</li>
            <li> I just ignored the small amount of liquid on my glasses until I was done with my lashes, and then wiped it off.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what wide-eyed alien species these pads were designed for</li>
            <li> this product delivers... get the small spoolies used for people with braces in the toothpaste aisle.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did!</li>
            <li> It only lasts about two weeks with me - not sure if I&#x27;m doing something wrong.  </li>
            <li> Usually just mascara and sometimes eyeliner.</li>
            <li> No more mascara needed even in the pool.</li>
            <li> I squeezed a small amount of tint onto a q-tip, then used the q-tip to apply the tint to the wand.</li>
            <li> I have really blonde lashes, so was skeptical this would work after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only rating it on ease of use - much to complicated.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll take a few stains on my hands in place of dealing with mascara every day!    </li>
            <li> so it must have been excessive amounts to cause</li>
            <li> Their eyebrow tinting kit is no better.</li>
            <li> Also, have a q-tip for dab any small spots that bleed over onto skin.  </li>
            <li> I usually touch up about every 2 months at the max...</li>
            <li> if I&#x27;m feeling lazy and don&#x27;t get around to it before then.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I was not sure that it would make any difference at all.  </li>
            <li> They are small and have bristles and they coat the eyelashes</li>
            <li> As some have suggested, use those small dental brushes for braces (the dollar stores carry them sometimes) to apply, they help.</li>
            <li> Even when applied carefully, the color coverage is poor.</li>
            <li> Some people complained about having trouble with the applicator</li>
            <li> Do one eye/brow at a time, let it dry/wash it, before switching to the other eye (yes, common sense, but I thought it was like applying mascara - it&#x27;s not!)</li>
            <li> I put a thin layer of Vaseline on my eyelids with a Q tip, careful not to smear it on my lashes.</li>
            <li> The only disappointment was that the activator in the kit is gone well before the black dye.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend doing this at all however, if you don&#x27;t have a very steady application, because getting this in your eyes is pretty nasty and mistakes are difficult to correct if you don&#x27;t correct immediately.  </li>
            <li> From the beginning, it was not nearly as good as the Dylash; It was never quite as black and my eyelashes never took the color quite as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tired other tints and ended up spilling them all over my bathroom, getting them in my eyes and all over myself.  </li>
            <li> you can pull your lid up and really get all the little hairs at the base and the ends.</li>
            <li> As for the actual application, the odd-shaped \\&quot;q-tips\\&quot; that come with the product are clumsy and difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Take the suggestions to use vasaline and the paper shields seriously unless you plan to stay locked in the house for a few days afterwards</li>
            <li> Although this product does dye the eyelashes somewhat, the coverage is not very good.  </li>
            <li> Product is very hard to apply without making a mess.</li>
            <li> 28 day mascara was extremly difficult to use, very messy, and the end result was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Hard to use.</li>
            <li> This product does work for darking the lashes but it is hard to replace the thickening effect of mascara.</li>
            <li> Hard to say.  </li>
            <li> The angle at which your lower lashes curl makes them hard to see regardless of their color, so</li>
            <li> 28 Day Mascara does not work and is hard to put on.  </li>
            <li> Looked up video on line to make instructions clearer, but it was still hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Used to use a liquid type brow tint, and it was so hard to control.</li>
            <li> Hard to use applicator as well.  </li>
            <li> I can see why some would give 1 star though because it&#x27;s hard to apply!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to get it close to the lash line.  </li>
            <li> Product is hard to get on your eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> Hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I can hardly tell I used it at all</li>
            <li> This item sucks....</li>
            <li> So much so that I could not wear any mascara that added length or thickened, as it made it look like I had a bad set of false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that this kit is still not perfect, there will be stains and stinging no matter how careful you are, and the process can still be improved.    </li>
            <li> Count on at least 30 to 45 minutes, and do one of the four sets of eyelashes at a time from start to finish.  </li>
            <li> This product sucks.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what caused me such disappointment in Godefroy with their 28 day mascara.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as difficult to use as I had expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally dirty blonde hair, so</li>
            <li> I purchased this despite the negative reviews from others, hoping it would work for me.  </li>
            <li> At least it does not irritate the eye at all though.</li>
            <li> Godefroy reads all the negative reviews on this page and discontinues</li>
            <li> I wanted my lashes colored so that when I&#x27;m at the beach or pool, or just getting up in the morning, you can at least tell that I have eyes.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need either straight-up vaseline or a thick balm (non-minty of course).  </li>
            <li> Although now I realize my lashes aren&#x27;t as thick as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and were at the end of the line when they were handing out \\&quot;thick and luscious\\</li>
            <li> Lay everything out and take the slow release lid off the activator  4)</li>
            <li> I think the trick to using this product is to go slow and be patient.</li>
            <li> Just apply slowly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why my eyes burn so much, but I grit my teeth through it because I hate my white-blond eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> but they aren&#x27;t thick</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> waste your money!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very messy and it doesn&#x27;t work at all!</li>
            <li> But this is a very small place, it just looks like I have a bit of eyeliner on.</li>
            <li> *word of caution, do the skin test, but do a VERY small area, like a dot or so.</li>
            <li> This product isn&#x27;t that difficult to use once you get a system down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I could talk for hours about how awful this product is, and what an absolute waste of money it was.</li>
            <li> This product needs  serious work.</li>
            <li> I have long eyelashes that are dark at the base, but something like sun-bleached at the ends.</li>
            <li> But still it&#x27;s less expensive then getting it done in</li>
            <li> It was a little difficult to use</li>
            <li> I did it myself which was a little scary but did so with out difficulty.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re a little useless addition</li>
            <li> my eyes burned so bad that they literally turned blood red.</li>
            <li> Not a good look.</li>
            <li> This product is messy, difficult to use and does not work.</li>
            <li> Not a good look.   </li>
            <li> I tried to wash it off as quickly as possible, but it was too painful...</li>
            <li> It was difficult to use and messy to apply.  </li>
            <li> if your not good at this stuff, have a friend over and do each others, its safer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use the eye shields as they were uncomfortable after a few seconds when I blinked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brand is just no good.</li>
            <li> but I became frustrated because I never got the same technician.</li>
            <li> my eyes when I am tired and having mascara on them has a negative outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not good, wouldn&#x27;t purchase again</li>
            <li> but at least I don&#x27;t look like a raccoon!  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed, and wish I could get my $17 back.</li>
            <li> I still need mascara if I want them to be thicker and longer, but at least now they show up without anything on!</li>
            <li> VERY HARD TO USE.</li>
            <li> It does dye your lashes, but its very hard to use without mistakes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to put on</li>
            <li> May work if you have very thick lashes but didn&#x27;t help mine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just safer and takes some of the pressure off because it IS a little awkward - expect a bit of a learning curve.  </li>
            <li> I expected this though; it is painful when I have this done in the salon too.  </li>
            <li> THE WORSE</li>
            <li> I have never got my lashes tinted at salon before, where I HAVE NOT experienced burning in my eyes</li>
            <li> in my area, approximately $60.00.</li>
            <li> Poor design...</li>
            <li> I hate wearing mascara on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> So I did what they said, applied a thin layer of vaseline under my lashes, placed the TRIMMED pads on the vaseline</li>
            <li> I bought it for my bottom lashes but they were too thin to see any difference.  </li>
            <li> I was getting tired doing the mascara ritual every morning before work, or before I would go out.</li>
            <li> Considering the severe difficulty of application it made the price that much worse.</li>
            <li> Doing just one eye at a time - I put a thin layer of vaseline on my lid and under the bottom lashes  - and used the cotton eye pad that was included to protect under my eye.  </li>
            <li> I  tired it  3 time  </li>
            <li> Lashes remained thin as before I used.  </li>
            <li> I can wear mascara, but still feel that it looks like false eyelashes -</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m into false lashes</li>
            <li> I saw other reviews of people how ignored the bad reviews thinking they could make it work, I am one of those people who also thought I could make it work.</li>
            <li> Seriously bummed!</li>
            <li> And it might stain your lids a bit if you are too sloppy, but</li>
            <li> It is a bit difficult to get to the base of your lashes without getting it all over you, especially the bottom lashes.  </li>
            <li> It was a bit messy to appy but no too bad.</li>
            <li> If you take your time and apply it carefully, you can get it to go from the base to the tips of your lashes.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention, it&#x27;s near impossible to rinse it off without either getting some on your face (stain!!!)</li>
            <li> The darkening of my lashes is not worth losing my lashes, so this product is going in the garbage :(</li>
            <li> Well, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, horrible!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Once you apply this product, it takes just 2-3 minutes per eye - in the salon, they left the dye on for 10-15 minutes - it would leak into my eyes and be very painful.     </li>
            <li> but it you hate black mascara</li>
            <li> It was very disappointing and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to do, I have shakey hands</li>
            <li> Yes...there are varying petroleum intensities and THAT is where I went horribly wrong.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> If I could give less than 1 star I would. Absolutely worthless. Don&#x27;t bother.  Saw no result. Waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> It does the job but it certainly does not last 28 days for me.  More like 14 days</li>
            <li> Hard to use. Did not continue to use.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time today. I am so impressed with the results. I think a few people who reviewed it poorly maybe mixed up the tubes? Small tube goes on first, let it dry, large tube goes on second, let it dry, wash off. I let mine dry completely before moving on to the next step. Maybe that also makes a difference?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My lashes are dark right along the lash line, but the tips are fair. I love how they look when I wear mascara, but my eyes are sensitive and I always end up rubbing them and smearing mascara all over. Not a good look. I sometimes use clear mascara to still get the thickening and curling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used one of those Dentek brushies to apply the product and it was really easy to get it exactly on my lash and not my skin. Instead of vaseline, I used lip balm. Basically the same idea, right? I was nervous about getting vaseline on the actual lashes and the dye not taking well as a result. I was able to get very close to the lash line and cover the skin without getting goopy vaseline all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final step where you use a damp tissue to remove the product did sting a bit but everything was back to normal within a minute. Next time I&#x27;ll probably just use water to completely was it off rather than trying to wipe it with a tissue. To be clear, the stinging sensation was only on my actual eyeballs, and I expect it was just because of the fumes of the strong dye. I didn&#x27;t get any dye in my eyes and my skin didn&#x27;t sting at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the dark brown for no reason other than it was cheaper than the black. I&#x27;ll buy this again for sure and next time I&#x27;ll just get the black.</li>
            <li> I have utterly colorless eyelashes and bought this product, expecting it to fulfill its claims of dying my lashes, possibly making mascara no longer necessary for me. I followed all of the directions carefully, but on my first try, none of the color stayed on my lashes at all. Thinking perhaps I had made some kind of mistake, I went through the steps again, and had the very same results: not a bit of color on my pale lashes! After reading other product reviews, I see that some others have had the same problem, it simply does not work. I removed all mascara and other substances from my lashes carefully and washed them throughly, twice. I applied the product exactly as instructed, but when I rinsed at the end, all of the product simply ran down the drain. Very unhappy consumer!</li>
            <li> This product simply did not work for me. I read all of the directions and followed them.  The product did not adhere to my lashes; I saw no change in color.. I did received what i ordered and would never use this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would use the seller again as the product did come in a timely manner and as described.</li>
            <li> I debated on this for a good couple weeks before buying. I have red hair which is extremely hard to dye, permanent hair dye stays in my hair 3 months tops. My eyelashes are practically clear but I&#x27;m prone to eye infections so I rarely use mascara (and usually end up regretting it). I didn&#x27;t think this stuff would work, and I assumed that if it did it would just wash out in a week. I was pleasantly surprised. It was difficult to do, I have shakey hands (jeez I just sound like a wreck don&#x27;t I?) so I did get it pretty much everywhere but I put vasaline all around my eyes and used baby wipes and an oil less face cleaner for cleaning up. I will say this, if you get vasaline on any lash, it will not dye. I spent more time trying to get vasaline around my eyes and not on the lashes than anything so it took me about 2 hours to get done. And I hated those stupid cotton things that came with it! Trying to vasaline a flat price of cotton onto a curved area does not work well. I thought the applicator that came with it was better than a mascara brush, was more pinpoint and turning it sideways did good. First go left one side light and the other side a little 2 toned so I did it again and it&#x27;s much better. Bottom ones might be the hardest. In any case, it&#x27;s a week later, my eyelase still look awesome and I can rub my eyes as much as I want. I will definitely be using this from now on. I don&#x27;t look forward to reapplying it though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: OK so I love this stuff now. Still don&#x27;t like applying it but have found an easier way. Mascara brush didn&#x27;t work and the applicator isn&#x27;t great but I&#x27;ve found a good brush to use. A small synthetic fan brush seems to work best and if you get one this enough, will go through your lashes while applying for a more even coat. You get more control with the fan brush too so less mess.</li>
            <li> I purchased this about 1 month ago. I have just used it for the second time. I love this product. I have very blonde eyelashes that you could barely see. I would never go out of the house without mascara. This makes it very difficult in the summer when I want to swim. This product worked wonders. You can acctualy see my lashes. It was a little difficult to use but once I got the hang of it, it worked out fine. They enclose cotton swabs for applicators. I used them to put vaseline around my eyes before use, but I purchased a mascara brush for the application. This makes it much easier to get all the lashes without getting it on your skin. Give it a try, you&#x27;ll be amazed!</li>
            <li> I HATE IT!!! THE WORSE I HAVE EVER USED.... I DID IT TWICE WITH NO RESULTS.... I HAVE BLONDE LASHES AND I USED THE BLACK... IT DIDN&#x27;T DO ANYTHING TO MY LASHES SOOOOOO DISAPPOINTED....</li>
            <li> I have super blonde eyelashes so I should have been an ideal candidate for this product.  I followed the directions, did it their way, and it BURNED.  It&#x27;s like getting hair dye in your eye, hurts.  Then I tried it my way, worked much better, but still nothing.  This item sucks....</li>
            <li> This product was simple to use and dyed my lashes quickly and easily. The first eye I did, did not come out quite as fully dyed as the second, as there is a bit of a learning curve, but they both looked pretty good. The second eye, which I managed to get a bit more of the base of the lashes did leave a little dye on my lids, but it just looked like eyeliner. It lasted about 3 weeks, which is the same as salon for me. The pads it comes with do need to be shaped and I folded them, so they were a little thicker and then shaped them, and they worked very well with a little vaseline on the under-side.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of this item after reading the different reviews, but glad I went ahead and tried it.&lt;br /&gt;Fairly simple to use, just take your time and make sure all directions are clear before you start. It actually&lt;br /&gt;works and not as time consuming as it might seem.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it is significantly less money than one salon treatment and you get several treatments in this kit. I have very long blonde eyelashes and I have had them tinted in the past with great success. I bought this and while I am not let down I must say that it isn&#x27;t the best of the best.&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day it does tint but not as dark as it should and it only lasts about a week rather than the 28 days the name claims.</li>
            <li> The 28 Day Mascara works both on the eyelashes and eyebrows. U have to be as careful as hairdye. That&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> The item is not really what I expected at all.  I thought this was a long lasting \\&quot;mascara\\&quot;; not a lash dye/tint.  Did not last 28 days and application was messy and runny to apply.  No volume to lashes, just minimal tint.</li>
            <li> Okay, I purchased this through my Dads amazon for the prime shipping. I have silver/clear eyelashes (natural redhead). I do not go out of the house without mascara. During the summer I like to get them tinted so I don&#x27;t have to rely so much on mascara when I go to the beach. At $30 dollars every 5 weeks adds up, and I wanted to try to do it myself.  I have never got my lashes tinted at salon before, where I HAVE NOT experienced burning in my eyes so I knew I could possibly expect that.  I tried this on my sister with her laying down and did get some in her eye which stung pretty bad.  So I tried again on myself after reading some reviews. I went to Publix and got the dental flossers for braces which were about  $2.50 for 10. They are very mini mascara wands.  -I didn&#x27;t bother with the Vaseline because I have a pretty steady hand and with the tiny mascara wands, it makes it really simple!  -I used a q-tip to put on the first step, I applied liberally, three separate times, waiting for it to dry completely.  -I then applied a very thin coat of activator to the dental flosser.  -Applying like regular mascara I made sure to cover both sides and got the bottom lashes as well.  I did not experience any burning sensation since I used only a small amount of activator so no excess got into my eye.  I let it sit for a few minutes then used a q-tip to wipe of any excess still on my lashes, although I did not have much because I used a small amount of activator.  I had nice black eyelash when I was finished! It was not as black and very black mascara, but I was overal very pleased with the color and  look. I possibly could do a thicker coat of activator to achieve this color. But for a first shot at doing this, I was beyond pleased and I am sure I will only get better as I go.  Wear gloves! To my surprise I woke up the next morning with some of my fingers a little black from the dye. I have some latex gloves at the house, cause I use them to apply my self-tanner so I will be sure to remember that next time!  I took off a star because i think the instrusctions and materials givent o use it oculd have been better, but with the purchase of my own i love it. I will purchase again when out.</li>
            <li> For the first time I see such a good eye lashes color. Imidiately effect, you don&#x27;t have to wait even a minute to get the result!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get results from this process. I read the instructions, followed the instructions, and used an 8 time magnifying mirror so I am sure I did a perfect application.  I even did it again with clean eyelashes (washed with soap and water).  I didn&#x27;t have any problems with leakage as other reviewers mentioned but I didn&#x27;t get any noticeable results...at all.  I also think the recommendation to use vaseline under lashes hinders the product sticking and the under eye cotton pads you are supposed to adhere with vaseline don&#x27;t fit very good and make it hard to get close enough to your lash line without getting any lashes under the pad.  So, the second time I skipped them and was just real careful with my application.  Maybe if you have blonde or pale lashes you would see results but I guess mine are dark already.  It isn&#x27;t going to give you any volume anyway, that&#x27;s why they invented mascara! Waste of money.  Wish I could return it but I waited too long and my return window expired.</li>
            <li> It was ok-I ended up dying my fingers more than my eyelashes. It does sting if you get it in your eyes even just a bit.I like the idea of the product but would consider going to have it done in a salon rather than myself. Definately has a great color.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t buy again. Did VERY little to imporove the look of my light brown lashes and the product was skimpy... meaning that the containers arrive mostly empty. It&#x27;s crap. I&#x27;ve had my lashes done in a salon, once.. ~ that was nice, but it only lasts a couple of weeks. I will not return to this brand name again.</li>
            <li> Works well, but is painful to use.  I expected this though; it is painful when I have this done in the salon too.  I will recommend that you tint one eye at a time if you are doing this yourself, I made the mistake of doing both at once, and couldn&#x27;t see what I needed to grab while my eyes were burning.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try tinting my lashes at home to save money, but the color did not last very long at all. Nowhere near as long as when I have it done in a salon.</li>
            <li> This product totally works instantly! Before I bought it I watched a gal trying it on YouTube. She had instant results so I ordered it. I think the main thing is to get a dark enough color so that it shows up. If you have really dark lashes already you probably won&#x27;t get much of a result. Use gloves, the stains won&#x27;t come off your nails for 3 weeks or more. Get some disposable mascara wands, it&#x27;s much easier that way. I noticed a little sesitivity afterwards and used some soothing eye cream. Very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Just used this for the first time.  I have thin medium brown lashes with light tips and this black tint worked - my lashes are darker, and now I can see how thin they really are!  I found it pretty easy to use because I didn&#x27;t feel the need to go all the way to the roots.  As others have said, a mascara brush would probably be better than the swabs supplied if your lashes are very light.  No mess, no pain, no mixing, I did one eye at a time to make it easier.  The only question I have is why doesn&#x27;t the pipet fit all the way into the Activator bottle?  I don&#x27;t know how easy it will be to get the Activator out after several applications and the bottle is less full.  I will keep using this and also a growth accelerator to make them thicker.</li>
            <li> I have WHITE blonde eyelashes and eyebrows. I never leave home without mascara (yeah, okay, and a little lipgloss, too. I&#x27;m vain). I found so much FREEDOM in using this product!  I can now go to the water park, the pool, the beach, etc and actually have noticeable eyes without having to bother with waterproof mascara (that destroys your lashes anyway).    It was easy &amp; fast to use -- start to finish, including clean up, it took maybe 10 minutes. If it&#x27;s messy for you, you&#x27;re using too much of the gel at one time. The trick is to make sure you use the 1st chemical several times and allow it to soak through the hair&#x27;s cuticle. Once that&#x27;s done, it&#x27;s just a matter of barely touching your lashes with the colorant gel and presto! Dark lashes!      Ladies, it only COLORS your existing lashes, it doesn&#x27;t make them longer or thicker.  If you take your time and apply it carefully, you can get it to go from the base to the tips of your lashes.  I colored my lashes about 3 weeks ago, and it&#x27;s still going strong.  I&#x27;ll probably do a touch up in another week or so. I&#x27;m very happy with this product. I wish I&#x27;d found it 20 years ago.  I can&#x27;t imagine not having this in my beauty arsenal. Now that I&#x27;ve discovered it, I&#x27;ll never be without it again.</li>
            <li> I read several comments that it was hard to apply...and they were right!  I tried both a cotton swab and a mascara brush but wasn&#x27;t overly successful.  What I did get on my lashes (mostly on my lids) definitely didn&#x27;t stay on for 28 days.  I will try it again but my first attempt was shaky at best.</li>
            <li> The vendor sent the product to me in a timely manner and I was satisfied with my transaction.  I used the product for the first time last month and the others were right about how hard it is so apply to your own eyes.  I followed the directions and the results, and watched a few vidoes of helpful tips to apply it and the results the first time were so subtle that I had to reapply again to make it darker.  It was still not black.  Not sure why the color would not stick to my eyelashes very well even though I cleaned and dried my face, and followed the directions properly.  I was happy with the results for about 3 weeks.  I am a redhead with lighter eyelashes that are almost blonde at the roots; the roots were near impossible to get to darken.  I will try this again and hopefully it will just be better with a little practice.  If you have someone who has a steady hand and you can trust, it would be best if they apply it for you.    Also to consider - it only colors your lashes, it does nothing for volume, whichis ok for daily use.  So if there is a day you want to go out somewhere special for an event, you may want to use mascara still.</li>
            <li> This product did not live up to it advertisement.  Used it twice and followed instructions to the letter,did not color my lashes.  I ordered the black and my lashes are blonde, not even a hint of color was on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t ave any luck with this and didnt notice any change in my med brown eyelashes. Used exactly as described in instructions</li>
            <li> I had read all the horror stories from other reviewers so was a bit hesitant to buy this product. I am SO glad I did. The stuff is amazing. I have been using Latisse and my eyelashes have been growing like crazy and are getting really full (nice ;-) but it was hard to tell because they&#x27;re relatively light. I had no issues at all with this product. Never dripped, smudged, stained, burned or any of the other problems people have reported. All I ended up with is eyelashes so dark and now full I don&#x27;t even need to wear mascara. Exactly what I was going for.</li>
            <li> I saw absolutely no difference. I have dark hair and eyebrows, but very light eyelashes, so I thought I would give these a try, since I actively swim, jog, etc.  However, I apply these per directions and did not experience the staining like some of the other reviewers, but also no dying either.  I tried a second time a few weeks later using an unused mascara brush and avoided the vaseline step.  Again, I saw no difference at all.  Both my top and bottom lashes are as blonde as they were before.  I will go back to a professional.</li>
            <li> First time I tried it, I followed instructions and it was a total mess. The pads kept falling in spite of the vaseline and made it harder to put the product. The product went into my eyes and it hurt so much I had to go rince immediately.  I tried again but this time without vaseline, without pads, just unsing a clean mascara brush for both activator and colorant (just washed it well between the two applications). I applied the gel with the mascara brush with no difficulty. I have to say that it worked very well with eyebrows (just make sure to clean the excess color with Qtip immediately) but not so well with eyelashes. It actually make my eyes look like I have eyeliner butm lashes are barely more visible than before. But maybe they&#x27;ll become more \\&quot;porous\\&quot; after a few applications? As far as duration, I just did it today, so I don&#x27;t know yet...    We&#x27;ll see but I wouldn&#x27;t expect too much from this product.</li>
            <li> The product sounded good, but it was a bit messy and hard to apply. I did it. However, the next day it smudged. And the next day. It&#x27;s been 3 days and it&#x27;s still smudging on my lower eye. I applied lightly. By day 4 it&#x27;s not really visible. I have not used any makeup removed on it or soap. I think it&#x27;s best just to go to a professional salon and have them do the tinting or just use mascara.</li>
            <li> VERY HARD TO USE. IT STINGS MY EYES.   IT ONLY WORKED THE FIRST TIME.   NOW IT DOESN&#x27;T WORK.   I WILL NOT BE USING THIS AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I have medium-blond lashes and have been a slave to mascara all of my life.  I sometimes go without it but I like how my eyes are more defined with darker lashes, so I decided to give this a try.  As all the other reviewers have stated, it is a bit tricky to use, but I actually used the staining to my advantage and let it touch the edges of my lids where I would want eye liner anyway.  Now I have visible eyelashes and sort of semi-permanent eye liner, until that wears off.  My first try though resulted in a bit messy \\&quot;liner\\&quot;, so I&#x27;ll try a thin eye liner brush next time, as well as a mascara wand, which would probably help to reach every lash better than the provided q-tip.    I did one eye first to compare the before &amp; after affects.  After applying the product, my top lashes are a bit darker, but as I get older, they are getting thinner, so I am also going to try out a product to help thicken and lengthen them.  The bottom lashes didn&#x27;t seem to tint as dark, but it could be that they are just so fine that it&#x27;s harder to see.      It did sting a bit though when I wiped it off, since in doing so, it got in my eyes a bit, but I will continue to use this product to see if I can master the application process and hopefully more noticeable lashes over time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not blond, but I am only light brown.  I bought this in black and couldn&#x27;t tell any difference when I used it.  I used it again the next day, trying to make them darker, and still couldn&#x27;t tell I did anything.  Maybe if you are very blond, it might make a difference, but otherwise, I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money.</li>
            <li> A while ago I posted the below negative review out of sheer disappointment and quite honestly, panic, due to the stains I acquired along my lash line....however....I feel the need to take a moment to re-review as I eventually figured out a key component.  If you choose to give this product a shot you MUST make sure the petroleum-based product you coat the skin around your eye with before starting the tinting process is heavy on the petroleum side.  Yes...there are varying petroleum intensities and THAT is where I went horribly wrong.  You&#x27;ll need either straight-up vaseline or a thick balm (non-minty of course).  Co. Bigelow (at Bath &amp; Body Works) produces a lovely rose fragranced balm which I&#x27;ve discovered works splendidly.  To apply the balm I use an actual small angled paint brush (generally available at any craft store).  This is a tremendous help in applying the petroleum with true accuracy so as to avoid getting it on your lashes.  Allow yourself enough time to move slowly.  And ideally, especially if it&#x27;s your first attempt at it, don&#x27;t plan on going anywhere afterward.  It&#x27;s just safer and takes some of the pressure off because it IS a little awkward - expect a bit of a learning curve.  AnyWHO...good luck and remember, take your time.  ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me first start by saying that I have never before taken the time to post an unfavorable review.  But for this, I simply had to.  I absolutely do not recommend this product.  In the past I have always just bit the bullet and gone into a spa to have my lashes done professionally.  But after reading several of the reviews posted for this product, I thought, &#x27;Hey!  This may be a great solution, not to mention quite a savings!&#x27;  Boy was I wrong.  I followed what was recommended on the box, as well as followed tips posted by others, but was very disappointed to find that not only did my lashes take on the color only minimally, but I was left with awful stains lining both my upper and lower lash lines...not in a nice \\&quot;semi-eyeliner\\&quot; kind of way, but in an \\&quot;I&#x27;ve been crying for the last hour\\&quot; kind of way.  I sit here typing this review feeling like the RCA dog with a lovely ring around my left eye.  I&#x27;m not even going to attempt to do my right....forget it!  Fortunately, since I also tint my eye brows (with an entirely different product), I had a gentle stain remover in my cupboard which has helped in lightening the blow.  Hopefully it will be gone by tomorrow morning so I&#x27;m not forced to devise some miraculous cosmetic plan to cover up the damage for work.  DO NOT buy this product.  Just go and have the pros do it for you.  Sorry for the bad news girls, but if it seems too good to be true, chances are it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m opening a my first studio, (NubangZ Studio) and I&#x27;m trying different lash tints.I saw this in the schwarzkopf professional supply store. I order the brown, thinking I had ordered  black.  I applied it by the directions on a cliet that had brown lashes- there was NO visible change- NONE! Remind you: the color I used was brown(on brown lashes), may work for light lashes. I&#x27;m going to reorder in black and try again, I found the application quick and easy, if it works- it would save alot of time. Hope this helped:)</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ll start off by saying that I&#x27;m very skeptical about products doing what they say they will. And I usually read the reviews before buying a product but don&#x27;t always listen. Thank Goodness because if I had believed the reviews on this I wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it. The application was not hard at all regardless of other reviews. As long as you use vasoline along the lash line there will be no staining. And I used a mascara wand and a liquid eyeliner brush for along the lash line. Voila&#x27;! Black eyelashes! I am a redhead so I have lighter eyelashes and it&#x27;s such a transformation! Although now I realize my lashes aren&#x27;t as thick as I&#x27;d like but oh well, you can see them now! It&#x27;s such an inexpensive product and it says you get alot of applications with it, totally worth it. I just used it for the first time and will continue to purchase it.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this, and bought it even after reading some of the other bad reviews. Unfortunately, like many others, I was disappointed. I dont know how anyone got this product to work for them. I also have white blonde eyelashes, so this should work on me. I even tried it twice in the same day, thinking maybe the first time I did it wrong. There is a slight color difference in my bottom lashes mostly, my top ones have barely at all :( This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I am 50+ years old with slightly wrinkled, and loose skin around my eyes..  First, I recommend watching some videos of people applying the product or similar tinting products on Youtube.com.  I also recommend applying the petroleum jelly as indicated, especially under your eyes, very close to lash line and cover the entire top lid so if you blink, there is no stain.  Some reviewers were disappointed about the under-eye shields.  Trim them and apply petroleum jelly all over the undereye area! I cut mine in half and trimmed again once it was sticking to the under eye petroleum jelly.  Apply the activator liberly, but carefully. I used three coats to make sure the lashes were saturated. The tint actually needs to have a pin stuck in the opening of the tube which is not mentioned, but fortunately, I had one close. I found that the tint is activated when your lashes are damp, not dry.  I was able to go over the lashes a couple of times.  I&#x27;ve seen a video where the person used a small paint brush to apply the color, which I think would be a great applicator.  Brace your arm/hand, whatever and take your time.  You are not applying mascara, you are applying tint.  Just like when you color your hair using a gel colorant.  I can see why its so costly to have tinting done in a salon...in my area, approximately $60.00. Its not the product, but the skill in application.  I can see every little lash, even the itty bitty ones that hide in the outer and inner corners. I got a glop of gel tint on the eye shield and carefully pulled away one of the layers and the glop went with the eyeshield.  (Another reason to trim the eyeshields; they are in layers).  Do I have some staining under and above my eyes, yep, a tad, but nothing that I can&#x27;t deal with.  Actually, it sort of looks like thin eyeliner.  I&#x27;ll review later to see how long the tint lasts. I just saved about $40.00 by doing the eyelashes myself! (and I do my own gel nails, too)  1/26/2012:  I still have tinted lashes, but plan to do again this weekend.  I like the product and will continue to use it</li>
            <li> I tried the product according to directions. Really did not darken my lashes very much. Since I own it now, I&#x27;ll give it another try at some point. Not impressed, though. Another product I purchased at local beauty supply outlet did a much better job. Best are salon treatments, if available - in MA it is now illegal (another ridiculous MA law), so it&#x27;s a hassle to find a place that will still do it.</li>
            <li> Really thought this product worked well. Stays on for a while even w nightly eye makeup removal. It is very important to be careful as it stains the skin immediately. My lashes are very light &amp; I used black. The color was perfect.</li>
            <li> True, this product does make you lashes dark. It does not/will not make you eyelashes look like you are wearing mascaca. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is not as easy to use as I had hoped. It runs and burns the eyes...going to try to get someone to help me with it but have been too busy to do it yet.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this eyelash dye did not work very well. In fact, I could not tell a difference - at all. I did the procedure two or three times over a two day period and I still did not notice that my eyelashes were any darker.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money.  I tried this product exactly according to package directions.  It doesn&#x27;t last 5 minutes, let alone the 28 days that it says it does.  Wanting a good tint, I applied it three days in a row.  It does a good job of staining the skin on your fingers and around your eyelashes though.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Good product-- does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Order black, because even the black isn&#x27;t quite as dark and pronounced as I&#x27;d like. Do go slowly and be careful when applying this product. This is a toxic product which will damage your eyes-- plain and simple. Also, realize that you are brushing your lashes while trying not to blind yourself; as such, you will NOT be able to get every tiny, short lash on your eyelid. A professional lash tint will be better in this respect.</li>
            <li> This product is messy, difficult to use and does not work. I was very careful applying this to my eyes, but it is virtually impossible to apply without touching your skin. I tried it twice, and both times it made little or no difference to my eyelashes, and did not stay on for more than 2 days!</li>
            <li> I find this really easy to use.  I don&#x27;t even use the eye pads, just apply it to my lashes as directed and wipe off with wet cotton balls after the application is done.  Sometimes there&#x27;s a bit of dye on the skin under my lower lashes, but it usually fades away after a face wash or two and/or is always faint enough to cover up with light foundation if it doesn&#x27;t wash off completely.&lt;br /&gt;I use those GUM go-betweens to apply - one for the dye and another for the activator.  They&#x27;re like tiny mascara wands and I can get a much better, cleaner and precise application than using the tools provided.  Great for the tiny corner lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I retouch about every 2 weeks.  And usually do 2 applications at a time to make sure everything gets dyed.  2 applications also seems to give my lashes a bit of a darker color than just one application.&lt;br /&gt;This obviously doesn&#x27;t look as dramatic as mascara, but it does darken my blonde lashes and that&#x27;s exactly what I expected and you can&#x27;t beat the price of doing it at home over paying a spa/salon.</li>
            <li> Okay, as far as the coloring aspect, yes it lasts for 28 days. The application,though, was very tricky for me the first time. However the second time was much smoother keeping these things in mind:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T bother with the eye shields. They do nothing, they fall off, and they will ultimately get in your way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use the Q-tips to apply the developer to your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy some disposable mascara wands to apply the colorant after fully saturating your lashes with the developer. The mascara wand makes for precise application with minimal to no smudging(stained eyelids).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than those tips I figured out, follow the directions included with the product. Soon you&#x27;ll have beautiful lashes at a fraction of the cost at a salon.</li>
            <li> If you have ever had a professional eyelash tint then you realize what a tint does for you isn&#x27;t was mascara does.  If you have dark eyelashes, then this product is not for you.  If you have light eyelashes or light tips on your dark lashes etc then this is great.  If you are an active lady, or even a guy who wants darker lashes without wearing makeup, a tint is great.  I have light lashes and I don&#x27;t wear makeup everyday.  This product costs less than one trip to salon for eyelash tinting and has MANY uses in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I took the advice of previous reviewer and used a mascara wand to apply.  This makes it so simple.  I bought a mascara from dollar store and washed the wand off and trashed the actual mascara.  I pushed wand into activator and applied to lashes (a few times to get them nice and wet) and then applied color gel to wand and wipe through lashes till covered the way I like.  Rinse wand and you and use it each time you apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So if you are wanting your lashes to look longer, thicker, fuller this is not for you.  If you just want to have some color to your lashes for the times when you do not wear mascara, than is GREAT!  &#x3D;)  Oh and also if you don&#x27;t want to wear mascara but your lashes are tinted you can use a lash curler and it will give you that extra POP without mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this Helps!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last 28 days, but for my purposes, it worked pretty well. I bought it for 2 days of Sea World and Discovery Cove. I was in the rain and muggy heat one day and in the water most of 2nd day. Wear gloves when you use it, because I think it does last 28 days if you get it on your cuticles. I tried bleaching it off and even filing it off my cuticles, but to no avail. It&#x27;s not easy to use, you have to be careful. It&#x27;s probably impossible to make something like this that would be easy to use.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t think it was at all easy to apply but it does darken your lashes.</li>
            <li> It is true - this product will color your lashes a darker shade - a great concept if you have nice thick lashes that are light colored. I, however, have just come to realize that I rely on mascara for much more than just color, but also to add volume and length.  Make sure you take the time to prep all your supplies and only do 1 eye at a time because it can be messy and it will sting and make your eyes water.  If you&#x27;re like me and were at the end of the line when they were handing out \\&quot;thick and luscious\\&quot; eyelashes, you may be disappointed with the results of this product.  I can now tell that mascara is the real answer for me. . . . poop!</li>
            <li> Does not work. I was excited to get it before I left for vacation thinking this will be great to not add mascara every day. I saw no difference in my lashes after using. Don&#x27;t waste you money like I did.</li>
            <li> I have very low expectations for my eyelashes.  I don&#x27;t need them longer nor thicker.  I just want to see the ones I have.  I am very well aware that lash tint does not give length or fullness, so that is NOT what I am complaining about.  I am complaining about this product also not depositing color.  No, my lashes are not naturally dark...they are blond.  I left it on 10 minutes and did it twice.  Followed directions carefully, even followed the tips given in other reviews here.  Nothing.  And yet somehow it smeared color along my lash line...NOT in a \\&quot;smoky eye\\&quot; kind of eyeliner way, either...more a \\&quot;I can&#x27;t go out in public like this\\&quot; kind of way.  Go ahead and try if you must (I, too, was sure I would do it right and that all these other reviews are dumb people...laugh&#x27;s on me!).  I can&#x27;t explain the good reviews, but I do know if you buy this, you will come back to my review and say, \\&quot;Why didn&#x27;t I listen to her?\\&quot;  What the heck, it&#x27;s less than twenty bucks...prove it to yourself.</li>
            <li> not sure if this is that effective.  my lashes are darkish at the start and blonde on the ends.  the first time i used this product it didn&#x27;t seem to work, but the second time it did.  i wish it was darker ( in england you can get a blue/black color that is darker).  I can see that if you have totally blonde lashes than this will give an improvement, but if just blonde on the ends this doesn&#x27;t make them stand out much.  i didn&#x27;t have any stinging.  although i&#x27;m not totally impressed i am glad i tried it and will use it again, especially on vacation when i&#x27;m going to be swimming, not wearing much makeup etc.</li>
            <li> It dies everything BUT hair. I was totally bummed. I had black died fingers for about a week, but as soon as you do your rinse, it comes off of your hair. I tried it twice. I waited long enough for it to set, well it dies your skin all right but not your hair. I also got some in my eye on accident, and boy did it burn. I couldn&#x27;t see that great out of the eye I got it in to for about four days, so apparently it dies your eyeball too, just not hair.</li>
            <li> As with any other product, it will work for some and not others.  I figured I might as well try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did work for me very quickly.  I have reddish hair and light eye lashes.  I followed the directions and also took some advice from other reviewers.  I followed the directions and ended up carefully using a mascara brush to apply the gel tint.  My biggest problem is that it&#x27;s hard to get the base of the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and eyes and surprisingly I didn&#x27;t have much of a reaction the first time.  The following is my error:  I had some eyelashes fall out.  I felt like I didn&#x27;t get the base lashes coated well enough and applied a second time within the same day.  THAT time I had irritation and 3 days later as I was taking off make-up, I had more than the normal amount of eye lashes fall out.  I can&#x27;t say for sure the second application caused this but I&#x27;ve never had that kind of lash fall-out before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will stain your skin.  I didn&#x27;t use vaseline around my eyes.  I did apply it so that it would look like eyeliner (top lid) if it did stain and that&#x27;s exactly what I got.  That lasted for 2 days and went away.  So overall it was ok.  I don&#x27;t know if I will do it again or maybe next time will try a different product.</li>
            <li> I have very blonde eyelashes and have been getting them professionally tinted every 5 weeks for a little over a year. Well that gets costly so I bought this kit. At the salon she put vaseline under my eyes so I did the same. It was a mess.&lt;br /&gt;I did the other lower lid with nothing but the activator and color gel and turned out much better...just need to have a steady hand. I did not use the under eye pads they provide either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cotton swabs they provide are terrible. Works ok for applying the activator but not the color gel.&lt;br /&gt;I will try this again using a eyelash tinting brush I just purchased from Amazon to apply the gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend doing one eye at a time. Do the bottom lash first and wash off then do the top lash. Go on to the next eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the top lashes put the activator on both the back and front of lashes. Apply the gel on the back of lashes first (also where the tinting brush is needed to get closer to the lid)then on the front of the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it does work...just need different tools to do the job and patience.</li>
            <li> This product does work for darking the lashes but it is hard to replace the thickening effect of mascara. It felt safe, no sting. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this product. Its super easy to use, I use a tooth brush to apply instead of the applicator that was provided. Works much better. I have to leave it on for about 4 min, but its a good idea to start at 1 1/2 min, then check about every minute until you know how long it takes for you. Only complaint I have is it also stains the skin behind your eyebrows for a day or two. But I&#x27;ve just decided to always to mine on a Friday night so it has the weekend to wash off my skin.</li>
            <li> Got the product very quickly &amp; it worked well. I recommend tearing one of the eye protectors in half and using it that way. I am going to use a mascara brush next time though because it gets gloopy sometimes. Overall I recommend it!!</li>
            <li> But I think that&#x27;s more about my lash turnover than the product.  Hard to say.  It definitely worked for me and did last a good 2 weeks though swimming in a chlorinated pool.  Did not cause any sort of adverse reaction.</li>
            <li> EDIT 8/5/2011:  Yes, this is a true \\&quot;dye\\&quot;, and is permanent in that it does darken the lashes significantly and slowly wears off over four to six weeks.  It will withstand soap, lotion, ointments, mascara, etc., so it is definitely worth doing if you have eyelashes that are not very dark.  Read my original post below for must do&#x27;s and don&#x27;ts.    The reason I am editing my review is that I have stumbled across an easy way to quickly remove all dye stains from your hands, which are almost inevitable as no one can really work with those silly hair dye gloves on.  I dyed my lashes today, and made a much greater mess of my hands than usual.  Really dark stains on almost every finger, including the nails.  I thought that I would soak my hands, and the try to file off the top layers of my skin with a nail file (does work, but not sufficiently to rob a bank!).    Then, I had to mix up some hair bleach for my daughter, who hates her dark arm hair.  I had some of the bleach (Sally Hansen creme bleach for the body) left over and thought, why not see if that takes the dye stains out?  AND IT DID - COMPLETELY!!  I left the creme on them for about 5 minutes, and it had taken most of the stains off and reduced the really dark ones until they were faint.  So I reapplied the bleach on those areas again for a few more minutes and all the stains were totally gone, even around and underneath my fingernails.      It didn&#x27;t leave the skin dry or noticeably lightened where the bleach was applied, although it might if you left it on too long or have dark skin - just be careful to apply precisely to the stain in that case.  You&#x27;d have to do one hand at a time, but the bleach stays good for quite a long time after you mix it up, and you can reuse the same bleach on the other hand.  As most of the body hair bleach brands use the same materials, I&#x27;m sure that Jolene or any other similar hair bleach system (using a dry powder bleach you mix with a creme activator) will work.    ORIGINAL REVIEW:I have had my lashes tinted at the salon over many years.  I was blessed with thick, long, naturally curly lashes, of a medium brown color (I&#x27;m a redhead).  So much so that I could not wear any mascara that added length or thickened, as it made it look like I had a bad set of false eyelashes.  So, I tinted.  Now, at 50, my lashes are still long, but not nearly as thick, and have faded to a lighter brown, with the tips almost invisible.  I can wear mascara, but still feel that it looks like false eyelashes - I just want to see what I have naturally, so tinting is still my preference.    It is hard to find salons that still offer lash tinting, and the price is prohibitive ($40, and a tip is expected).  So, I tried the do-it-at-home kits, starting with Roux, the old standby, purchased at a local beauty supply store for about $32.  Roux&#x27;s kit is hard to use, as both the developer (1st solution applied) and the color (applied on top of developer) are thin liquids.  However, on the plus side, Roux includes a stain remover vial as well, which works fairly well (but never gets the dye off completely in all areas).    Recently, I accidentally spilled the color vial in my Roux kit, and would have had to purchase a whole new kit to replace it.  Rather than just re-order Roux, I perused other possibilities online and found this product on Amazon, 28 Day Mascara.  Reading the reviews, I saw that there was a large disagreement between reviewers, with some stating that there was no color added to their lashes at all.  I decided to go for it anyway, and am glad I did.    Yes, this product DOES WORK!!  I am sitting here looking at very black, completely colored lashes, top and bottom.  The thicker, gel consistency of the colorant made it easier to apply than the Roux solution, so less staining.  However, there was still that eye-burning sensation when I got too close to the root on the upper lids.  I want my lashes died from root to tip, so that is something I just have to put up with.  The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that this kit is still not perfect, there will be stains and stinging no matter how careful you are, and the process can still be improved.    I don&#x27;t know why other reviewers found this kit didn&#x27;t work for them, excluding those who thought tinting meant a mascara-like thickening and lengthening miracle. I can only conclude that they did something to prevent the product from performing as it did for me.  Here are some of the possible mistakes to avoid:    1.  Did not properly clean their lashes prior to tinting.  You cannot have ANYTHING on your lashes - no remover, no moisturizer, no soap residue, nada!  If you take off your mascara with a remover, and then expect to tint your eyelashes, it will not adhere as there is a physical barrier on your lashes.  I took off my mascara, then washed my face, paying particular attention to my lashes, using actual soap.  Not a facial cream, not a makeup remover, not even a moisturizing soap, just plain soap.  Yes it dried out my skin, but as soon as I was done with the tinting, I moisturized the heck out of my face.    2.  Used too much Vaseline, or got Vaseline on their lashes.  This would explain the reviewers complaining about how the tint didn&#x27;t take to their lower lashes.  Vaseline is insidious.  It gets on everything it touches.  I knew that I could not use Vaseline under my lower lashes without getting some on the lashes, thus defeating the whole intent of coloring them.  My lower lashes touch the skin below the eyelid, and any Vaseline would travel up higher as I tried to tint them.  Then the Vaseline would contaminate the swab, keeping the developer from properly coating the lower lashes.  Just skip the Vaseline/paper cover step entirely, go slowly and carefully, and accept that you will have some minor staining for a day or so.  Have a clean, dry swab at the ready to quickly remove any staining blobs as they occur - the faster you clean it off the less it will stain.    3.  Did not use proper lighting or magnification.  If you are in a brightly lit room (good bathroom light), and use a makeup mirror that magnifies, you will see that your lashes are actually longer than you think.  It is hard to see them just looking in a mirror - you need the good light (you&#x27;re tinting your lashes because they are pale, so without good light you won&#x27;t see them).  You cannot tint them and then expect to suddenly see them clearly without good light and magnification.  You may have tinted your lower lashes successfully, but not appreciate that fact as you are not using a sufficient light or magnification to see them.  The angle at which your lower lashes curl makes them hard to see regardless of their color, so I suspect that some reviewers reported less than expected results merely because they were not looking at their newly tinted lashes properly.  Doing the lower lashes on one eye first, you can then compare them to the other eye&#x27;s lower lashes, and you will see that, if you did it correctly, the tinted lashes are much darker than the untinted ones.    4.  Did not use glasses if they need them.  I wear reading glasses, and I was able to wear them WHILE I tinted my lashes, and also used a magnifying makeup mirror (one with a stand).  Sliding the glasses down a little on my nose, and angling the mirror so that I was looking down into it when I tilted my head, I had room to maneuver the swab soaked with the developer underneath my glasses, so between them and my eye.  Using the mirror as well gave me a complete, clear view of each lash on my lower lid.  I was able to reach the upper lashes from above my glasses.  Every now and then, I bumped my glasses with the swab, but they&#x27;re made of glass, so I knew nothing in the kit could damage the lenses.  I just ignored the small amount of liquid on my glasses until I was done with my lashes, and then wiped it off.    5.  Did not go slowly enough or carefully enough.  You need to devote sufficient timeto the whole tinting process, and to do only one set of lashes (upper right, lower right, upper left, lower left), at a time.  Count on at least 30 to 45 minutes, and do one of the four sets of eyelashes at a time from start to finish.  The instructions state you should apply the first solution 2 to 3 times over each lash.  Then you need to wait one minute (or a little longer is OK), for the developer to dry.  It has to dry!  And it has to saturate each lash completely, hence the reapplications before moving on to the coloring step.  Don&#x27;t be stingy - make sure that the swab is really wet and re-wet it for each of the 3 applications you will do prior to using the colorant gel.    6.  Did not use a small enough, or well enough designed applicator for the colorant gel.  The swabs included in the kit are fine for applying the developer solution, the first step.  But they are not so good for applying the second step, the colorant gel, because this solution is the one that stings, and the one that stains.  I had intended to use an old mascara wand, but realized that this wouldn&#x27;t work with my method (the under-the-glasses application) as it was just too big and thick.  So I used one of my son&#x27;s braces brushes - a disposable mini brush (half an inch, if that) on a two inch handle (just happened to see one in the bathroom drawer and had a Light Bulb Moment).  This brush is made of wire and short bristles, and you can bend the wire as well, to create an angle you wouldn&#x27;t get from a mascara wand.  Yes, that brush is now kept in the kit&#x27;s box, so he doesn&#x27;t use it by mistake, but the tinting solution cleaned off completely.  These tiny brushes are available in the toothpaste/floss section of any drug store in packs of multiples - much cheaper than the mascara wands, and much easier to use for the lower lashes than anything else.  They work great on the upper lashes too, but those are the easier lashes to tint anyway.    My lashes are extremely black now, and I have washed them a couple of times and have applied moisturizers several times. I used the left over Roux stain remover, and it worked fairly well for the stains I ended up with from the 28 Day Mascara tinting.  There is, however, a vague, bluish grey color under my lower lashes, which I know will fade away completely over the next day or two.  Until then, that&#x27;s why I have concealer.  You can purchase tint remover for your skin at any beauty supply store, for when you use hair dye, and it&#x27;s not very expensive.  If you use a swab and are careful, these will work to remove or at least reduce the tinting stains.  However, if you clean the stains off immediately with a clean, dry swab (no stain remover until you are done tinting) as they occur, there will be less staining to deal with at the end.    I don&#x27;t know how long this 28 Day Mascara tint job will last, and will update this review if I think the product didn&#x27;t hold up as long as the Roux.  Usually after the third week I think about re-tinting, so I&#x27;ll see if 28 Day Mascara lasts that long.</li>
            <li> I am a DIYer when it comes to beauty products I don&#x27;t want to pay money at a salon if I can do it myself.  28 day mascara lets me do this.  I have to say at first I was a little afraid of how safe this really was since both the product and petroleum jelly say not to get in eyes! I decided I would give it a shot and be extra careful with it.  Well, I just finished applying it and I have to say it looks great!  I do have a bit of that smoky eye going on but at least I don&#x27;t look like a raccoon!  We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two things that I think would make this product better.&lt;br /&gt;1.)  If they provided the petroleum jelly.&lt;br /&gt;2.)  If they gave you tips on how to prolong the effect.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tired other tints and ended up spilling them all over my bathroom, getting them in my eyes and all over myself.  This is the easiest tint to use and it works!! Like a magical layer of darkness stemming from the front of my lashes to the back.  Ill never go back to the other tint again.</li>
            <li> This product was difficult to apply &amp; it made my eyes burn. Afterwards it was barely noticeble &amp; what color there was washed out in two days!</li>
            <li> Good product. It darken lashes fairly well. I particularly like that my lower lashes show now as I&#x27;ve always despised using mascara on those.  Be very careful applying this, but it&#x27;s well worth the effort.  It only takes a few minutes total.  Like the idea one girl mentioned about applying this with a mascara brush. I&#x27;m going to try that next time. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> You need to test as the label says for a reaction and wait 24hours.  Take the advice of the detailed reviews on here and it REALLY helps improve results!  I was worried it would hurt and it was a bit stingy but not to bad.    So when you start make sure you wear gloves, be aware it stains EVERYTHING (I got some on my nails because I forgot the gloves).     Do one eye at a time was much better for me...more time consuming but good for accuracy.    Use the first chemical liberally(Get it all covered..they reccomend 1-2x letting it dry between but I did it 3-4 coats and letting it dry between)    Next use a mascara wond for colorant(they don&#x27;t provide one...I used an old one from my last mascara tube after washing it well)!    Wipe away any stain fast and it will not cause a problem!    Take it slow and it works GREAT!!</li>
            <li> I have very blonde eyelashes and don&#x27;t like to go out without at least a little mascara on.  I also camp, kayak, hike - outdoorys stuff that isn&#x27;t always convenient to apply/remove/clean up mascara, (or cool!!....my camper friends make fun of me; I don&#x27;t care). So for years I have gotten my eyelashes dyed before vacations.  It&#x27;s great; don&#x27;t have to think about it, off we go. Recently spas in my area (W. WA) have stopped dying lashes - new laws or regulations about too much potential danger to the eyes --- so I was excited to try this product.      Welllll......      Pros:    1. Comes as complete kit with everything you need to do the job.   2. It does dye your lashes; almost instantly.  Follow instructions and whatever the activator and gel touch will be dyed (eyelashes, eyelids, fingers, sink--everything).   3. The kit includes enough product for multiple applications - which you&#x27;ll need in order to practice a few times to learn how to use it.      Cons:   1. It is very difficult to use.  Have tried several rounds of dying, trying to get the knack of it and basically can get a bit on the top row of lashes, but the bottom lashes are hardly touched  and the corner lashes are almost completely untouched.  This leaves me with a nicely dyed section in the middle of my top lashes with the rest blonde.  Not a good look.   2. The included pads used to put under the eye to protect the skin need to be cut way down to fit under the eyes and don&#x27;t stick very well, even when glopped with Vaseline, as advised in the instructions, so some staining happens which takes a few days to wear off.  I&#x27;m not sure what wide-eyed alien species these pads were designed for but I had to cut and reshape them by half for use (perhaps I&#x27;m a tad  beady-eyed).    3. I tried using the included applicator sticks, and also an eyelash brush, and an eyeshadow brush - trying to find a better way to control the application of the dye and still could not get full coverage.     So --- it sort of works.  Nothing to the extent of a salon but it is certainly not as easy or effective as described on the package.       Best of luck.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not all that impressed.I have long, thick lashes, but the tips of them are light making them seem shorter and sparser than they really are. This didn&#x27;t really do much to amend that. Not to mention, it&#x27;s near impossible to rinse it off without either getting some on your face (stain!!!) or in your eye (holy oh my pain, batman!). I think I&#x27;ll stick with regular mascara and deal with looking like I have no eyelashes at the beach or the pool.</li>
            <li> This product DOES work, but it is also tricky to use.  I found that even though I was careful NOT to contaminate (mix) the ingredients from one tube to another, somehow, they got contaminated anyway.  Once that happens, the product is no longer effective.  I got two uses from it, had a lot left, but could no longer use it.  I used a brush with two sides, and dropped some of the ingredients into separate small dishes, to try to be sure the contents of the two tubes stayed apart until I mixed them as directed.    It is a bit awkward to apply.  I used a magnifying mirror.  Yes, my lashes were darkened.  But I wound up going to a salon (and paying more) to have it done professionally after the two containers became useless.  If you are very careful, or can get a friend to help, this is certainly cheaper than a salon.</li>
            <li> Changed my blonde lashes to black lashes in a matter of seconds. Very simple to use and the results are great. I used to never leave the house without mascara thanks to this product that&#x27;s a thing of the past!</li>
            <li> I purchased thie product in hopes to be able to do my own lashes at home rather than in a spa   I tried it three times and got zero results  My niece with lighter lashes than I also tried t twice with no results   threw product away</li>
            <li> This product worked very well for me, with a few modifications to tools and procedures.  A small makeup brush helped apply vaseline, a tiny \\&quot;dental spiral brush\\&quot; (for cleaning braces) was a perfect applicator, and a 10x magnifier mirror helped with careful application.      Although my eyes are extremely sensitive, none of the product got in my eyes or stained my skin.  My eyelashes are no longer invisible!  Reapplying every few weeks seems to work best.</li>
            <li> I saw other reviews of people how ignored the bad reviews thinking they could make it work, I am one of those people who also thought I could make it work. The first day I tried it I saw every little result on my lashes and a lot on my hand!!! So here are some tips if you are going to ignore the bad reviews and try it anyway.   (test on skin first like they suggest!!!)  1) Buy 2 mascara brushes to apply the solution instead of the q-tips provided  2) Don&#x27;t mess with the under the eye things they are terrible  3) Lay everything out and take the slow release lid off the activator  4) Use the q-tips to apply petroleum jelly on both top and bottom lid, get them as close to the hair line as possible without getting any on your lashes.  5) Lightly cover your hands in the petroleum jelly  6) Use the first mascara brush to apply the activator don&#x27;t saturate it too much it stings like a B*tch if you get it in your eyes and it makes them water so you lashes get wet. Cover both sides of the top lashes and then cover the bottom lashes wait (I have tried applying the colorant right after which worked best for getting my skin as dark as possible, and I have waited a minute and I have waited more than a minute not sure which works the best as they seem to all have darkened the a little. Applying the colorant right after makes it glob a little and it looks darker but it also seem to wash away)  7) Apply the colorant with the second bush, both side of the top lashes and then the bottom lashes.  8) I left it on for a few minutes after I know it says it colors instantly, but it made me feel better.  9) Wash lashes  10) Repeat in a few hours or the next day until they are darker.  ***This is what I found worked a little for me, and they aren&#x27;t as dark as I would like them to be. I understand it isn&#x27;t going to look like I am wearing mascara but I would have like to have made them black black. Instead they look darker (but not black).</li>
            <li> For the cost of one beauty salon eyelash tinting I can get dozens!  I used this before my recent vacation to Sayulita, Mexico. I have very blonde lashes and I loved being able to roll out of bed and not think about mascara or raccoon eyes after a swim.  It takes about 15 minutes. That includes prep, application and cleanup.  I found the application process simple and it didn&#x27;t sting as much as the salon version.  I like that I can do this from the comfort of my home, it rocks!    One tip: It will stain porcelain so be careful when using it around the sink.      [...]</li>
            <li> Love the results but the process is difficult to do by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;It stings your eyes if you are not really careful.</li>
            <li> The product does a good job but in the information it says it can be used on eyebrows also.  The brand name does not suggest this.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I did not like about this product was the way it is applied.  The color goes on then the activator.  It wastes alot of product this way.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend due to the wastefullness of the application.</li>
            <li> This eyelash tint performs as described - it tints your eyelashes black, quickly, fairly easily, and not too messy if you have a steady hand. It doesn&#x27;t sting, doesn&#x27;t stain your skin as long as you wipe up any spills asap. Overall, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;I had blonde eyelashes; now I have black eyelashes. Viola! However, this DOES NOT act like mascara - don&#x27;t confuse the two. It will not make your eyelashes longer or thicker, only darker.&lt;br /&gt;I recommended using a small, thin makeup brush for applying the first step - the cotton swabs are a little unwieldy for that part.</li>
            <li> i liked the product.  i don&#x27;t think it does the same job as my facialist.  but it does dye my lashes for about a week with minimal sting.  good luck!</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t stay on eyelashes- slips off and stains skin (even with using Vaseline product included). Very disappointed. I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> My eye lashes are long, fine, and sort of dark.  The bottom lashes are long, but hard to see.  The tips on top are lighter.  After putting this on one eye, I could see almost no difference between the two eyes.  I imagine this would only be helpful if you had very blonde eye lashes.  This in no way would take the place of mascara.  Don&#x27;t bother buying this if your eye lashes are anything but blonde.  I used black.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this product. I have very, very blonde, barely-can-see lashes.  This made a big difference. It takes a bit of time the first time, but really gets faster and easier with each application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the enclosed swabs, before my disposable mascara brushes arrived.  Both worked out, but as expected, the disposable brushes were quite a bit easier. Then I tried an \\&quot;Inter-tooth\\&quot; brush picks(available at most drug stores), that is much smaller and I have the best control over where the tint goes; I did attach a picture so you can compare the sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I do not follow their \\&quot;current\\&quot; directions of 1st brushing on the #1 step  liquid (activator), then #2 step of brushing on gel (colorant) directly on the lashes. I found a link to some UK instructions that I modified: in a glass dappen dish I mix equal parts of the liquid and the gel; then apply it. It just works better for me that way, and find I use less of the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use a lipstick-like applicator of colorless lip balm to go on the eyelids and under the lower lashes, (I use this too when tinting my brows). Way more control of where that balm/petroleum gel goes; little to none on the stuff I am trying  to tint! (I actually use the free baby \\&quot;chapstick\\&quot; I got from my dentist and keep it in the box.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Tools I Use: I also use a 1) high magnification mirror to do this work, 2) clear lipstick [[ASIN:B0037LKVD0 Chapstick Fresh Effects Lip Balm, Refreshing Mandarin]], 3) glass dappen dish [[ASIN:B000B8YY94 CLUB1 Glass Dappen Dish]], 4) inter-dental brush picks  for application [[ASIN:B002UHIO7W Interdental Brush - 10 pc,(Aim)]] and 5) a \\&quot;metal\\&quot; eyelash comb [[ASIN:B002HK2GI0 Tweezerman Folding Eyelash Comb]] to help remove the lashes sticking together and clumping. Got to have &#x60;em all lined up before I begin.</li>
            <li> I think the trick to using this product is to go slow and be patient. This will prevent burning your eyes (it&#x27;s not too bad) and skin staining. I find the pads to be useless. However, I do use petrolium because all hair color stains my skin terribly.     This product will not replace mascara. But it will make your \\&quot;natural\\&quot; appearance a little prettier. On my no-makeup days I like to see my tinted lashes, along with curling them and it just brightens my eyes a little. It makes me feel a little better about myself, that&#x27;s never a bad thing.</li>
            <li> I love being able to do this treatment at home.  I have blonde hair, so this product is very helpful and appreciated.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I purchased this so I could avoid using mascara. My lashes are very long, and I also use Latisse. However, my lash tips are blonde, and my lashes only look long and full when I use mascara. I also have several white/grey lashes because I have started going grey. I wanted these to be dyed, rather than plucking them out.  First, this product works as advertised, but is very messy. I used Vaseline on my upper lid and under my eyes to prevent any dye getting on my skin. I felt the shields that came with the product were useless and kept wrinkling, making application difficult.  As for the actual application, the odd-shaped \\&quot;q-tips\\&quot; that come with the product are clumsy and difficult to use. I bought disposable mascara wands for about 8 bucks and used those to apply the dye, and it worked instantly. No waiting for the dye to develop, which was a huge plus. Obviously, it&#x27;s not equal to the look of mascara, but it definitely helps.</li>
            <li> I purchased 28 day mascara a few months ago, but  after reading the reviews, I was scared to try it.  I finally did yesterday. Seriously---what is wrong w/you people?!  All this talk of eye stinging and dye everywhere. Anyone who has minimal hand-to-eye  coordination can apply this product successfully, w/o ANY mess or fuss.  In other words, if you can apply mascara, you can use this easily and will be happy you did. Granted, it does not do the job of mascara. It does not thicken or lengthen, nor does it purport to do so, but it does really color, and I am thrilled w/the results.</li>
            <li> this product was a total waste of money the only thing  am walking away with is my eyes on fire it is impossible to use and my upper and lower eyelids are the only thing with dye on them i do not recomend this product i am so dissapointed!!!!</li>
            <li> this product delivers... get the small spoolies used for people with braces in the toothpaste aisle.  use the spoolies to apply a small amount following the directions... makes my nonexistant lashes looke like a 20 year old model&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I had to do 3 applications before I saw any results and it doesn&#x27;t last long at all, also there is nowhere near 25 applications as promised.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I was using another product that was 3 x as expensive &amp; this works BETTER! A tip for use? Pointy Q-Tips! So you can get the dye off your skin quickly. Skip the protective papers &amp; DEFINITELY skip the vaseline! Another tip? MAGNIFYING MIRROR!!! If you could see those tiny hairs in a regular mirror you wouldn&#x27;t need this stuff, HELLO!</li>
            <li> 28 Day Mascara does not work and is hard to put on.  Does not stay more than 12 hours.  It flakes off when sleeping.</li>
            <li> I thought it was kinda a pain to use and it didn&#x27;t help me.  Maybe cause I already have black eyelashes?</li>
            <li> I have tried using this several times.  Messy and doesn&#x27;t really make any difference.  May work if you have very thick lashes but didn&#x27;t help mine.</li>
            <li> Took a bit to figure out right amount to use &amp; a LOT of patience is required. As I have blonde eyelashes, it took 2 applications &amp; I never could get the bottom lashes well. But it&#x27;s a noticeable difference! It&#x27;s been about 2 weeks &amp; it&#x27;s still lasting</li>
            <li> So I just dyed my eyelashes myself!  Had never done it before.  And I have to say I&#x27;m usually a mess with things like this.  I don&#x27;t have any staining on my skin.  I slowed down and took my time. I&#x27;m fair hair, fair skin, blue eyes....BLONDE lashes. I use Just For Men Beard &amp; Mustache dye for my eyebrows, so this was intriguing.  Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;d say.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see why people are using the disposable mascara wand.  It would be easier to apply than with the tiny applicator provided.  I used LOTS of Q-tips.  But it&#x27;s not a big rush.  If you get black in step one on your skin, finish applying it to your lashes and clean it up with a wet Q-tip.  Applying step 2 is not an exact science.  Just get it on the lashes and go over it a few times and it seems to spread out.  I found it easier to keep my eyes open.  The product did not run or get in my eyes when I did and it made less of a mess on my skin with my eyes open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the white undereye guard on the first eye.  Ditched it for the second.  It made a bigger mess with it than without. The petroleum jelly was good, but it&#x27;s difficult to not get it on the eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price this stuff is great....better than paying $25 for a single salon job.  We&#x27;ll see how long it lasts.  :)</li>
            <li> Did not do what I it said it would nor as I expected.  Did not last!  Didn&#x27;t even last 2 weeks let alone a month.  Messy.  Simply a waste of money in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Wasn&#x27;t sure how easy it would be to do this myself but it went well and I&#x27;m happy with the results. We definitely buy again!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very messy and it doesn&#x27;t work at all! don&#x27;t waste your money!! pls don&#x27;t purchase this piece of junk!!!</li>
            <li> Get, and wear some plastic gloves like you would wear for hair dye!!! My fingernails are permanently dyed and it took weeks for my fingers to shed the stains.  Be CERTAIN that the (very hard to use) shields are cut firmly  and attached to ALL your under and over eye skin. I have dark eyelashes and just wanted the tips darkened. The product may have accomplished that - but slightly at best. I was pretty preoccupied with dealing with the mess and may not have fully coated the lashes. I may try it again, taking the noted precautions, just to see if it works better. I definitely still need my mascara.  I was generally disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is a waste of your money.  It does nothing the first application.  After a couple of weeks I tried again.  I still cannot tell the difference.  In addition it stings your eyes if ANY of the product get in your eyes.  A totally ineffective product that can cause you much discomfort.  DO NOT BUY!  DO NOT BELIEVE THE CLAIMS OF THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Following some online advice from another site, the first time I used this I actually applied it twice.  I applied, clean it all off and applied again.  This was in December and since then have only applied once a month.  I have long, practically invisible eyelashes and they turned really dark.  I would definitely buy this product again!</li>
            <li> Got this stuff in my eye and had to go to ER, ended up with tiny blisters inside my lower eyelid. Had to have eye rinsed out with saline solution for 20 minutes. Doc gave me antibiotics, and a pain prescription. In bed for 3 days. Now have lashes dyed at salon.</li>
            <li> Process quick but lashes not much darker than before.  Be careful not to get it on fingernails.  Does not last 28 days for me.</li>
            <li> For eyelashes, this doesn&#x27;t do much.  I have brown hair, and the tips of my lashes are blonde, so this made my eyelashes microscopically more visible.  I still have to wear mascara to look good; but I dye my hair black, and I&#x27;ve used this on my eyebrows to make them look like they naturally match my hair color.  Since eyebrow hairs are so thick and close together, this product works perfectly to make eyebrows dark and still look natural, with no clumping as with mascara or unnatural lines as with brow pencil.  The best way I&#x27;ve found to do it is the same way I dye my hair, and at the same time.  I want my roots to be completely covered, so that the little baby hairs around my face look naturally dark.  This means that I don&#x27;t use petroleum jelly to protect my skin when I dye my hair; instead, I dye when I know I&#x27;ll be at home for a couple days.  The dark patches wear off after a couple showers, and the same is true of any dark patches caused by the 28 Day mascara.  I rub the two coats in well each time, ensuring a longer-lasting, full hair-length application - and my brows look great.  This lasts more like 14 days or less, not 28; but after the color wears off the skin it looks fantastic.  Don&#x27;t buy this product for eyelashes unless you&#x27;re a very light-skinned blonde; but if you dye your hair black or dark brown from a light color, you can use this product to make your brows pop.  However, the color does not last more than a few showers, especially if you scrub your face the way that I do.</li>
            <li> I was nervis to buy and to try this but its great! Really works. I suggest doing two times it will make it look ticker/darker. Do it in your own home and not spend money to have someone do it for you at spa. Youtube even has instructions how to do it, really helpful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in black and have used it several times now.  I have had my eyelashes professionally tinted numerous times always love the results.  But I can&#x27;t seem to achieve the same degree of color impact with this product.  Yes, my lashes are darker and it&#x27;s better than the natural blonde color they have.  But they are in no way gorgeously dark like they appear after having this done at a salon.  I was hoping this item would be my solution to wanting my lashes tinted for special events but I think I&#x27;ll continue to visit the salon for those situations.  This product isn&#x27;t that difficult to use once you get a system down.  I did buy a very soft small bristled makeup brush for applying the tint (step #2  the brush I bought was for eyeliner or something).  I can&#x27;t get the paper skin protector things to work worth a dime.  Instead I use a business card that I hold up under my lower lashes when I do those sections.  It&#x27;s easier to control the business card and you can adjust it as you go.</li>
            <li> I have used this Kit for 6 months now.  I apply it to both eyes, upper and lower lashes and let it set for 20-30 minutes.  Of course, I&#x27;m careful with the application and it does take practice, but I&#x27;ve never had a problem and my lashes look awesome for about 3 weeks.  I&#x27;m a Latisse user - growing longer lashes but they are grey so they don&#x27;t grow darker.  Godefroy takes care of that.</li>
            <li> I ordered and used a similar product about 2 years ago. It was messy and difficult to apply, but the new version is much easier! I was able to use a clean mascara brush instead of the older &amp;#34;Q-tip&amp;#34; applicators. I did not get any stains on my eyelids or skin beneath my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am allergic to all mascara (tried them all from cheap to exhorbitant) and the result is itchy eyes each time. I endorse the 28 day mascara completely.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for eyebrows but my lashes did not change...I followed all the rules, read all the blogs and I did everything the same.  I dont get it. I will have to go to the salon for my lashes :-(  but the brows are two weeks darker now... and the black color was not too dark for this blonde.</li>
            <li> Product was messy and hard to use. Looked up video on line to make instructions clearer, but it was still hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Came right on time.  Appreciate the great service.  Worked well n product description was well described n came in the mail with no problems.</li>
            <li> It was very efficient in making my lashes darker. It doesn&#x27;t elongate or thicken like a mascara would, but it is not advertised that it does, so it is great! I re-dye mine about every 3 weeks and they last until the nest dye. But, when I do dye them, I do the process of colorant and activator 3 times just to make sure I get every lash and to ensure that they are very dark. I would definitely recommend this product for people with blond lashes.</li>
            <li> The product was difficult to use without getting dye around eye...even with the hints given on reviews.  And it took a few days to get the dye off of places where I didn&#x27;t want it.  My lashes are dark blond to brown...but I thought they were longer than the dye showed them to be.  AND it appeared the dye lasted a week or so, then I no longer could really see it.  I was disappointed in the product a bit...but more in how it made ME look than the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Esthetician and have used the professional dye for years, it lasts longer but ugh what a mess! This works fast (instantly!) is easy to use and color lasts for 30 days or more. Recommend</li>
            <li> This product sucks.  It honestly didn&#x27;t make a difference at all, and I have light lashes. Don&#x27;t waste your money like I did!</li>
            <li> Okay, so, yes, this stuff did tint my eyelashes. I followed the instructions to the letter. I saturated my lashes with the activator and applied the gel. First thing, there was NOWHERE NEAR 25 APPLICATIONS IN THE TUBE. The little bottle probably had 25. I had to squeeze the tube like I was trying to get the last bit of toothpaste out. It took so much of it to cover my lashes! I&#x27;m a blonde, but I bought the black because I have really long, thick lashes, you just can&#x27;t see them. I wanted them dark. I didn&#x27;t get what I wanted. They&#x27;re not dark. They tinted unevenly. It has only been a week and they have already started to fade. Unevenly. I will not be using this product again. I threw it away. Oh, well. Live and learn.</li>
            <li> I have very fair eyelashes so this product definitely helps.    It only lasts about two weeks with me - not sure if I&#x27;m doing something wrong.  Just be careful when using and wear gloves as it can easily stain your skin.  I will definitely continue to buy this product.</li>
            <li> It works, just is messy. I don&#x27;t think that it lasts as long as it says it does. It is a personal choice.</li>
            <li> Product is very hard to apply without making a mess. Even following directions carefully, one blink during the application process, and it&#x27;s in your eye, and it burns fiercely! Also anywhere it touches on your skin around your eye is permanent for at least three days, so better have \\&quot;extreme\\&quot; coverage makeup. The directions say to keep the different product mixes away from each other, so they do not mix, and make the dye. I kept them away from each other like two rabid dogs, and somehow there still ended up being gunk in the liquid. The directions say to use vaseline to hold the eye guards in place, but any lash you touch the vaseline on, none of the dye takes. It does dye your lashes, but its very hard to use without mistakes.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was a little uncertain but ordered this anyway...  This product really works!!  I did not give it 5 stars because of the applicator issue...Poor design...With common sense, it is easy to make the necessary adjustments.  This is how I used this:  I used one of the swabs to put a layer of aquaphor (I couldn&#x27;t find my vaseline--same difference) all around my eye....I started with the little eye pads but they didn&#x27;t last the process...I applied the first product and let it dry...I then used a MASCARA BRUSH to apply the gel---I got pretty good coverage...  Yes, it was somewhat messy because I did tear up a few times...However, it cleaned up beautifully and only my lashes are black.  I have pretty great coverage.  Definitely buy this product!!</li>
            <li> I have literally never had such a terrible experience with a product before. I&#x27;m glad I bought a single application before investing in a large pack of 25 applications. I have no pros, so I&#x27;ll go straight to the cons list:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. IT DOES NOT WORK - my eyelashes are blonde, and I thought this would darken them so that I wouldn&#x27;t need to put on mascara when I&#x27;m running late for work. No such luck. The before and after difference is minimal, and I still need mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The pain! Holy cow I screamed so loud. This dye WILL get into your eye when you are washing it off. I tried to wash it off as quickly as possible, but it was too painful... what an awful experience. Imagine getting an eyelash stuck in between your eye and contact lense. Now triple that. Now imagine what I went through. And no, I do not have extra sensitive eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Takes a long time. I thought it would be a 5-10 minute ordeal, but it took a lot longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It&#x27;s messy. My bathroom sink was covered in dye, and I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s stained. Hopefully not- I didn&#x27;t try cleaning it with any real cleaners yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. It stained my fingers. I now have these black unattractive marks that make me look like I&#x27;m diseased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could talk for hours about how awful this product is, and what an absolute waste of money it was. I&#x27;m thinking of holding a conference or writing a book, or doing something big to get the word out there. Anybody have any ideas?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh- forgot to mention. I regularly use Godefroy eyebrow tint, and I absolutely LOVE it. It&#x27;s what caused me such disappointment in Godefroy with their 28 day mascara. If anybody from Godefroy is reading this right now, I&#x27;m not mad- I&#x27;m just disappointed in you. You have so much more potential than this.</li>
            <li> For the price, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  It was difficult to use and messy to apply.  The manufacturer needs to develop an easier and  better application technique for this product.</li>
            <li> I love this tint! The new improvements are great. They now include more functional tools to apply it with and improved the formula as well so it goes on better. It does tint and it does hold the color all month. I already have pretty dark lashes but it brings them all out and makes me feel more confident and comfortable to just go out without make up or some vitamin fortified clear mascara. I personally like the thickness of mascara cuz I really don&#x27;t wear much make up. Usually just mascara and sometimes eyeliner. This product allows you to have dark lashes natural lashes all months with only one application. I love semi-permanent time saving fixes. I plan on purchasing this item for years to come.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very light colored.  I found this product online and read the other reviews.  Decided to give it a try.  Just like the&lt;br /&gt;other users, this product was messy and did not color your lashes as stated on the instructions.  I even repeated the application the next day, the results weren&#x27;t any better.  I do not recommend purchasing this product.&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
            <li> First and foremost the most careful of people cannot avoid staining with this stuff. My eyelashes and even eyebrows are clear with a slight bit of white blond at the roots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it nearly burned my eyes out! My eyes are not sensitive at all, and I have never felt such pain. Be aware when you feel that pain your eyes will close, and if you don&#x27;t use the eye shields your face will be colored for almost a week. I bought color remover for skin and it worked pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;28 day mascara does not dye your eyelashes well, basically just the center on the top gets and stays colored. More than anything this stuff made my eyelids bright red and burn like crazy. The stuff they give you is also very difficult to use, so I tried a clean mascara applicator and it worked slightly better, but you have to use more of the product which means it doesn&#x27;t last for 25 applications. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty well! It makes life a little more convenient, since I now can dye my lashes at home :). It&#x27;s a little tedious, but worth it.</li>
            <li> WIPES OFF IMMEDIATELY.... IF YOU LAUGH IT RUNS... LOL AT PERMENANT. I FEEL TAKEN. THIS SHOULD BE TAKEN OFFTHE SELLERS LIST</li>
            <li> I bought this several months ago, and although it does do a good job tinting the blond ends of my eyelashes, I think it also makes more of them fall out.  I have used this kit about 3 times, and after each time I have used it, many more eyelashes fall out than the norm, and this continues for weeks.  The darkening of my lashes is not worth losing my lashes, so this product is going in the garbage :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fall out never happened when I got my eyelashes professionally tinted, so it must be this specific formula.</li>
            <li> I worked in a spa/salon for many years and had my eyelashes tinted by the esthetician on a regular basis. This product is the same one they used and now I can do it myself.  Yes it can be messy if you do not take your time and go slow and steady.  Be very careful and you can have fantastic results.</li>
            <li> This product works! It lasted about 30 days as the package stated. It was perfect for my trip. I wil certainly be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> You need to repeat the process Of tinting many times before real results. Also it clumps the lashes instead of tinting each lash individually. Would not recommend</li>
            <li> i dont understand it. i read tons of reviews and tried this 6x with different tricks.... none of it worked. i thought i was going to end up blind. my eyes burned so bad that they literally turned blood red. i had more product in my eyes than on my eye lashes. they would not stain. the black goop just kept wiping away... i even tried the stain on my arm and hand to see if it would stain my white hair.... it just wiped away. i tried it for 10mins even though it stated that it would stain immediately... and nothing.</li>
            <li> First of all, the DVD did not play, neither in my computer nor in my DVD player. That was the first clue. I read the directions twice then tried to use it on my lashes.  Secondly, the so called applicator (plastic toothpick?) was a joke. Did use the &amp;#34;applicator&amp;#34; the first attempt, but the product washed right off. Second time I prepped my lashes just as instructed, and used an old mascara wand to apply. Applied better, but again, after the allotted time, product washed right off.  I tried this three different times on both eyes (total of six times) and it washed off every time. Now I have to send this product back to get a refund. It was definitely a waste of time. Maybe the product I received was out of date? If the company wants to send me a replacement package I will try again and modify this review.</li>
            <li> I can speak from personal experience that your results are 100% user-facilitated, meaning that if you don&#x27;t get good results, it&#x27;s because you didn&#x27;t do it right. How do I know? Because there are times I use this, and my lashes look amazing after; and then there are times I use it, and it&#x27;s like I didn&#x27;t even apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I am giving this 3 stars (instead of 5), though, is because I haven&#x27;t quite figured out from one experience to the next what the heck I am doing wrong/right/differently to result in such a wide spectrum of, er, results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you&#x27;re someone who is really good at figuring these things out (or have a colorist&#x27;s background and know your stuff), then this is worth trying.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to give it even one star, as a star implies there is some redeeming quality that can be found.&lt;br /&gt;Not the case with this product.</li>
            <li> This has actually changed my entire makeup routine. I am 26 and a natural light yellow blonde. My eyelashes are nice and long, but you could never see them! Even with mascara the roots were still blonde. I always felt so self conscious about how &#x27;bare&#x27; my eyes looked without eyeliner and mascara. So I&#x27;d use them every single time I left the house. Now I just use Vaseline! I don&#x27;t even bother with ANY eye makeup! No mascara, no eyeliner, no eyeshadow. I just use concealer, an spf, a lip tint, and blush! I am sooooo happy that I decided to dye them. On me black doesn&#x27;t look all that natural. It looks like I have really smooth mascara on. That is perfectly fine with me. I&#x27;m sure most people wouldn&#x27;t think anything of it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The process is really simple it just takes some time to get used to it. I don&#x27;t even use the little under eye papers anymore. And it probably takes me well under 10 minutes to do both eyes, one at a time, top and bottom. I&#x27;ve had no problems with it staining my skin for long, but it will stain your nails for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint that I could have so far is that when/if it gets in your eyes it BURNS terribly. I just rinse my eye with water thoroughly and it&#x27;s fine. I would recommend this for anyone who has light to brown eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Whoever was the &amp;#34;architect&amp;#34; of this solution in terms of applicator failed miserably. Super messy, everything is bound to get in your eye, it only looks nice n easy in their commercial. But just like so many commercials it is very far from reality. The dye is stingy ( if gets in your eye) but weak - doesn&#x27;t last as long as they claim and never gets really black on your eye lashes even after 2 or 3 repetitions. I still had to use mascara after this. This product needs  serious work.</li>
            <li> Lashes did not get dark enough.  Although easy to use, I would not recommend to my friends or buy it again</li>
            <li> This product is great.  Although it doesn&#x27;t last as long as it claims (at least not on me), it beats putting on mascara every day.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes are very long and light brown/blonde. I used the product (in black) twice on the first eye and the difference was virtually nonexistent. I was hoping for something darker that would allow me to skip using mascara. It was also difficult to use with one stick supplied in the kit that you have to keep cleaning off so the activator doesn&#x27;t get contaminated by the stick. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This does a good job of coloring eyelashes, but it doesn&#x27;t give the extra fullness or length you get from regular mascara.  As a result its visual effect is only a fraction of regular mascara.</li>
            <li> It works as promised. The pads for under the eyes are huge and I quit trying to hassel with them and put Vaseline under my eyes. I only have a few grey eyelashes but don&#x27;t like mascara, it always flakes and I have tried every brand from too expensive to inexpensive and it all works the same, so this is a great solution.  Especially if you curl the eyelash and then apply clear mascara.</li>
            <li> the color barely showed up on my eyelashes. I could see only a small improvement. Its nothing like wearing mascara. My eyelashes are blonde and this made them slightly darker, but i felt like it was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year. The quality is consistent and the product does what it claims. The only improvement I wish for is that it came pre-mixed in a mascara type bottle so the process was more efficient.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product. Not only were my lashes only slightly darker, but I accidentally got it on my nails. It took months to grow the brown stain out.</li>
            <li> To put it simply, this product does exactly what it says it will. It DYES your eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;This will not make your lashes fuller or longer.&lt;br /&gt;It will make what you already have look darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am unsure how long it will last, but I have had them dyed for 2 weeks now and they are still very dark. I did mine twice. This is okay per the directions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use a lot of vaseline… i got no staining because i loaded up on vaseline around my eyes and wiped off all excess dye on my skin immediately after it touched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Works as advertised.  Needs 2-3 coats to get black lashes.  I like it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have blonde lashes and tried to dye them.  The dye did not take, and I tried it again and it did not do much better.  It is hard to apply but I am willing to try it again maybe with a friend to help me apply it to see if that works better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, nothing spectacular it makes your eyelashes a little darker but if you are looking for the wow factor then this isn&#x27;t it.  It doesn&#x27;t come even close to making you look like you have mascara on.</li>
            <li> I used this product twice and it didn&#x27;t work for me at all. I followed all the directions on a packaging correctly, and saw no results. Applicator is easy to use, and directions are easy to follow. I have blond eye lashes and after washing off the mixture, my eye lashes were still blond. I am disappointed, and wish I could get my $17 back.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and when I did not see any difference I repeated the whole process all over. I should say I did not see any difference again, just a little gteyish color. Sent it back yesterday.</li>
            <li> I have discovered that using my self-tanner remover gets the dye out of my skin, but not my nails, I have acrylics. The one I have is Model Co and it is called Tan Remover exfoliating scrub. This is the only one I have tried but if you think about it the removers are to get stain out of your skin so I imagine any would work.</li>
            <li> The product is ABSOLUTELY excellent!!! Ive been using it for years~! Its easy to apply and stays on for weeks without reapplication!</li>
            <li> I think it would be better called a stain rather than dye.  It did work but I had to do it repeatedly for it to darken by eyelashes.  Once darkened, about three days was tops to have gotten out of the product.  It was easy to use.  I did it myself which was a little scary but did so with out difficulty.  I worked in a salon for years and have had my lashes dyed many times.  This was easier than that process but just not as effective.  I have to give it a half way mark as it did eventually make a little difference but not something I would want to do every week to have darker lashes.</li>
            <li> Great eyelash/eyebrow tint!  I have blonde eyelashes so I was excited to find this on pinterest and purchase here!  I don&#x27;t have to pay someone else to do something I can do myself!  Ladies, if you can put on mascara without poking your eye, you can use this.</li>
            <li> This product does not live up to it&#x27;s hype.  It didn&#x27;t last more than 4 days let alone 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, it doesn&#x27;t last a whole month but other than that it&#x27;s pretty good....Will order again.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this stuff! I hate how mascara smudges and this stuff saves me gobs of money and effort over a year. Seriously, do not get it in your eye. It will sting and your eye will be read for a couple of days. (A spider surprised me in the bathroom and my hand twitched and I got it in my eye.) Be careful and you will love the results.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the permanent eyelash tint kit by Godefroy.  Your lashes really do get black and they stay that way.  When I am finished with this kit, I am going to order it again.  Why cheaper than getting it done at a salon and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have blonde lashes.  Had them dyed by a pro a few months ago.  It cost $25, lasted about 2 weeks before fading to almost nothing. I followed the instructions to the letter during the first two applications last night. The amount of dye was barely noticeable.  I did it two more times, leaving it on much longer than a minute each of those times.  My lashes barely have any color after four repeated treatments.  I used plenty of product, that was not the problem. The dye definitely stained my skin however.  Regular hair dye never leaves stains on my skin, but this stuff DOES.  Take the suggestions to use vasaline and the paper shields seriously unless you plan to stay locked in the house for a few days afterwards (I assume the skin stains will be gone in a few days).  Btw, the pro got dye in my eyes.  I think no matter who does it, some is bound to get in your eyes.  I found I was much better at keeping it out of my eyes and treating the problem once it did get in my eyes than the pro.</li>
            <li> Works well when you dont want to wear mascara everyday. This product works great if you have blonde eyelashes like I do. I dont like to wear mascara everyday because it is drying so doing this once a month makes my eyelashes stand out. WAAAAAYYY cheaper than going to the salon and getting someone else to do it.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I am not just blonde, i am white blond and i have blonde eyelashes and eyebrows. So, just to have some kind of definition to my face in stead of looking like a polar bear in a snowstorm, i have to wear make up. Just got this and dyed my eyelashes. It was easy! And now my lashes are a visible dark brown/black all of the time. No more mascara needed even in the pool. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I found this product to be very easy to apply with minimal mess.  The key is to be sure to apply a lot of petroleum jelly or similar product to the surrounding eye area.  Very quick application and processing, and easy to use.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that I felt the color (black) wasn&#x27;t as dark as I would&#x27;ve liked; but then again my blonde eyelashes are practically invisible.  Overall I am very pleased with this product and glad I made the low cost investment which will save me quite a bit of time and money now that I don&#x27;t have to go to the salon to have my eyelashes tinted.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, I still wear mascara for sure, but this helps my very light lashes be seen when I&#x27;m on a quick no make up errand.</li>
            <li> I have Blonde eyelashes and you cant see them if I am not wearing mascara. I don&#x27;t wear makeup every day and I do not want to put mascara on everyday. This stuff is amazing. It takes some time to get a good technique down using this but it is not hard at all. Makes my lashes black and stays that way for at least a month. The only thing id say i didn&#x27;t like is the applicator. I bought the tiny brushes used for braces and they work great, you can get all of the upper and lower lashes coated!</li>
            <li> Way too messy and not much in the way of darkening eyelashes.  I won&#x27;t buy it again!</li>
            <li> Well, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, horrible!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> A lot of people  said it stained their skin, but I did not have that problem. Great results. Nice color.</li>
            <li> First off, this came super quick.  However, it doesn&#x27;t really work.  There is a slight tint to my extremely reddish blonde lashes.  It will certainly not last for 28 days.  You can&#x27;t tell that my lashes are tinted at all really.  I even left it on a bit longer than what was recommended.  I will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Two major drawbacks:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) The tint is so watery that it stained only the middle of my lashes, missing the roots and tips, even though I sponged my lashes repeatedly in attempt to cover them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.) The cotton eye guards have sharp upper edges that kept moving around and jutting into my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved the idea of a tint that would darken my eyelashes for a month, but I find regular mascara to be much more effective.</li>
            <li> Used to use a liquid type brow tint, and it was so hard to control. This is much easier. Applied last week, so i can&#x27;t comment on durability. But, it is so easy to apply, I wouldn&#x27;t even mind applying every other week.</li>
            <li> It takes a couple tries to apply it without getting a little messy but it really works and lasts about a month. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I was hoping I could avoid putting on mascara for a month. I had my daughter apply it, and she followed the directions very carefully (she&#x27;s an M.D.) She put it on the lashes of my right eye, so we could compare. Unfortunately, we saw no difference at all. The instructions say to wash the eyelashes after application of the gel colorant. Maybe it should be left on longer, but that is not what the instructions say. Perhaps it works for women with very blond lashes, but it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> The product is a little tricky to apply (be careful not to get it on countertop, clothing, etc.). But the result is nice, and I can do without mascara for a few weeks, at least. I usually wear brown mascara, but the brown in this product was too light. Black is best.</li>
            <li> The trick is to do one eye at a time if you are using this product on yourself.  Applying the activator with the cotton swab works fine.  But I used a small eyeliner/brow/eyeshadow brush (which I cleaned with soap and water each time before use) to apply the color, which instantly appears (no waiting).  There are plenty of UTube videos on how to tint your eyelashes/eyebrows and I recommend viewing some of them before attemping yourself.  This is a tint, not a masacara, so it does not add volume.  It is intended for those of us with light colored lashes/brows.  If your lashes/brows are already dark you will probably not notice a difference (same thing as if you had it done at a salon---no difference for already dark lashes).  I like doing this myself as it saves money compared to having it done at the salon.</li>
            <li> Great, easy to use product. My lashes are very blond. I dye them every 2 months. Follow the  directions, it is a very easy and quick process. It will  not make your lashes look thicker like mascara. I do think it makes them look longer though because now they actually show up!</li>
            <li> as a natural blonde, i always felt like i could not leave the house without my eyebrows filled in and some mascara on...even though i am pretty low-maintence. I hated having to always feel &amp;#34;done up&amp;#34; just to feel comfortable! when i found out about lash tinting, i found a salon near my house that did it for $25. i did it a few times and loved it! however, i was unwilling to pay that much regularly, and low and behold after some searching i found this product and realized it was the exact same one they used on me at the salon! I bought it, and used it as soon as I got it and got the same results as i did when i paid for it to get done! and honestly, with some practice, i feel like i can do a better job because i can keep my eyes open and really coat each individual lash.&lt;br /&gt;  here&#x27;s a tip: it&#x27;s helpful to put a business card on your upper eyelid and paint the solution onto your lashes with the card behind it. you can pull your lid up and really get all the little hairs at the base and the ends. this is also a great tip for applying mascara! like other reviewers said: this is not a replacement for mascara. it will simply tint your lashes black so that they are visible. won&#x27;t fill them out or lengthen them! it&#x27;s wonderful especially if you are outdoorsy, spend a lot of time in the sun, or are &amp;#34;low maintenance&amp;#34; and want to feel pretty without being all done up. very natural looking!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I used it 2 weeks ago and haven&#x27;t yet seen any color wash out. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I watched several videos on how to do this but consistency of this product was terrible for lashes.  Interesting it was great for brows</li>
            <li> it works good but stains the skin and it difficult ti use without a mess… practice might help there is plenty in the kit to use several times.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;dye&amp;#34; washes right off. It&#x27;s like colored water. Do not buy! I sure wish I hadn&#x27;t wasted my funds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.  I don&#x27;t think it dyed my lashes like I wanted it to.</li>
            <li> I had blonde lashes before I used the product and I had blonde lashes afterward. The shields that you are to place underneath your eyes do not stick and will not stay on so I had to apply the product without them. It was a bit messy to appy but no too bad. I just wish it had worked...I will try again tonight...</li>
            <li> First time user. This was easy to apply (I followed cleaning and application advice from a previous user) and I got excellent results. My lashes were blond and invisible, but now look great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tint for three years, after I tried several others. This works fast, lasts  for couple of weeks, and looks absolutely natural.</li>
            <li> I used Roux Lash And Brow Tint for years and really didn&#x27;t like how toxic it is and how badly my eyes hurt after use, aside from the fact it doesn&#x27;t work that well. I have light blond hair and bought Godefroy in black and LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest using a magnifying mirror, sit down and get everything together on a paper plate. Do NOT get any of the colorant on your fingers or elsewhere because unlike Roux you cannot remove it with stain remover like Roux includes in their kit (which is basically diluted bleach).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seriously sensitive eyes and it doesn&#x27;t bother them at all. Also I don&#x27;t wear mascara anymore and really like the more natural look. Thanks Godefroy! Oh and the price is great too.</li>
            <li> it works as it says buy not on the area that I need. burned a little but overall it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> OMG---This product is the best.  I just got it today and I am so satisfied.  If when applying this tint-take your time.  It is only messy if you rush through it.  It won&#x27;t burn if you don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.  The results will really make you happy as it did me.  I am a first time user and I didn&#x27;t get it all over my hands and face like some claim they have.  I didn&#x27;t even use the sheets that they provide.  I&#x27;m a 58 years old woman and if I can do it with a professional look then anyone can do it.  Think of all the money you will save by not buying mascara all the time.  Think of the convience this product is.  No smears,flakes or raccoon eyes. Wake up without the mascara on your pillow case.  Seriously---this product is worth the money.  Try it.</li>
            <li> I am amazed by how well this product works! I have never written a review before, but I am so pleased with this product that I have to share it. I just used it a few hours ago. I have pale, light brown/blonde lashes and this is the first time that I have used any product like this. I was doubtful that it would work, but this product does exactly what it claims: it tints lashes black. It will not make you look as if you are wearing mascara, which thickens and adds length to lashes, but the tint will make your lashes a dark, rich black color. If you have dark black lashes already then this product will probably not do very much for you, but it is great for lighter lashes. I was also very pleased to find out that this product is made in Sweden, which lessened my fear that it would damage or hurt my eyes. This is a great, highly effective product, and if you use it correctly it will absolutely work. I think that any negative reviews are due to people expecting a mascara-like product or those who do not use it correctly. I am so happy with the results, here are a few tips that I think will help you achieve great results too:     1) First I thoroughly cleaned and dried my lashes, using a mild cleanser (there cannot be any residue or makeup on your lashes). I skipped the eye pads and petroleum jelly (vaseline) as even a small bit of petroleum jelly will only get on the lashes and prevent the product from adhering.  2) I applied the activator using the rounded end of a Q-tip, using the enclosed transfer pipet to apply activator to the q-tip. I spent a good 10 minutes applying activator to each eye (at least 20 mins total), thoroughly covering each lash from base to tip (I applied activator to the top side of my upper lashes as well as the underside). I only put a small amount of activator (no more than a few drops) on the q-tip each time (there should not be activator dripping off the q-tip), and I repeated this process until I had thoroughly coated every little bit of eachlash (and coated each lash multiple times). This way you can thoroughly coat each lash without getting activator in your eyes.  3) I knew that the pointed end of the q-tip was not going to work very well for applying the tint, so I used a tiny (no more than half an inch long), angled mascara wand specifically designed for applying mascara to the lashes in the corner of the eye. (I washed and dried the wand thoroughly before using to apply tint). My mascara wand came from my \\&quot;Imju Fiberwig Tiny Sniper\\&quot; mascara, but you could find a wand like this at most beauty supply stores like Sephora or Ulta (the wand should be very very tiny with the brush set at an angle). This was the perfect tool for applying the tint. I squeezed a small amount of tint onto a q-tip, then used the q-tip to apply the tint to the wand. As I did with the activator, I only applied a very small amount of tint at a time to avoid getting it in my eyes. I repeated the application of small amounts of tint until I had covered every bit of each lash, I also applied tint to both the top and bottom sides of my upper lashes.     -By being very careful and applying only small amounts of tint at a time, I was able to avoid getting very much on my skin. The only place that I accidentally stained with tint was a small place on my upper eyelid right above the lash line in the outer corner (I usually smear mascara in the same spot by accident). But this is a very small place, it just looks like I have a bit of eyeliner on. I wiped the stain with a damp q-tip as soon as it happened, so it is very minor. I did not get any of the tint on the skin below my lashes, and I did not use any vaseline or the eye pads. After allowing the tint to dry for a few minutes, I washed my eyes with mild face wash (I use baby wash). My lashes are now a deep, rich black color! I still need mascara if I want them to be thicker and longer, but at least now they show up without anything on! This product works exactly as it says it will.The short list:  -start with thoroughly clean and dry eyelashes, skip the vaseline under the eyes  -only apply small amounts of activator at a time, but keep at it until you thoroughly coat each side of every lash (then coat each lash again)  -use a tiny, angled (clean) mascara wand to apply the tint, only apply a small amount of tint at a time but repeat until every side of every lash is coated (apply to each lash from multiple sides)  -go slowly and carefully, applying a small bit at a time; keep plenty of q-tips on hand to quickly wipe away mistakes    Since I only applied a small amount of activator and tint at a time, I only got a little bit of the tint into my eyes, and it did sting, but luckily there was too little on my brush to cause any real pain. A few hours after application my eyes do feel a bit sensitive, sort of similar to the way they feel a few hours after chopping a strong onion or swimming in a chlorinated pool. I am expecting the tint to last for about 2&amp;1/2-3 weeks, I will update this review if it lasts for a significantly shorter or longer period than expected. I am very picky about beauty products, but I plan on using this one again and again, and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very very good product. lashes look very natural and beautiful. Very easy to use. The main act according to instructions.</li>
            <li> Works great but easier to use and old mascara application brush to apply. My eyelashes look great only did them once but ready to do them again.</li>
            <li> I have very light eyelashes &amp; am a Redhead. This product is GREAT. Since using this most times I don&#x27;t even need mascara. So easy to put on..  If you can put on mascara without getting dots or smears on your skin then you will not have a problem. Just apply slowly. I bought the brushes &amp; use them.</li>
            <li> Did not work very well.  Dyed my lashes twice and couldn&#x27;t see much of a difference. Also tried it on my daughter with same results. It probably works best on very very light lashes.</li>
            <li> Read lots of reviews and never was able to get this to stick to my eyelashes and keep them dark for more than a few days.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really see much of a difference and hard to apply</li>
            <li> I love that suddenly I have longer eyelashes because the tips apparently were light. The application takes a little getting used to, would love to see each tube with a mascara brush - would make it more user friendly. Now I just apply clear mascara over my lashes and it looks like I have on regular mascara without the running or raccoon eyes. My husband said it looks very natural and makes my almond shaped eyes look like they are open wider. Will buy again, hope they put mascara brushes into each container!</li>
            <li> My wife reports the product&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> Dye did not last more than a couple of days. I was hopeful it would last and keep me from having to constantly wear mascara, especially during the hot sweaty summer months. Washed off after 2 days and only left my lashes slightly darker and I still had to wear mascara. I feel like it&#x27;s keeping my regular mascara from rely adhering to my lashes as well. Would try it again ..</li>
            <li> Today I used 28 Day Mascara and was disappointed by the results. I followed the instructions and even dyed my eyelashes several times with no difference. The packaged said that you can use the product to attain longer thicker lashes but with me that was not the result. Maybe it is because my eye lashes are already brown because those with blonde eyelashes in the reviews seemed to have satisfied results.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as it says</li>
            <li> This is a very difficult product to use. The applicator does not allow you to put enough product on it to cover the lashes. Used a cotton tip instead. The eye pads have no adhesive to stay under the eye therefore you are trying to hold it in place in addition to applying the product. Messy and terrible instructions. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Works on brows, not lashes.</li>
            <li> Seems to work, and I haven&#x27;t made a mess yet.  You do need to be careful when applying.</li>
            <li> The only disappointment was that the activator in the kit is gone well before the black dye. It would be wonderful to have a way to buy these separately, or have the kit hold a slightly larger amount.</li>
            <li> A bit tricky to get the hang of and a little messy, but it really does work. I would advise using a clean mascara wand to apply vs. the provided applicator - much easier.</li>
            <li> I have blonde lashes. I like this product enough that I am buying it again.    Previously, I was going to a salon to have my eye lashes tinted - but they recommended that I go every two weeks and that gets expensive - both money and time.    I really like being able to do this at home.    Once you apply this product, it takes just 2-3 minutes per eye - in the salon, they left the dye on for 10-15 minutes - it would leak into my eyes and be very painful.     If you get this product into your eyes, it will sting. I keep a bottle of saline handy and rinse my eye if that happens. I have more control at home so I like that. Plus I am learning how to prevent getting it into my eye at all (an option not available at the salon). The key is to do one eye at a time and to not put on too much product at once.    I don&#x27;t bother with the \\&quot;tissues\\&quot; they provide for under the eye or with putting vaseline on my skin to prevent staining as the vaseline gets on my eyelashes and then the product won&#x27;t adhere to my lashes.    I take my time and carefully apply the product using the provided pointed q-tips. Then brush my eyelashes with a clean mascara brush (which I bought separately). If I get any on my skin, I wipe off immediately with a regular q-tip. It will stain my skin for a day or so but not bad.    So far so good - it is so nice to not have to wear mascara - which I was always rubbing off resulting in \\&quot;racoon eyes\\&quot;.     In summary, this product lasts as long as the salon treatment did. What is better is that I save time and money (and avoid discomfort!) by doing it myself at home.    fyi: I am near-sighted so it is easy for me to get close to a mirror to see what I am doing. I can&#x27;t imagine how anyone who is far-sighted could use this product. You could not wear glasses or contacts during the process.</li>
            <li> The seller was great and shipped it immediately.  My only problem was, the instructions say you can remove any tint from your skin with soap and water.  Well, I guess that is true in two weeks when the dead skin cells fall off.  Beware, it will tint your skin too if you accidentally get some on it.  It did NOT wash off with soap and water!!!! Once my under eye skin color went back to normal, I enjoyed having my lashes permanantly tinted.  It works, just be very careful!</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.  Found it easier to use than I thought.  I purchased disposable mascara brushes so it was very easy to apply.  Just keep in mind... does NOT thicken lashes just darkens them.  I used the black tint and it does not make lashes real dark.... very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product one time and it seemed to work well.  I hate wearing mascara on a daily basis.  Now I use my eyelash curler and you can see my lashes fine.</li>
            <li> i like this product it is really easy to use . my only concern is the color.. the black  color is too light like almost brown.</li>
            <li> I have really blonde lashes, so was skeptical this would work after reading the reviews.  I used disposable mascara applicators to apply.  It worked so well and no mess!  I didn&#x27;t even need the under eye protectors.  I left the color portion on for 3 minutes rather than one after the first application, and that helped a lot.  I used another mascara applicator to apply the second portion too and that also worked well.  This was very easy to use, but not sure I will continue to use since it didn&#x27;t make my lashes as dark as I would like.  I can definitely tell a difference from the blonde though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice and didn&#x27;t really see results either time. Make sure to use vaseline on your skin prior to dying because it&#x27;s really easy to get a tiny bit on your lash line and it will stain for a few days.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awful. I read all of the reviews on how to make this stuff work (the instructions in the kit are completely inadequate).  They were helpful but after a couple of hours all I&#x27;ve gotten is some very lightly dyed eyelashes and my eyes are burning like a son of a *****. I&#x27;ve tried applying it with the Q-tip provided, a toothpick with a tiny bit of cotton on the end and a masacara brush. I&#x27;m lying here with an icepack on them. It does stain your skin, enough that I look like I have black eyeliner on. In fact my last application I settled for directly dying my skin so that my \\&quot;eyeliner\\&quot; matches and forgetting about getting my eyelashes dyed. I&#x27;m young and have thick eyelashes, they&#x27;re just blonde. This was a complete waste of money. I&#x27;m looking to see if I can get my money back. If not I&#x27;ll just throw it away.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product! I really don&#x27;t like mascara AT ALL, I can&#x27;t stand the feeling of it on my eyelashes, and my eyelashes are so long they brush the insides of my glasses when I blink, so mascara can be a nightmare! Although they&#x27;re long, thy&#x27;re light colored, especially at the tips- the tips are blonde. So without mascara, the length is completely lost. Since I despise mascara, i thought I&#x27;d give this a try, and I&#x27;m glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t understand why people are saying this is so difficult to use. When I first tried it, I just read the directions and did exactly what they say to do, except I bought disposable mascara brushes to apply the gel, but I&#x27;ll get back to that later.&lt;br /&gt;First off, it says on the box to use vaseline so you don&#x27;t accidentally get it on your skin. It also says the pads can be trimmed to fit, if necessary. And yes, it IS necessary. So I did what they said, applied a thin layer of vaseline under my lashes, placed the TRIMMED pads on the vaseline and they stayed just fine. Nothing leaked through.&lt;br /&gt;Second, the q-tips are really only good for applying the vaseline, and the activator. Just be careful to only get the vaseline on your skin, and NOT your lashes! if you get it on your lashes, the dye won&#x27;t work. (it&#x27;s a barrier...)&lt;br /&gt;Third, I went ahead and bought a pack of disposable CURVED mascara brushes at Sally&#x27;s beauty Supply for about $3, due to the reviews on here I figured it was my best bet. It was, and I HIGHLY suggest it! It makes this product SO user friendly! The best and easiest way to apply the gel is to put it on the OUTSIDE CURVED part of the mascara brush, this way you can apply it to the harder to get to areas like the corners and lower lashes. I had NO trouble at all doing it this way, all my lashes dyed beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t understand comments about how it stains everything, clothes, counters...what are people doing with this product? The gel that dyes comes in a little tiny squeeze bottle, and it&#x27;s a gel, so I don&#x27;t understand how it&#x27;s getting everywhere?!?! But that&#x27;s irrelevant...I just don&#x27;t understand how it gets \\&quot;everywhere\\&quot;. (it does, however, stain the eye pads) I use this product at my dining room table with my lighted magnifying mirror, and it&#x27;s mess-free. Just be careful not to get it IN your eye, somehow I managed to get a tiny bit the first time I used it and it hurt so bad I was convinced I was blinded for life! But I wasn&#x27;t...&#x3D;) It washed out no problem! (Thank goodness!)&lt;br /&gt;So in conclusion, I LOVE this product! My eyelashes are so happy not to have to wear mascara! &#x3D;) They look outstanding! Very happy! I highly suggest this product, just READ the directions and follow them! Oh, and don&#x27;t forget the curved disposable mascara brushes, you&#x27;ll thank me later! Ha-ha!erstand how it&#x27;s getting everywhere?!?! But that&#x27;s irrelevant...I just don&#x27;t understand how it gets \\&quot;everywhere\\&quot;. (it does, however, stain the eye pads) I use this product at my dining room table with my lighted magnifying mirror, and it&#x27;s mess-free. Just be careful not to get it IN your eye, somehow I managed to get a tiny bit the first time I used it and it hurt so bad I was convinced I was blinded for life! But I wasn&#x27;t...&#x3D;) It washed out no problem! (Thank goodness!)  So in conclusion, I LOVE this product! My eyelashes are so happy not to have to wear mascara! &#x3D;) They look outstanding! Very happy! I highly suggest this product, just READ the directions and follow them! Oh, and don&#x27;t forget the curved disposable mascara brushes, you&#x27;ll thank me later! Ha-ha!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara tint.  It&#x27;s easy to use and it really covered my gray lashes. The product arrived on time so I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I had read some of the other reviews, this made it easier to do. I bought some disposible mascara applicators, and began the process of getting noticible eye lashes! Mine are so blonde they are see through! I am going on a trip and we will be in the water alot, I hate waterproof mascara! So all I need to do is curl my tinted eye lashes and walah! So to make it simple I liked the product, it works...</li>
            <li> I work in a Salon and we offer Lash tinting for $25. I tried this product and I think it works just as well as ours in the Salon. With 25 applications that would be $625 in the Salon. It is more trouble to do it yourself but it&#x27;s worth it. You will love your dark lashes! It takes practice. Do one eye at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple years and I love it. After applyin a couple times, youll kniw what works for you and the process will take less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well, in that it makes your eyelashes darker. But it&#x27;s a pain in the rear to apply, easy to make a mess, and unlike mascara doesn&#x27;t lengthen or thicken your lashes. So for the amount of results seen on my eyelashes, wasn&#x27;t worth the effort of applying every few weeks.</li>
            <li> I have very light and thin lashes and it seems like a lot of work to barely see this tint on my lashes and it does not seem to last more than a day for me.</li>
            <li> Amazing able to use myself and definitely had color that lasted.  After the first few applications it was just as easy as putting on regular mascara maybe just a minute longer prep time but lasted much longer of course!  Instant results.  Now I&#x27;m into false lashes so I use less but still touch up my bottom lashes every so often.</li>
            <li> This product does work, don&#x27;t listen to the obviously obtuse reviewers who claim it stains the whole bathroom and their hands/face, but can&#x27;t go on the lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I did it with a professional lip brush (small rounded flat tip) and the comb it came with in the box. I have long eyelashes that are black, but the tips are very blonde so I was trying to make them all black.&lt;br /&gt;It worked but the result is a dark brown, natural looking, but I wanted black like the roots of my eyelashes. It&#x27;s clearly not black even after doing the application several times.&lt;br /&gt;The reason for three stars is that the price is way to high for the amount given and the color is brown not black.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend the product, but I suggest you try another one that&#x27;s cheaper and gives a deeper color result.</li>
            <li> Product is easy to use. The fumes did not bother my eyes which has been issue for me with previous tints I&#x27;ve tried. I took off one star because I didn&#x27;t feel the black color was as rich as it could be.</li>
            <li> Have used this for quite awhile.  I have thin pale lashes and do not want to wear mascara every day (rough on the lashes-applying and removing!).  This works just fine.  Lasts about 3 good weeks.  Easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to take me some time to get the hang of this, mainly because my eyes water so much when I use it.  It takes about three applications to get the color to stay on.  I don&#x27;t know why my eyes burn so much, but I grit my teeth through it because I hate my white-blond eyelashes.  As soon as the color stays black and I wash the color off, the burning stops.  Don&#x27;t use on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> If I could return the product, I would. I tried using it 3 times, on clean lashes, and the result is spotty at best. My lashes are blond, almost translucent at the tips... and they were pretty much the same after 3 applications. Meh.</li>
            <li> I nearly didn&#x27;t buy this product after reading other reviews, but decided to try it anyway.  I believe the key to application is do not be in a hurry, go slow, and if you need to use a q-tip without cotton to apply slow and steady.  You may even want to do top and lower lashes separate rather than trying to do one eye at a time.  (So 4 separate applications vs. 2.)  Keep in mind this is stain, it darkens lashes but doesn&#x27;t add anything to them.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this product, I have blonde eyelashes and always have to wear mascara or false eyelashes.  I applied this product on a Tuesday morning and by Friday morning it was gone.  Each day it was less than the day before.  I also did not get them wet in the shower.  I would not recommend this product because it does NOT last for 28 days.</li>
            <li> It takes some practice and may take take 2 applications if you have blonde lashes, but does work.&lt;br /&gt;I used a mascara wand. Keep Q tips handy to remove smudges on eyelids.</li>
            <li> I successfully applied the product to my left eye as directed, but accidentally got a DROP of product in my right eye and that was the end of it.  My eye was on fire and teared so badly that it was impossible to apply the product.  The burning and tearing lasted a good 15 minutes afterwards and the redness stayed through the end of the night.  One big drawback is that they don&#x27;t provide a brush but just some cotton swabs which makes application very difficult and sloppy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dark eyelashes on my upper lids but they are invisible on my lower lids and the ends of my outer upper lashes.  The tint was visible right after application on my left eye, but disappeared after showering the next day.  Perhaps this product works well for fair haired people, but heaven help you if you get it in your eye.</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the eyebrow dye.  The product for eyebrows works great but this is just so-so.  Hard to apply, stings and really doesn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> It needs a better applicator as those wands could be improved. I found that the mascara only lasts about a week.</li>
            <li> Although somewhat messy, I did like this....but stopped using it because it is messy.</li>
            <li> So good so far. I&#x27;ve used other lash dies and they were more complicated to put on. This had no fumes and no stinging at all!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean smudges and got all the lashes! Will wait to see how long the color lasts but great so far.</li>
            <li> Love this product when it first goes on but it does not last for 28 days.</li>
            <li> I have blonde eyelashes.  I dislike wearing mascara during the summer and this year I didn&#x27;t have to.  The product worked just as described.  I would, however, have someone help me next time.  I don&#x27;t see very well close up.</li>
            <li> I purchased this thinking I could escape from wearing mascara every day. It wasn&#x27;t as deep of a black tint as I&#x27;d hoped, but it was pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;Im thinking if I dye them twice it will work better.&lt;br /&gt;Was really easy to apply &amp; had no problems with it!</li>
            <li> Seemed like a good idea at the time, after receiving it and reading the instructions decided it was more trouble then it was worth.  If you have someone helping you it might be just fine.  I&#x27;m only rating it on ease of use - much to complicated.  Not rating the product as I didn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> So far so good with this product. I have naturally blonde hair with nonexistent lashes and brows. Mascara is a necessity for me no matter where I go. I honestly didn&#x27;t have a problem with applying this product. I read many reviews and use a mini mascara wand to apply both the color and activator. If the color touched my skin, I made sure to wipe it off immediately so it didn&#x27;t stain like others have said it does. Theres definitely a difference with the color. As many have stated, this only COLORS your lashes. I have long lashes but they aren&#x27;t thick so when I wear make-up I still use my mascara for volume. I personally think this was money well spent and defintely intend to use this product again.</li>
            <li> I have eyelashes the color of fishing line and anything will show up on them-except this.  It really didn&#x27;t do much for my eyelashes-it was difficult to apply and it kind of burned my eyes.  However, it was amazing on my eyebrows!!! I am definitely going to purchase this in brown for my eyebrows-which are very very very blonde as well.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviewers have been having trouble with this product not setting or washing off, and I think the trick is to start with really clean dry lashes.  If you have any oil or residual makeup on your skin or lashes, this wont \\&quot;take\\&quot;.  I have had good results that last for weeks and weeks.  It&#x27;s great to wake up already looking made up!  The process is a bit messy and you should make sure you have a steady hand before applying.  Apply the activator gel, let it set for a minute or two, then liberally apply the dye.  I dont use the cotton pads they sent at all, But i do use pointed swabs for the application of activator and dye.  If you get too much in one area, use a lash brush to redistribute while it is still wet.  if you get a dab of dye on your skin, it will come off with oil or soap if you get to it immediatelty.  It will also come off with a bit of the activator on the end of a swab.  Try to let your lashes dry before doing too much else, and don&#x27;t wash or use makeup remover for 24 hours or so.  I also make a thin line of eyeliner with this process and while it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the lashes, it works well.  I would not recommend doing this at all however, if you don&#x27;t have a very steady application, because getting this in your eyes is pretty nasty and mistakes are difficult to correct if you don&#x27;t correct immediately.  I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> this product is easy to use, but I have used a lot of this stuff in the past. it is strong and you do need to be careful not to get it in your eyes. dont get it on your skin, it will stain. it comes with an applicator but I used my own. remember tho its just a dye, it dose not thicken the hairs, but for those of us with blonde hairs, its nice to see them when you cant put mascara on. if your not good at this stuff, have a friend over and do each others, its safer. I got black and I did come up nice.</li>
            <li> I just have to warn you: Dont bother. Its way too difficult to use and doesnt do anything. I bought this and the eyebrow tint by this same line in dark brown.&lt;br /&gt;I suggest buying the eyebrow stuff and using THAT on your lashes (using a mascara brush) - it works very well (and has also stayed on my eyelashes for the last three weeks) - although it does sting your eyes a bit from the chemicals. You dont have to leave it on too long though. Maybe a minute. And it might stain your lids a bit if you are too sloppy, but nothing that wont come off in a day (try some eye-makeup remover or Ponds cream or Vaseline)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mascara stuff was not only kind of hard to use, but mainly it just didnt do anything. Even when I used a mascara brush to put it on it still sucked. First you put the dye on and then you have to put the developer on - and with the eyebrow stuff you just mix it all together and slap it on. Its much easier and works much better.</li>
            <li> I had to follow the instructions the the T. It worked great the first time, although I had to leave it on for 35 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Now that t he product has been opened and used I am not getting the same results as the first time. I will most likely go back to the salon and pay to have them do it again.&lt;br /&gt;Time is money, so I was hoping to save both with this product.</li>
            <li> I got good results with this product. It&#x27;s not as difficult to use as I had expected it to be.  I have long eyelashes that are dark at the base, but something like sun-bleached at the ends. Mascara irritates my eyes so I don&#x27;t use it. I used this 3 weeks ago, and my eyelashes still have a nice, lush, long look. I especially like how long it has made my bottom eyelashes look. I&#x27;ve never used mascara on my bottom lashes, so this was a good improvement. I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package there was only one small plastic stick to stir with which has to be used over and over again. The photo shows 20 sticks. The packaging looked old as well.</li>
            <li> Tried 2 separate applications one week apart. I followed the directions exactly each time and never got more than 3 days wear. With the second application, I applied several coats and it did not extend the length of wear at all. Not worth the time, trouble or expense.</li>
            <li> So disapointed!  I have very light eyelashes and thought this was going to be wonderful.  I don&#x27;t wear mascara anymore and wanted my eyelashes to be dark enough to be able to see them.  This products application was messy, to say the least, and after TWO applications, there was barely any difference. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it and certainly wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.  I don&#x27;t believe you could ever get 25 applications out of it either.  Oh well..... wasn&#x27;t the first time I wasted money like that.  Too bad they don&#x27;t make samples you can purchase for a few dollars first.  But then, if they did that, they wouldn&#x27;t sell much of the actual product.  \\&quot;Live and learn!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I live this product! It was so easy to apply and looks great!!! I will defiantly recommend this to friends!</li>
            <li> I have no problem with the seller, great, prompt transaction.  I did not care for the product.  Not easy to use and didn&#x27;t seem to do what it was intended for.  Hard to use applicator as well.  Don&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> If I had thicker eyelashes it would have probably been much better.  I bought it for my bottom lashes but they were too thin to see any difference.  I could at least see it on the top lashes but didn&#x27;t make enough change to buy again.  It was easy to use.</li>
            <li> Makes things darker, but the name of the product doesn&#x27;t suit it.</li>
            <li> It was horrible to use. It smeared after applying and then was very difficult to get off of my skin...but wouldn&#x27;t stay on my lashes as promised! .</li>
            <li> I am always in a hurry when I have to go out.  The 28 day mascara is a big time saver, it worked the way it was suppose and does save me some time.  No complaints.  It met my expectations and it arrived on time as promised.&lt;br /&gt;I did recommend it to some of my family and friends.  Would buy this product again.  The price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have red hair and light eye lashes. I was getting tired doing the mascara ritual every morning before work, or before I would go out. I also hate when I get back home late, naturally tired, go to bed and get all comfortable only to realize I never took my mascara off...     I was very intrigued when I came across this. I was a little nervous at the thought of putting chemicals near my eyes. I&#x27;m pretty clumsy and fumbly, so I was iffy about trying it out on myself. I went ahead and ordered it after reading in the reviews that a lot of people had no problems doing it on themselves with no help. I was reading several people saying the chemical stings their eyes when they were applying the mascara. I, thankfully, didn&#x27;t experience any pain.     I will say, the bottled labeled first solution is easy to apply and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the staining at that point. Make sure you get all the lashes nice and wet with this stuff because if you don&#x27;t, some lashes wont change colors. I used the q-tips that were provided. I did one eye at a time. I made sure to get all the lashes wet, and then I put more of the solution on the q-tip and did it again, just to be sure, and then let it set in for about a minute and a half. I made sure that I didn&#x27;t have any of the first solution on my eye lid before applying the 2nd. As soon as I put the 2nd solution on the lashes, they instantly turned black. The lashes will clump together when you do this. It&#x27;s perfectly fine if they do, just keep applying and make sure you get every lash. Once you rinse the solutions off and your lashes dry, they will separate back to normal. I let it set in for maybe 30 seconds, even though they say it&#x27;s instant... I just wanted to make sure. I was pretty worried about how to rinse it off the lashes. Will it run and stain my face? Nope, it doesn&#x27;t. All you have to do is cup water in your hand and basically hold your closed eye in the cupped water then let the water fall into the sink. I&#x27;d be careful notto rub your eye very much, and when drying- just gently pat your eyes dry. You will see some black come off on to the towel when patting your eye dry.     I will say when I went to do my other eye, when I went to rinse it off, the lashes didn&#x27;t get dyed. I have a feeling I must have still had some kind of oil or even makeup remover residue left in my lashes. Make sure your lashes are completely free of any residue from makeup or makeup remover/soap. The dye won&#x27;t set in if you have anything on them. I rinsed that eye really good after that and tried again with success. I&#x27;m happy to say that after a month, my lashes are still dark and I haven&#x27;t reapplied once! I would like to mention that this will not give your lashes the full effect that mascara gives, so if you lack length and volume in your lashes, you might be disappointed. I have long and full lashes, so I&#x27;m as happy as can be about it. When I would go without mascara, my eyes looked dull and people were constantly telling me I looked tired. Now that they are dark, I don&#x27;t look sleepy and it looks very natural. I might do a re-apply in the next couple days. If you avoid rubbing your eyes and gently pat your eyes dry, you can get it to last a long time.     Another note I would like to make: They come with these paper cut out face shield things to put under your eyes. You can cut them to the shape you want. They are annoying, so I didn&#x27;t bother with them. The instructions say to use petroleum jelly on the skin under your eyes and eyelashes, so that your skin won&#x27;t get stained by accident... I didn&#x27;t do that because it sounded messy and if you accidentally get that stuff on your lashes, the dye won&#x27;t take...so be careful when applying it you your face if you choose to use it...I just went without. I did get a little dye on a couple fingers and finger nails... My finger nails are still stained by it and the stains on my fingers just recently went away. I&#x27;ll take a few stains on my hands in place of dealing with mascara every day!    If you have light colored eyelashes, this product is definitely worth it. If you have dark lashes, don&#x27;t waste your money or time, it will do nothing for you. This product does not add volume or length, just color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to put on, without getting it on the skin under the eye(and everywhere else). Even with the eye shields, because the product soaks right thru them.  I had a make-up technician apply it for me, and I still did not get satisfactory results. And the little bit you are lucky to get on the lashes doesn&#x27;t stay on. By the time I washed the excess off my skin and wiped my tearing eyes, there was nothing left on the lashes.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002T71IL2 Godefroy 28 Day Mascara Black Permanent Eyelash Tint Kit Contains 25 Applicat...]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is described as an eyelash (or eyebrow) permanent tinting kit and has exceeded my initial expectations.  I received the 28 Day Mascara yesterday and used it today.&lt;br /&gt;Instructions were very easy to read and follow.  I used a magnifying mirror to aid in seeing and tinting the smaller, lighter colored lashes and I did make a few changes to make application a little bit easier.  I used the rounded end of the q-tip for activator #1 and dampened the lashes as instructed, however it said add activator gel #2 to the pointed end and apply to lashes - I did that but found it worked much easier if I added activator gel #2 to an individual mascara applicator (you can buy a package of 20 for very little) which applied the #2 gel much more efficiently.  I must admit I tried to use the cotton eye shields, but they were more of a hindrance so I pulled them off and was just more careful to not touch skin with gel #2(which can easily stain the skin).  That being said, I did get a little bit on the eyelid at the base of the lashes and I added more to the \\&quot;mistake\\&quot; to create an eyeliner effect as a test to see if the \\&quot;eyeliner\\&quot; would stay and how long it would last as opposed to the actual eyelash tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lashes that are naturally very light brown, this product immediately made them black (which is the color of the product).  I will come back in a few days to update this review with a one week post application review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:  use individual mascara applicator for #2 gel and use a magnifying mirror to help with locate and tint lighter colored lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of Day 1 - I am very pleased with this product - 5 Star rating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jan</li>
            <li> Product is ok. Looks good as soon as the stuff is applied but doesn&#x27;t really last for long. The first time I used it, it caused a red itchy rash under my bottom eyelid.</li>
            <li> This was messy. It did not work for me. It was a lot of work with no results. I received no difference in the color of my lashes.</li>
            <li> This stuff simply doesn&#x27;t work. Perhaps if I had a blonde eyelashes or it may do nothing for you either. It did nadda for me.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth review I&#x27;ve ever left fyi...and I&#x27;m leaving it because the reviews don&#x27;t seem all that glowing partly due to the messiness of the product.  Well, I used only what came in the box in addition to non-petroleum jelly (more natural form of vaseline) and it was NOT messy.  I ordered mascara brushes, but they hadn&#x27;t arrived yet and I didn&#x27;t want to wait to try this stuff. ;)  I did get it on my skin, but with the petroleum jelly as a barrier, it doesn&#x27;t stain at all when removed with tissue or a Q-tip as the mess ups happen.  I got it on our white sink and rinsed it with water right away...didn&#x27;t stain at all.  I got it on my hand where I hadn&#x27;t used petroleum jelly-came off with water.  I didn&#x27;t use the eye shields as they were uncomfortable after a few seconds when I blinked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One eye did kind of sting when I put on the activator...not from having it get in my eye, but from the chemical nature of the product.  I&#x27;m normally a natural product kind of girl so it bugged me a little.  I think I was putting too much of the activator on though to be sure I covered all the lashes...so it&#x27;s partly my fault.  As I said, only one eye was sensitive...so it must have been excessive amounts to cause it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only did one application (as apposed to two to make it even darker) and am very happy with the results.  I&#x27;m a sandy blonde and my lashes and brows a just a tiny bit darker than my hair.  To have them a nice dark dark brown/black all the way to the tips it super amazing.  I don&#x27;t wear mascara unless I&#x27;m going out, so it&#x27;s really nice to have more visible lashes all the time. &#x3D;)  This is going to sound like I got paid to leave a review...but I had my husband look at my lashes and he asked if I had extensions put on...like the expensive glue one lash at a time kind...he may have just been trying to make me happy...who knows ;).  I have been using lash conditioner at night to make them more healthy too and that has really made a difference too.  Ifeel like my lashes don&#x27;t fall out as fast so they get a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line.  It works-not like extensions dramatic, but it does make them look longer and much darker.  It&#x27;s not THAT messy.  I hope it lasts for a few weeks but will continue to use even if it starts to fade before 28 days.  It has survived my normal routines for a few days in response to a user saying it washed off after a few hours...it sounds like she didn&#x27;t put on the activator.  It&#x27;s the color that goes on first..then the activator...then remove it all with a tissue after a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;happy beauty experimenting! ;)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve tried it three times. Don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> Worked well, but very difficult to do on oneself! Be very careful. It will last a very very long time.</li>
            <li> This product is so so at best. I found it easy to use, but I am not impressed at all with the results. I would advise mixing the color and the developer prior to application,  rather than layering the developer on top of the color. Their eyebrow tinting kit is no better. This brand is just no good.</li>
            <li> This product does very little to darken your lashes and it doesn&#x27;t thicken them at all. It really shouldn&#x27;t be called mascara. And it can stain your skin.</li>
            <li> I love this eyelash tint. I used an old mascara brush that I cleaned and soaked first, which really helped to distribute the tint easily.  I didn&#x27;t use any of the pads and found if you have a pretty steady hand, you don&#x27;t need them. The activator was equally easy to apply, just keep it out of the eye. Also, I applied to the top and bottom of each upper and lower lash, and left it on for 15 minutes before removing. It didn&#x27;t hurt my lashes and I find they come out darker.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Lasts about 3 or 4 weeks and has quite a few uses in the bottle. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with dyeing my skin. It wipes off when you smudge your skin.</li>
            <li> It works, plain and simple. I wish I had thicker lashes, and this stuff does nothing for that, but it isn&#x27;t made to. And it&#x27;s easy to use. As some other people stated, I also don&#x27;t use the cotton cover things.</li>
            <li> It is okay a little difficult to use but it works must be careful not to get on skin hard to remove..might recommend it.</li>
            <li> My eyelashes was really really light blonde that It looked like I had no eyelashes at all (without the mascara)............Althouh, I had to put the gel first &amp; then the color because it didn&#x27;t work for me at first. I used a disposable mascara. I did it like 4 times and left the dye on for 3 to 5 minutes in order to get my eyelashes dark enough. But after all, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m very happy with the results&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE PRODUCT, IT HAS MADE ME LOOK FORWARD TO USING IT AS IT WORKS SO WELL. BUY IT, ITS WORTH IT</li>
            <li> I have normal length eyelashes and, they are thick enough, but as I have aged, they have become ligthter colored on the ends.  I hate all the cakey mascara&#x27;s that I have to use and I always seemed to have hoot owl eyes at the end of the day.  I read about the eyelash tint and decided to try it.  Although it is a little tedious to put on, it worked great.  Beautiful dark lashes that really show up now.  I had no eye irritation and it took a lot of time off of my morning routine.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> No complaints using this product...just don&#x27;t be in rush using it or you&#x27;ll have black spots where you don&#x27;t want them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a problem applying it at all, but it didn&#x27;t make a difference in my eyelash look.  My lashes (what little I have)are brown, but never got any darker. I&#x27;ve gotten better results with Olay&#x27;s product. Try that!</li>
            <li> I have had my lashes tinted professionally for years.  At $25 a pop I thought I would try this product.  It did not cover my gray lashes on the first try. So I repeated the process again.  Better but not black enough.  The third time I left it on for 5 minutes instead of the recommended 1 minute. Results are OK!  I would like to see them darker.  And yes I followed the directions perfectly.</li>
            <li> Am a blonde who&#x27;s been dyeing lashes her entire life and this product doesn&#x27;t even make it until the end of the day. Does last as long as mascara.</li>
            <li> I have very light lashes and have been getting them dyed professionally for years. I wanted to start doing them at home to save money but this dye in no way compares to how they look after I have them done professionally from the salon. Seriously bummed! I guess I will have to keep looking!</li>
            <li> Have gone back to regular mascara; can&#x27;t say that it stayed dark for anything over 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> The key to using this product is to have small applicator brushes (like what comes with Latisse, like a nail polish type brush).  I squeeze a very small amount on the end of the brush and then blot lightly on paper towel before applying with a very light touch to the top lashes.  Be Patient.  Don&#x27;t be heavy handed or put a lot of product on your applicator.  Don&#x27;t bother trying to use the paper shields in the box.  They are too big and do not stick.  The vaseline just makes things horrible.  Remember to wash and dry your lashes before applying to rid of any oils.  I highly recommend this product and have not had any problem applying if I take my time.  Also, have a q-tip for dab any small spots that bleed over onto skin.  I apply so sparingly that I ususally do 2 separate applications a couple hours apart.  Beats getting in your eyes and having dye spots on your skin.  Hope this helps!  Really, the key is using good applicators. Check Sallys beauty supply for different options.  Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I thought this would darken my eye lashes more than it does.  It is very easy to use. It would be good for blonds that want darker lashed</li>
            <li> Sorry to say, after two attempts, it did not work for me. I bought &amp;#34;Just for Men&amp;#34; for half the price in jet black and success in just one minute.</li>
            <li> works great on eyebrows! Lasted one month then had to re-apply.</li>
            <li> 1. Difficult to use 2. Dried out my lashes 3. Color didn&#x27;t last!!! Threw away the box, won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff. I have naturally dirty blonde hair, so my eyelashes (although very long) are super light. I usually spend about an hour in the bathroom doing this, but that&#x27;s because I love my lashes to be extremely dark so I do the process 3 times. It&#x27;s all about preference though :) 1 coat is more than okay! I&#x27;m just over the top. The color lasts, too. I usually touch up about every 2 months at the max... if I&#x27;m feeling lazy and don&#x27;t get around to it before then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that the applicator stick is kind of a pain in the butt to work with, and I personally think it sucks. But it&#x27;s not the worst thing in the world. I sometimes use those skinny brace-flossers (I forget what they&#x27;re actually called, they&#x27;re the ones with the small bristles) and I feel they make the application so much easier! Either way, totally worth a shot. You won&#x27;t be disappointed! ESPECIALLY since this entire box is cheaper than one application at a salon. Don&#x27;t let the bad reviews deter you. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use.  I followed the directions exactly and had gorgeous black lashes (mine are very blonde) for 26 days.</li>
            <li> I have used different eyelash dye products over the years. Although this product does dye the eyelashes somewhat, the coverage is not very good.  I have very blond, translucent eyelashes so I was hoping to find a product that came up to my expectations. After applying the solutions, it barely dyed the top lashes and the color on the bottom lashes washed off. I did follow the directions to a T and found the swabs useless. I then used a separate lash wand and the coverage was much better.  Since I have more applications left, I will do it again but scrape the vaseline and eye shields. I don&#x27;t recommend this idea unless you have a very steady hand, which I do. I hope it does a better job but I am not holding my breath.</li>
            <li> I picked up this item after seeing a tutorial on a beauty website. The tutorial suggested using small dental appliance brushes that you can generally find with the dental floss and appliance items like wax for braces. I used the dental brushed like a mascara wand to apply the activator and color gel and didn&#x27;t have any problems. I was able to get it almost all the way to the roots and didn&#x27;t even use a shield. I did put lots of moisturizer around my eyes so I would be able to wipe them off, but didn&#x27;t end up needing to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have applied this one time and got it perfect from the first time. My eyelashes are blonde, and while I do still wear mascara, I can wash my makeup off and still look like I have eyes! This is a great product and I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting to purchase this product for many years and the price finally came down, I could not resist!!  It was a little tricky the first time but by the 3rd I am a pro! Read all the reviews with suggestions.  I bought the disposable mascara brushes, it fits PERFECTLY in the hole of the plug for the no 1 Activator jar, scrapes the excess off too.  Becareful though, it splatters a little.  For the no 2 Gel Colorant, I use the pointy Q tips provided.  Worked very well. Before I started I also used a regular Q-tip to put petroleum jelly around my eye, under and on the lid.  A must is a maginifing lite mirror.  Go slow and dont put too much activator on, it tends to splatter and will burn your eyes a little.  I used it a few days in a row to darken the look.  I got fair to good results. I have long thin completely transparent lashes, so the effect is minimal but I figure a little is better than nothing!  But what really sold me was I decided to try it on my thinning eye brows, instant LOVE!  I will keep using it.  I like having at least a slightly visible eye lash, looks pretty good when I use my curler on them.  Maybe about a 3 1/2 to 4 for lashes, 4-5 stars for eyebrows!  If my eyelashes were thickier and light the effect would be a knock out but all in all I am pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After over one month of using I am ready to reorder.  This is a new staple in my make up case.  I have started to use Retivalash too so the effect is becoming more apparent.  For someone with no visible lashes to actually seeing them, it is very nice.  Really easy to use now, although I did forget to wash my hands after the last time and ended up with a brown stained thumb.  Oops!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything, leaving it on longer, mixing it differently than the directions say...if there&#x27;s a difference it&#x27;s so slight and only lasts a day or so.  I have shorter, light brown eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about purchasing this product because I have very fine lashes and I was not sure that it would make any difference at all.  I ordered the less expensive brown color even though I really wanted the black and I used it last night for the first time. WOW!!! My lashes appear longer and thicker than they ever have. It looks like I am wearing mascara. My lashes are visible to the very tip.  I wish I had taken before and after pictures. I had no redness or reaction at all and it was really easy to use.  I will continue to purchase this product. I am a canadian customer and had no problem purchasing this from Amazon and it was at my door within a week.</li>
            <li> I have brown eyelashes that are lighter on the ends.  The tint worked well enough to get those, but really made no difference to the other parts of my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took other reviewers&#x27; advice and used an old (clean) mascara wand.  It really helped saturate my lashes with the developer, then after I washed it I was able to put on the gel very cleanly and easily.  i had no staining around my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again on account of my lashes being already dark, but I would buy the brown for my eyebrows.  I could see how this would work for light lashes.</li>
            <li> It does dye lashes good but applicator provided is not helpfull. I applied with one of those tooth floss brushes as I read online and worked very well as the bristles are small</li>
            <li> This stuff works really well and gives you the same results that you could get from a spa. It is probably really difficult to apply it on yourself though.  The trick to not letting it sting you eyes is to just gently hold your eyelid closed. That way you eyelid will create a nice seal.</li>
            <li> I have pale (almost white) lashes and this works really well to add some color to my lashes, but it doesn&#x27;t take the place of mascara. At best, I look like a brunette without eye make-up. I find the product difficult to remove. The tint is fine, but the gel activator is VERY eye irritating (hurts like a MF). So, if you take it for what it is (not mascara), it&#x27;s worth the $20.</li>
            <li> Clear instructions and easy to use.  I have blonde eyelashes, and while this doesn&#x27;t thicken them, I can go without mascara - a nice, natural black color.</li>
            <li> This eyelash dye was very easy to apply and it lasts a very long time. If you are expecting the actual results of mascara, you are going to be dissappointed. Your lashes will be darker but they will not be fuller. It is really just a dye. I did find that if I dyed my lashes every 2 weeks rather than every 4, they are darker for longer. **word of caution, do the skin test, but do a VERY small area, like a dot or so. It doesn&#x27;t wash off or wear off in a few days. My test area looked like a huge bruise  inside of my elbow and was there for over a week.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work&lt;br /&gt;what a mess&lt;br /&gt;drips, smears and after all that doesn&#x27;t even work&lt;br /&gt;I rate it minus 5 stars</li>
            <li> You must use brushes not swabs to apply this. My lashes are blonde to the root. I dont need to put anything on my lids, under or above, either. I just have to be patient and take my time. Dont put too much product on, it shouldnt be running off or spilling down your face. You can take your time because the color sets immediately so theres no time to &#x27;set&#x27; or anything. I keep the pointed swabs handy in case I do get a bit on my skin, they are better than round ones. I hope this helps people who are having trouble bc if you can get the application down you will LOVE this product and wont be able to live without it. Like me!&lt;br /&gt;**i also use this brand eyebrow tint and it is great as well. Lasts for 2-3 wks depending on my activity.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed with this product. It seemed to work well when first applied but the results did not last even into the next day.</li>
            <li> Since getting older my beautiful long, dark eyelashes have grayed and shortened somewhat. Hate the time it takes to apply mascara and have tried MANY since my long time favorite mascara was taken off the market back in 2000. Even though reviews were mixed I was hopeful and decided to give it a try. Was Extremely disappointed in product. I was very careful following the application instructions, and tried applying the product several times in a row. Considering the severe difficulty of application it made the price that much worse. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Its an awful product.  I used it as directed, and the colored only lasted for a day.  I did not expect to look like mascara just darken my eyelashes which it did not.</li>
            <li> bought as a gift and when she opened it the tint tube was opened and messy so will be returning</li>
            <li> I purchased this despite the negative reviews from others, hoping it would work for me.  It didn&#x27;t.  Perhaps there&#x27;s a fine line between the ratio of the two items that create a bond on the eyelash (to dye it).  If so, I didn&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li> This product gets the job done, but it requires patience and care to avoid getting stains on fingers &amp; fingernails.  Instructions are good and the end result of the application is quite satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Easy but messy to use but got good results. No burning. Color lasted about 3 weeks. Wish It came with more applicators and was made so it was less messy to use. End up wasting a bunch of product. But still it&#x27;s less expensive then getting it done in a salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For instruction I went to YouTube. Godefroy has a how to use vid on this product.</li>
            <li> My son&#x27;s finance came over and asked to me to dye her eye lashes with this product. She has very blonde lashes. The dye worked great and her lashes were black. She then dyed mine and my lashes are black now and I have not worn mascara for weeks. Seems like my lashes are growing now for not using mascara. Let me tell you this product works. I like it a lot. Just be careful with the product getting into your eyes. It stings. Would recommend Godefroy 28 day mascara eyelash dye. GREAT!!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, but this product did not work for me. It was very disappointing and a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have had my eye on this tint for my lashes for awhile--just couldn&#x27;t really afford til now. I have read so many reviews for and against and the just &#x27;so-so&#x27;s&#x27;, but I will tell you I have put this on my lashes--and brows!  I am duly impressed with my results!&lt;br /&gt;I got everything ready beforehand...old towel on counter, cotton swabs just in case, small damp rag--just in case. I saw a suggestion to use those tiny 2-inch flossing brushes instead of the applicators they send. That is the BEST suggestion and I endorse wholeheartedly! I used 2. One for Colorant and one for activator--This application (first time) was a Breeze! I actually did it twice on my lashes--upper and lower and got really beautiful results! Then I thought-why not try to see if I have eyebrows up there?- and ended up with eyebrows again!! I&#x27;m a bit older so my brows have really lightened up and thinned out--but for 2 years I&#x27;ve used Beauty Lash and went from literally &#x27;sparse stubs&#x27; for eyelashes to getting them for the first time in my life! (I wore false lashes all thru high school in the 70&#x27;s! Told u I was older! &amp;Uuml; ) I&#x27;ve used the lash growth on the brows as well, for all those new pretty, long lashes and brows grow in -white!&lt;br /&gt;So here I am, happy to have these lovely dark lashes and brows~and though it&#x27;s not quite the same effect as adding mascara--I feel pretty again!!&lt;br /&gt;This product is worth the money and it will last a very long time~ which makes it worth it&#x27;s weight in gold for me!</li>
            <li> Very good, easy to use and gives long-lasting result. Much better experience  then dying my lashes in the salon. Cheaper,too!</li>
            <li> I bought this to save $$ on eyelash tinting at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not terribly hard to put on with a mirror, vaseline, and the skin shields. The time and effort didn&#x27;t bother me. However, it stings like a MOTHERF*CKER going on, it stings being washed off, and my eyes stung after! I&#x27;m not at ALL someone with sensitive skin, and I&#x27;ve never had that reaction all the times getting my eyelashes dyed at the salon. Do they just package black tar in a tube and sell it as this stuff? Holy Mary, mother of God!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the results lasted barely two weeks. I really, REALLY wanted this to work. I&#x27;m much rather do this myself at home. Great price, too! Still have my box, not going through that again. I&#x27;ll just hit the salon to avoid this possible blindness. And I&#x27;m not close to rich. But GEEEZ LOUISE, kittens, I have my limits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kthanxbai!</li>
            <li> lasts about 4-6 weeks, easy to use. I&#x27;ve gotten pretty good at it. I just moistion my lashes using the qtip and then put on the activator - it&#x27;s instant black eyelashes!</li>
            <li> This product is great! I can see why some would give 1 star though because it&#x27;s hard to apply!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend NOT using the applicator brush provided but to use dentek easy brush cleaners (toothbrush aisle) to apply. They are small and have bristles and they coat the eyelashes great.&lt;br /&gt;Then make sure lashes are clean and dry. Apply step one. I do my right eye then left but I apply to both eyes first before applying the activator. This gives it time to set. I apply step one twice to each eye and wait about 2 minutes before step 2. Then apply the activator the same way as in step 1. I do right eye first then left then repeat. Upper first then lower lashes.  I let it sit on for 2 minutes or so then I wash off. If you get some in your skin around the eye use a qtip to take it off immediately or it will stain. I do not use vasoline around my eyes because if it gets on your lashes the dye will not take. I sometimes repeat this process in 2 days for darker lashes. I think repeating right away is a waste because your lashes may be wet still and won&#x27;t take the tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your lashes will only get tinted. It&#x27;s not going to be super drastic. I have light eyelashes and they turn black using this but no additional volume or length. They appear fuller because I try to he every little lash that I can find. I really like how my lashes look once it&#x27;s done. I would reapply every 2 weeks vs every 28 days to keep the darkness around.</li>
            <li> ordered  this item for a freind she liked very much and she said would order again if nee be shipping is always on time thanks so much</li>
            <li> Boy, does this stuff burn!  I&#x27;ve used several eyelash tints and this one was just awful!  It burns the eyes, even there is no harm and it says it&#x27;s a &#x27;natural&#x27; product, I had to wash off almost immediately, so it did not work for tinting at all!  There are better products out there!</li>
            <li> I have short brown lashes and it really didn&#x27;t make a difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;Hard to apply because they are so short.</li>
            <li> This product is good for someone (like me) who has blonde eyelashes and wants to darken them so you can go without makeup (like at the beach or pool) and still have some lashes. The name is misleading, so if you already have dark lashes don&#x27;t waste your money, it is not a substitute for mascara since it doesn&#x27;t thicken lashes at all.  It takes a bit of practice to put it on without creating much staining around the eyes.  So don&#x27;t do this right before you are going to a party or something.  The first time I used it I got a bit of staining (like wide eyeliner) around my eyes which looked o.k. with makeup and went away a day later.  The next time I was more careful using the comb (enclosed) and a disposable clean (can get at beauty supply places) mascara wand and it worked better.  If you curl your lashes afterwards with a eyelash curler, your lashes will look more pronounced.</li>
            <li> If you have blonde eye lashes , this product works great .. I wear glasses so i would use a magnifying mirror, kind of awkward , but it only takes a few minutes to do. I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile and I still miss some eye lashes , you can re do them again ....When all is done, lashes last a good 3 - 4 weeks before next app......This product does not thicken or lengthen lashes , it just darkens them....</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and ahead of schedule, in good condition.  I am waiting to use this when we go on vacation.  I was happy with the price too.</li>
            <li> Nice to have it  at home, ...elaborate usage</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had to wear mascara since December!  This is amazing and so easy to apply!  It really does last a long time.  Honestly, if it only lasted a week, it&#x27;s worth it!  Not having to apply mascara daily has been priceless!!!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly.  I even applied the tint twice as instructed.  I could not tell any difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I found this product really easy to use. Lasted 28 days or more possibly for my lashes. One box is close to how much doing it twice at the salon costs.&lt;br /&gt;The few negatives I have dont really affect the rating I gave it.&lt;br /&gt;For one I threw away the little pads, I dont really need them, i just put a little vaseline around my eyes, if i get it on my skin it wipes right up with a cotton swab. So I guess for me they&#x27;re a little useless addition that i still pay for.&lt;br /&gt;Two the applicator broke when i was cleaning it but I found out disposable mascara applicators work better, they might waste a little more product though.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think my experiences with this product were good and i find the product is worthy of 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This product does not work. Tried it 4 times and it added very little, if any color. Followed the directions exactly. Also, when trying to remove, although I was very careful, it irritated all the skin around my eyes. Tried to return, and seller said they did not do returns, so it was a total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read several reviews about how this product did not work for the reviewer and, I must say, I&#x27;m puzzled. I have blonde lashes and not very many to boot, but after using this product, I can at least see them! I gave up using the protector pads and just use vaseline. I think part of the problem is if you get too much Vaseline, it prevents your lashes from getting the dye on them. I do one eye at a time, keeping it closed, so I&#x27;m dying the top and the bottom at the same time. This worked better than trying to do the top and the bottom separately--that&#x27;s when the stuff got in my eye. But even when it did, I just ran cold water over my eye, and all was well. It is simple to do the bottom lashes, so doing a double application for them is not a big deal and may be necessary. So, in a nutshell, the product  works, but you have to be careful with the Vaseline, keep your eye closed and maybe do a double application to your bottom lashes.</li>
            <li> This product worked on me but I had to do the application many times to get the desired results. It was a little messy but nothing that was too hard to deal with.</li>
            <li> This product works just like a level 2 hair dye, except for your eyelashes and eyebrows. It was very fast and easy to use - the containers and applicators make sure none of the product is wasted (and there is enough product for many uses). Your eyelashes turn as stay instantly dark for at least 2-4 weeks. The color does NOT run. However, it is good to note in no way does it look like mascara. If you have thin eyelashes or medium-colored eyelashes already, you will not notice much difference.</li>
            <li> After three uses I still did not have any color on my lashes.  Read all the possible ways to apply...did not matter...it just does not tint the lashes!</li>
            <li> I saw no difference when I dyed my eyelashes. Delivery was good. I would not order it again. I will give it another try to see of the color stays on it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work on darker lashes! Even after repeated applications I saw no difference. The dye came right off after one wash.</li>
            <li> if your single and cant see up close don&#x27;t buy it!!! If you miss its very permanent and since I cant see very well I didn&#x27;t know I had missed until later. Not recommend that you do it to yourself.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product a year ago (2011).  Back then, the box contained q-tip like cotton applicators, a glass bottle with clear liquid (that goes on first), and a tube of black gel (goes on second).  I used a mascara wand I bought separately as well.  I had no problem using the old box, it never got my lashes very black, but enough that it made a difference so I felt I didn&#x27;t need to wear mascara to the gym.  I never got any stains on my skin, and I never used the under eye pads with the vaseline-not necessary.  Once you put on the gel the color sets immediately and you wash it off with water in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;Now, a year later (2012), I received a box as a gift, the box looks the same on the outside, but the contents inside are totally different.  The new box contains 2 differently shaped plastic applicators (a comb type and a plain stick type), and then the black gel you put on first, and then a clear gel you put on second.  It comes with more instructions this time, but the photos are so small, I can&#x27;t tell which applicator you&#x27;re supposed to use.  I guess you choose. This new formula is much messier and totally DID NOT WORK!  I tried 3 times, but saw virtually no difference to my lashes.  I followed the instructions to a T, and I have a very steady hand and am good at fine motor skills.  It also took me a lot longer.  I even tried it with the pads underneath, but they didn&#x27;t stay in place, so the dye from my lower lashes got absorbed by the cotton pad, then it shifted around and got the dye underneath and below my lower lashes (luckily the dye came off my skin.)  Also with this new kind, you have to wait a minute or so for the second gel to set.  Other difference is now you wipe it off with a wet kleenex, instead of washing in the sink.  Every time I tried I ended up with stains on my fingers, guess I should have worn gloves.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would not buy this again since they changed their formula.  Used to work, now it doesn&#x27;t.  Time to find a different brand, or have a professional do it for me at the salon.rand, or have a professional do it for me at the salon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my eyelashes dyed at the salon in the past - but wanted to dye the top lashes only - so I thought I&#x27;d try it at home.  Doing just one eye at a time - I put a thin layer of vaseline on my lid and under the bottom lashes  - and used the cotton eye pad that was included to protect under my eye.  I probably will skip the eye pad next time - I didn&#x27;t get any drips anywhere and it feels so uncomfortable - tugging at the skin every time I move!  I did use little dental brushes as other reviewers have mentioned - and those seemed to work well.  I did not goop too much on at once - worrying about getting it in my eye.  I probably did not get it as close to the roots as I would have liked - but my problem area is the tips of my eyelashes - where they are so blonde that they are invisible.  Although I&#x27;ve only used it once - I did not get any in my eye while applying it.  When rinsing with warm water - I did feel a brief stinging in each eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When done - my lashes were uniformly dark - I used the \\&quot;black\\&quot; shade - and it wasn&#x27;t as dark as my salon tint had been - but looks nice and natural.  I would suspect that unless you have really light lashes - this won&#x27;t do much for you - and it certainly doesn&#x27;t add volume as a mascara would.  Overall - I am pleased and will continue to use this - great for those days when I want to skip make-up - my eyelashes are now visible!</li>
            <li> I found this product difficult to use. first you have to paste on the eye shields with petroleum jelly that you have to get yourself, the eye shields are very large and need to be cut and still make it hard to open your eyes then you have to put on one product which then stings your eyes so its even harder to open your eyes, then you have to put the dye on with a q tip. overall for very little darkening of the eye lashes and a lot of cleaning up and your eyes stinging for 5 minutes i would not get this again, nor requemend it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;like so many other reviewers said, it&#x27;s best to use a mascara brush (I was able to avoid staining my skin that way) and it takes a little practice if you&#x27;ve never dyed your lashes before. I have pale blonde lashes, and my lower ones/the fine lashes in the corners of my eyes didn&#x27;t take very well on the first try. However, the kit does say you may need 2 applications the first time. I have red hair and very fair skin, and I find that black looks the best - thick black mascara looks too harsh on me, but as this is just a dye, it has a soft look, doesn&#x27;t thicken or clump like mascara. I love waking up looking like I&#x27;ve done my eyes!</li>
            <li> I am Latina with dark lashes. I was hoping to get a real rich charcoal black color. I really didn&#x27;t see any difference. This will work good if your lashes are of a brown color or less. As for the application, it went on as described (plus I watched a video online for more info). Use the Vaseline to keep it from dyeing your skin and getting the white sheet to stick, but really make sure you don&#x27;t get any on the lashes. As some have suggested, use those small dental brushes for braces (the dollar stores carry them sometimes) to apply, they help.</li>
            <li> Thank you for having a product that is easy to do for my light eye lashes. I purchased this product because I was going to be a new mom and knew that it would be hard to always put on mascara. Without mascara I look much younger and tired. This has been great and lasts at least two months on my lashes!</li>
            <li> Just not for me! There were too many precautions and your eyes are too important to be trying unsafe products.</li>
            <li> This product does not work very well on eye lashes - I followed the instructions to the letter, but notice only a minimal change in colour - not nearly as dark as other products.</li>
            <li> I have used this item twice and it is a little messy and I get it in my eyes. It does not hurt but I just can&#x27;t get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> A little hard to use.  I&#x27;m sure I will get better as time goes on. I did get some color though.  Hard to get it close to the lash line.  For me though anything is better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I love Godefroy&#x27;s eyebrow tint, so I decided to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my lashes tinted at salons many times over the years, and this product can provide salon-quality results...but it may take you a few tries to get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I shied away from applying the recommended petroleum jelly (based on other reviewer comments). For me, that was a mistake as I ended up with some staining in the lower corner of my eyes, which took about 5 days to fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used it, I applied a bit of petroleum jelly beneath my lower lashes only, and I left on each tint for 4 minutes (versus the 1 minute recommended on the box). Next time, I&#x27;ll bump up the time a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t replace mascara for work or going out...but it does add a nice bit of color that frames my eyes when I&#x27;m not wearing any makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have mentioned DO NOT TRY TO DO THIS IN A RUSH! Give yourself at least 30 minutes, more time is even better.</li>
            <li> We have tried to use this tint kit for eyelashes once and were not completely impressed with the outcome. Maybe we will keep trying and hopefully with practice we will finally get a better result.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and awesome results. Def would purchase again! I&#x27;ve tried other products that irritated too much.  This was great</li>
            <li> this tint just doesn&#x27;t do the job. It&#x27;s more like a light stain. At least it does not irritate the eye at all though.</li>
            <li> I have dark lashes but the tips are very light.  So I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting it all the way down next to the eyelid, I can just sweep it over the tips and, presto, my lashes look longer.  I also use it for my eyebrows which are sparse and basically a mess from over plucking.  The first time was a disaster.  I looked like Groucho Marx for 3 days, but there was promise in the fact that it also dyed my skin. By the third time I had learned to use it very carefully(within a mask of Vaseline)  to draw on eyebrows exactly like I was putting on eyebrow pencil.  They look great -- better than drawn on with pencil, actually -- and the dye lasts for several days before it comes off the skin. Even after that the brows look thicker because the gray and colorless hairs stay dyed until they fall out. So although the &amp;#34;permanent pencil&amp;#34; look fades, it is wonderful for a weekend trip.  This is my favorite never-be-without beauty product.</li>
            <li> This product really does work darkening lighter hairs, but every person we tried it on had the unwanted side effect of dye runoff into the skin. To be fair, the product admits this could be an issue and advises pads and oil barriers, but that hinders the application&#x27;s effectiveness to a degree.</li>
            <li> It took me a couple weeks to try this (I was afraid it would be messy after reading other reviews), but I was very happy after I finally tried it last night. I followed the instructions, almost, to a T. After reading other reviews I bought some dental picks to use as applicators, not the kind for flossing, the kind with the tiny comb. I think they were $2.00 for 150. I was careful with the petroleum jelly and the eye guards, but it turned out I didn&#x27;t really need them, it didn&#x27;t make a mess at all. The only slightly messy part happened when I first punctured the tube of colorant, but I was expecting that, so I had a hand towel ready.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not mascara, it won&#x27;t make your lashes look like you&#x27;re wearing mascara. If you put it on carefully it makes your lashes completely black and natural looking. It does have a little bit of a lengthening effect because most lashes are lighter at the tip, and this colors the entire lash.</li>
            <li> I like this product works better on eyebrow but 50/50 on eyelash.... It was easy to apply..  you have to be careful can be messy. Be patience I kept it on my eyebrow &amp; eyelash more than 30mins&lt;br /&gt; Yes I would recommend this product :-)</li>
            <li> Even when applied carefully, the color coverage is poor. Not what I consider permanent either, and would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This really works and lasts!  My only wish is it would make my skinny lashes fatter!  I only noticed the slightest of irritation to my eyes that evening and I did repeat and put two coats on.</li>
            <li> 28 day mascara was extremly difficult to use, very messy, and the end result was not what I expected.  I will not continue to try to use this product and will never refer it to anyone I know.[[ASIN:B008USICDG Godefroy 28 Day Mascara Permanent Eyelash and Eyebrow Tint Kit Singles Black]][[ASIN:B008USICDG Godefroy 28 Day Mascara Permanent Eyelash and Eyebrow Tint Kit Singles Black]]</li>
            <li> Would not recommend to anyone. I tried using the product according to directions and it made no difference with the way my lashes looked.</li>
            <li> This does a pretty good job of making my lashes darker. Probably lasts close to the 4 weeks as advertised. Easy to use and I don&#x27;t need the crescent pads underneath. I like waking up in the morning and looking good!</li>
            <li> This product does not work. I tried it twice, followed directions very carefully. DID NOTHING. Do not waste your money on this product</li>
            <li> I cannot wear mascara due to allergies- I am allergic to everything!  I was going to a salon for eyelash tinting but I became frustrated because I never got the same technician. Some would be careful not to get the hydrogen peroxide on my skin and others would not meaning I would have a headache .  Some were careless and I worried about my eyes.  I thought about doing it myself&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 28 day mascara is easy to use at home and does NOT contain peroxide.  I started by trying to use the shields that come with it and could not.  I tried the glasses that turn down ( I am farsighted) and that didn&#x27;t work.  Finally I decided to just \\&quot;do it\\&quot;  I use a brush and apply the gel and dye to the tips of my lashes (with my eyes open).  I apply the gel twice and the dye once finishing one eye completely before moving to the next.  Doing the tips creates the effect of dark lashes without going near my skin.  I try to be careful and protect my eyes but a couple of times I have gotten the gel on the lower lid.  I used a damp Qtip to remove and had no problems although I do not recommend getting it in the eye. .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My feeling is that it is pretty safe.  As others have said , you have to be careful not to contaminate the two products with one another so you may go through numerous Q-tips or brushes.  This is my solution to not being able to wear mascara- also there is no flaking, smearing, or racoon eyes like many non allergic mascaras.&lt;br /&gt;I high recommend.</li>
            <li> my lashes look no different and my skin is completely stained. I can&#x27;t leave the house like this! Do not buy this item! It&#x27;s terrible!</li>
            <li> I just dyed my eyelashes using this product with good results.  Some people complained about having trouble with the applicator but I didn&#x27;t have any problems with it.  You have to be careful, of course, but it wasn&#x27;t that hard to use.  If you can apply mascara, you can use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE CAREFUL opening the tube of colorant.  The only problem I had was that when I opened the first tube, it spurted out a little.  No harm, but it wasted a bit of the product and could have stained something if I had not opened over a paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product - I can&#x27;t wear mascara, so I am happy to have dark lashes again.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me, I followed instructions but did not make much of a difference in the color of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t expect to like this product, but I thought I&#x27;d order it and give it a try.  Once you get the hang of it, the application is so easy!  It does take a few applications to achieve the desired color, but I honestly don&#x27;t mind.  I just do one eye, then the other, and then go back to the other, etc.  It takes me about 30 minutes. If you go to YouTube and search this product, Godefroy has a video tutorial showing exactly how to apply it, and it&#x27;s extremely helpful.&lt;br /&gt;Using this product is so much cheaper than going to a salon...I used to spend $50.00 to get my eyelashes and eyebrows dyed, and the products at the salon burned my skin a bit.  I have experienced no irritation whatsoever with Godefroy.  I use the black for my eyelashes and the dark brown for my eyebrows.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It will darken your lashes.  Enough that you can go without mascara?  Probably not.  But for anyone with blonde or redhead eyelashes, this is a Godsend.</li>
            <li> Did not tint my blonde eyelashes in the slightest, even after leaving on for 20 minutes. I have been tinting my own eyelashes for over 10 years with other products so am familiar with the process. Would like a company rep to explain the ratio of color tint to developer in case the description included produced the wrong ratio. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DID NOT WORK FOR ME. IT STUNG MY EYES AND IT DID NOTHING TO MY EYE LASHES. I HAVE VERY LIGHT ALMOST BLONDE EYE LASHES.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was terrified to actually try this stuff but I&#x27;m SOOO happy I gave it a go.  First, do yourself a favor and dont use the applicator stick that it comes with...just trash it trust me.  I used two different mascara brushes that I cleaned up from old mascara tubes I had laying around.  Make sure you get them clean, like soap and water clean!&lt;br /&gt;Next, clean your face and eye area with soap and water so your natural oils wont hinder the dye.&lt;br /&gt;Next tip that I learned quickly, DONT use the pads they give you for the under eye.  Just apply a layer of petroleum jelly under your eyes and down to the tops of your cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;Follow the directions, squeeze a little bit from tube 1 onto the designated &amp;#34;brush 1&amp;#34; and apply liberally to eye lashes like you would mascara.  Wait for 1 min.  then squeeze some of the gel from tube 2 onto designated &amp;#34;brush 2&amp;#34;.  wait another min and go wash your eyelashes off with warm water.  I suggest wiping away the petroleum jelly first because it kinda gets in the way when you try to remove the gel from your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;Only do one eye at a time! and wash the brushes with soap and water between each eye application or it will get messy and ultimately will ruin the process for you.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted mine pretty dark so I completed the process twice and am very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> I have light blonde hair and my eyelashes are light brown to blonde in spots. This makes them dark and look fuller by catching every little hair and making them dark.</li>
            <li> I bought this for me and my stepmom who always goes to get her lashes tinted and we both tried it. I didn&#x27;t have a problem doing it I just didn&#x27;t notice a difference, my stepmom had a problem keeping it off her skin and hands and then it did stain for days!!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this before and I do like it but I ordered black and I received brown. My lashes are dark anyway so it didn&#x27;t really matter. I&#x27;ll order it again when I run out hopefully I&#x27;ll get black next time.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I recently decided to stop wearing all makeup as an experiment to save time, money, and to experiment with why society promotes women who are \\&quot;perfect.\\&quot; I did a two week challenge and have decided to not wear makeup again except for special occasions like family holidays. I did want something to enhance my lashes and make them standout more---I&#x27;m a white girl so my lashes are blondish/gingerish. This was super easy to use and my lashes came out a nice black shade and it appears that I have some type of mascara on. I did leave it on longer than it says to, it recommends 1 minute, but I did 3 mins. It does burn if you get it in your eye, but not horribly. Overall I am very pleased with this and whenever I run out will most definitely purchase again! It&#x27;s also a great deal--at Sally&#x27;s Beauty they have a different brand for $45!!! So $18 is practically a steal!</li>
            <li> This is a simple process to tint my eyelashes and has great lasting quality.  It saves me money doing the tint myself instead of paying salon prices for eyelash tinting.</li>
            <li> Just used this product for the first time. Easy to apply. Colored my light brown lashes to black and hopefully will keep the color for the 28 days as advertised. Great for summer if you don&#x27;t want to use mascara every day in the heat.</li>
            <li> I am about to put in my request to become a spokes person for this product- right after I order a couple boxes of it to stock up on it in case Godefroy reads all the negative reviews on this page and discontinues it.&lt;br /&gt;I have nordic blond eyelashes and when I don&#x27;t have mascara on it appears I have no eyelashes. Then I tried Godefroy and now boom problem solved. It&#x27;s not mascara, it doesn&#x27;t add thickness or length, but since I hardly wear makeup it was perfect for me, because it looks so natural and you don&#x27;t have to reapply it everyday, worry about smudging or taking it off at night.&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t figure out how a single person had issues with the application process. I have it down to an art now though&lt;br /&gt;1. take a shower and wash around eyes&lt;br /&gt;2. circle eyes in copious amount of chapstick trying to get close to the lash line but not get chapstick on it.&lt;br /&gt;3. skip the white pad things ( just wipe off mistakes ASAP- if you have enough chapstick around your eyes you can do this with your finger.&lt;br /&gt;4. Keep eyes open and CAREFULLY apply the black- then wait a minute and add clear- then wait a minute and wipe it all off with wet rag. I do lower lashes first to keep the chapstick coating on my top lashes intact.&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ve gotten to the point of doing both my lower lashes at the same time and then both my upper lashes at the same time making this whole process post shower about five-ten minutes long)</li>
            <li> My experience with this product is that it DOES work and lasts for an entire month, but that’s where the pros end. The cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The instructions make the application process sound easy, but if your experience is anything like mine you will get frustrated with the under-eye pads, which come loose easily even when they are coated in Vaseline. The application wand that comes in the package is hardly an effective tool to apply the product, and it is difficult to avoid staining your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The effects are not comparable to true mascara. I have found that even when my lashes have been dyed twice, I cannot achieve the same dramatic effect as I would with volumizing mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, this product is a great back-up plan - if you sleep in one morning and don&#x27;t have time to apply makeup, at least you won&#x27;t look completely washed out.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have ordered once before and was impressed enough to order again. I do a lot of outdoor activities, scuba diving, fishing, boating and I am a nurse.  It makes life so much easier not having to use mascara...don&#x27;t get me wrong I still use it on occasion, but for being on the go it is great especially for light colored lashes. Took a couple times to get the application down, but gets much easier.</li>
            <li> Easy to use as long as you follow directions carefully.  3 weeks and my eyelashes are still black.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> The reason I sought out a product like this is because I am going to have Lasik surgery and I will be unable to wear makeup. Yes, I am that vain - I&#x27;m okay with admitting that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only applied one application so far. I&#x27;m about two weeks in and still going strong. I have strawberry blonde hair so my lashes are super light. With this in mind, I did apply the lash tint two times. I could tell after the first application, however, the ends of the lashes still seemed pretty light. After the second, it was darker and much better. It still is not as dark as it would be with mascara, however, I am comfortable enough to go without mascara now. I didn&#x27;t use Vaseline or the under eye guides that it came with. I was just careful and basically treated it like it was mascara. I used the applicator it came with - this is not really easy to use, but I made it work. A x10 mirror helps a lot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point I got a little too comfortable with the application and managed to poke myself in the eye...oops! Nothing happened. I wiped it off my eye and kept going. I didn&#x27;t feel any stinging throughout any part of the process. So far I&#x27;m very happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I am giving it four stars is because I had to apply a second application and I haven&#x27;t made it through the 28 days to verify it would last that long. However, based on how things are going, I&#x27;d say there is a very good chance it would.</li>
            <li> I have light eyelashes and always preferred putting on mascara before I left the house. With this tint kit I only put on mascara when I am dressing up a bit. Learning how to apply the dye without getting it all over took me a few months, but now I can dye my lashes in about 15 minutes. I dye them about two weeks and usually other people can&#x27;t tell whether I am wearing mascara or not. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I really liked this, I have light blonde eyelashes and I always have to put on a lot of mascara to cover them up so I was really excited for this :)it doesn&#x27;t cover quite enough to be able to go completely without mascara but that might just be my own personal prefferance, it has really shortened up my makeup routine though :)</li>
            <li> Easy &amp; great product, a dream come true for gals or guys with light eyelashes. I love this product &amp; will continue to purchase. Comes with everything you need.</li>
            <li> This product is quite easy to use. You don&#x27;t even need the under eye guards. My eyelashes are already kind of dark so I didn&#x27;t see too much difference but I accidentally got bleach on my eyebrow while doing my hair and I used this to darken that spot and it worked great. I don&#x27;t understand why some people have so much trouble. It didn&#x27;t stain my skin either I just wiped it off right away. It won&#x27;t give that mascara look but it you hate black mascara like I do you can use this then use a clear mascara to get the wet look.</li>
            <li> This is a lot of effort with minimal results.  I have light brown lashes and did two applications (labor intensive) and the difference is negligible.</li>
            <li> I am a professional and this was just a waste of money and time. It was very messy and the color came right off....would not recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and purchased it again.  It is super easy and the color lasts a long time and also give my lashes body.  I like the applicators and also that you just squeeze a tube, no mixing needed.</li>
            <li> This product is nearly impossible to use. The applicators included are worthless. I spent more time trying to get the product off my skin than getting the product on my eyelashes. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this product because I have a LOT of lashes but I&#x27;m blonde so all my hair is blonde and doesn&#x27;t show up.  Well, I ran home when I got it all excited to use it and put it on.  It&#x27;s very hard to put on and I used my own mascara wand. (I buy clear ones to dye my eyebrows)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did exactly what the directions suggested and rinsed my lashes afterward.  They are darker but I can barely tell ... I will do them again tomorrow and see if that helps.. but I can barely tell.</li>
            <li> I  tired it  3 time  my eyelashes  never  got  darker however  where I got  some on  my finger nail it dyed it just  fine!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and took them into consideration before ordering the lash dye. Here&#x27;s my experience. After reading the directions, I slathered on vaseline and glued the eye shields to my face. Then I doused my (sparce) lashes with the activator. I was really confident at this point that I was on the road to success. What it doesn&#x27;t mention in the directions, and would have been VERY helpful to me is: the gel colorant will bring tears to your eyes and stings like the dickens! Had the directions warned me (I&#x27;m sure the reviews did), I would have proceeded with more caution. Instead, moving full speed ahead, I was in a lot of pain during the dying part of the procedure. I did not end up with lashes like the ad displays, but I must admit that all two dozen of the lashes I have turned black. Next time - and I will try at least one more time - I will be VERY CAREFUL in the application of the gel colorant. Also, I won&#x27;t be so ambitious as to try to color the lower lashes. I think, with care, the upper lashes can be enhanced with this product. (I love the Godefrey brow dye, and apparently you can use this product on your brows as well. I just don&#x27;t want black brows.) I think this product does what it claims to do, but it doesn&#x27;t perform miracles. Your lashes will be darker, but not thicker or longer.</li>
            <li> I have light eyelashes even though I have darker hair. I have a tendency to mess w/my eyes when I am tired and having mascara on them has a negative outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had had my eyelashes tinted professionally in the past and was truely intimidated about performing the process myself. I recently saw a youtube video of someone showing &#x27;how to&#x27; and it looked fairly simple so I figured, why not.&lt;br /&gt;This was so easy, even my 10yr old could have done it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big tip: use Sunstar GUM interdental brushes to apply gel/activator rather than the stick of a applicator that comes in the kit and you&#x27;ll have virtually no mess.</li>
            <li> it works but it takes a long time to get it done right its very frustrating and very messy also</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for dying eyebrows but does next to nothing for eyelashes (at most, my eyelashes look tinted for a couple of days and have the &amp;#34;sand in eye&amp;#34; feel like when you leave mascara on for too long). On eyebrows, it lasts 2-3 weeks. My &amp;#34;hair complexion&amp;#34; is medium brown, on the lighter side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couple tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- You WILL make a mess with this. Make sure any surface is not prone to staining, because it&#x27;s near impossible to get this out.&lt;br /&gt;- Do one eye/brow at a time, let it dry/wash it, before switching to the other eye (yes, common sense, but I thought it was like applying mascara - it&#x27;s not!)</li>
            <li> daughter had a bad experience with this stuf, followed directions but it bled and colored her eye lids and cheeks.  not good, wouldn&#x27;t purchase again</li>
            <li> I have bone white eyelashes and like to dye them black. I used to use the Dylash by Eylure, but they no longer ship to the US so I decided to try this. From the beginning, it was not nearly as good as the Dylash; It was never quite as black and my eyelashes never took the color quite as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application process is a total pain. Instead of mixing the dye and activator together, you have to apply the dye to your lashes first, then the activator. It makes the dying process twice as long, and doesn&#x27;t even do as great of a job. Also, I always had to do the application process two times per application in order to get all the hairs to take the color (the first time you&#x27;d always have some lashes that weren&#x27;t reached/didn&#x27;t take) However, it sufficed because it did make my lashes darker, and it was the only option I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a year (A little does go a long way, at least), and tried to dye my eyelashes tonight. It did not work at all. My guess is that after such a long time, it expires? Although I never had that problem with Dylash. Still, it was the final straw with this product. I spent about an hour trying to dye them and ended up with nothing better than what I started with. Even though I still have a little of the product left, I chucked it in the trash and ordered a different brand (hopefully the next one will work better).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product works okay, and is way better than having white eyelashes, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it if you have another brand or option.</li>
            <li> Wait a minute, I MUST put at leat 1 STAR in order to write a comment?? I would have given 0 stars. I thought I was a good candidate for this product...I have permanent eyeliner (willing to try something new), I have brown hair (recommended - my lashes are light brown), I&#x27;m great at following directions (Straight A&#x27;s lol...). The only thing that got tinted was a spot on my hand which I rinsed off....</li>
            <li> I know it is going to be messy--and I know it really works--I still give 5 stars--even though I have not used it yet--thanks</li>
            <li> I wish I had discovered this years ago!!! I always had a problem of my mascara running and settling in under my eyes by the end of the day. Only waterproof mascara solved this but it was so harsh on my lashes I ended up losing some. This is fantastic!! I was super nervous about staining and getting it all over the place. Well that wasn&#x27;t a problem on my eyes - but it was a problem on my counter. I have a white corian bathroom counter which now has weird black inkblot stains on it because I wasn&#x27;t careful enough with the product. Make sure you cover your counters when you use this. But in terms of my eyelashes - they worked on my blonde/light brown lashes and I no longer have black circles under my eyes. I will definitely keep using this.</li>
            <li> I am a brunette, so the box did warn me that it would probably only dye the tips.  My eyelashes are brown, but the tips and bottom lashes are blond.  However, after following instructions for 2 sessions of 2 minutes each, I noticed no change.  I applied a third application and left on for 20 minutes--way longer than the suggested time.  The lashes are still light on the tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice very mild irritation of the skin, and that&#x27;s the only thing I got out of it.  My recommendation is for brunettes to not bother with this product.  I did follow instructions of not getting petroleum jelly on lashes, cleaned the applicator off before applying and etc.  This dye is just not strong enough to dye my lashes.</li>
            <li> The lash tint effect is minimal...hardly worth the effort it takes to apply.  I would not buy the product again.</li>
            <li> Product is hard to get on your eyelashes.  Takes a lot of time, and I noticed no difference after I had applied it 3 times. Wouldn&#x27;t waste my money again.</li>
            <li> This stuff does a great job of tinting my very blonde eyelashes, but be prepared to take some time to do this right.  It is a bit difficult to get to the base of your lashes without getting it all over you, especially the bottom lashes.  It works though, so overall I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.  It does &#x27;TINT&#x27; the eyelashes, however, I was expecting it to be more of a mascara.  There is no fullness to the lashes only slight color.</li>
            <li> This product is a rip off. I used for several weeks and it did not deliver results as advertised. Lashes remained thin as before I used.  Hard to apply.</li>
            <li> I ordered black and received brown--I can hardly tell I used it at all and I put it on twice.</li>
            <li> got here quick and is just as it said. works great I&#x27;m pleased got it quick too very happy Thanks</li>
            <li> A little hard at first to get used to using, but I am getting better, and know I like it. Definitely love it on my eyebrows!</li>
            <li> I applied this product per the instructions and only have to apply daily mascara sparingly. IT REALLY WORKS! You will not be disappointed. It is much better than the professional product I have used for years.</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and this is great because you can see my eyelashes even when I am not wearing mascara (which is pretty much all the time).  I can&#x27;t believe I went the first 30 years of my life without dying my eyelashes!  I like to use the applicator they sent with the kit.  I tried using a disposable mascara wand one time and it seemed to just waste the dye.  I apply like mascara to both sets of lashes on both eyes.  Wait a couple minutes.  The apply the deactivator creme #2 and wash my face and it is done.  I got better at it after a few times. I only have to dye once a month and at this rate the kit should last a couple years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: this does not make it look like you are wearing mascara, but for those blondes out there we can look like dark-haired people do when they aren&#x27;t wearing eye-makeup.</li>
            <li> This was an awful mess and didn&#x27;t make my blonde eyelashes any better. They were just slightly darker for about 2 days. Too much trouble for that.</li>
            <li> So I read some of the other reviews and what had/hadnt worked for others, so I tried a few different approaches but, I found that the applicator in the package was really the best tool. In the directions it says \\&quot;apply to top of lashes\\&quot; I tried applying it like mascara and got piss-poor results so I did exactly what the directions said and found it was far superior to any other way, what a concept haha! I am a red head, to the fullest extent, I have bright copper red hair, freckles (not too many just the right amount if you ask me) and damn near clear eyelashes and brows. I refuse to leave my house or let my friends see me without even a little mascara and brow powder. This made me feel more comfortable in my own skin, I don&#x27;t look so ghostly anymore, and it really is lasting. I keep thinking it&#x27;ll just wash off but it doesn&#x27;t. Love this stuff and I will forever use it.&lt;br /&gt;Couple of tips: apply to the top&lt;br /&gt;Do one eye at a time, think of it like a 4 section process, do the top lash, then bottom, then move to the next eye and repeat the process.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t try to do all your lashes at the same time, if you have really light lashes I reccomend leaving it on for more like 2min.&lt;br /&gt;I use an old mascara wand for the corners I feel didn&#x27;t get thorough application with the wand. It will burn your eyes if you get the activator in it, but a warm wash cloth will wipe it away and it isn&#x27;t a lasting burn (I learned the hard way). I avoided that issue by doing it one section at a time. My mother and best friend are now eager to try it.</li>
            <li> I got the lash tint in black, it is not as dark as the lash tint I usually get at the beauty school for ten bucks, It does not seem to last as long either. I have reddish hair and naturally light brown lashes. I have used this product three times, I will probably finish using the remainder, it does seem to have the 25 applications it promises. the last two times I applied it I left it on for a good 5 min. to see if I could get a darker result, it helped maybe a little. Another draw back is the two step process, you apply the colorant to the lashes first then the activator, each time having to make sure you get every lash root to tip. Why not mix the colorant and activator before you put it on the lashes and just apply once? I would not buy this product again unless they have a darker black, as is the result was not worth the time and hassle. (I was very careful to make sure my lashes were clean and dry)</li>
            <li> A little pricey but it does the trick. I&#x27;m 55 and still have pretty good eyelashes. I can use this and not have to wear mascara. Easy to use. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Using this was very messy, and it was mostly washed off in one day. Disappointing, because I wanted to like it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blonde, so my lashes are very light and look non-existent without mascara. They are also very fine. This didn&#x27;t help with the \\&quot;fine\\&quot; issue, but the darker color is nice. I wanted my lashes colored so that when I&#x27;m at the beach or pool, or just getting up in the morning, you can at least tell that I have eyes. It is not a dramatic difference, but it is a difference.  You can notice the difference more if you curl your lashes. If you expect this to help with length and thickness, you will be disappointed. Also, if you already have dark lashes, I don&#x27;t think you would see a benefit from using this.&lt;br /&gt;  Application was easier than I expected. I didn&#x27;t get any in my eyes or stain the area around my eyes. The pads that came with it to go under your eyes felt odd and got in the way, so I took them off and was fine without them. I put a moderate coating of petroleum jelly above and below my eyes and that did the trick. When I would get some of the black gel in the wrong spot, it was easily removed with a cotton swab. I used cotton swabs and the enclosed applicators, but for next time I&#x27;m going to buy some of those braces cleaners that look like miniature mascara brushes. I repeated the process for my top lashes right away because I didn&#x27;t get all the lashes the first time. This helped ensure that almost every lash was colored. This was quick and easy to use, so I can see myself using it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This is a good one. It is tricky to use, will take a few times to get right. I have my own gloves, I recommend getting some at the local drug store in the correct size, will help a lot. A little got into my eyes and burned a lot the first time which then bled onto my skin but no blindness and no staining so as long as you use the Vaseline as directed you will be ok. My eyelashes did stay tinted for weeks, it was nice, I liked it.</li>
            <li> Does not last 28 days as promised.&lt;br /&gt;Apply like mascara - will work much better.&lt;br /&gt;So, I have to repeat every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> I was paying twice this much for one eyelash dye job at a salon, this works as good or better than those.</li>
            <li> I tried this because I can&#x27;t be bothered to do more than a powder foundation most mornings... and I really liked it! I applied it with a clean mascara brush, per another positive review, and it worked great. I have long lashes that are generally blonde-ish, and this worked great to add a little color.</li>
            <li> This did the trick so I need not wear mascara in Mexico easy to do works great and lasts</li>
            <li> I did not find that it made a lot of difference for me.  My lashes are already dark brown so perhaps it was naive of me to expect any more than what I got.  I decided to try it before going backpacking being so my face wouldn&#x27;t look totally naked, but it still did.  It certainly doesn&#x27;t take the place of mascara, which thickens and lengthens.  I  didn&#x27;t use it on my eyebrows, as black would be too dark.  I do use the Godefroy Brown Eyebrow tint regularly and love it.  While the lash tint was almost imperceptible and lasted maybe a week, I find that tinting my brows lasts about 6 weeks and defines and perfects them.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot.  It actually did color my lashes black and it lasted a month as advertised.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Ok. I read all the reviews before purchasing this product. I don&#x27;t know why some found it so difficult .&lt;br /&gt;I have blonde lashes and have been getting them tinted at salons now for 30 years. Unlike a  day spa where you wait 15 mins with your eyes closed for the color to take , this takes minutes.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best product and easy to use if you take your time and have a magnifying mirror.&lt;br /&gt;I did not use the paper eye protectors, as one size fits nobody. I put a thin layer of Vaseline on my eyelids with a Q tip, careful not to smear it on my lashes. This prevents the dye from coloring your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I did the lower lashes first on one eye. You paint the color on, wait 1-2 minutes then apply the gel which sets the color. I used a mascara brush to paint on the color and the stick they supplied to apply the gel.&lt;br /&gt;Leave the gel for 1-2 mins and then wipe off with a damp tissue.&lt;br /&gt;If you have missed some lashes or it is not dark enough, you can repeat the process.&lt;br /&gt;It has now been 2 weeks and the color is just as fresh as day one.&lt;br /&gt;I actually think my lashes look thicker than when I had it done by the  esthetician.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I wear contacts and have tried every mascara on the market.  I live in Florida hot and humid.  This product work great.  No racoon eyes.  Last for 3 to 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I wish I had my money back, this product lasted until I washed my face, which was later that same evening.  I would not recommend this product, but oh well, it was worth a shot I guess.</li>
            <li> I have been buyiing this product for quite some time now.  I love it.  Although this last package was the best so far.  The applicators were much easier to use to apply the tint.  Lasts a long time too.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and I haven&#x27;t had any problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;The price is great too !!!</li>
            <li> I have used many lash tint products and this is easier due to the gel consistency. I  used the comb to apply the gel instead of the little sticks. It is easy to get frustrated. I did not cover every lash very well, but it makes a big difference for me . These last tints usually take better the second time. Follow the instructions carefully.  I plan to re tint my lashes and it has been only two weeks but want to see if the color takes better the second time. Very important be have clean lashes, no oils on it. Take your time.</li>
            <li> I have blonde lashes, so I often get them tinted at my salon, but that costs a pretty penny.  So I thought I would try this product.  I read other reviews and did the following:  used inter-dental brushes for the color and activator, they work very well.  Used a magnifying mirror.  Had q-tips on standby for smudges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, it really went pretty well.  My lashes are black.  The upper lashes are better than the lower.  The lower ones are more difficult to tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And here&#x27;s a hint for people that buy this without reading --it is a lash TINT, NOT A MASCARA.  My lashes are tinted, not longer, not fuller.  I&#x27;m still going to wear mascara for those things.  But for everyday, I now have some definition to my eyes with dark lashes, which I like.  It looks like this package will last a long time, so that saves me a bunch of money from salon prices and tips.  All I have to buy are more tiny dental brushes.</li>
            <li> I am a traveling girl living out of a suitcase, so the fact that everything fits into a little zip lock baggie is a major bonus for me! I don&#x27;t bother using the &#x27;drop pads&#x27; they&#x27;re just a nuisance. I just apply it before bedtime, wipe it off - and any residue will be showered of in the morning. No  fuss. It&#x27;s very easy to apply and stays dark for at least 3-4 weeks. So when I wake up in the morning or go to yoga and don&#x27;t feel like putting on make-up, I still look good.</li>
            <li> First, my order arrived much quicker than expected.  The process was a bit messy on the first eye but much less messy on the second.  Once I get the hang of it I&#x27;m confident I will be quicker and less messy.  My lashes and brows look amazing!</li>
            <li> This is garbage! And that&#x27;s where it went! after two failed attempts to get lashes to take the dye. And yes I followed directions!</li>
            <li> Its kinda messy and needs a different applicator. Suggested to reuse at least once a week, for best results use twice weekly.</li>
