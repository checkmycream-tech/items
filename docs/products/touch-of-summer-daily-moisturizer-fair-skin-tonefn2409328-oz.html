            <li>LOVE this lotion!  </li>
            <li>In the morning, I shower the tanning lotion off, and am left with a beautiful, even tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely happy with this lotion and 110% recommend it!  </li>
            <li>I love this self tanner, has a pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t turn you orange</li>
            <li>The lotion&#x27;s gradual color is amazing.</li>
            <li>Smelled nice tho</li>
            <li>It smells really nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re fair</li>
            <li>But after using it for about a week, my tan on  my legs was really nice</li>
            <li>Nice smell, color, and feel.</li>
            <li>Nice lotion with just a hint of color.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice summer glow.</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and works great.</li>
            <li>I get a nice even glow with this, and I love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li>Love love love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, light smooth consistency, I am NEVER orange; great product.</li>
            <li>This lotion goes on easy and smells nice.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite self-tanner.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend this product more üëçüèºüëçüèº</li>
            <li>I love it, however; I love all of Hempz products</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to devote to the perfect fake tan, and this lotion is the perfect, low-maintenence solution to my problem.  </li>
            <li>I shower in the evening about two hours before bed, making sure to exfoliate with a pouf and body wash.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a deep tan, this may not be the best product</li>
            <li>BUT if you are looking for a nice light tan and don&#x27;t want to gamble on smell, streaks, and being orange....</li>
            <li>I love hempz lotion but probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
            <li>I love Hempz products.</li>
            <li>; self tanner has a bit more oomph</li>
            <li>and I really LOVE that caramel bronze color it gives me.</li>
            <li>I still like it better than Jergens.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The smell could be better</li>
            <li>only use 3 x a week after I shower and is awesome</li>
            <li>Plus, the smell of this product is MUCH better.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d be better off buying a gradual tanner from the drugstore.</li>
            <li>It smells so nice and light, goes on so easy, without streaks.  </li>
            <li>It gave me a nice comfortable and light tan</li>
            <li>have had great luck with this lotion and have developed a ritual that works well for me.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer gives a nice golden glow.  </li>
            <li>I love Hempz lotion and was REALLY excited when I found this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products and like this one the best.</li>
            <li>I love the original hempz lotion.</li>
            <li>This product is moisturizing and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable too!!</li>
            <li>Even though it does have that smell of the self-tanner, it is definitely not as annoying as others.</li>
            <li>I alternated using the medium tone every two or three days with the light tone.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic packageing.</li>
            <li>Hempz is a fabulous brand</li>
            <li>The medium tone is perfect and I would recommend it for all skin colors, even the lightest pale.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion!!!!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not disappointed with this product as well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it more time, and maybe I&#x27;ll (hopefully) be able to come back and take away the con :)</li>
            <li>A little streaky but very pleased for the most part!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t streak, builds a good color and smells better than other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li>Creates a nice, natural looking tan - not orangey.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it had good reviews for a relatively inexpensive gradual tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is hemp so it is moisturizing and give you a nice, natural looking color.</li>
            <li>I will still use it at home for a quick color.</li>
            <li>I love that this lotion doesn&#x27;t streak and is a gradual tan product so you are able to use it daily.</li>
            <li>Works great and doesn&#x27;t look fake and it is so easy to put on!!</li>
            <li>Went on smooth, no streaking or funny orange color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives good color and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>the Medium color-don&#x27;t think the Light would add much color)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have any gross smell which is nice though.</li>
            <li>I have been able to use this on my sensitive face with no problems.  </li>
            <li>Applied daily, it gives the appearance of a nice golden tan while moisturizing skin.  </li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews, but I just have to say that this product exceeds my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and was pleasantly surprised to find it at this cost.  </li>
            <li>Works right away.</li>
            <li>Textuer is not greasy, light coverage, but good color  smells good, last better than most other fake tanners I have used</li>
            <li>Also it makes the skin super super soft.  </li>
            <li>I bought my first tube of this</li>
            <li>Applying the body lotion first helps to keep your skin moisturized so it absorbs the tanning lotion evenly, and helps maintain your color.  </li>
            <li>This is the first self-tanner I ever used</li>
            <li>but I am overall still pleased.</li>
            <li>Prices this at Ulta, and was more than double the price I paid here!</li>
            <li>I apply with it every other day and it really keeps my skin a nice, realistic, golden color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several kinds with mitts, wipes etc, the cheap kind, the expensive kind</li>
            <li>I wanted something that was not going turn me orange, smelled nice (not like tanning lotion), and gave me a slight tan when I used it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and I love that the smell only slightly lingers.</li>
            <li>If this product ever becomes available in a no-added-fragrance version (all self tanners, even the so-called fragrance-free products, have some degree of that tell-tale chemical odor from the substance that actually causes the tanning), I would certainly want to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I did not notice any color transfer to clothing  fast absorbing.</li>
            <li>My skin is olive-toned but gets very pasty throughout the winter months.  </li>
            <li>I love this product as it seems to give an even tan appearance, ( if put on carefully).</li>
            <li>The tinting is not as intense as sunless tanning lotion and there is no discoloration in the skin around my joints (elbows, knees, ankles, toes and fingers).</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think my skin got much darker.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make me very tan</li>
            <li>Paula&#x27;s Choice &amp;#34;Almost the real thing&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks..</li>
            <li>Really like the product</li>
            <li>Looks like a real tan.  </li>
            <li>how gentle it gives a bronzed touch to skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>but be careful because it streaks if you put your jeans on right after applying it, other than that it&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li>I also recommend the Hempz Original Body Lotion, which you can buy from the same seller.</li>
            <li>Better than any other tanning moisturizer on the market.</li>
            <li>Silky, nice smell, and gives you a touch of summer all year round!</li>
            <li>When I get out of the shower and dry off, I apply Hempz Original Body Lotion (which is one of my absolute favorites) all over my face and body.  </li>
            <li>I have used this lotion for the last couple of years, and it is my favorite daily tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>And the price is way too high.</li>
            <li>and it takes several applications before I distinctly notice color.</li>
            <li>Wish it came in dark, however, since Medium is really light.</li>
            <li>did not like and this actually made my arm burn when i tested it out before covering whole body completely</li>
            <li>No harsh smell.</li>
            <li>It took over a month for the rash to completely disappear.  </li>
            <li>Just use caution with this product and, obviously, completely discontinue use if you get even a hint of a rash</li>
            <li>This lotion is extremely affordable compared to others on the market, and allows for a more subtle and gradual tan, as opposed to the more extreme and immediate tan you will get from using an Equate tanning foam, for example.  </li>
            <li>Used this product several times and it did bring up a little needed color on my very pale skin to just the light tones I wanted, but I found the fragrance to be far too strong to continue using.  </li>
            <li>My main goal was to maintain a little bit of color throughout the winter, and after much research of various products, both high and low-end, I decided this was the product for me.  </li>
            <li>have what anyone would consider overly sensitive skin and have used various self tanners before.  </li>
            <li>I used this stuff for about a week and barely noticed any color.</li>
            <li>I really like this and not much smell</li>
            <li>Moisturizers my dry skin very well while at the same time gives it a summer tan look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but i still felt it was hard to apply evenly and still has that slight orange color.</li>

            <li> I have been able to use this on my sensitive face with no problems.  </li>
            <li> Applied daily, it gives the appearance of a nice golden tan while moisturizing skin.  </li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews, but I just have to say that this product exceeds my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and was pleasantly surprised to find it at this cost.  </li>
            <li> Works right away.</li>
            <li> Textuer is not greasy, light coverage, but good color  smells good, last better than most other fake tanners I have used</li>
            <li> Also it makes the skin super super soft.  </li>
            <li> I bought my first tube of this</li>
            <li> Applying the body lotion first helps to keep your skin moisturized so it absorbs the tanning lotion evenly, and helps maintain your color.  </li>
            <li> This is the first self-tanner I ever used</li>
            <li> but I am overall still pleased.</li>
            <li> Prices this at Ulta, and was more than double the price I paid here!</li>
            <li> I apply with it every other day and it really keeps my skin a nice, realistic, golden color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several kinds with mitts, wipes etc, the cheap kind, the expensive kind</li>
            <li> I wanted something that was not going turn me orange, smelled nice (not like tanning lotion), and gave me a slight tan when I used it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and I love that the smell only slightly lingers.</li>
            <li> If this product ever becomes available in a no-added-fragrance version (all self tanners, even the so-called fragrance-free products, have some degree of that tell-tale chemical odor from the substance that actually causes the tanning), I would certainly want to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any color transfer to clothing  fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> My skin is olive-toned but gets very pasty throughout the winter months.  </li>
            <li> I love this product as it seems to give an even tan appearance, ( if put on carefully).</li>
            <li> The tinting is not as intense as sunless tanning lotion and there is no discoloration in the skin around my joints (elbows, knees, ankles, toes and fingers).</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think my skin got much darker.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make me very tan</li>
            <li> Paula&#x27;s Choice &amp;#34;Almost the real thing&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks..</li>
            <li> Really like the product</li>
            <li> Looks like a real tan.  </li>
            <li> how gentle it gives a bronzed touch to skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> but be careful because it streaks if you put your jeans on right after applying it, other than that it&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li> I also recommend the Hempz Original Body Lotion, which you can buy from the same seller.</li>
            <li> Better than any other tanning moisturizer on the market.</li>
            <li> Silky, nice smell, and gives you a touch of summer all year round!</li>
            <li> When I get out of the shower and dry off, I apply Hempz Original Body Lotion (which is one of my absolute favorites) all over my face and body.  </li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for the last couple of years, and it is my favorite daily tanning lotion.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> And the price is way too high.</li>
            <li> and it takes several applications before I distinctly notice color.</li>
            <li> Wish it came in dark, however, since Medium is really light.</li>
            <li> did not like and this actually made my arm burn when i tested it out before covering whole body completely</li>
            <li> No harsh smell.</li>
            <li> It took over a month for the rash to completely disappear.  </li>
            <li> Just use caution with this product and, obviously, completely discontinue use if you get even a hint of a rash</li>
            <li> This lotion is extremely affordable compared to others on the market, and allows for a more subtle and gradual tan, as opposed to the more extreme and immediate tan you will get from using an Equate tanning foam, for example.  </li>
            <li> Used this product several times and it did bring up a little needed color on my very pale skin to just the light tones I wanted, but I found the fragrance to be far too strong to continue using.  </li>
            <li> My main goal was to maintain a little bit of color throughout the winter, and after much research of various products, both high and low-end, I decided this was the product for me.  </li>
            <li> have what anyone would consider overly sensitive skin and have used various self tanners before.  </li>
            <li> I used this stuff for about a week and barely noticed any color.</li>
            <li> I really like this and not much smell</li>
            <li> Moisturizers my dry skin very well while at the same time gives it a summer tan look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but i still felt it was hard to apply evenly and still has that slight orange color.</li>
            <li> I also find it much easier to evenly spread the tanning lotion over body lotion, otherwise it can get a little dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why others have had issues with drying, as I feel this lotion is very moisturizing for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I use it for a few days in a row and get a really nice color, without looking fake at all.  </li>
            <li> I only use it 2-3 times a week, in between my other lotions and when applying to my face, I don&#x27;t wash my hands before putting on my regular face lotion.</li>
            <li> I use a little to even out the color I get from the natural sun, and plan to use it this winter.  </li>
            <li> I was a little surprised at how well it works and</li>
            <li> I let that dry for 5-10 minutes, then apply the Hempz Touch of Summer over that.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t received a whole lot of color but have noticed subtle difference.</li>
            <li> I let the tanning lotion dry for another 5-10 minutes, then put on something loose and baggy</li>
            <li> Hours later I am DARK</li>
            <li> and I have noticed that I am turning a little tan, instead of the glaring white</li>
            <li> I get a little bit of the product mixed in with my regualr moisturizer and my face looks even and blended.</li>
            <li> I was afraid the lotion for medium skin tones would be too dark on my pasty winter skin, but I have achieved a beautiful tan that does not look fake or orange after every single use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have found no streaking problems, and in the winter it can build up color slowly and add as much color or as little as you prefer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the last few months to get used to self-tanners</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very moisturizing, and I didn&#x27;t look any tanner.</li>
            <li> Works well smells a little strange tho.</li>
            <li> As with all self tanners, careful around knees and ankles!</li>
            <li> I have yet to find ANY natural tanner&#x27;s that don&#x27;t have chemicals in them‚Ä¶but at least the one I am using now has very minimal ingredients in it that are harmful and they are listed last meaning they are used in rather small concentrations compared to the ingredients at the beginning of the list!</li>
            <li> I also use less product when applying to wet skin.  </li>
            <li> The color it turns the skin is very natural--not fake or orange in any way.  </li>
            <li> I just have to remember to wash my hands of they can get dark.</li>
            <li> And much to my surprise there is no \\&quot;fake</li>
            <li> I have used it over the last 3 years and get just enough color to not look fake - and it makes me feel like I can go out in shorts with damaging my skin.  </li>
            <li> It goes on evenly, doesn&#x27;t have an odd odor and the color match blends</li>
            <li> and they all look fake and are really high maintenance.</li>
            <li> So I was shocked when I started getting raised red patches on my elbows that spread up my forearms and eventually almost my entire upper body!  </li>
            <li> After my skin has dried, there is no greasy residue and over time a slight tinting to the skin becomes noticeable.  </li>
            <li> It adds a little sparkle when wearing it</li>
            <li> My sister worked in a tanning salon, and told me I have to start using this lotion after tanning and or everyday use</li>
            <li> This lotion dried out my skin and made it soo itchy.</li>
            <li> With this lotion, you do not have to worry about streaking or your skin tone looking uneven.  </li>
            <li> or you may have trouble getting rid of it like I did.</li>
            <li> Need I say more‚Ä¶ it has harsh chemicals check out EWG&#x27;s skin-deep database</li>
            <li> I use this a few times a week..</li>
            <li> I just wanted to be a touch darker than pale.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m a pale olive.</li>
            <li> Wow, of all the ones I used before... some very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a gradual tanner that wouldn&#x27;t turn me orange and that didn&#x27;t have a terrible smell.  </li>
            <li> I used to use jergens in the past, but did not prefer the gold flakes they would leave behind.</li>
            <li> This works just as well, if not better than the expensive sunless tanners sold in Dept. stores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying that this will happen to everyone, but I would hate for someone else to experience this and wonder if they&#x27;re the only one.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try this because I am tired of the Jergens.</li>
            <li> I still haven&#x27;t remotely reached a base tan point that I want</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> Too bad, as the skin color tone produced was just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have that nasty fake tan smell.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Ugh, Hempz I am so disappointed it you!</li>
            <li> The Jergens tanning lotion I was using smelled horrible, was sticky, and I couldn&#x27;t stand it any longer.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason this product made me break out in a terrible, itchy rash all over my arms, shoulders, face, neck &amp; chest!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells awesome and clean feeling</li>
            <li> This is my favorite self-tanner. Even though it does have that smell of the self-tanner, it is definitely not as annoying as others.</li>
            <li> The Jergens tanning lotion I was using smelled horrible, was sticky, and I couldn&#x27;t stand it any longer. I wanted something that was not going turn me orange, smelled nice (not like tanning lotion), and gave me a slight tan when I used it. I love Hempz lotion and was REALLY excited when I found this product. It shipped quickly and works great. I love the smell, and I love that the smell only slightly lingers. It adds a little sparkle when wearing it and I have noticed that I am turning a little tan, instead of the glaring white I was. I only use it 2-3 times a week, in between my other lotions and when applying to my face, I don&#x27;t wash my hands before putting on my regular face lotion. I get a little bit of the product mixed in with my regualr moisturizer and my face looks even and blended. The medium tone is perfect and I would recommend it for all skin colors, even the lightest pale. Very happy with this buy and once I run out I will buy it again!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It works well and produces great color, not orange. It will definitely leave your hands orange though if you don&#x27;t wash them thoroughly after applying. I&#x27;ve ordered this multiple times and will definitely be my go to for self tanner lotion anytime that I need some.</li>
            <li> I appreciate how the product works.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion for the last couple of years, and it is my favorite daily tanning lotion.  Silky, nice smell, and gives you a touch of summer all year round!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have used it over the last 3 years and get just enough color to not look fake - and it makes me feel like I can go out in shorts with damaging my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t turn my skin orange and it smells great! Love it, love it, love it!</li>
            <li> I get a nice even glow with this, and I love the smell. Creates a nice, natural looking tan - not orangey.</li>
            <li> Great product. Went on smooth, no streaking or funny orange color. No harsh smell. I did not notice any color transfer to clothing  fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for 3 days 2x a day and it has evened out my driver&#x27;s tan! I couldn&#x27;t recommend this product more üëçüèºüëçüèº</li>
            <li> My sister worked in a tanning salon, and told me I have to start using this lotion after tanning and or everyday use I love it, however; I love all of Hempz products</li>
            <li> I recently gave up tanning at the salon to avoid skin issues in the future....(i.e. wrinkles, leather-like skin, cancer....) I&#x27;ve tried the last few months to get used to self-tanners and I have not had the best experience. I&#x27;ve tried several kinds with mitts, wipes etc, the cheap kind, the expensive kind and they all look fake and are really high maintenance. I bought my first tube of this and I AM HOOKED! The lotion&#x27;s gradual color is amazing. I apply with it every other day and it really keeps my skin a nice, realistic, golden color. It also smells great and is a great moisturizer. I highly recommend this lotion!!!!</li>
            <li> i bought this so i could deepen my already tan.skin. This lotion dried out my skin and made it soo itchy. Smelled nice tho</li>
            <li> My main goal was to maintain a little bit of color throughout the winter, and after much research of various products, both high and low-end, I decided this was the product for me.  This lotion is extremely affordable compared to others on the market, and allows for a more subtle and gradual tan, as opposed to the more extreme and immediate tan you will get from using an Equate tanning foam, for example.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to devote to the perfect fake tan, and this lotion is the perfect, low-maintenence solution to my problem.  With this lotion, you do not have to worry about streaking or your skin tone looking uneven.  My skin is olive-toned but gets very pasty throughout the winter months.  I was afraid the lotion for medium skin tones would be too dark on my pasty winter skin, but I have achieved a beautiful tan that does not look fake or orange after every single use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had great luck with this lotion and have developed a ritual that works well for me.  I shower in the evening about two hours before bed, making sure to exfoliate with a pouf and body wash.  When I get out of the shower and dry off, I apply Hempz Original Body Lotion (which is one of my absolute favorites) all over my face and body.  I let that dry for 5-10 minutes, then apply the Hempz Touch of Summer over that.  Applying the body lotion first helps to keep your skin moisturized so it absorbs the tanning lotion evenly, and helps maintain your color.  I also find it much easier to evenly spread the tanning lotion over body lotion, otherwise it can get a little dry.  I let the tanning lotion dry for another 5-10 minutes, then put on something loose and baggy so my lotion can continue to absorb and not rub off.  In the morning, I shower the tanning lotion off, and am left with a beautiful, even tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely happy with this lotion and 110% recommend it!  I also recommend the Hempz Original Body Lotion, which you can buy from the same seller.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great. I have a medium skin tone and I can actually use this product every day without worry. Been using it now for 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t noticed any streaking and it doesn&#x27;t smell bad. If you&#x27;re looking for a deep tan, this may not be the best product BUT if you are looking for a nice light tan and don&#x27;t want to gamble on smell, streaks, and being orange....I would definately recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer and nice color-not an orange cast to it at all.  I will order this again!!</li>
            <li> I love this product as it seems to give an even tan appearance, ( if put on carefully). I have tried other products and like this one the best.</li>
            <li> For whatever reason this product made me break out in a terrible, itchy rash all over my arms, shoulders, face, neck &amp; chest!  I do *NOT* have what anyone would consider overly sensitive skin and have used various self tanners before.  So I was shocked when I started getting raised red patches on my elbows that spread up my forearms and eventually almost my entire upper body!  It felt like I had been rolling in insulation, and I only used it maybe 2-3 times.  Nothing else about my routine had been changed so I know it was this product.  It took over a month for the rash to completely disappear.  I&#x27;m not saying that this will happen to everyone, but I would hate for someone else to experience this and wonder if they&#x27;re the only one.  Just use caution with this product and, obviously, completely discontinue use if you get even a hint of a rash or you may have trouble getting rid of it like I did.</li>
            <li> I alternated using the medium tone every two or three days with the light tone.  For me it worked to give me just a touch of color without turning orange.  I didn&#x27;t want a deeply tan look.  I just wanted to be a touch darker than pale.</li>
            <li> Smells soooooo good! Works right away. but be careful because it streaks if you put your jeans on right after applying it, other than that it&#x27;s a really good product.</li>
            <li> I use immediately after shower to lock in the moisture on my skin.  I also use less product when applying to wet skin.  After my skin has dried, there is no greasy residue and over time a slight tinting to the skin becomes noticeable.  The tinting is not as intense as sunless tanning lotion and there is no discoloration in the skin around my joints (elbows, knees, ankles, toes and fingers).</li>
            <li> This is the first self-tanner I ever used and I didn&#x27;t think my skin got much darker. I love hempz lotion but probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. I&#x27;ll stick with the regular lotion.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, light smooth consistency, I am NEVER orange; great product. This is on my summer list forever!!!</li>
            <li> Wow, of all the ones I used before... some very expensive.  This one is the keeper.  Wonderful scent.  Or I should say lack of.  So happy about that.  All the ones before had a smell I couldn&#x27;t stand</li>
            <li> did not like and this actually made my arm burn when i tested it out before covering whole body completely</li>
            <li> I love Hempz products. I decided to try this because I am tired of the Jergens. It smells really nice, the DHA &amp;#34;tanner smell&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t overwhelm me or my hubby and it only lasts for a short time. It doesn&#x27;t make me very tan and it takes several applications before I distinctly notice color. It&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re fair but I&#x27;m a pale olive. Paula&#x27;s Choice &amp;#34;Almost the real thing&amp;#34; self tanner has a bit more oomph and I really LOVE that caramel bronze color it gives me. I would buy this at the beginning of &amp;#34;tanning season&amp;#34; just to start gradually gaining color and then up the ante with the Paula&#x27;s Choice tanner. I still like it better than Jergens.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It has a berry smell.  But after using it for about a week, my tan on  my legs was really nice then I went on vacation to Mexico and it didn&#x27;t stay on.  I blotched all over.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to wipe it off.  Forget going in the pool.  It comes off in streaks.  That is with all the tan products I found.  Tropical weather doesn&#x27;t work with any of these products.  I will still use it at home for a quick color.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t look fake and it is so easy to put on!! The price was very reasonable too!!</li>
            <li> I used this stuff for about a week and barely noticed any color. I did notice streaks though. It doesn&#x27;t have any gross smell which is nice though.</li>
            <li> Used this product several times and it did bring up a little needed color on my very pale skin to just the light tones I wanted, but I found the fragrance to be far too strong to continue using.  Too bad, as the skin color tone produced was just what I was looking for. If this product ever becomes available in a no-added-fragrance version (all self tanners, even the so-called fragrance-free products, have some degree of that tell-tale chemical odor from the substance that actually causes the tanning), I would certainly want to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, color, and feel.</li>
            <li> Used it before going to an island wedding.  It gave me a nice comfortable and light tan so I loved it! Thanks..</li>
            <li> Need I say more‚Ä¶ it has harsh chemicals check out EWG&#x27;s skin-deep database and you&#x27;ll see. I have yet to find ANY natural tanner&#x27;s that don&#x27;t have chemicals in them‚Ä¶but at least the one I am using now has very minimal ingredients in it that are harmful and they are listed last meaning they are used in rather small concentrations compared to the ingredients at the beginning of the list! Ugh, Hempz I am so disappointed it you!</li>
            <li> This works so great!  I use a little to even out the color I get from the natural sun, and plan to use it this winter.  I have found no streaking problems, and in the winter it can build up color slowly and add as much color or as little as you prefer.  The smell is pleasant.  The color it turns the skin is very natural--not fake or orange in any way.  This is also a wonderful moisturizer.  I have been able to use this on my sensitive face with no problems.  This works just as well, if not better than the expensive sunless tanners sold in Dept. stores.  I will keep this in stock in my household.  Thank you Hempz.  Great-clean fragrance too.</li>
            <li> Really like the product</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!  Smells awesome, applies pretty well. I just have to remember to wash my hands of they can get dark. I use this a few times a week..sometimes weekly..in the in the winter so I don&#x27;t look as vampire-ish.  I don&#x27;t, however, apply it to my face because it can be a bit greasy feeling for my face.</li>
            <li> This product is moisturizing and easy to use.  Does not streak or rub off on your clothing.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fantastic packageing.</li>
            <li> I really like this and not much smell</li>
            <li> I like the product.  It does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Moisturizers my dry skin very well while at the same time gives it a summer tan look.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It goes on evenly, doesn&#x27;t have an odd odor and the color match blends well so that I don&#x27;t turn orange.</li>
            <li> I love that this lotion doesn&#x27;t streak and is a gradual tan product so you are able to use it daily. The smell could be better but I am overall still pleased.</li>
            <li> I bought this item not knowing what to expect. Haven&#x27;t received a whole lot of color but have noticed subtle difference. And much to my surprise there is no \\&quot;fake tan\\&quot; odor like all the rest. Prices this at Ulta, and was more than double the price I paid here! Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Looks like a real tan.  As with all self tanners, careful around knees and ankles! Doesn&#x27;t have that nasty fake tan smell.</li>
            <li> I love this self tanner, has a pleasant smell and doesn&#x27;t turn you orange</li>
            <li> Perfect.  only use 3 x a week after I shower and is awesome</li>
            <li> Nice lotion with just a hint of color. (I bought the Medium color-don&#x27;t think the Light would add much color)&lt;br /&gt;No lingering odor... nice and conditioning too!</li>
            <li> This is amazing!  I was a little surprised at how well it works and how gentle it gives a bronzed touch to skin.  Hempz is a fabulous brand and I&#x27;m not disappointed with this product as well.  Applied daily, it gives the appearance of a nice golden tan while moisturizing skin.  Will reorder!</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low for a gradual tanner that wouldn&#x27;t turn me orange and that didn&#x27;t have a terrible smell.  I rarely write reviews, but I just have to say that this product exceeds my expectations.  Lotion is very easy to apply, doesn&#x27;t streak, doesn&#x27;t turn me orange, and best of all, there is NO SMELL.  I mean--none.  It&#x27;s the only self-tanner that I can put on in the morning and go to work without feeling self-conscious about the smell.  I would recommend applying it with your hands, though--it tends to gunk up my self-tanning mitt.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I bought this because it had good reviews for a relatively inexpensive gradual tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells good&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t streak (even your hands)&lt;br /&gt;Actually moisturizes...rather well&lt;br /&gt;Subtle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes awhile to build. A WHILE. I still haven&#x27;t remotely reached a base tan point that I want and I&#x27;ve been using it for just over a week. I&#x27;m giving it more time, and maybe I&#x27;ll (hopefully) be able to come back and take away the con :)</li>
            <li> Textuer is not greasy, light coverage, but good color  smells good, last better than most other fake tanners I have used</li>
            <li> LOVE this lotion!  Perfect amount of color, with NO streaking.</li>
            <li> It is hemp so it is moisturizing and give you a nice, natural looking color. Excellent choice. And gets inbetween your fingers without the tan mark unlike jergens.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice summer glow. A little streaky but very pleased for the most part!</li>
            <li> Better than any other tanning moisturizer on the market. I tan with a tingle lotion, go home and scrub that stuff off then I put on touch of summer. Hours later I am DARK</li>
            <li> This is the best sunless tanner I have ever used! It doesn&#x27;t streak, builds a good color and smells better than other tanning lotions.</li>
            <li> I have continued to use this product over several years. I used to use jergens in the past, but did not prefer the gold flakes they would leave behind. Plus, the smell of this product is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> I am amazed to finally find a self-tanner that doesn&#x27;t give off that funky smell for days! there might be just the slightest bit for about 2 hours, but after that, it&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;It gives good color and doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff!!!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer gives a nice golden glow.  Wish it came in dark, however, since Medium is really light.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product! Mix it with your regular lotion to ensure even coverage and no blotchy places.</li>
            <li> This is a great lotion!  It smells so nice and light, goes on so easy, without streaks.  I use it for a few days in a row and get a really nice color, without looking fake at all.  Also it makes the skin super super soft.  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This lotion goes on easy and smells nice.  You can apply and leave the house without smelling like a tanning salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pre-lotion my knees, hands and ankles before applying this to prevent those areas from absorbing the tanning lotion too heavily.  Once applied, I wash my hands and the rest happens oh so gradually and looks great!  I&#x27;m not sure why others have had issues with drying, as I feel this lotion is very moisturizing for my skin.  Oh well, different bodies I guess.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but i still felt it was hard to apply evenly and still has that slight orange color.</li>
            <li> Works well smells a little strange tho.</li>
            <li> I love the original hempz lotion. This stuff however just isn&#x27;t good. I hate the smell of it. It&#x27;s not very moisturizing, and I didn&#x27;t look any tanner. And the price is way too high. You&#x27;d be better off buying a gradual tanner from the drugstore. Oh well lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Turned my body orange!</li>
            <li> I love this product and was pleasantly surprised to find it at this cost.  A very good deal and I&#x27;d purchase it again.</li>
