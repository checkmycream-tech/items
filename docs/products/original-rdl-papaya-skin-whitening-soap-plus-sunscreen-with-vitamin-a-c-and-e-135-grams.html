            <li>I love this soap.</li>
            <li>This soap is okay because I am still using my Kojie soap.</li>
            <li>I just like the Kojie soap better.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to even it out no matter</li>
            <li>I guess I will be more patient.</li>
            <li>Love this soap...im darkskinned but this soap is making me brown skinned...</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on your face more than twice a day 3 times a week..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give it more time.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>Makes my face feel very clean and it removes alot of my makeup.</li>
            <li>But the soap bar seems to melt so easily.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and leaves my skin feeling super clean.</li>
            <li>My skin is becoming smooth and even toned</li>
            <li>I love how cool my face feels after washing  with this soap, there should be instructions on the box</li>
            <li>Work good, I need to order more, it&#x27;s better than the other brand love it.</li>
            <li>i have used it for couples of days and already saw a huge differences in my skin.ladies</li>
            <li>i am light skinned  </li>
            <li>AND I FELT SMOOTH A</li>
            <li>All I use is light exfoliate cleanser, then I use papaya soap, alcohol free toner and a moisturizer with an spf of 30</li>
            <li>It make your skin bright &amp; soft.</li>
            <li>I have caramel soft and bright skin.</li>
            <li>Now my face, neck and chest area look more of a golden hue, while the marks look even darker.  </li>
            <li>but it makes my body feel clean</li>
            <li>I does clean face and lightens it.</li>
            <li>As per instruction apply and clean your face you will see the difference.</li>
            <li>My complexion looks clean and brighter.  </li>
            <li>Clean your face up ..</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s really working, I let it sit on my skin for about 10 minutes or so and it evened up and brightened my complexion, but mostly it evens up the skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Then I noticed my complexion over all getting pretty light, so I have had to take a break.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely worth the price .</li>
            <li>Worth buying.</li>
            <li>-- I use Thayer&#x27;s and for you sensitive folks it comes alcohol free -- you can get it for cheap at drugstore(dot)com --</li>
            <li>I seen the lightening in my skin right away.</li>
            <li>Like how clean my face feels afterwards, but didn&#x27;t really see any lightening affects on my marks on my face.  </li>
            <li>This is supposed to be skin whitening soap, which is the reason I bought it, but it did absolutely nothing to my skin besides clean it.</li>
            <li>After the first day I saw result when it came to my actually acne itself, this soap gave me a nice glow and cleared my skin immediately.</li>
            <li>Shipping was first class..</li>
            <li>Exactly what i was looking for üëçüëç</li>
            <li>no real change but nice soap</li>
            <li>after a week lets just say this product does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>This soap is VERY  drying, as it is supposed to be -- it is an exfoliating soap!  </li>
            <li>This product does have a nice scent , however it can be a little drying.</li>
            <li>Not only does it lightening my skin, it makes my skin softer and smooth .</li>
            <li>Worked very well will order again</li>
            <li>This product works naturally, makes your face fresh.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in the brightness of my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I think this soap just enhance the lightening process because my face is much lighter than again</li>
            <li>I really can not tell a difference because I am using my Kojie soap.</li>
            <li>shipping was so fast.</li>
            <li>so I haven&#x27;t really seen a lot of results yet .</li>
            <li>it is very drying</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t see any, but I rubbed it in for a few seconds and rinsed with warm water</li>
            <li>and I used up nearly the entire bar before I reviewed it because I wanted to make sure, but it did not work no matter</li>
            <li>This is a nice size bar and will last a minute if you are only washing your face with it.</li>
            <li>but I would order again when I am overexposed to the sun to get my color back quickly.</li>
            <li>I will probably not buy this particular soap again.</li>
            <li>but it does brighten it somewhat, I would highly recommend .  </li>
            <li>The lightening is gradual and not at all drastic, so if your goal is to not turn two whole completion shades lighter, you will be ale to notice without things going too far.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it really does that its just your skin will clear up</li>
            <li>Using bleaching creams for so many years causes uneven skin tone and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an AA  woman with normal skin.</li>
            <li>let me add if you have a skin cleanser tool like the clairsonic mia or other skin cleansing device use this soap AFTER cleansing with those devices this way your skin is clean and it will drive the  bleaching product directly into the skin..  </li>
            <li>I originally bought it to lighten my dark toe knuckles...</li>
            <li>so I think I will lay off for a little bit as I am already light.</li>
            <li>This is a natural soap.</li>
            <li>Others may experience different results but it didn&#x27;t do too much for me.</li>
            <li>Make sure if you want results you exfoliate and leave on your skin for at least 8 minutes</li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The soap really does work to bring back a youthful glow.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a week without the Kojie soap and it really did the same as the Kojie soap.</li>
            <li>This soap will leave your face soft because of the vitamins in it.</li>
            <li>It will leave a soft and shininess on your face, but you will have to use a skin oil or skin lightener.</li>
            <li>My primary concentrated area is under my chin which is uneven and shadowy.</li>
            <li>So far I like the soap.</li>
            <li>it may burn sensitive parts</li>
            <li>It is very drying and if you get it in your hair during your shower, your hair will be extremely dry as well.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t seen any major changes</li>
            <li>For me, this was basically a regular ol&#x27; bar of soap but more expensive than a regular one and without much of a smell.</li>
            <li>If you think the Kojie soap is too strong then try this soap because it is a little milder and it will sting a little but not harsh side effects not on my face.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this soap to fade the dark marks and hyperpigmentation on face; and dark marks from a pityriasis rash.  </li>
            <li>I decided I wanted to use this product for a week or so before writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m dark skinned with a huge amount of acne scarring and uneven pigments.</li>
            <li>It will dry you out and clear skin at the same time.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased the soap to help even out my skin and lighten dark spots, which it did. Then I noticed my complexion over all getting pretty light, so I have had to take a break. The lightening is gradual and not at all drastic, so if your goal is to not turn two whole completion shades lighter, you will be ale to notice without things going too far. But over all a great buy: super clean feel when you are done and helps to lighten.</li>
            <li> I tried it and I broke out no thank you not for me. I&#x27;ll stick to kojie San.</li>
            <li> Made my skin smoother</li>
            <li> i am light skinned  black female, i needed a soap that will lightening and brightening my skin at the time, this soap does it all. Not only does it lightening my skin, it makes my skin softer and smooth . i have used it for couples of days and already saw a huge differences in my skin.ladies, you definitely have to try it .&lt;br /&gt;it works !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like to change my soaps from time to time and this is a good one.  My skin lightens up when I use it; but I am already a nice brown but I would order again when I am overexposed to the sun to get my color back quickly.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE SMELL AND YOU CAN THINK OF A GOOD  CHOICE IN YOUR LIFE  I MADE A VERY GOOD CHOICE ,USED TODAY AND I FELT SMOOTH A SILKY SKIN THANK YOU AMAZON</li>
            <li> ihave hyperpigmentation skin.and I can say this product works it got rid ofthe darkness around my eyes and my lips I also use it under my arms and on my booty .</li>
            <li> Worked very well will order again</li>
            <li> Helped brighten my skin, and fade some spots. Helped with acne a little bit as well. But the soap bar seems to melt so easily.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and leaves my skin feeling super clean.</li>
            <li> This is a natural soap. If you need a bleaching soap, this is not for you. This product works naturally, makes your face fresh.</li>
            <li> Love it. It dries your face but it makes my body feel clean</li>
            <li> I love how cool my face feels after washing  with this soap, there should be instructions on the box but I didn&#x27;t see any, but I rubbed it in for a few seconds and rinsed with warm water</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any difference while using this. Others may experience different results but it didn&#x27;t do too much for me.</li>
            <li> It will dry you out and clear skin at the same time. You will not turn white I don&#x27;t think it really does that its just your skin will clear up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this soap in combination with 6 other soaps so I switch off but this one leaves a noticeable difference. Really nice size bar, great lather and you instantly become brighter. With exfoliation and combination of bleaching creams and lotions, within 3 weeks you see your skin a shade lighter . Make sure if you want results you exfoliate and leave on your skin for at least 8 minutes</li>
            <li> I only bought one soap; therefore, I couldnt tell if it does what they claim it does.</li>
            <li> Like how clean my face feels afterwards, but didn&#x27;t really see any lightening affects on my marks on my face.  This product does have a nice scent , however it can be a little drying.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel very clean and it removes alot of my makeup. I&#x27;m also seeing a difference in my face. It has lighten up alot of my blemishes. I love this soap</li>
            <li> Works but takes a few weeks to see results.</li>
            <li> Didnt do anything.  I saw no improvement at all. Was just regular soap.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I should have bought 2, because now I see the price has gone up. I use mine twice a day for 4/5 days a week with Alpha Hydroxy Oil-free Formula to even out my skin tone. I&#x27;m back and forth with this soap, and my regular routine. When I use it, I let it stay and dry on my face for about 5 minutes then I wash it off. It does a great job getting rid of the blemishes. I agree with the other reviews that it is drying, I don&#x27;t mind that; It&#x27;s not like my skin is going to crack instantly. I just simply follow up with a moisturizer. I have brown skin, for anyone who might be wondering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS NOT A QUICK FIX. I saw changes in 3 days, but I&#x27;ve continually use this product for weeks, along with staying out of the sun, eating my berries, and drinking plenty water. By week 4 my friends noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Some brightening, but nothing that impressive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using it for couple weeks now , I notice my skin getting whiter</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin. If u allow it to sit on your face for too long, it will burn your skin.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be skin whitening soap, which is the reason I bought it, but it did absolutely nothing to my skin besides clean it. For me, this was basically a regular ol&#x27; bar of soap but more expensive than a regular one and without much of a smell. I was very disappointed. I used this every time I took a shower and I used up nearly the entire bar before I reviewed it because I wanted to make sure, but it did not work no matter how long I used it. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Came very fast, package was not damage and the soap itself smell wonderful and felt good on my face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in the brightness of my skin tone. It smells nice, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again. It is very drying and if you get it in your hair during your shower, your hair will be extremely dry as well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful soap it makes my skin soft nd bright</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s really working, I let it sit on my skin for about 10 minutes or so and it evened up and brightened my complexion, but mostly it evens up the skin tone.  Using bleaching creams for so many years causes uneven skin tone and what I like about this soap is that it evens it up evenly.  It also tightens the skin and cleans and shrinks the pores as well as giving the face a healthier look.  Your skin will be visibly even which is what you want.  I don&#x27;t think it whitens the skin but it does brighten it somewhat, I would highly recommend .  I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months now and it&#x27;s definitely worth the price .</li>
            <li> This product is good for acne. I&#x27;m not sure about its effect for lightening because I&#x27;m the same completion. Also, it burns after&lt;br /&gt;a few minutes if you use a lot.</li>
            <li> Shipping was first class.. And the product itself is great! Exactly what i was looking for üëçüëç</li>
            <li> Does it work?  As a soap  yes but I have not seen the difference on its advertising protection.  I made it just my regular soap................</li>
            <li> The soap really does work to bring back a youthful glow.</li>
            <li> Amazing soap, love it!</li>
            <li> no real change but nice soap</li>
            <li> This soap is okay because I am still using my Kojie soap. I think this soap just enhance the lightening process because my face is much lighter than again I really can not tell a difference because I am using my Kojie soap. I would recommend using this soap with Kojie soap. I have used it for a week without the Kojie soap and it really did the same as the Kojie soap. I am hook on Kojie soap. This will lighten your face. I still have some left and I have put it to the side for a minute. This soap will leave your face soft because of the vitamins in it. If you think the Kojie soap is too strong then try this soap because it is a little milder and it will sting a little but not harsh side effects not on my face. It will leave a soft and shininess on your face, but you will have to use a skin oil or skin lightener. It will change the texture of your face like Kojie soap. I just like the Kojie soap better. This is a nice size bar and will last a minute if you are only washing your face with it. I won&#x27;t be buying again. I do use it with my Kojie soap too because of the vitamins in the soap and the sunscreen in it. I use a sunscreen cream that is in my skin lightener, so think about the sunscreen too when lighten your skin. It is very important too.</li>
            <li> Works!!!!! Bought it for blemishes but it is making my skin a lot lighter as well so I think I will lay off for a little bit as I am already light.</li>
            <li> I really love this soap, This is the best soap for me,It&#x27;s cleanse very good and lighten the skin. shipping was so fast. thank you</li>
            <li> It was so good i saw improvements</li>
            <li> I have to scrub my face with rough sea sponge with this soap for it to show some improvement but then it makes my face feel burning and all red. I guess I shouldn&#x27;t scrubbed my face.</li>
            <li> I decided I wanted to use this product for a week or so before writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m dark skinned with a huge amount of acne scarring and uneven pigments. After the first day I saw result when it came to my actually acne itself, this soap gave me a nice glow and cleared my skin immediately. After the 3 day it started to target my scars. after a week lets just say this product does exactly what it says it does. I&#x27;m happy and I&#x27;ll continue to use this soap daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons would have to be the burning and the dryness after rinsing the soap. IF you&#x27;re going to let the soap sit on your face do it for about 1-2mins</li>
            <li> I love this soap! It smells so Good!</li>
            <li> did nothing at all for me</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen results. My primary concentrated area is under my chin which is uneven and shadowy. It is at least 1 1/2 shades darker than the rest of my face and I haven&#x27;t been able to even it out no matter what. I guess I will be more patient.</li>
            <li> I does clean face and lightens it.</li>
            <li> I actually like this product a lot. Through trial and error have learn what not to do while using it, like do not scrub your skin too roughly before applying this product and dont scrub while using it cos you&#x27;ll burn your skin. But it has controlled my acne in ways i never dreamed of. My skin is becoming smooth and even toned and I started seeing result within a week of using this product. Bye bye to all of the expensive acne treatments I&#x27;ve used on the past that simply dont work. All I use is light exfoliate cleanser, then I use papaya soap, alcohol free toner and a moisturizer with an spf of 30 and I&#x27;m good to go. I have never been happier with a product. It actually works wonders for meüòä</li>
            <li> I did not even bother using it- it contains parabens. If a list of ingredient had been present at the time I never would have made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Does not work as promised</li>
            <li> Love this soap...im darkskinned but this soap is making me brown skinned...I want my face to be the same complexion as my body but im afraid its not goodd for your face cuz it breaks it out so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on your face more than twice a day 3 times a week.. I originally bought it to lighten my dark toe knuckles...I guess its working but I haven&#x27;t seen any major changes</li>
            <li> Using this soap for past two months. Recommended soap for skin whitening. It make your skin bright &amp; soft. As per instruction apply and clean your face you will see the difference. Worth buying.</li>
            <li> I give it 4 stars.  This my 3rd day using this soap so I haven&#x27;t really seen a lot of results yet . it smells sooooo good.  I use it every night I think it has lightened mg dark spots on my arms a bit not completely.  My complexion looks clean and brighter.  I&#x27;m going to give it more time.  So far I like the soap.</li>
            <li> Work good, I need to order more, it&#x27;s better than the other brand love it.</li>
            <li> Clean your face up ..I love it</li>
            <li> I saw no difference after using this product.</li>
            <li> This soap is excellent, it reminds me of Kojie SAN soap but papaya soap is better. I have dark spots everywhere on my body and trying everything to get rid of them. I leave the soap on my body for 2 minutes then rinse off. I seen the lightening in my skin right away. The soap does not melt quickly and give a great lather. I have caramel soft and bright skin.</li>
            <li> Now, Here&#x27;s the deal..... I&#x27;m an AA  woman with normal skin. No acne, no skin sensitivity issues just hyper-pigmentation problems around my mouth.  This soap is VERY  drying, as it is supposed to be -- it is an exfoliating soap!  You MUST moisturize after rinsing!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Wash your face with this soap leave on for no more than three minutes or else it will BURN your face!  If you are doing it on other body parts you can leave it on as long as tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Rinse twice with water, distilled is best but tap will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Apply a toner of your choice, if you&#x27;re not sure of a toner to use go for a premium witch hazel toner -- I use Thayer&#x27;s and for you sensitive folks it comes alcohol free -- you can get it for cheap at drugstore(dot)com -- just do a search for it.  Let that air dry before you add your moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  Add your moisturizer and eye cream of your choice and you are done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. If you are doing this during the day you MUST incorporate a sunblock before you apply your makeup if not all of your efforts of an even skin tone will be lost to the suns UV rays.  Best of luck ladies and gents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also let me add if you have a skin cleanser tool like the clairsonic mia or other skin cleansing device use this soap AFTER cleansing with those devices this way your skin is clean and it will drive the  bleaching product directly into the skin..  Best of luck!</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few days; once in the morning and once before bed.  I let the lather stay on my skin for two minutes because any longer it WILL sting!  Don&#x27;t scrub this product into your skin because it will burn and turn your skin red ( at least it did with mine and I am an AA of medium brown complexion.)  I originally purchased this soap to fade the dark marks and hyperpigmentation on face; and dark marks from a pityriasis rash.  The product DOES lighten, but lightens my skin overall... doesn&#x27;t even touch the marks.  Now my face, neck and chest area look more of a golden hue, while the marks look even darker.  I will probably not buy this particular soap again.</li>
            <li> this soap is the best papaya soap ever i used..but be patient with result..it is going to take time see the glow in your skin</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing I only say this because once I started using this soap on my face it has kept me from getting pimples! And that helps to keep acne scarring at a minimal! Be careful when using it on your body it may burn sensitive parts I only use it for my arms legs and back it burns everywhere else! This soap is good it is very drying so I use it only at night and in the morning I use aveeno complexion face pads with a moisturizer! Hope it helps you like it has does wonders for my face I will purchase again and again!!!!!</li>
