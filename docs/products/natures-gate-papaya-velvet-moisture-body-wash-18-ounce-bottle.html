            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>Soothe my sprit when I take a shower with it with a good lather.</li>
            <li>Of course, if I had never gotten use to the good feelings those toxic chemicals add, I&#x27;d probably be doing nothing but raving about this.</li>
            <li>Good for our skin and lots of lather.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and is great for shaving instead of a shave cream for the pits and legs.</li>
            <li>I liked the product: good price, pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering</li>
            <li>I like the bottle with the pump on top, though!</li>

            <li>Love this soap!  </li>

            <li>I tried it and it smelled AMAZING</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li>pump for handy shower use</li>
            <li>This has a nice smell, cleanses well.  </li>
            <li>Not as apricot-y as i would have liked.</li>
            <li>Nicely priced, like the pump bottle.</li>
            <li>This is a good lightly fruity-scented medium weight moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Great natural product with a pleasant smell that&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I ordered it right away, and I&#x27;m happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>great product with reasonable applicator top!</li>
            <li>It also gets me good and clean without overdrying my skin.  </li>
            <li>First of all, great product.  </li>
            <li>This is a very smooth and gooey body wash.</li>
            <li>It smells nice but not too strong.</li>
            <li>My wife and kids love this body wash</li>
            <li>They would be better off switching to a squeeze bottle design.</li>
            <li>I received a bottle of this over a year ago from the Amazon Vine program in order to test and review, and it was one of my favorite products ever.</li>
            <li>(silky).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might have to purchase it more often if you like to use a lot of lather while washing.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I LOVE the smell of papaya and</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; for many definitions (not all)</li>
            <li>Love this body wash.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>works great thanks .</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite though, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>Mine like many others was cracked upon arrival, however not to the degree that would effect the dispensing performance.  </li>
            <li>We started purchasing this more than a year ago because it contains no MEA, DEA, or TEA.</li>
            <li>I love this body wash...</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this stuff.  </li>
            <li>its organic so no nasty chems on your skin</li>
            <li>Have used many of Nature&#x27;s Gate&#x27;s items and have always been pleased.</li>
            <li>I have used 3 bottles of this now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite body product brand ever.</li>
            <li>I love this body wash</li>
            <li>I love this body wash.  </li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t like this body wash since it takes a lot of product to form a good lather.  </li>
            <li>It did wonderful job on my skin cleaning but the scent somehow smells strange.</li>
            <li>Nature&#x27;s Gate Papaya velvet moisture body wash is the perfect balance, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on my skin.</li>
            <li>The lack of that feeling kind of drives you to want to keep pouring on the soap and using it up too quickly.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t dry you out, and it smells great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many natural body washes, and most don&#x27;t match up to the good lather this one produces.  </li>
            <li>the reviews of it being a superior body wash were too much to pass up.</li>
            <li>Find it to suds up nicely and would say it is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>Good, gentle body wash.  </li>
            <li>It smells SOOO good and lathers really well</li>
            <li>I really like Nature Gate, however, the papaya did not smell good, and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting cleaned.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s economical AND luxuriously wonderful at the same time.  </li>
            <li>Love the fragrance and it leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, all the scents in this brand are great actually.</li>
            <li>In a easy to use pump (for me anyway)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As a result the product has a strong coconut odor.  </li>
            <li>It is a good basic body wash with nice ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think something so mild and moisturizing would really do the job, but I was pleasantly surprized.</li>
            <li>The smell is light and not overbearing.</li>
            <li>It took some getting use to, but I eventually like the light, papaya, fruity smell.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying to switch over to products that are chemical free hence my purchase of this body wash.  </li>
            <li>Scent could be improved but overall, a great product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>It smells really good and feels soft on your skin</li>
            <li>smells so goood, all natural, no harmful chemical and good price.</li>
            <li>Never dried my skin out and nice and sudsy :)</li>
            <li>Smells good and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>The smell, like the feel, is actually an odd kind of almost really good.</li>
            <li>I bought this because a website that evaluates skin care products listed it as one of the mildest body washes on the market, based on the fact that its cleansing ingredients include a significant amount of sodium cocoyl isethionate (SCI, a coconut-based surfactant that is known to be the mildest one used in skin care products).</li>
            <li>I appreciate that it has more natural ingredients in it than most products of this type.</li>
            <li>The product gets you plenty clean</li>
            <li>It seems to clean the skin</li>
            <li>But its cheap and worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I like it better than Dove body wash, and I really like Dove.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-This is unusual for me, but I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with how amazon packed everything.</li>
            <li>I expected this to be mild and non-drying based on the ingredients list, and have been happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great, is vegan, has no scary ingredients, and gets really sudsy, which is sometimes a problem for natural products.</li>
            <li>sure why Nature&#x27;s Gate doesn&#x27;t make a bigger deal out of their very mild cleansing ingredients--maybe because surfactants have names that sound &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;synthetic&amp;#34; to people, while their marketing pitch is &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;botanical.&amp;#34; But body washes by definition contain surfactants, whether they market themselves as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or not.</li>
            <li>I love the ingredients and how its made, only thing I&#x27;d change is I wish it bubbled up more.</li>
            <li>The scent is nice and light and I definitely see a change in my skin...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an overwhelming sweet smell - just mild and pleasant (at least to me).  </li>
            <li>My new favorite shower gel.</li>
            <li>Having a pump on it is great, because it doesn&#x27;t a mess</li>
            <li>it is the only kind I use.</li>
            <li>smells good and moisterizes like expected.</li>
            <li>and they proved me right...</li>
            <li>Velvet is the right word to describe this product.  </li>
            <li>DID GO A LONG  WAY  AND MADE NICE SUDS.  </li>
            <li>if you have dry,sensitive skin and live in the desert you need this product I have found this works as good or better then the more expensive brands</li>
            <li>I loved it, it left my skin soo soft.  </li>
            <li>Most soaps super lather up but then leaves skin dry.</li>
            <li>Thanks again and God bless!</li>
            <li>like I did the first time.  </li>
            <li>I am not the first to complain about the dispensing mechanism of this product.  </li>
            <li>The first two substantive ingredients cited on the label of this body wash are extracted from coconut.  </li>
            <li>and that is all that really matters!</li>
            <li>That may be more to my taste, so I&#x27;m trying that one next.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that guys would like the fragrance as it&#x27;s very fruity, but I think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>Keeps skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Used by my whole family including kids!</li>
            <li>Its a great wash to moisturize but not leave a heavy residue afterwards, which many other body washes do.  </li>
            <li>smells good, definitely not long lasting.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft without over drying.  </li>
            <li>But this leaves skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li>The longer I used it, the more dry my skin became.  </li>
            <li>large size</li>
            <li>Will work fine for the summer but probably wouldn&#x27;t do enough for my skin in the winter.</li>
            <li>But with repeated use, I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t need to use as much body wash</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I keep a bottle on my desk at work and the scent is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother me or anyone else.</li>
            <li>But if you really like the scent of papaya, go for it.</li>
            <li>B001CI6RQK Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials Natural Deodorant, Fresh, 2.5 oz.]]</li>
            <li>I really like this body wash.</li>
            <li>I have used the Nature&#x27;s Gate Papaya lotion and really like it, so thought I would try the body wash.  </li>
            <li>This is really a gem from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Love these products because they don&#x27;t have the harshest of the detergent and no real toxic chemicals , yet they are affordable.  </li>
            <li>This is not moisturizing, but it is a gentle cleanser</li>
            <li>nice smell, rinses well, natural, packaged in bag to prevent leaks into your other order.</li>
            <li>Other nature gate products are much better.</li>
            <li>The price is better than other on-line stores.</li>
            <li>Overall, the smell is not overpowering and, the clean is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[[1]]]</li>
            <li>smells good and natural but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Good lather and subtle scent.</li>
            <li>but otherwise this has been a decent product to meet my needs.</li>
            <li>and it leaked over everything in the box that luckily could be washed off; they gave a refund without asking for it back</li>
            <li>Lathers decent with a loofah.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of the high rate..</li>
            <li>I even subscribed to it, but unfortunately amazon stopped carrying it; therefore I am happy to find it here from another vendor.</li>
            <li>Been using it for about 5 months, and it will continue to be a regular product for me as long as Amazon has it :)</li>
            <li>You feel the difference, clean and soft skin with a lovely very subtle scent.</li>
            <li>This body wash makes my extra dry skin feel much more smoother and soft</li>
            <li>Decent product, lathers well, not a heavy scent to it.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and had previously used strong soaps like dial.</li>
            <li>Now my skin feels clean but not tight and dry.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the most moisturizing body wash I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Further aggravation occurs when the pump will not return to the top, due to thickness of product, requiring the operator to manually pull it up.  </li>
            <li>It is mild and gentle and makes my skin soft, and also makes it less bumpy.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty strong straight from the bottle but very subtle when using.</li>
            <li>both my daughter and i developed utis after using this product - anyone else?</li>
            <li>This leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I take baths, so I prefer using natural products.</li>
            <li>IT IS NATURAL  </li>
            <li>Natural product.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and this does not bother it.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Nature&#x27;s Gate products before and loved them, but this time it&#x27;s a fail.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through most of a bottle, and it works well for me, leaving my skin less dry and itchy than even the &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The price is very good, too, considering that SCI is expensive, which is one of the reasons few companies use it.</li>
            <li>This new stuff DOES NOT SAY &amp;#34;VEVLET&amp;#34;, and the ingredients are different.  </li>
            <li>since I use their shampoo that comes in the same bottle and is equipped with the proper squeeze top, I save the top of the empty shampoo, and throw out the useless pump....</li>
            <li>something no other body wash has delivered.</li>
            <li>I had tried many other body washes and all seemed to dry my skin out too much or be too heavily scented which causes me to itch (allergies).</li>
            <li>the top nozzle was broken but product still usable.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more poorly thought out.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes shy away from fruit smells because they can be too sweet smelling, but this scent is just right.  </li>
            <li>The problem is this is a very viscous product that is being dispensed from a bottle that does not have a wide base and is compounded by the pump top that isn&#x27;t exactly square, therefore when being pumped, it wants to tip.</li>
            <li>They put only a tiny touch of fragrance in their products, and so far I haven&#x27;t had any allergy problems with any of them.</li>
            <li>Does not dry your skin out.</li>
            <li>IT DID NOT DRY MY SKIN.</li>
            <li>At first it was only a little bit.  </li>
            <li>Not much else to say; this is my new go-to body wash.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t want to get too graphic, but no matter how much deodorant I use, I tend to sweat and at the end of the day, there is a little odor going on.</li>

            <li> Good for our skin and lots of lather.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and is great for shaving instead of a shave cream for the pits and legs.</li>
            <li> I liked the product: good price, pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering</li>
            <li> I like the bottle with the pump on top, though!</li>

            <li> I love this body wash and loved the price on amazon even more!  </li>
            <li> I tried it and it smelled AMAZING</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li> pump for handy shower use</li>
            <li> This has a nice smell, cleanses well.  </li>
            <li> Not as apricot-y as i would have liked.</li>
            <li> Nicely priced, like the pump bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a good lightly fruity-scented medium weight moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great natural product with a pleasant smell that&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I ordered it right away, and I&#x27;m happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> great product with reasonable applicator top!</li>
            <li> It also gets me good and clean without overdrying my skin.  </li>
            <li> First of all, great product.  </li>
            <li> This is a very smooth and gooey body wash.</li>
            <li> It smells nice but not too strong.</li>
            <li> My wife and kids love this body wash</li>
            <li> They would be better off switching to a squeeze bottle design.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this over a year ago from the Amazon Vine program in order to test and review, and it was one of my favorite products ever.</li>
            <li> (silky).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might have to purchase it more often if you like to use a lot of lather while washing.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I LOVE the smell of papaya and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; for many definitions (not all)</li>
            <li> Love this body wash.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> works great thanks .</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite though, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> Mine like many others was cracked upon arrival, however not to the degree that would effect the dispensing performance.  </li>
            <li> We started purchasing this more than a year ago because it contains no MEA, DEA, or TEA.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash...</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff.  </li>
            <li> its organic so no nasty chems on your skin</li>
            <li> Have used many of Nature&#x27;s Gate&#x27;s items and have always been pleased.</li>
            <li> I have used 3 bottles of this now and absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite body product brand ever.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash</li>
            <li> I love this body wash.  </li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t like this body wash since it takes a lot of product to form a good lather.  </li>
            <li> It did wonderful job on my skin cleaning but the scent somehow smells strange.</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate Papaya velvet moisture body wash is the perfect balance, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on my skin.</li>
            <li> The lack of that feeling kind of drives you to want to keep pouring on the soap and using it up too quickly.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t dry you out, and it smells great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many natural body washes, and most don&#x27;t match up to the good lather this one produces.  </li>
            <li> the reviews of it being a superior body wash were too much to pass up.</li>
            <li> Find it to suds up nicely and would say it is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Good, gentle body wash.  </li>
            <li> It smells SOOO good and lathers really well</li>
            <li> I really like Nature Gate, however, the papaya did not smell good, and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting cleaned.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s economical AND luxuriously wonderful at the same time.  </li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and it leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff, all the scents in this brand are great actually.</li>
            <li> In a easy to use pump (for me anyway)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As a result the product has a strong coconut odor.  </li>
            <li> It is a good basic body wash with nice ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think something so mild and moisturizing would really do the job, but I was pleasantly surprized.</li>
            <li> The smell is light and not overbearing.</li>
            <li> It took some getting use to, but I eventually like the light, papaya, fruity smell.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to switch over to products that are chemical free hence my purchase of this body wash.  </li>
            <li> Scent could be improved but overall, a great product.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and feels soft on your skin</li>
            <li> smells so goood, all natural, no harmful chemical and good price.</li>
            <li> Never dried my skin out and nice and sudsy :)</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> The smell, like the feel, is actually an odd kind of almost really good.</li>
            <li> I bought this because a website that evaluates skin care products listed it as one of the mildest body washes on the market, based on the fact that its cleansing ingredients include a significant amount of sodium cocoyl isethionate (SCI, a coconut-based surfactant that is known to be the mildest one used in skin care products).</li>
            <li> I appreciate that it has more natural ingredients in it than most products of this type.</li>
            <li> The product gets you plenty clean</li>
            <li> It seems to clean the skin</li>
            <li> But its cheap and worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I like it better than Dove body wash, and I really like Dove.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-This is unusual for me, but I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with how amazon packed everything.</li>
            <li> I expected this to be mild and non-drying based on the ingredients list, and have been happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, is vegan, has no scary ingredients, and gets really sudsy, which is sometimes a problem for natural products.</li>
            <li> sure why Nature&#x27;s Gate doesn&#x27;t make a bigger deal out of their very mild cleansing ingredients--maybe because surfactants have names that sound &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;synthetic&amp;#34; to people, while their marketing pitch is &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;botanical.&amp;#34; But body washes by definition contain surfactants, whether they market themselves as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or not.</li>
            <li> I love the ingredients and how its made, only thing I&#x27;d change is I wish it bubbled up more.</li>
            <li> The scent is nice and light and I definitely see a change in my skin...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an overwhelming sweet smell - just mild and pleasant (at least to me).  </li>
            <li> My new favorite shower gel.</li>
            <li> Having a pump on it is great, because it doesn&#x27;t a mess</li>
            <li> it is the only kind I use.</li>
            <li> smells good and moisterizes like expected.</li>
            <li> and they proved me right...</li>
            <li> Velvet is the right word to describe this product.  </li>
            <li> DID GO A LONG  WAY  AND MADE NICE SUDS.  </li>
            <li> if you have dry,sensitive skin and live in the desert you need this product I have found this works as good or better then the more expensive brands</li>
            <li> I loved it, it left my skin soo soft.  </li>
            <li> Most soaps super lather up but then leaves skin dry.</li>
            <li> Thanks again and God bless!</li>
            <li> like I did the first time.  </li>
            <li> I am not the first to complain about the dispensing mechanism of this product.  </li>
            <li> The first two substantive ingredients cited on the label of this body wash are extracted from coconut.  </li>
            <li> and that is all that really matters!</li>
            <li> That may be more to my taste, so I&#x27;m trying that one next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that guys would like the fragrance as it&#x27;s very fruity, but I think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Keeps skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Used by my whole family including kids!</li>
            <li> Its a great wash to moisturize but not leave a heavy residue afterwards, which many other body washes do.  </li>
            <li> smells good, definitely not long lasting.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft without over drying.  </li>
            <li> But this leaves skin feeling soft and clean.</li>
            <li> The longer I used it, the more dry my skin became.  </li>
            <li> large size</li>
            <li> Will work fine for the summer but probably wouldn&#x27;t do enough for my skin in the winter.</li>
            <li> But with repeated use, I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t need to use as much body wash</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I keep a bottle on my desk at work and the scent is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother me or anyone else.</li>
            <li> But if you really like the scent of papaya, go for it.</li>
            <li> B001CI6RQK Arm &amp; Hammer Essentials Natural Deodorant, Fresh, 2.5 oz.]]</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash.</li>
            <li> I have used the Nature&#x27;s Gate Papaya lotion and really like it, so thought I would try the body wash.  </li>
            <li> This is really a gem from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Love these products because they don&#x27;t have the harshest of the detergent and no real toxic chemicals , yet they are affordable.  </li>
            <li> This is not moisturizing, but it is a gentle cleanser</li>
            <li> nice smell, rinses well, natural, packaged in bag to prevent leaks into your other order.</li>
            <li> Other nature gate products are much better.</li>
            <li> The price is better than other on-line stores.</li>
            <li> Overall, the smell is not overpowering and, the clean is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[[1]]]</li>
            <li> smells good and natural but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Good lather and subtle scent.</li>
            <li> but otherwise this has been a decent product to meet my needs.</li>
            <li> and it leaked over everything in the box that luckily could be washed off; they gave a refund without asking for it back</li>
            <li> Lathers decent with a loofah.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the high rate..</li>
            <li> I even subscribed to it, but unfortunately amazon stopped carrying it; therefore I am happy to find it here from another vendor.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about 5 months, and it will continue to be a regular product for me as long as Amazon has it :)</li>
            <li> You feel the difference, clean and soft skin with a lovely very subtle scent.</li>
            <li> This body wash makes my extra dry skin feel much more smoother and soft</li>
            <li> Decent product, lathers well, not a heavy scent to it.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and had previously used strong soaps like dial.</li>
            <li> Now my skin feels clean but not tight and dry.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the most moisturizing body wash I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Further aggravation occurs when the pump will not return to the top, due to thickness of product, requiring the operator to manually pull it up.  </li>
            <li> It is mild and gentle and makes my skin soft, and also makes it less bumpy.</li>
            <li> It smells pretty strong straight from the bottle but very subtle when using.</li>
            <li> both my daughter and i developed utis after using this product - anyone else?</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I take baths, so I prefer using natural products.</li>
            <li> IT IS NATURAL  </li>
            <li> Natural product.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and this does not bother it.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nature&#x27;s Gate products before and loved them, but this time it&#x27;s a fail.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through most of a bottle, and it works well for me, leaving my skin less dry and itchy than even the &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The price is very good, too, considering that SCI is expensive, which is one of the reasons few companies use it.</li>
            <li> This new stuff DOES NOT SAY &amp;#34;VEVLET&amp;#34;, and the ingredients are different.  </li>
            <li> since I use their shampoo that comes in the same bottle and is equipped with the proper squeeze top, I save the top of the empty shampoo, and throw out the useless pump....</li>
            <li> something no other body wash has delivered.</li>
            <li> I had tried many other body washes and all seemed to dry my skin out too much or be too heavily scented which causes me to itch (allergies).</li>
            <li> the top nozzle was broken but product still usable.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more poorly thought out.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes shy away from fruit smells because they can be too sweet smelling, but this scent is just right.  </li>
            <li> The problem is this is a very viscous product that is being dispensed from a bottle that does not have a wide base and is compounded by the pump top that isn&#x27;t exactly square, therefore when being pumped, it wants to tip.</li>
            <li> They put only a tiny touch of fragrance in their products, and so far I haven&#x27;t had any allergy problems with any of them.</li>
            <li> Does not dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> IT DID NOT DRY MY SKIN.</li>
            <li> At first it was only a little bit.  </li>
            <li> Not much else to say; this is my new go-to body wash.</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t want to get too graphic, but no matter how much deodorant I use, I tend to sweat and at the end of the day, there is a little odor going on.</li>
            <li> The smell is subtle and the soap is gentle to my extremely sensitive, gluten allergic skin.</li>
            <li> Nature&#x27;s Gate makes a Hemp version of this body wash, which other reviewers describe as having a clean, grassy smell (despite the use of hemp oil in the product, they mean grass as in your lawn, not your recreational substance).</li>
            <li> Apparently no one from the company has ever used this product, in the packaging that they retail it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t linger long after a shower, so it&#x27;s tolerable.</li>
            <li> The smell does not stay long.</li>
            <li> in all, if your skin is itchy from using other soaps/body washes, definitely give this a try.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out but doesn&#x27;t feel too lotiony either.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry after.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates, so won&#x27;t dry out your skin</li>
            <li> And some botanicals are pretty irritating to the skin.</li>
            <li> After I press down, the pump doesn&#x27;t come back up</li>
            <li> skin wont be dry after using this !</li>
            <li> Since I typically shower alone, this only allows two hands for the process of putting the product onto the applicator.....</li>
            <li> Price is way less than the local grocery or &amp;#34;whole</li>
            <li> Well, my only in store option was the local health food market, which is unbelievably snobby and overpriced.</li>
            <li> The only problem is, my skin dried out from using it.  </li>
            <li> However I will agree with other reviewers that the pump doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> works as well as any other bodywash.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t tell any noticeable difference between it and another other body wash, so</li>
            <li> To read my other reviews, click the link \\&quot;See all</li>
            <li> cleansers offered by other brands.</li>
            <li> One bottle appeared to not be shut all the way, and had leaked on the outside of the bottle and one bottle&#x27;s pump had several pieces broken off apparently due to the other bottles rolling around on it.</li>
            <li> But I find it unpleasantly fruity, sweet, and coconut-y.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t get much of the scent when using this body wash</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t have to deal with storing it upside down when it&#x27;s almost gone.</li>
            <li> However, the smell is not strong and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my other products.</li>
            <li> Another reason it&#x27;s not more widely used is that milder surfactants tend to give you less suds.</li>
            <li> I found this a little odd since it is supposed to be moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not a deal breaker (I&#x27;m ordering another one because I&#x27;m running out), it does mean I have to pump with one hand and hold it down with the other, all while tossing around my bath sponge to try and get some gel on it.  </li>
            <li> My legs feel moisturized in the dead of winter.</li>
            <li> but, it does lack that slick surfactant feel that we&#x27;ve come to associate with soap.</li>
            <li> unfortunately I didn&#x27;t receive my last order do to shipping issue.</li>
            <li> It makes a lot of bubbles in my whirlpool tub, and doesn&#x27;t leave soap scum on the tub.</li>
            <li> Amended down 1 star caused me to break out and difficult to pump.</li>
            <li> but the pump sucks, the spring inside is weak and wears out, or comes broken.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this body wash.</li>
            <li> but it arrived damaged, the pump was broken off.</li>
            <li> Smell is very subtle.</li>
            <li> All of these are dangerous ethanolamines.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but will probably be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Nothing is really bad about this product.</li>
            <li> If you are expecting papaya, you&#x27;ll be sadly disappointed as was I</li>
            <li> Turns out this is almost impossible!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife and kids love this body wash and I am extremely happy to have found this product for this price. Great service and online experience! Thanks again and God bless!</li>
            <li> I love this body wash and loved the price on amazon even more!  Its a great wash to moisturize but not leave a heavy residue afterwards, which many other body washes do.  The smell is light and not overbearing.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not picky about body wash and sorts. But when I started looking into healthier products (animal-cruelty-free a must), I found this brand. You feel the difference, clean and soft skin with a lovely very subtle scent. I truly don&#x27;t think you need to use a lotion after this because it does the job. Plus, the bottle is a good size for the price. Two-three pumps is enough for each wash. Lets just say I&#x27;m strictly using this from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-K</li>
            <li> I liked the product: good price, pleasant scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering and it suds well.  However I will agree with other reviewers that the pump doesn&#x27;t work well...doesn&#x27;t dispense enough soap and it often gets stuck and has to be pulled up.  They would be better off switching to a squeeze bottle design.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this over a year ago from the Amazon Vine program in order to test and review, and it was one of my favorite products ever. It is mild and gentle and makes my skin soft, and also makes it less bumpy. I have oily skin and had previously used strong soaps like dial. I didn&#x27;t think something so mild and moisturizing would really do the job, but I was pleasantly surprized. Now my skin feels clean but not tight and dry. It makes a lot of bubbles in my whirlpool tub, and doesn&#x27;t leave soap scum on the tub. The scent is pleasant, but not overpowering. I appreciate that it has more natural ingredients in it than most products of this type. I even subscribed to it, but unfortunately amazon stopped carrying it; therefore I am happy to find it here from another vendor. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> the top nozzle was broken but product still usable. nice smell, rinses well, natural, packaged in bag to prevent leaks into your other order. Amended down 1 star caused me to break out and difficult to pump.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t like this body wash since it takes a lot of product to form a good lather.  But with repeated use, I&#x27;ve noticed that I don&#x27;t need to use as much body wash like I did the first time.  It might have been attributed to the fact that I was using another body wash (St. Ives Coconut Wash) before I using Nature&#x27;s Gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is just like it states on the bottle - papaya.  It took some getting use to, but I eventually like the light, papaya, fruity smell.  It&#x27;s not an overwhelming sweet smell - just mild and pleasant (at least to me).  This body wash makes my extra dry skin feel much more smoother and soft (silky).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might have to purchase it more often if you like to use a lot of lather while washing.  But its cheap and worth the price.  I definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> It smells nice but not too strong. I love the ingredients and how its made, only thing I&#x27;d change is I wish it bubbled up more.</li>
            <li> I loved it. Does not dry your skin out.</li>
            <li> smells good and natural but not overwhelming. works as well as any other bodywash.</li>
            <li> Ever since I&#x27;ve tried this body wash it is the only kind I use. It smells really good and feels soft on your skin</li>
            <li> I truly like this body wash. The scent is nice and light and I definitely see a change in my skin... something no other body wash has delivered. My legs feel moisturized in the dead of winter. I will order again.</li>
            <li> I like this body wash but it arrived damaged, the pump was broken off.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I LOVE the smell of papaya and the reviews of it being a superior body wash were too much to pass up. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t get much of the scent when using this body wash and I can&#x27;t tell any noticeable difference between it and another other body wash, so I won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Organic, no animal products or animal testing, and smells heavenly. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and does a great job</li>
            <li> smells so goood, all natural, no harmful chemical and good price. Soothe my sprit when I take a shower with it with a good lather. Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great smell to it, silky texture, I like it a lot.  Find it to suds up nicely and would say it is well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a good lightly fruity-scented medium weight moisturizer. Not greasy at all. I keep a bottle on my desk at work and the scent is light enough that it doesn&#x27;t bother me or anyone else.</li>
            <li> great all around! will buy again!</li>
            <li> They put only a tiny touch of fragrance in their products, and so far I haven&#x27;t had any allergy problems with any of them.</li>
            <li> Never dried my skin out and nice and sudsy :) I like it better than Dove body wash, and I really like Dove.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to switch over to products that are chemical free hence my purchase of this body wash.  I don&#x27;t find the papaya smell too pleasing but otherwise this has been a decent product to meet my needs.</li>
            <li> It did wonderful job on my skin cleaning but the scent somehow smells strange. It would be in my reorder list.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It&#x27;s &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; for many definitions (not all) and it smells really great.  It&#x27;s not overpowering but it&#x27;s nice.  I do struggle with the pump though.  After I press down, the pump doesn&#x27;t come back up so I have to manually do that.  While it&#x27;s not a deal breaker (I&#x27;m ordering another one because I&#x27;m running out), it does mean I have to pump with one hand and hold it down with the other, all while tossing around my bath sponge to try and get some gel on it.  The product it still great, but there is a challenge with the execution of the pump.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this product but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s the most moisturizing body wash I&#x27;ve had. Will work fine for the summer but probably wouldn&#x27;t do enough for my skin in the winter. I like the bottle with the pump on top, though!</li>
            <li> Love this body wash. I had tried many other body washes and all seemed to dry my skin out too much or be too heavily scented which causes me to itch (allergies). Nature&#x27;s Gate Papaya velvet moisture body wash is the perfect balance, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on my skin. I love it. I have been using this product for a year now. I am definitely a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> both my daughter and i developed utis after using this product - anyone else? smells good, definitely not long lasting.</li>
            <li> Decent product, lathers well, not a heavy scent to it.</li>
            <li> works great thanks . great smell.</li>
            <li> Great natural product with a pleasant smell that&#x27;s not overpowering. It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft without over drying.  I&#x27;m usually very happy with Nature&#x27;s Gate line of hair and skin products.</li>
            <li> I like the way this soap lathers and feels. Most soaps super lather up but then leaves skin dry. But this leaves skin feeling soft and clean. The smell isn&#x27;t my favorite though, it&#x27;s just okay. But if you really like the scent of papaya, go for it. I would purchase this body wash again, just not this scent.</li>
            <li> First of all, great product.  I&#x27;ve tried many natural body washes, and most don&#x27;t match up to the good lather this one produces.  The two stars is in hope that the company might read the review.  I am not the first to complain about the dispensing mechanism of this product.  Couldn&#x27;t be more poorly thought out.  Mine like many others was cracked upon arrival, however not to the degree that would effect the dispensing performance.  The problem is this is a very viscous product that is being dispensed from a bottle that does not have a wide base and is compounded by the pump top that isn&#x27;t exactly square, therefore when being pumped, it wants to tip. Further aggravation occurs when the pump will not return to the top, due to thickness of product, requiring the operator to manually pull it up.  Since I typically shower alone, this only allows two hands for the process of putting the product onto the applicator..... Turns out this is almost impossible!  Apparently no one from the company has ever used this product, in the packaging that they retail it in.&lt;br /&gt;My solutions has been....since I use their shampoo that comes in the same bottle and is equipped with the proper squeeze top, I save the top of the empty shampoo, and throw out the useless pump....great product with reasonable applicator top!</li>
            <li> We started purchasing this more than a year ago because it contains no MEA, DEA, or TEA. All of these are dangerous ethanolamines. You should look up what they can do to your brain. At the end, I will include three addresses to the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS). The product gets you plenty clean but, it does lack that slick surfactant feel that we&#x27;ve come to associate with soap. The lack of that feeling kind of drives you to want to keep pouring on the soap and using it up too quickly. The smell, like the feel, is actually an odd kind of almost really good. Nothing is really bad about this product. It just glances at the goodness though. Of course, if I had never gotten use to the good feelings those toxic chemicals add, I&#x27;d probably be doing nothing but raving about this. Overall, the smell is not overpowering and, the clean is effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[[1]]] http://msdssearch.dow.com/PublishedLiteratureDOWCOM/dh_0044/0901b80380044789.pdf?filepath&#x3D;amines/pdfs/noreg/111-01388.pdf&amp;fromPage&#x3D;GetDoc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[[2]]] http://msdssearch.dow.com/PublishedLiteratureDOWCOM/dh_0044/0901b803800447ea.pdf?filepath&#x3D;amines/pdfs/noreg/111-01401.pdf&amp;fromPage&#x3D;GetDoc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[[3]]] http://msdssearch.dow.com/PublishedLiteratureDOWCOM/dh_017d/0901b8038017d302.pdf?filepath&#x3D;amines/pdfs/noreg/111-01375.pdf&amp;fromPage&#x3D;GetDoc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are products I use, and have reviewed, with this item.

            <li> Good, gentle body wash.  Leave my skin softer than traditional soaps.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great, is vegan, has no scary ingredients, and gets really sudsy, which is sometimes a problem for natural products. My new favorite shower gel.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash...unfortunately I didn&#x27;t receive my last order do to shipping issue.</li>
            <li> Good for our skin and lots of lather. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Be forewarned.  The first two substantive ingredients cited on the label of this body wash are extracted from coconut.  As a result the product has a strong coconut odor.  If you are expecting papaya, you&#x27;ll be sadly disappointed as was I</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this stuff.  The only problem is, my skin dried out from using it.  At first it was only a little bit.  The longer I used it, the more dry my skin became.  I found this a little odd since it is supposed to be moisturizing.  I&#x27;ve used Nature&#x27;s Gate products before and loved them, but this time it&#x27;s a fail.</li>
            <li> No issues. smells good and moisterizes like expected.</li>
            <li> I love this body wash! It smells SOOO good and lathers really well and that is all that really matters!</li>
            <li> This leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.  I just don&#x27;t like the pump or it would be 5 stars.  I feel like I&#x27;m always missing out on the last of the product in the bottom of the bottle without a real hassle to get it out.</li>
            <li> I really like Nature Gate, however, the papaya did not smell good, and I didn&#x27;t feel like I was getting cleaned.  Other nature gate products are much better.</li>
            <li> lovely creamy sudzy delightfully scented body wash&lt;br /&gt;good large size&lt;br /&gt;great pump for handy shower use&lt;br /&gt;and its organic so no nasty chems on your skin</li>
            <li> I sometimes shy away from fruit smells because they can be too sweet smelling, but this scent is just right.  It also gets me good and clean without overdrying my skin.  I often get red blotches on my skin after showering, but am not getting them anymore after I switched to this prodcut.  I was skeptical, but will probably be buying this again!</li>
            <li> I really like this body wash. It makes your skin feel so soft. I take baths, so I prefer using natural products. Have used many of Nature&#x27;s Gate&#x27;s items and have always been pleased.</li>
            <li> I have used 3 bottles of this now and absolutely love it. The smell is subtle and the soap is gentle to my extremely sensitive, gluten allergic skin. I use the corresponding Papaya body lotion and it is also wonderful. Bravo, Natures&#x27;s Gate!</li>
            <li> if you have dry,sensitive skin and live in the desert you need this product I have found this works as good or better then the more expensive brands</li>
            <li> Smells good and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I have used the Nature&#x27;s Gate Papaya lotion and really like it, so thought I would try the body wash.  It&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this because a website that evaluates skin care products listed it as one of the mildest body washes on the market, based on the fact that its cleansing ingredients include a significant amount of sodium cocoyl isethionate (SCI, a coconut-based surfactant that is known to be the mildest one used in skin care products). I&#x27;ve gone through most of a bottle, and it works well for me, leaving my skin less dry and itchy than even the &amp;#34;moisturizing&amp;#34; cleansers offered by other brands. The price is very good, too, considering that SCI is expensive, which is one of the reasons few companies use it. Another reason it&#x27;s not more widely used is that milder surfactants tend to give you less suds. But I find this product plenty sudsy enough for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure why Nature&#x27;s Gate doesn&#x27;t make a bigger deal out of their very mild cleansing ingredients--maybe because surfactants have names that sound &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;synthetic&amp;#34; to people, while their marketing pitch is &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;botanical.&amp;#34; But body washes by definition contain surfactants, whether they market themselves as &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or not. And some botanicals are pretty irritating to the skin. So what works best for me is to ignore the marketing pitch and just read the ingredients list. I expected this to be mild and non-drying based on the ingredients list, and have been happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m knocking off one star for the smell. This is strictly a matter of personal taste: plenty of others seem to like it. But I find it unpleasantly fruity, sweet, and coconut-y. It doesn&#x27;t linger long after a shower, so it&#x27;s tolerable. Nature&#x27;s Gate makes a Hemp version of this body wash, which other reviewers describe as having a clean, grassy smell (despite the use of hemp oil in the product, they mean grass as in your lawn, not your recreational substance). That may be more to my taste, so I&#x27;m trying that one next.</li>
            <li> This is really a gem from Amazon.  It&#x27;s economical AND luxuriously wonderful at the same time.  Been using it for about 5 months, and it will continue to be a regular product for me as long as Amazon has it :)</li>
            <li> Great size that I bought for my kitchen sink but there is no paper seal and it leaked over everything in the box that luckily could be washed off; they gave a refund without asking for it back so I can&#x27;t complain....and Zout does the same leaking without seal only they make you return it...they have to work on these points.  The pump on this didn&#x27;t work at all.  I was worried about this before I ordered it and they proved me right...</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the high rate.. but it&#x27;s just body wash shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance and it leaves my skin feeling clean and moisturized.  I&#x27;m not sure that guys would like the fragrance as it&#x27;s very fruity, but I think it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> My favorite body product brand ever.</li>
            <li> IT IS NATURAL  HOWEVER  NOT  SO MOISTURISING .  IT DID  NOT SMELL GREAT  IT  DID GO A LONG  WAY  AND MADE NICE SUDS.  IT DID NOT DRY MY SKIN.</li>
            <li> I used to give this product 5 stars.  I loved it, it left my skin soo soft.  This new stuff DOES NOT SAY &amp;#34;VEVLET&amp;#34;, and the ingredients are different.  It seems to clean the skin so well it strips it.  Way do companies change formulations?  Bring back the Velvet formula!!!!!</li>
            <li> Like the soap but with each bottle the pump does NOT work!</li>
            <li> I love this body wash but the pump sucks, the spring inside is weak and wears out, or comes broken.</li>
            <li> Good lather and subtle scent. It smells pretty strong straight from the bottle but very subtle when using. I would recommend if you like the smell of tropical fruits.</li>
            <li> Not very impressed with this body wash. The smell does not stay long.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, all the scents in this brand are great actually. Doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out but doesn&#x27;t feel too lotiony either. Having a pump on it is great, because it doesn&#x27;t a mess and you don&#x27;t have to deal with storing it upside down when it&#x27;s almost gone. Awesome.</li>
            <li> Lovely smell! Natural product. feel great about this choice.</li>
            <li> This is a very smooth and gooey body wash. It has a nice smell and is great for shaving instead of a shave cream for the pits and legs. My skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry after. Price is way less than the local grocery or &amp;#34;whole food&amp;#34; store. Deal.</li>
            <li> This has a nice smell, cleanses well.  In a easy to use pump (for me anyway)&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and this does not bother it.  It is a good basic body wash with nice ingredients.  Keeps skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> Scent could be improved but overall, a great product.</li>
            <li> Not as apricot-y as i would have liked.</li>
            <li> Recently at a women&#x27;s expo, I came across a sample of this stuff - never heard of it before. I tried it and it smelled AMAZING so I immediately went online to find out where I could buy it. Well, my only in store option was the local health food market, which is unbelievably snobby and overpriced. Then I found it here on amazon. I ordered it right away, and I&#x27;m happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-smells great&lt;br /&gt;-reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates, so won&#x27;t dry out your skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-limited availability, your best bet is probably to get it online&lt;br /&gt;-not the best at removing odor, I don&#x27;t want to get too graphic, but no matter how much deodorant I use, I tend to sweat and at the end of the day, there is a little odor going on. I find that it takes a lot of product, a lot of scrubbing, and a lot of time to wash all the odor out.&lt;br /&gt;-This is unusual for me, but I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with how amazon packed everything. One bottle appeared to not be shut all the way, and had leaked on the outside of the bottle and one bottle&#x27;s pump had several pieces broken off apparently due to the other bottles rolling around on it. Not a big deal, but could have been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, if your skin is itchy from using other soaps/body washes, definitely give this a try. It won&#x27;t dry you out, and it smells great!</li>
            <li> Love this soap!  Used by my whole family including kids!</li>
            <li> Velvet is the right word to describe this product.  I love this body wash.  It leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Smell is very subtle. Makes my skin soft. Lathers decent with a loofah. Nice to find a good paraben-free product!</li>
            <li> Wife loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love these products because they don&#x27;t have the harshest of the detergent and no real toxic chemicals , yet they are affordable.  This is not moisturizing, but it is a gentle cleanser and it smells wonderful.  However, the smell is not strong and doesn&#x27;t interfere with my other products.</li>
            <li> This body wash lathers nicely without the chemical additives and has a very pleasant fragrance! The price is better than other on-line stores.</li>
            <li> Smells great, feels great, cleans well. Nicely priced, like the pump bottle. Not much else to say; this is my new go-to body wash.</li>
            <li> like it !!!!&lt;br /&gt;good product!&lt;br /&gt;good quality!&lt;br /&gt;recommend you&lt;br /&gt;your skin wont be dry after using this !&lt;br /&gt;the best</li>
