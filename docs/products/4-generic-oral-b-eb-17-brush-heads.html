    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>They also work great!</li>
            <li>Very happy with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>works great at a great price.</li>
            <li>Worked good for 2 weeks, then the head of the brush stopped turning.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>These brush heads do work, but not as good as the brand name ones.</li>
            <li>The price was too good to pass up.  </li>
            <li>and it was a perfect fit.</li>
            <li>Every bit as good as the ones I paid much more for from Wal Mart!</li>
            <li>This did not happen for me; very pleased.</li>
            <li>I can tell you one thing, I&#x27;m ordering more, roll the dice!</li>
            <li>they work good, good fit on the handle and the bristles don&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li>I even waited a month, maybe even more, to write this review just in case</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with its results.</li>
            <li>A pretty good Brush heads, I had no problem when I used the Oral - B replacement brush heads, if your looking for a replacement brush</li>
            <li>They are much softer, leading one to think that they might not work as good.  </li>
            <li>This singular is perfect for my small mouth.</li>
            <li>each brush head is good only for one week !</li>
            <li>The packaging had German all over it, which is a good thing IMO.  </li>
            <li>the generic brand is just as good as the brand name.</li>
            <li>These fit my brush just fine, but they don&#x27;t stay attached very well, other than that, they are good.</li>
            <li>A few customers stated that they experienced bristles breaking off or coming apart during usage.</li>
            <li>Quality of the bristles is great, some do not fit snuggly</li>
            <li>They still work great, just makes me wonder if all these people who are complaining are crazy or did I just get the one batch of good brush heads?</li>
            <li>made me smile.</li>
            <li>one of them broke on me or didn&#x27;t work right</li>
            <li>The price is right.</li>
            <li>I have ordered more of these and plan to continue to use them as long as they are available.</li>
            <li>Decent product!!</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>The bottom part spins, but the top head part does not, so the internal shaft must break or become disconnected.</li>
            <li>All four brushes stopped working within the first week.</li>
            <li>First brush head broke after second try.now on the second one so far so good after</li>
            <li>The bristles are stiffer than the ones I have purchased from retail stores too which I really like.</li>
            <li>The head doesn&#x27;t fit the brush well and gives a very different feeling while brushing.</li>
            <li>Snug fit, quality bristles (I think the packaging indicated they were Dupont/teflon, but like I said it was in German).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll order genuine products next time.</li>
            <li>Just like the originals but much cheaper.  </li>
            <li>so I do not see much difference there anyway.</li>
            <li>(I still use the old manual style tooth brush), and she says they fit on to the device slightly differently.</li>
            <li>They actually work almost as well as the original floss action toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li>for the price the quality was very close to the much higher priced brush heads especially Oral B and others.</li>
            <li>The fit isn&#x27;t as tight on the Oral-B Vitality, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.  </li>
            <li>They fit snug and tight (Braun Oral B - Plak Control Ultra).  </li>
            <li>I hope they last as long as the original ones.  </li>
            <li>but I change my brush frequently</li>
            <li>have tried 3, all of them fit very tightly on a vatality - but still work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought a generic product in the past that was much better quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After about 2 weeks, the first one failed.&lt;br /&gt;After 1 day the 2nd one failed.&lt;br /&gt;They are breaking internally.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product or seller - there are other &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; brushes (soft ones even) that are far better.</li>
            <li>Will purchase these again in the near future.</li>

            <li> They seem to work as well as the more expensive ones, and last as long.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sucker deal, they are so darn cheap, but in this case you get a lot less than you pay for.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to buy these as long as they sell them here.</li>
            <li> They do not last as long as originals</li>
            <li> Bristles won&#x27;t come off as other generic brands.  </li>
            <li> Only got a few brushes from the pack because they all fell apart shortly after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered the larger, double or duel bristle rotating brush refills before and they were too harsh.</li>
            <li> They last less than a week.  </li>
            <li> I was a tad skeptical when I read the somewhat mixed, however positive reviews for this.</li>
            <li> No it is not original but generic product and if you expect it to work as a brand name</li>
            <li> some only lasted a few brushings.</li>
            <li> but I must admit I was skeptical at first</li>
            <li> This is an extremely inexpensive brush head.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve bought several things that other people complained about and when the product showed up</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the expensive ones found in stores.</li>
            <li> Each of these heads lasted less than 2 weeks, then the brush head snapped off.</li>
            <li> Did not fit Oral-B toothbrush correctly.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re better than the store brand generics, that I usually have a hard time with the heads staying on the base.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because it fits my base a little too snug, and I&#x27;ve actually had a little problem taking them off.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase these brush heads because of all the negative reviews I read</li>
            <li> After a few days they just vibrate instead of spinning and become worthless.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;it supposed to have Twisted head</li>

            <li> I failed to realize this brush did not have the longer flossing edges.</li>
            <li> Quite disappointing.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> First brush head broke after second try.now on the second one so far so good after&lt;br /&gt;one week.will see how it goes</li>
            <li> The brush heads work well for me.  The fit isn&#x27;t as tight on the Oral-B Vitality, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.  They seem to work as well as the more expensive ones, and last as long.  I have ordered more of these and plan to continue to use them as long as they are available.</li>
            <li> Worked good for 2 weeks, then the head of the brush stopped turning.&lt;br /&gt;Will NOT buy again. We will go with the brand name next time.</li>
            <li> These fit my brush just fine, but they don&#x27;t stay attached very well, other than that, they are good. thanks!</li>
            <li> I got these about 6 months ago. they work good, good fit on the handle and the bristles don&#x27;t come out. Can&#x27;t be beat especially for the price.</li>
            <li> They last less than a week.  After a few days they just vibrate instead of spinning and become worthless.  It&#x27;s a sucker deal, they are so darn cheap, but in this case you get a lot less than you pay for.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase these brush heads because of all the negative reviews I read but I&#x27;ve bought several things that other people complained about and when the product showed up, I remembered thinking, what the #$%! was everyone whining about? So I received these brush heads, and guess what, I thought to myself, what the #!%&amp; was everyone whining about! The heading says &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; but I received Oral-B Brush Heads, originals with Oral-B logos on each brush head. They also work great! Every bit as good as the ones I paid much more for from Wal Mart! The bristles are stiffer than the ones I have purchased from retail stores too which I really like. I even waited a month, maybe even more, to write this review just in case one of them broke on me or didn&#x27;t work right but that hasn&#x27;t happened. They still work great, just makes me wonder if all these people who are complaining are crazy or did I just get the one batch of good brush heads? I can tell you one thing, I&#x27;m ordering more, roll the dice!</li>
            <li> each brush head is good only for one week !&lt;br /&gt;it supposed to have Twisted head but after one week of using it become Loosen</li>
            <li> I hope they last as long as the original ones.  They fit snug and tight (Braun Oral B - Plak Control Ultra).  Bristles won&#x27;t come off as other generic brands.  I will definitely continue to buy these as long as they sell them here.</li>
            <li> The head doesn&#x27;t fit the brush well and gives a very different feeling while brushing. I bought a generic product in the past that was much better quality.</li>
            <li> These brush heads do work, but not as good as the brand name ones. They are much softer, leading one to think that they might not work as good.  The price was too good to pass up.  I will probably not buy them again.</li>
            <li> The packaging had German all over it, which is a good thing IMO.  Snug fit, quality bristles (I think the packaging indicated they were Dupont/teflon, but like I said it was in German).  Vibrates just the same as the Oral B brand</li>
            <li> Each of these heads lasted less than 2 weeks, then the brush head snapped off. Quite disappointing. I&#x27;ll order genuine products next time.</li>
            <li> Just like the originals but much cheaper.  Worked well for the grandchildren.  Will purchase these again in the near future.</li>
            <li> I am an engineer.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 12 of these.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried 3, all of them fit very tightly on a vatality - but still work.&lt;br /&gt;After about 2 weeks, the first one failed.&lt;br /&gt;After 1 day the 2nd one failed.&lt;br /&gt;They are breaking internally.  The bottom part spins, but the top head part does not, so the internal shaft must break or become disconnected.</li>
            <li> They are working well but I must admit I was skeptical at first but they work well and it was a perfect fit. They wear out when needed to be replaced with no issues.</li>
            <li> A pretty good Brush heads, I had no problem when I used the Oral - B replacement brush heads, if your looking for a replacement brush and you have a Oral B tooth brush then this should work for you.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than the expensive ones found in stores. My wife uses these (I still use the old manual style tooth brush), and she says they fit on to the device slightly differently. She thinks they are probably seconds, but says they work like they should. The price is right.</li>
            <li> The brushes failed after about a week&#x27;s use. some only lasted a few brushings. They to not seem to be replacements for the Oral-B brand.</li>
            <li> All four brushes stopped working within the first week. They&#x27;re junk! I sent them back to the seller and have not heard back. I still have no brushes and out the money for return shipping. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product or seller - there are other &amp;#34;generic&amp;#34; brushes (soft ones even) that are far better.</li>
            <li> I like these toothbrush heads. They actually work almost as well as the original floss action toothbrush heads. Decent product!!</li>
            <li> I will only buy these from now on.</li>
            <li> Only got a few brushes from the pack because they all fell apart shortly after use. Avoid this product at all cost! Did not fit Oral-B toothbrush correctly.</li>
            <li> I was a tad skeptical when I read the somewhat mixed, however positive reviews for this. A few customers stated that they experienced bristles breaking off or coming apart during usage. This did not happen for me; very pleased. I&#x27;ve ordered the larger, double or duel bristle rotating brush refills before and they were too harsh. This singular is perfect for my small mouth. It&#x27;s med/soft, and moves around my teeth/gums like a cotton ball. I am quite pleased with its results.</li>
            <li> They do what they are supposed to do. I haven&#x27;t noticed that they break all the time. I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> For the price you cannot beat this product. No it is not original but generic product and if you expect it to work as a brand name then you look elsewhere. I&#x27;m happy with it. They do not last as long as originals but I change my brush frequently so I do not see much difference there anyway. Quality of the bristles is great, some do not fit snuggly but they still do the job.</li>
            <li> the generic brand is just as good as the brand name. works great at a great price. I would purchase these again.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely inexpensive brush head.  Works as it was designed.  I use for my travel bag.  Cannot beat the price or quality. I failed to realize this brush did not have the longer flossing edges.</li>
            <li> The product fits the unit it was made for and continues to satisfy. Very happy with the purchase.  made me smile.</li>
            <li> for the price the quality was very close to the much higher priced brush heads especially Oral B and others.</li>
            <li> Every one of these brushes fell apart shortly after we began using them, and in one case pinched the inside of my son&#x27;s mouth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what others are talking about. I&#x27;ve used a couple of these brush heads for almost a month each and haven&#x27;t had any problems with bristles falling out. They&#x27;re better than the store brand generics, that I usually have a hard time with the heads staying on the base. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because it fits my base a little too snug, and I&#x27;ve actually had a little problem taking them off.</li>
