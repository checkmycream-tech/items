            <li>OK for what it was bought for.  </li>

            <li>The nail clippers work.the cuticle pushers are ok.</li>
            <li>Great and fast service.</li>
            <li>The design is cute too.</li>
            <li>No idea what most of this stuff is for</li>
            <li>but I love the case and the tools I do use are well made.</li>
            <li>Its kind of cheap.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the male that needs to groom and clean up.</li>
            <li>When I first got it, the case looked really nice.</li>
            <li>I used the clippers and worked fine.</li>
            <li>They also have a smell of cheap metal.</li>
            <li>Everything looking nice with this manicure set, I like the case that the instrument came in very convenient, I would recommend.</li>
            <li>Overall this was a good bargain.</li>
            <li>Case would not close, Quick adjustment made the correction.</li>
            <li>Great set, but the case is a little flimsy and feels like it&#x27;s about to break.</li>
            <li>Lots of gadgets which I had fun trying out.  </li>
            <li>I also very much like the case.</li>
            <li>Sharp and good quality nail care kit for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The case is exactly what my wife needed to keep these organized and in her purse.</li>
            <li>I will eventually buy a higher end kit in person</li>
            <li>Its been a few months now and all is good.</li>
            <li>I really like the product.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly more sturdy than expected ..</li>
            <li>Set arrived fast.</li>
            <li>Stainless steel set.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting much when I ordered this at this price ($9).  </li>
            <li>The case isn&#x27;t as manly as the stainless steel implements inside.  </li>
            <li>Got this manily for the smaller tools to get hang nails and was surprised at how sturdy the clippers are.</li>
            <li>The pieces were new and crisp, everything is in working order.</li>
            <li>Overall, the case alone is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Very heavy duty and perfect for my husbands thick man nails.</li>
            <li>but I love it, much harder to lose than my older much smaller one.</li>
            <li>nail clippers are sharp and nicely aligned, everything has solid construction of what looks like stainless brushed steel.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of the tools inside!  </li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I was right not to invest in the expensive ones, as this set is more complete and everything works like it should.</li>
            <li>Each grooming tool is substantially strong enough to tame men&#x27;s toe and finger nails.  </li>
            <li>Some of the tools weren&#x27;t sharp, but for the price I can&#x27;t really complain.</li>
            <li>the only bad thing it doesn&#x27;t close as good</li>

            <li> Bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> Not super solid build, but for price it cant be beat.</li>
            <li> good,but outcase is not very well</li>
            <li> The quality is really bad, and the design is kind odd!</li>
            <li> The clippers look nice, but one of the leatherette loops that holds nail clippers in place was broken on arrival, due to very poor sewing.</li>
            <li> None of the tools were sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also adding a photo of one of the nail clippers when I tried cleaning it, and when I cleaned it, I got all this black stuff.</li>
            <li> The case is a little tightly packed but we have had no problems with it not closing.</li>
            <li> I have very thick nails, especially thumb nails, and have always had to use toenail clippers on them.  </li>

            <li> While some are obvious, others are difficult to determine.</li>
            <li> I like how the case is small so you can bring it every where.</li>
            <li> but I have a hunch you could use at least 3 or 4 for nefarious purposes.</li>
            <li> I am not happy at all with the quality of these.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this set because of the price.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> The case itself is mediocre, but I am not going to complain given the quality of the tools.</li>
            <li> Bad investment.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Got it as a birthday gift. Great kit for a great price. Has so many things in the kit I don&#x27;t know what 1/2 of them are used for.</li>
            <li> OK for what it was bought for.  To KEEP MY HUSBAND from using my manicure set on his toe nails.  I would not want to use it.  but he thinks it&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li> good,but outcase is not very well</li>
            <li> I really like the product. has a lot of tools. the only bad thing it doesn&#x27;t close as good</li>
            <li> Very good quality products for the price and includes almost everything you could need. The case is a little tightly packed but we have had no problems with it not closing. I would buy it again</li>
            <li> Great value purchase! This set is of high quality and excellent functionality. I was right not to invest in the expensive ones, as this set is more complete and everything works like it should. nail clippers are sharp and nicely aligned, everything has solid construction of what looks like stainless brushed steel. The case is exactly what my wife needed to keep these organized and in her purse. before she just had nail clippers floating around in there nipping fingers when you were looking for things in there.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly more sturdy than expected ..</li>
            <li> Great set, but the case is a little flimsy and feels like it&#x27;s about to break.</li>
            <li> When I first got it, the case looked really nice. However, once I opened it, it was not so spectacular. The tools looks very rusty and dirty. They also have a smell of cheap metal. The nail clippers work.the cuticle pushers are ok. But the cuticle nippers do not work at all and dont even cut anything. I am not happy at all with the quality of these. Don&#x27;t buy them. I&#x27;m also adding a photo of one of the nail clippers when I tried cleaning it, and when I cleaned it, I got all this black stuff.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected but I love it, much harder to lose than my older much smaller one. The pieces were new and crisp, everything is in working order.</li>

            <li> Perfect for the male that needs to groom and clean up.</li>
            <li> It is very cheap. Do not buy it.</li>
            <li> Everything looking nice with this manicure set, I like the case that the instrument came in very convenient, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I would have given it a 5-Star rating if they had included a manual describing the recommended/intended use of the instruments. While some are obvious, others are difficult to determine.</li>
            <li> Great nail kit. Very heavy duty and perfect for my husbands thick man nails. Got this manily for the smaller tools to get hang nails and was surprised at how sturdy the clippers are. Nice case to hold everything. Great buy for the price</li>
            <li> The quality is really bad, and the design is kind odd!</li>
            <li> I like the kit and it feels like something that could last for generations. However not all the tools are what I would call &amp;#34;5-star&amp;#34; quality, especially the tweezers. I also admit I still don&#x27;t know what some of these tools but I have a hunch you could use at least 3 or 4 for nefarious purposes. Overall, the case alone is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this set because of the price.  I was wrong.  I have very thick nails, especially thumb nails, and have always had to use toenail clippers on them.  I decided to try the fingernail clippers and they actually worked on all of my fingernails, including thumbnails.  I am very impressed and glad that I ordered this set.  I would definitely order it again.  I also very much like the case.</li>
            <li> Sharp and good quality nail care kit for a reasonable price. The outer cover is attractive and the size makes it perfect for my purse or bag.</li>
            <li> Great and fast service.</li>
            <li> High quality product at great price!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the quality of this item.</li>

            <li> Stainless steel set. Case would not close, Quick adjustment made the correction. I used the clippers and worked fine. I am very pleased with this set.Its been a few months now and all is good.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and fast shipping :)</li>
            <li> Perfect and arrived just in time for girl&#x27;s pedicure night. Thank You</li>

            <li> Wow!  Impressive, weighted set!  Didn&#x27;t notice some tools have a smiley face. Can&#x27;t wait to use.</li>
            <li> Bad investment. None of the tools were sharp.</li>
            <li> Great kit. For the price it sells, this is great.</li>
            <li> Very nice set, many tools.</li>
            <li> Lots of gadgets which I had fun trying out.  Not super solid build, but for price it cant be beat.</li>
            <li> It is what you would expect for the price. I will eventually buy a higher end kit in person i think.</li>
            <li> No idea what most of this stuff is for but I love the case and the tools I do use are well made.</li>
            <li> The case isn&#x27;t as manly as the stainless steel implements inside.  Each grooming tool is substantially strong enough to tame men&#x27;s toe and finger nails.  The case is about the size of a man&#x27;s hand.  Overall this was a good bargain.</li>
            <li> Its kind of cheap. But great for the price.</li>
