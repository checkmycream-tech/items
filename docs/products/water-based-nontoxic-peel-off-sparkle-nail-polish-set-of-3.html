    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>washes great.</li>
            <li>an the price is great.</li>
            <li>Great for this grownup.  </li>
            <li>Great communication, customer service and a great product.</li>
            <li>I figured since they are brightly colored and peel off, parents won&#x27;t mind them.</li>
            <li>But, as products go, this is still probably the best children&#x27;s nail polish available.</li>
            <li>No ordor (which is good)</li>
            <li>I absolutely loved the colors and the quality of these nail polishes.</li>
            <li>I put some on my thumb and loved the color.</li>
            <li>She loved it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my niece and both her and my sister love it!</li>
            <li>safe and non toxic!</li>
            <li>Nice colors.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks so much for a great product!</li>
            <li>It is not for girls, very strong</li>
            <li>It comes off easy too!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s actually kind of cool!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s very important when my Grand daughter will be using it.</li>
            <li>My daughter has tried to eat some, so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s non-toxic as well</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Again, a healthy solution for childrens play.</li>
            <li>, they are &#x27;ok&#x27;</li>
            <li>I love this.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I Love that it is a non toxic product.</li>
            <li>and they love them....</li>
            <li>Will reorder for sure.</li>
            <li>But ok i guess.</li>
            <li>We will have to order more</li>
            <li>also like to mention the fantastic customer service!</li>
            <li>She got very excited and sat still for the painting process.</li>
            <li>this peel off product is great for all young girls who are into nails.</li>
            <li>My 4 year old is a one very happy girl :) Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Peels off easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to paint on moving fingers because if it gets on skin, just peel off.  </li>
            <li>Peels off easily too.  </li>
            <li>This looks just like nail polish and it dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>This applies very smoothly, dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily, dries quickly and is CUTE.</li>
            <li>Its perfect for her little fingers and toes.</li>
            <li>Our children&#x27;s safety is important to us.  </li>
            <li>It does peel right off, it tends to do this at the nail tip most often.</li>
            <li>My niece was so excited when I told her I bought it for her.</li>
            <li>The paint peels off easily and also goes on pretty easily.  </li>
            <li>I guessed right, parents have approved and they will be gifts!</li>
            <li>This peels off and gets kind of stretchy, but pretty much comes off in one piece.</li>
            <li>I apply about three coats and it will wear fairly well for several hours.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t tend to wear nail polish when I&#x27;m pregnant.</li>
            <li>Granted I have a SUPER sniffer now</li>
            <li>so I did get a mild odor</li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pregnant and strong odors</li>
            <li>But for a fun set of colors and safe on nails, I&#x27;d highly suggest this brand.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d</li>
            <li>I love this product for my 2 year old granddaughter!</li>
            <li>I quickly grabbed my daughter (2) and asked if she wanted pretty nails.</li>
            <li>Quick to dry and nice colors.</li>
            <li>I have also tried the peeling feature this morning (only tried off one nail) and it peeled off very easily</li>
            <li>The polish color does look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>She has been prancing around going \\&quot;pretty nails\\&quot; ever since.</li>
            <li>I hope the manufacturer replaces the bottles to plastic so that is safe for kids, other than that the actual polishes are nice matte colors.</li>
            <li>Quality time spent together with easy clean up and no harmful chemicals .</li>
            <li>I bought the nail polishes for my little niece, the colors are nice but they don&#x27;t sparkle.</li>
            <li>The polishes will soften in the bath and can be wiped or scraped gently off once they have soaked for a while.    </li>
            <li>hold up over a whole night, though.</li>
            <li>they work really well, but think they are very overpriced.</li>
            <li>really bother me</li>
            <li>My daughter has tried all 3 colors (a single layer of polish) and after months of baths and swimming it&#x27;s still staying strong.  </li>
            <li>As long as it stays dry, the polish is remarkably resilient and wearable for several days if you take fast showers.</li>
            <li>I love this product for little girls.</li>
            <li>Even little girls love polish.</li>
            <li>The glitter and pink are too light to see</li>
            <li>Tips wear down a bit at the end of the day, but its easy to touch up and go.  </li>
            <li>The paint also comes off pretty quickly in the pool, but with no swimming will stay on for a few days.</li>
            <li>This stains your nail, don&#x27;t put polish on directly over it!</li>
            <li>I am an adult and wear this!</li>
            <li>My Two and a hlaf year old has a blast painting her nails then mine.</li>
            <li>We ordered the strawberry from Allykats website directly.</li>
            <li>, I also have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>no mess.</li>
            <li>they peel off a little too easily but overall</li>
            <li>(if applied too thin you can scrape it off very easily too.</li>
            <li>Also, it would have been nice to get pink instead of the red as the pink is not currently offered for sale on Amazon.com.    </li>
            <li>but the only color you can really see is the blue.  </li>
            <li>I love that now we can wear some polish and not worry about the harsh chemicals that come with other nail polishes.</li>
            <li>Colors are a little muted and definitely needs two coats, but this is meant to be safe for the little ones so I can forgive that.</li>

            <li> I highly recommend this especially for little ones.</li>
            <li> When the bottle arrived I opened it and tested it out on my thumb, first thing I noticed was hardly any smell.</li>
            <li> Very thin polish, so goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> I expected that it would come off after a few baths (which is what I wanted) so we could put new on without having to break out the toxic nail polish remover.  </li>
            <li> The bottles are about the same size as a standard bottle of nail polish, not tiny, and they are a lot less toxic than other nail polish brands on the market.</li>
            <li> The other thing that irritated me a little was that the blue peeled off, but we could not get the purple or the red to peel off.</li>
            <li> so we had a big mess plus glass pieces all over the floor</li>
            <li> The pigments include a list of typical colors such as Green #6 and Blue #1 along with Titanium Dioxide.    </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s worse is it doesn&#x27;t really respond that well to nail polish remover either...</li>
            <li> I have a two-year-old and we use as few toxic products as possible.     </li>
            <li> so be careful if you are giving them to kids.</li>
            <li> Like the other AllyKat nailpolish, it wears all day with typing, driving, digging in workbag for materials.  </li>
            <li> We have looked at other non-toxic and water based nail polishes.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had other nail polishes that we bought at the store that claims its non-toxic etc</li>
            <li> Hardly any color at all to it and not lasting.</li>
            <li> My manicure is usually looking rough after a few hours.</li>
            <li> The pink and purple were hard to distinguish from one another once they were on.  </li>
            <li> not sure what to use now.  </li>
            <li> It is sparkly but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The brush is not very good, even after scrapping off excess paint on the sides of the bottle it is still goopy when trying to apply the polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several kinds of peel-off and usually, they either wipe away when you touch them or are very difficult to peel.  </li>
            <li> I did avoid painting her thumbs because she sucks her thumbs.</li>
            <li> Overall I am unimpressed and wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money.  :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that it was labeled \\&quot;non-toxic\\&quot; and yet, there were a couple of toxic substances listed on the back.     </li>
            <li> Colors were also weird and unattractive.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> this peel off product is great for all young girls who are into nails. no mess. washes great. water based. an the price is great. thanx brenda</li>
            <li> definitely peels off. My daughter has tried to eat some, so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s non-toxic as well</li>
            <li> This stains your nail, don&#x27;t put polish on directly over it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It comes off easy too! I bought this for my niece and both her and my sister love it!</li>
            <li> This is NOT water soluble.  My daughter has tried all 3 colors (a single layer of polish) and after months of baths and swimming it&#x27;s still staying strong.  I expected that it would come off after a few baths (which is what I wanted) so we could put new on without having to break out the toxic nail polish remover.  What&#x27;s worse is it doesn&#x27;t really respond that well to nail polish remover either... not sure what to use now.  Also does not peel off for us at all.  Colors were also weird and unattractive.  The pink and purple were hard to distinguish from one another once they were on.  Overall I am unimpressed and wish I wouldn&#x27;t have wasted my money.  :(</li>
            <li> Very thin polish, so goes on easily.  Peels off like a dream!  I&#x27;ve tried several kinds of peel-off and usually, they either wipe away when you touch them or are very difficult to peel.  This peels off and gets kind of stretchy, but pretty much comes off in one piece.</li>
            <li> Great for this grownup.  Like the other AllyKat nailpolish, it wears all day with typing, driving, digging in workbag for materials.  Tips wear down a bit at the end of the day, but its easy to touch up and go.  About every 3 days, I peel off polish in the shower and start all over.  No muss, no fuss.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. Peels off easily. (if applied too thin you can scrape it off very easily too. Nice colors.</li>
            <li> safe and non toxic! I am an adult and wear this!</li>
            <li> It is not for girls, very strong</li>
            <li> Bought this for my toddler and she loves the idea of painting her nails.  The paint peels off easily and also goes on pretty easily.  For that, I gave this product three stars.  However, this comes in a pack of three but the only color you can really see is the blue.  The glitter and pink are too light to see and I&#x27;m going to put 3 or 4 coats on a toddler.  The paint also comes off pretty quickly in the pool, but with no swimming will stay on for a few days.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail polish because I was looking for something non-toxic that didn&#x27;t need to be removed by any toxic chemicals. I have a two-year-old and we use as few toxic products as possible.     I was disappointed that it was labeled \\&quot;non-toxic\\&quot; and yet, there were a couple of toxic substances listed on the back.     Ingredients: Water, Vinyl Acetate, PVP, Glycerin, PPG-26-Buthte-26 / PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil, Sodium Benzoate, Triethanolamine, Methyl Paraben, Pigment. The pigments include a list of typical colors such as Green #6 and Blue #1 along with Titanium Dioxide.    Warning: Flammable    The other thing that irritated me a little was that the blue peeled off, but we could not get the purple or the red to peel off. The solution ended up being fairly simple. The polishes will soften in the bath and can be wiped or scraped gently off once they have soaked for a while.    Also, it would have been nice to get pink instead of the red as the pink is not currently offered for sale on Amazon.com.    But, as products go, this is still probably the best children&#x27;s nail polish available. The bottles are about the same size as a standard bottle of nail polish, not tiny, and they are a lot less toxic than other nail polish brands on the market. As long as it stays dry, the polish is remarkably resilient and wearable for several days if you take fast showers.</li>
            <li> Again, a healthy solution for childrens play. No toxic worries. Our children&#x27;s safety is important to us.  This is the answer.</li>
            <li> You put it on - you peel it off! Does what you want it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t hold up over a whole night, though. My manicure is usually looking rough after a few hours.</li>
            <li> No ordor (which is good) but I bought it because it advertized that it didn&#x27;t require nail polish remover to take off. The brush is not very good, even after scrapping off excess paint on the sides of the bottle it is still goopy when trying to apply the polish. The polish color does look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> bought these for my girls as a gift. they work really well, but think they are very overpriced. wish i would have had time to look in the store for these. they peel off a little too easily but overall, they are &#x27;ok&#x27;</li>
            <li> My niece was so excited when I told her I bought it for her.</li>
            <li> I love this.  Easy to paint on moving fingers because if it gets on skin, just peel off.  Quick to dry and nice colors.</li>
            <li> Love this product. My Two and a hlaf year old has a blast painting her nails then mine. Quality time spent together with easy clean up and no harmful chemicals .</li>
            <li> I Love that it is a non toxic product. That&#x27;s very important when my Grand daughter will be using it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely loved the colors and the quality of these nail polishes. My 4 year old is a one very happy girl :) Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Bought these for our granddaughters (ages 4-3-2-1) for Christmas and they love them....they paint - peel off and paint again . Will reorder for sure.</li>
            <li> Not like Tinkerbell&#x27;s Bo-Po. But ok i guess.</li>
            <li> I love this product for my 2 year old granddaughter! Its perfect for her little fingers and toes. Peels off easily too.  I highly recommend this especially for little ones.</li>
            <li> We have been looking for a nail polish for our daughter. We have looked at other non-toxic and water based nail polishes. But they are way more expensive. We ordered the strawberry from Allykats website directly. It was sent the next day and we received it very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pregnant and strong odors really bother me, I also have sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t tend to wear nail polish when I&#x27;m pregnant. When the bottle arrived I opened it and tested it out on my thumb, first thing I noticed was hardly any smell. Granted I have a SUPER sniffer now so I did get a mild odor but nothing bothersome. I put some on my thumb and loved the color. We&#x27;ve had other nail polishes that we bought at the store that claims its non-toxic etc and it was like putting colored water on the nails. Hardly any color at all to it and not lasting. This looks just like nail polish and it dries very quickly. It is sparkly but not overwhelming. I quickly grabbed my daughter (2) and asked if she wanted pretty nails. She got very excited and sat still for the painting process. I did avoid painting her thumbs because she sucks her thumbs. It goes on easily, dries quickly and is CUTE. She has been prancing around going \\&quot;pretty nails\\&quot; ever since. I have also tried the peeling feature this morning (only tried off one nail) and it peeled off very easily, it&#x27;s actually kind of cool! I love that now we can wear some polish and not worry about the harsh chemicals that come with other nail polishes. We will have to order more colors!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for a great product!</li>
            <li> I purchased these for some girls in my family entering their teens. I figured since they are brightly colored and peel off, parents won&#x27;t mind them. I guessed right, parents have approved and they will be gifts! I did however keep one for myself, the purple shade (like a grape purple). This applies very smoothly, dries quickly. I apply about three coats and it will wear fairly well for several hours. It does peel right off, it tends to do this at the nail tip most often. But for a fun set of colors and safe on nails, I&#x27;d highly suggest this brand.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d also like to mention the fantastic customer service! I wrote them with questions and they replied within 12 hours. Great communication, customer service and a great product.</li>
            <li> For my granddaughter. She loved it.</li>
            <li> I love this product for little girls. It&#x27;s something my granddaughters ages 8, 7 and 5 can use by themselves and is nontoxic. No remover necessary, simply peel off. Colors are a little muted and definitely needs two coats, but this is meant to be safe for the little ones so I can forgive that. Thank you for a nontoxic alternative. Even little girls love polish.</li>
            <li> I bought the nail polishes for my little niece, the colors are nice but they don&#x27;t sparkle. My issue is they are glass bottles and when we accidentally dropped one it broke so we had a big mess plus glass pieces all over the floor so be careful if you are giving them to kids. I hope the manufacturer replaces the bottles to plastic so that is safe for kids, other than that the actual polishes are nice matte colors.</li>
