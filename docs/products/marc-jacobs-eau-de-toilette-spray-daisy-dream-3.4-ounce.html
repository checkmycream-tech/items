            <li> gift for 13 year old granddaughter ,,,,,,,many thanks and hugs from her, she loves it. it has a pretty soft and flowery fragrance, i almost kept it!!.</li>
            <li> I only gave this fragrance 3 stars b/c of its inability to last a decent amount of time &amp; I was a lil disappointed in the actual smell itself. It smells good but not $50 good. I&#x27;ve gotten a couple of compliments on it. But I def don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s worth $50 dollars. I wish now I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. Considering I could&#x27;ve bought 2 perfumes that were more long-lasting &amp; I rly loved the fragrance. I&#x27;ve gotten much better smelling &amp; longer lasting perfume for MUCH, MUCH cheaper!</li>
            <li> This is such a wonderful fragrance!  It was delivered on time too!</li>
            <li> Delivered quick and in original packaging.</li>
            <li> I use this scent almost everyday! A MUST HAVE.</li>
            <li> This perfume is lovely! I get compliments on it all the time. It&#x27;s not overwhelming but the scent does last for a while. And you can&#x27;t beat the price! (cheapest price here from online and in stores) If you like sweet scents this is def for you. And the packaging is a plus, so cute! I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this perfume, 100 percent satisfied! One of my new favorites.</li>
            <li> This is a delightful scent. It is reminiscent of Daisy, which I adore, but it is slightly different, and I definitely agree that this scent lasts longer. If I spray this while wearing a jacket or blazer, the garment will retain the scent for ages. This one is also quite the crowd pleaser- my boyfriend always compliments how delish I smell when I am wearing this too. ;) I love Marc Jacobs fragrances! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Product as described.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Perfume was exactly what I was expecting and a great price!</li>
            <li> Just got it and live it! Soft and sweet.</li>

            <li> Wife is happy happy happy  ... Shipped really fast smells nice</li>
            <li> Excellent. I love my perfume. The service was outstanding.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it as much as I do the original Daisy but i would definitely order it as an alternative if i couldn&#x27;t get Daisy or need to switch it up.</li>
            <li> Just absolutely wonderful,a must buy</li>
            <li> On time and very cute package</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this perfume, I think it smells great as well, aesthetically the bottle is gorgeous .. 5 stars</li>

            <li> My boyfriend loves it.  I think it&#x27;s ok. A little young, powders down to a fresh powdery smell. Kind of generic.</li>
            <li> My husband ordered this for my birthday.  I have &amp; love both the Daisy &amp; Dot so naturally,  I would love the Daisy Dream... I do like the scent &amp; the bottle is beautiful. It&#x27;s light &amp; summery. But, it lasts maybe an hour after i apply it and then you can&#x27;t smell it anymore.  I receive so many compliments on the other two &amp; haven&#x27;t received one on this fragrance.  I will sadly be returning it. :(</li>
            <li> My daughter loved the fragrence!  Nice and refreshing.</li>
