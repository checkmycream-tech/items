            <li>Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything else, and the best part about it is it has replaceable cartridges.  </li>

            <li>lol.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>This is a remarkable tool.</li>
            <li>Pair this with a wonderful lotion and you will have smooth silky feet in no time!</li>
            <li>This is a good product and it worked well for me.</li>
            <li>Works great, the handle is a nice quality.  </li>
            <li>a gift for someone that loved mine.</li>
            <li>Also, the smoothing file is not as good as the emery files the Ped Egg comes with.</li>
            <li>this is the best device I have ever used and laready got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this micro-plane!</li>
            <li>This product worked perfectly the first time, and with the smoothing head, eliminated the need to use anything else.  </li>
            <li>My favorite addiction!</li>
            <li>love this product and would buy it for others!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and works great.</li>
            <li>The buffer plate is great for fine tuning afterwards.</li>
            <li>The blades are amazing.  </li>
            <li>This foot file is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I wish the handle was about two inches longer for ease of use but all in all I liked it</li>
            <li>Just to give you a sense of what I own...</li>
            <li>The curvature of the handle makes handling very easy.</li>
            <li>Best one I have used so far!</li>
            <li>bought it because of good experience with original mode.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shared this with everyone on my Facebook because it REALLY is that damn good of a file!</li>
            <li>Great product, works very well.</li>
            <li>The results are honestly better than going to a podiatrist.</li>
            <li>but you need to know when to stop and do more another day.</li>
            <li>I find an abrasive file (like Dr. Scholl&#x27;s) works better and is faster to use.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying one for everyone I love.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best foot file I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>If I tried to use it a bit more aggressively, it would just tear the skin.</li>
            <li>I bought it with the suggested O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Creme.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times already and absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the PedEgg which was ok.</li>
            <li>and it would just do an ok job.</li>
            <li>Love...</li>
            <li>love</li>
            <li>... love...</li>
            <li>Play it safe and find a comfort zone.</li>
            <li>I was checking the ergonomics of the handle more than the performance of the blades, but when I went to remove the blade cartridge</li>
            <li>I love the Microplane.  </li>
            <li>I have used some of the cheaper versions and they have torn by feet up because they are too aggressive in removing both the calluses and the healthy skin that is underneath.  </li>
            <li>Way better than a pet egg</li>
            <li>You will be glad you bought it.</li>
            <li>and I really love this product.</li>
            <li>(although it is sure to happen eventually).</li>
            <li>and she loves it much better than the ped egg</li>
            <li>A must have item for everyone that cares about the appearance and health of their feet!  :)&lt;</li>
            <li>The foot file took them off for the most part.</li>
            <li>My feet are much better</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and super effective.</li>
            <li>Loved this at first.</li>
            <li>The Microplane foot file works best on dry feet it says, and I have to agree, it works wonders on my feet.  </li>
            <li>Once the callous is gone, the file smoothly glides over healthy skin.  </li>
            <li>Will still need to see the podiatrist but will be more comfortable between visits.</li>
            <li>I had smooth, lovely feet in about 10 mins.  </li>
            <li>Given the good reviews, I thought I&#x27;d try this one, since it looked to have a much sturdier handle.  </li>
            <li>It is easy and comfortable to use and does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li>I love to see how much callus I am able to get off my feet!</li>
            <li>I did not pay attention if it came with instructions, but when using the buffer, it&#x27;s best to perform circular motions due to the shape of the apertures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; does the job.</li>
            <li>When it arrived I tried it out for a couple minutes just to see how easy it was to use.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt, and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>I purchased this one and the difference is HUGE.</li>
            <li>This file is FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li>Within days my winter feet were smooth as a baby bottom.  </li>
            <li>and it does make my feet smooth.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel a thing, was amazing how much skin came</li>
            <li>The fact that blade replacement is available is an additional bonus.</li>
            <li>Plus, the handle on this is so comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>The shavings stay in the handle and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I checked my heels and they were smooth.  </li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable to use and doesn&#x27;t bend or flex when using it.  </li>
            <li>The cap also fastens securely to cover the blades so you can throw this in a drawer without worrying about nicking anything.  </li>
            <li>The handle size/shape is comfortable and shape of head enables getting into curves.  </li>
            <li>and it keeps them so smooth.  </li>
            <li>I have beautiful feet but after 15 years of ballet they are not soft.</li>
            <li>It works just as described and is quick, easy and painless.</li>
            <li>I worked great on my feet, it took the dry skin off with no problem and now I have smooth feet.</li>
            <li>I still have my original.  </li>
            <li>I would say use the Microplane Foot File, and just buy some super fine sandpaper for smoothing.</li>
            <li>It is fairly agressive at removing the skin but not so much that I was worried about removing too much skin.  </li>
            <li>I  have had to remove calluses most of my life with a straight edge razor blade.</li>
            <li>It takes half the time of PedEgg and leaves my feet smooth beyond anything I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li>So I need something I can just grab and do the job quickly in between pedi&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It was quick and painless.</li>
            <li>I have skinny feet and high arches, so its like my feet try to become broader and flatter with the callouses :)  </li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Buy it, use it gently and sparingly -- and enjoy soft, nice feet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to file off a bit too much so your feet are tender after.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to get carried away and not realize how much skin you&#x27;ve removed.</li>
            <li>This product is like the Ped Egg used to be only way BETTER!</li>
            <li>If you DO plan on disinfecting them, you might be better off washing them with soap and water and then using a spray disinfectant and allowing them to air dry instead of submerging them, or make sure you don&#x27;t submerge them longer than 10 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li>(I give them a workout), but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li>The cartridge system is kind of fussy, but not a big deal.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more masculine appeal (no lame ass name like pedi-egg).  </li>
            <li>This is a great tool for removing small calluses.  </li>
            <li>were.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot afford as many pedicures as I would like, but this little tool does a better job than what you would get in a salon.</li>
            <li>This works right from the first use.  </li>
            <li>This foot file does an amazing job of removing dead skin and making your feet smooth.</li>
            <li>I had a Pedi-Egg foot file on a stick that I really liked and thought did a great job of cutting through the hooves that develop at the end of my legs.  </li>
            <li>This thing made my feet very soft and smooth to the point my feet felt like silk.  </li>
            <li>After using this the first time I believe I will never have to use the razor blades again.</li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t pretty at all.</li>
            <li>I rarely leave comments about products I purchase on Amazon although customer feedback has really helped inform my decisions in making purchases, including this one.</li>
            <li>You actually have to be careful because, while completely safe, it&#x27;s so effective</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This unit actual works in a healthy way.  </li>
            <li>Wow,  wonderful results, removes thick skin very well.  </li>
            <li>This thing is pretty much miraculous!</li>
            <li>buffing cartridge is a great bonus not available with most other metal files.</li>
            <li>Still a decent product for the price, but there are better for just a few more dollars.</li>
            <li>I use a specific heel cream everyday and my feet look very good.</li>
            <li>It is powerful so be very careful on your first try, but once you become accustomed to it, you&#x27;ll love it also.  </li>
            <li>The Microplane doesn&#x27;t require anywhere near as much pressure as the Pedi-Egg did to achieve far better results.  </li>
            <li>When I read the reviews on this I expected a super strong almost indestructible file.</li>
            <li>Easily removes that extra layer of skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to everyone with callus!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I received the Microplane foot file in a reasonable amount of time for it being shipped overseas to my APO and used it that night.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really work well on my feet.</li>
            <li>I like that you can buy replacement plates so you don&#x27;t have to buy another whole product when the blades wear out.</li>
            <li>High Quality !</li>
            <li>Smooth skin left remaining.</li>
            <li>My feet are finally normal-looking and smooth, and the cracks have healed up.</li>
            <li>I bought this based on reviews, and as I used it I was mindful that many said to be careful because it will remove your skin.</li>
            <li>I used it, gently, and could not believe how baby-smooth my feet</li>
            <li>Really does what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I was amazed by how much yuck was in there.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are no help really.</li>
            <li>but I wish it was a bit smaller to fit between my toes.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much effort either.  </li>
            <li>Once you get the dead skin off - get some good foot cream (with urea) to keep them soft</li>
            <li>One is for filing (to remove excess skin) and the other is more of a buffer to make your feet extra smooth.  </li>
            <li>and I can see why it is more expansive than the other unit.</li>
            <li>These rasps just work so much better than any other type of rasp out there.</li>
            <li>The extra long handle is great for people like me with back problems!  </li>
            <li>I suppose you could damage healthy skin if you used enough pressure, but it&#x27;s amazing how little pressure you need to actually get rid of callouses.  </li>
            <li>We have the larger Colossal foot rasp and love it but wanted a smaller, more controllable version for small calluses and corns.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is flat compared to the curved blade of the Colossal rasp, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference since everything you file on is curved.  </li>
            <li>You get so much more off of your foot in less time with this than the ped egg!  </li>
            <li>I am confident this is because I left it submerged in disinfectant for too long (times get very busy in the salon</li>
            <li>I also picked this up because every other file I found was too feminine in design, and this fit the bill with</li>
            <li>I have used Ped egg for years and gave one of these new Microplane files to my daughter as a gift as it looks nicer in a gift basket</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference!.  </li>
            <li>This version cuts the same as the larger rasp but gives better control on smaller areas.  </li>
            <li>The only part that is not quite as good is the shallow well for holding skin shavings.</li>
            <li>No digging, no blood, no pain, just gentle sanding that is way more effective than any pumice stone or other item designed for getting rid of the tough, dry, scaly skin on your feet!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say this thing worked wonders for my feet, and it certainly will do the same for yours!  </li>
            <li>The grater is sharp, gets the job done quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>I use it less often than with other products because it is so effective.</li>
            <li>Your feet will feel great - relieved of the dead thick, skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best implement I&#x27;ve found yet to get the dead skin off my formerly scary feet.</li>
            <li>The tools above would smooth but would never really get rid of the thickened skin.</li>
            <li>Follow the directions and get professional results every time.</li>
            <li>This Microplane file took it just about completely off</li>
            <li>The second time was just maintenance, really -- and that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve needed since.</li>
            <li>When I ordered this micro-plane I really didn&#x27;t expect a big difference in performance.</li>
            <li>It  has my feet feeling baby soft in no time.</li>
            <li>I am a professional nail tech</li>
            <li>As far as I am concerned, I would not use anything else.  </li>
            <li>I plan to purchase a few more for family members with the same problem.</li>
            <li>Although the reviews were excellent on this product, I was still doubtful it would take care of &amp;</li>
            <li>Clean up is a snap, just unclipp it, &amp; the dump the dead skin.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it dulled after that first use and I couldn&#x27;t get any more callus removed.</li>
            <li>Definitely, this is a keeper and highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The first time, I got rid of every rough and craggy spot.</li>
            <li>Changing the heads is easy too, although I&#x27;ve never had one go dull on me yet</li>
            <li>Item is priced right and should last a long time if used properly.</li>
            <li>However, quickly noticed that it was extremely hard to get certain areas because the shape is completely flat.</li>
            <li>My advice is to use this file in between sessions of the coarse version, particularly to gradually remove any deep fissures.</li>
            <li>Not great, just ok.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you have feet that are worn out from overuse and dry from winter.  </li>
            <li>The very first time I used it, it shaved off the heavy callous I develop on the edge of my big toe.</li>
            <li>Changing the discs can be a little clunky on the first try because it feels like you might break something trying to snap them back in.</li>
            <li>You can purchase refills when dull (I get about 6 months use before I want to replace the blades), but its cheaper to just order a whole new set.</li>

            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shared this with everyone on my Facebook because it REALLY is that damn good of a file!</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well.</li>
            <li> The results are honestly better than going to a podiatrist.</li>
            <li> but you need to know when to stop and do more another day.</li>
            <li> I find an abrasive file (like Dr. Scholl&#x27;s) works better and is faster to use.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying one for everyone I love.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best foot file I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> If I tried to use it a bit more aggressively, it would just tear the skin.</li>
            <li> I bought it with the suggested O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Creme.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times already and absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the PedEgg which was ok.</li>
            <li> and it would just do an ok job.</li>
            <li> Love...</li>
            <li> love</li>
            <li> ... love...</li>
            <li> Play it safe and find a comfort zone.</li>
            <li> I was checking the ergonomics of the handle more than the performance of the blades, but when I went to remove the blade cartridge</li>
            <li> I love the Microplane.  </li>
            <li> I have used some of the cheaper versions and they have torn by feet up because they are too aggressive in removing both the calluses and the healthy skin that is underneath.  </li>
            <li> Way better than a pet egg</li>
            <li> You will be glad you bought it.</li>
            <li> and I really love this product.</li>
            <li> (although it is sure to happen eventually).</li>
            <li> and she loves it much better than the ped egg</li>
            <li> A must have item for everyone that cares about the appearance and health of their feet!  :)&lt;</li>
            <li> The foot file took them off for the most part.</li>
            <li> My feet are much better</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and super effective.</li>
            <li> Loved this at first.</li>
            <li> The Microplane foot file works best on dry feet it says, and I have to agree, it works wonders on my feet.  </li>
            <li> Once the callous is gone, the file smoothly glides over healthy skin.  </li>
            <li> Will still need to see the podiatrist but will be more comfortable between visits.</li>
            <li> I had smooth, lovely feet in about 10 mins.  </li>
            <li> Given the good reviews, I thought I&#x27;d try this one, since it looked to have a much sturdier handle.  </li>
            <li> It is easy and comfortable to use and does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li> I love to see how much callus I am able to get off my feet!</li>
            <li> I did not pay attention if it came with instructions, but when using the buffer, it&#x27;s best to perform circular motions due to the shape of the apertures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; does the job.</li>
            <li> When it arrived I tried it out for a couple minutes just to see how easy it was to use.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt, and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one and the difference is HUGE.</li>
            <li> This file is FANTASTIC.  </li>
            <li> Within days my winter feet were smooth as a baby bottom.  </li>
            <li> and it does make my feet smooth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel a thing, was amazing how much skin came</li>
            <li> The fact that blade replacement is available is an additional bonus.</li>
            <li> Plus, the handle on this is so comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> The shavings stay in the handle and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I checked my heels and they were smooth.  </li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable to use and doesn&#x27;t bend or flex when using it.  </li>
            <li> The cap also fastens securely to cover the blades so you can throw this in a drawer without worrying about nicking anything.  </li>
            <li> The handle size/shape is comfortable and shape of head enables getting into curves.  </li>
            <li> and it keeps them so smooth.  </li>
            <li> I have beautiful feet but after 15 years of ballet they are not soft.</li>
            <li> It works just as described and is quick, easy and painless.</li>
            <li> I worked great on my feet, it took the dry skin off with no problem and now I have smooth feet.</li>
            <li> I still have my original.  </li>
            <li> I would say use the Microplane Foot File, and just buy some super fine sandpaper for smoothing.</li>
            <li> It is fairly agressive at removing the skin but not so much that I was worried about removing too much skin.  </li>
            <li> I  have had to remove calluses most of my life with a straight edge razor blade.</li>
            <li> It takes half the time of PedEgg and leaves my feet smooth beyond anything I have ever experienced.</li>
            <li> So I need something I can just grab and do the job quickly in between pedi&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> It was quick and painless.</li>
            <li> I have skinny feet and high arches, so its like my feet try to become broader and flatter with the callouses :)  </li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Buy it, use it gently and sparingly -- and enjoy soft, nice feet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to file off a bit too much so your feet are tender after.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to get carried away and not realize how much skin you&#x27;ve removed.</li>
            <li> This product is like the Ped Egg used to be only way BETTER!</li>
            <li> If you DO plan on disinfecting them, you might be better off washing them with soap and water and then using a spray disinfectant and allowing them to air dry instead of submerging them, or make sure you don&#x27;t submerge them longer than 10 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> (I give them a workout), but it&#x27;s totally worth it.</li>
            <li> The cartridge system is kind of fussy, but not a big deal.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more masculine appeal (no lame ass name like pedi-egg).  </li>
            <li> This is a great tool for removing small calluses.  </li>
            <li> were.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot afford as many pedicures as I would like, but this little tool does a better job than what you would get in a salon.</li>
            <li> This works right from the first use.  </li>
            <li> This foot file does an amazing job of removing dead skin and making your feet smooth.</li>
            <li> I had a Pedi-Egg foot file on a stick that I really liked and thought did a great job of cutting through the hooves that develop at the end of my legs.  </li>
            <li> This thing made my feet very soft and smooth to the point my feet felt like silk.  </li>
            <li> After using this the first time I believe I will never have to use the razor blades again.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t pretty at all.</li>
            <li> I rarely leave comments about products I purchase on Amazon although customer feedback has really helped inform my decisions in making purchases, including this one.</li>
            <li> You actually have to be careful because, while completely safe, it&#x27;s so effective</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This unit actual works in a healthy way.  </li>
            <li> Wow,  wonderful results, removes thick skin very well.  </li>
            <li> This thing is pretty much miraculous!</li>
            <li> buffing cartridge is a great bonus not available with most other metal files.</li>
            <li> Still a decent product for the price, but there are better for just a few more dollars.</li>
            <li> I use a specific heel cream everyday and my feet look very good.</li>
            <li> It is powerful so be very careful on your first try, but once you become accustomed to it, you&#x27;ll love it also.  </li>
            <li> The Microplane doesn&#x27;t require anywhere near as much pressure as the Pedi-Egg did to achieve far better results.  </li>
            <li> When I read the reviews on this I expected a super strong almost indestructible file.</li>
            <li> Easily removes that extra layer of skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to everyone with callus!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I received the Microplane foot file in a reasonable amount of time for it being shipped overseas to my APO and used it that night.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really work well on my feet.</li>
            <li> I like that you can buy replacement plates so you don&#x27;t have to buy another whole product when the blades wear out.</li>
            <li> High Quality !</li>
            <li> Smooth skin left remaining.</li>
            <li> My feet are finally normal-looking and smooth, and the cracks have healed up.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews, and as I used it I was mindful that many said to be careful because it will remove your skin.</li>
            <li> I used it, gently, and could not believe how baby-smooth my feet</li>
            <li> Really does what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I was amazed by how much yuck was in there.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are no help really.</li>
            <li> but I wish it was a bit smaller to fit between my toes.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much effort either.  </li>
            <li> Once you get the dead skin off - get some good foot cream (with urea) to keep them soft</li>
            <li> One is for filing (to remove excess skin) and the other is more of a buffer to make your feet extra smooth.  </li>
            <li> and I can see why it is more expansive than the other unit.</li>
            <li> These rasps just work so much better than any other type of rasp out there.</li>
            <li> The extra long handle is great for people like me with back problems!  </li>
            <li> I suppose you could damage healthy skin if you used enough pressure, but it&#x27;s amazing how little pressure you need to actually get rid of callouses.  </li>
            <li> We have the larger Colossal foot rasp and love it but wanted a smaller, more controllable version for small calluses and corns.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is flat compared to the curved blade of the Colossal rasp, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference since everything you file on is curved.  </li>
            <li> You get so much more off of your foot in less time with this than the ped egg!  </li>
            <li> I am confident this is because I left it submerged in disinfectant for too long (times get very busy in the salon</li>
            <li> I also picked this up because every other file I found was too feminine in design, and this fit the bill with</li>
            <li> I have used Ped egg for years and gave one of these new Microplane files to my daughter as a gift as it looks nicer in a gift basket</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference!.  </li>
            <li> This version cuts the same as the larger rasp but gives better control on smaller areas.  </li>
            <li> The only part that is not quite as good is the shallow well for holding skin shavings.</li>
            <li> No digging, no blood, no pain, just gentle sanding that is way more effective than any pumice stone or other item designed for getting rid of the tough, dry, scaly skin on your feet!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say this thing worked wonders for my feet, and it certainly will do the same for yours!  </li>
            <li> The grater is sharp, gets the job done quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> I use it less often than with other products because it is so effective.</li>
            <li> Your feet will feel great - relieved of the dead thick, skin.</li>
            <li> This is the best implement I&#x27;ve found yet to get the dead skin off my formerly scary feet.</li>
            <li> The tools above would smooth but would never really get rid of the thickened skin.</li>
            <li> Follow the directions and get professional results every time.</li>
            <li> This Microplane file took it just about completely off</li>
            <li> The second time was just maintenance, really -- and that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve needed since.</li>
            <li> When I ordered this micro-plane I really didn&#x27;t expect a big difference in performance.</li>
            <li> It  has my feet feeling baby soft in no time.</li>
            <li> I am a professional nail tech</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned, I would not use anything else.  </li>
            <li> I plan to purchase a few more for family members with the same problem.</li>
            <li> Although the reviews were excellent on this product, I was still doubtful it would take care of &amp;</li>
            <li> Clean up is a snap, just unclipp it, &amp; the dump the dead skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it dulled after that first use and I couldn&#x27;t get any more callus removed.</li>
            <li> Definitely, this is a keeper and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The first time, I got rid of every rough and craggy spot.</li>
            <li> Changing the heads is easy too, although I&#x27;ve never had one go dull on me yet</li>
            <li> Item is priced right and should last a long time if used properly.</li>
            <li> However, quickly noticed that it was extremely hard to get certain areas because the shape is completely flat.</li>
            <li> My advice is to use this file in between sessions of the coarse version, particularly to gradually remove any deep fissures.</li>
            <li> Not great, just ok.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you have feet that are worn out from overuse and dry from winter.  </li>
            <li> The very first time I used it, it shaved off the heavy callous I develop on the edge of my big toe.</li>
            <li> Changing the discs can be a little clunky on the first try because it feels like you might break something trying to snap them back in.</li>
            <li> You can purchase refills when dull (I get about 6 months use before I want to replace the blades), but its cheaper to just order a whole new set.</li>
            <li> After a few seconds of use it was clear, not only is it painless, but removes the thick skin rather quickly.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this at first and the price didn&#x27;t help out much.  </li>
            <li> In a couple minutes with not much effort, I had cleared more dead skin off my feet than I usually did in half an hour of using my old Pedi-Egg.  </li>
            <li> so I do not know how long the blade will last but compared to pumice, files, etc.</li>
            <li> Wide handle is easy to grip; blades are sharp so it is meant to be used at a shallow angle to the skin.</li>
            <li> Neither could really deal with the areas where the skin was just thick.</li>
            <li> I have used the Ped Egg for years, and loved it, but the past few years I can&#x27;t find one that is sharp, and the replacement blades are even worse.</li>
            <li> I need so little of it, it will likely last 8 months, if not a year.</li>
            <li> I sure was wrong!....</li>
            <li> I had problems with callus on my feet for a very long time.</li>
            <li> tried for first time; very easy to use; it filed down the hard painful callus on the ball of foot and on the side by the baby toe.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with dry, callous-ridden feet for as long as I can remember and have spent plenty on of all kinds of ointments and files to keep my feet looking presentable.  </li>
            <li> Pedicures are little too metro for him, so I&#x27;ve been on a constant hunt for something to address this.</li>
            <li> My heels were cracked and dirty looking before I started but after just rubbing for about 2 minutes they are smooth as a babies</li>
            <li> Works for removing callus but leaves skin rough</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to overdo it though--it&#x27;s that aggressive.</li>
            <li> Once you do it a few times, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know my feet had so much dead skin on it, but definitely feels cleaner and smoother than before!</li>
            <li> Dead skin empties by pulling blade from handle but be careful putting it back on as the blades are sharp.  </li>
            <li> I have to buy a new one every few months because eventually they get dull</li>
            <li> Walking around with a painful fissure is one thing, having both heels on fire is a whole new level of hurt.</li>
            <li> I treat myself to pedicures every other month or so, but still have lots of callouses.  </li>
            <li> I was not totally impressed with how well this one&#x27;s blades stayed snapped in at first, but after using it, I was SOLD.</li>
            <li> others have said, be careful!</li>
            <li> One cartridge for course work and the other to finish it off.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s very rough heels have been wrecking havoc on my sheets for years.</li>
            <li> I have nasty runner feet and a long-standing callous on one of my feet that is pretty much always there in various degrees.</li>
            <li> When I tried to get callouses off, it made my feet really rough and uneven.</li>
            <li> I recommend you order other microplane foot files avoid this one!</li>
            <li> my feet feel smoother and I have less callouses.  </li>
            <li> Got the Black for my husband and the Teal for myself.</li>
            <li> The area behind the metal file collects the &amp;#34;trimmings&amp;#34; which is, for lack of a better word, disgusting but also very convenient.</li>
            <li> Holds dead skin well too but needs to throw a towel down just in case.</li>
            <li> The blades lock in tightly, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about them popping out during use.  </li>
            <li> Replacing the blades and even the PedEgg for Men itself is becoming increasingly difficult not to mention expensive.</li>
            <li> This little file works like a charm.</li>
            <li> This microplane smoothes them out and lets me get rid of some of the dead skin bulk.</li>
            <li> Just a few minutes per foot and</li>
            <li> It grates any and all dead skin from my feet (heels, and toe corns).  </li>
            <li> it broke after a few uses, dont recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how much dead skin the Foot File collected when I popped the blade off for cleaning.</li>
            <li> and I tend to leave my tools in disinfectant for a few hours at a time with no issues).</li>
            <li> At first glance you wonder how it won&#x27;t shred your feet into a bloody mess.</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I have tried many foot files, worst one I ever tried was probably the &#x27;ped egg&#x27;.   </li>
            <li> Not sure I need two cartridges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and it hasn&#x27;t become noticeably dull.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading reviews where the reviewer says they&#x27;ll replace the product when it wears out or the file part got dull.</li>
            <li> but I did return this item since it&#x27;s so dull</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products like this and this one was as disappointing as the others.  </li>
            <li> As a long-standing, but unhappy, PedEgg user I must say that is this foot file takes the technology to a totally different level.</li>
            <li> It also broke after only 3 month of use, and I dont have crazy alligator feet or anything.</li>
            <li> There are much less expensive versions of this product in the marketplace but do not be fooled by the retail difference.  </li>
            <li> I have serious calluses, and have looked for ages to find something to handle them.</li>
            <li> Tough file seems to never get dull, thought it would with my tough skin had layers from the &#x27;80&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I like it because it&#x27;s extremely efficient, but I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m in danger of cutting myself.</li>
            <li> Works well for removing very thick calluses.  </li>
            <li> I had some very thick and splitting calluses on my heels.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried pumices, other foot files, the stupid Ped-Egg, and nothing came close to this.</li>
            <li> I have been using PedEgg for Men given that the white-pink-polka-dotted-dainty-fainty size, which  appears to be targeting  women customers, is really difficult to grasp.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s now useless.</li>
            <li> I get bad callouses from playing soccer all the time.</li>
            <li> but this one is purely bad design.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Great product, works very well.</li>
            <li> Just spend the money and be done, the egg will only frustrate you.  Yes, it&#x27;s not cheap, but it will get the job done, and fast.  Once you get the dead skin off - get some good foot cream (with urea) to keep them soft</li>
            <li> Works for removing callus but leaves skin rough</li>
            <li> These are the best! Follow the directions and get professional results every time. You can purchase refills when dull (I get about 6 months use before I want to replace the blades), but its cheaper to just order a whole new set.</li>
            <li> I get bad callouses from playing soccer all the time. I have skinny feet and high arches, so its like my feet try to become broader and flatter with the callouses :)  This microplane smoothes them out and lets me get rid of some of the dead skin bulk. It is very easy to use and super effective.</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable. I had problems with callus on my feet for a very long time. I just received it and it does miracles. The results are honestly better than going to a podiatrist. Highly recommend it to everyone with callus!</li>
            <li> Foot scraper works great but you need to know when to stop and do more another day. Holds dead skin well too but needs to throw a towel down just in case. Would recommend and repurchase. Tough file seems to never get dull, thought it would with my tough skin had layers from the &#x27;80&#x27;s I think.</li>
            <li> I have tried many foot files, worst one I ever tried was probably the &#x27;ped egg&#x27;.   I treat myself to pedicures every other month or so, but still have lots of callouses.  So I need something I can just grab and do the job quickly in between pedi&#x27;s.  The Microplane foot file works best on dry feet it says, and I have to agree, it works wonders on my feet.  Just a few minutes per foot and my feet feel smoother and I have less callouses.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I received the Microplane foot file in a reasonable amount of time for it being shipped overseas to my APO and used it that night. I worked great on my feet, it took the dry skin off with no problem and now I have smooth feet. I was using the Ped Egg but it didn&#x27;t really work well on my feet. This is a good product and it worked well for me.</li>
            <li> This is a remarkable tool. I  have had to remove calluses most of my life with a straight edge razor blade. After using this the first time I believe I will never have to use the razor blades again. Use with care, of course. Your feet will feel great - relieved of the dead thick, skin. I recommend this product. Over time I will buy several.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; does the job.</li>
            <li> This file is FANTASTIC.  It grates any and all dead skin from my feet (heels, and toe corns).  It is powerful so be very careful on your first try, but once you become accustomed to it, you&#x27;ll love it also.  I use this in conjunction with the Flexitol Foot Cream for Diabetics (even though I&#x27;m not diabetic), and I have the smoothest feet EVER.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several products like this and this one was as disappointing as the others.  I find an abrasive file (like Dr. Scholl&#x27;s) works better and is faster to use.</li>
            <li> This works right from the first use.  Within days my winter feet were smooth as a baby bottom.  I would reccomend it to anyone with scaly heels.</li>
            <li> When I read the reviews on this I expected a super strong almost indestructible file. This is not indestructible. It is made well but has plenty of room for improvement. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks now and it hasn&#x27;t become noticeably dull. I wish the handle was about two inches longer for ease of use but all in all I liked it ok and it was priced well.</li>
            <li> it broke after a few uses, dont recommend this one. I recommend you order other microplane foot files avoid this one!</li>
            <li> Works great, the handle is a nice quality.  Love it.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve purchased a LOT of foot files over the years. I was not totally impressed with how well this one&#x27;s blades stayed snapped in at first, but after using it, I was SOLD. You have to be careful not to overdo it though--it&#x27;s that aggressive.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! I&#x27;m buying one for everyone I love. I used it at the end of my shower and freaked out when I emptied the tray. I never imagined I was so scales. Love it.</li>
            <li> works like nothing else, period.</li>
            <li> This thing is the bomb.  I suppose you could damage healthy skin if you used enough pressure, but it&#x27;s amazing how little pressure you need to actually get rid of callouses.  Once the callous is gone, the file smoothly glides over healthy skin.  I don&#x27;t know how they made a file that only abrades the calloused area, but they did.  And the buffer is awesome as well.  Definitely the best foot file I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Happy with this product. Nothing to dislike. I think I am going to get one for my sister. I know she will like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been reading reviews where the reviewer says they&#x27;ll replace the product when it wears out or the file part got dull. The beautiful thing about this file is you can just replace the plates!!! If they aren&#x27;t sold on Amazon, the Microplane website has them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had another file that I bought at a drug store. When I tried to get callouses off, it made my feet really rough and uneven. It was like I was filing them off and it wasn&#x27;t pretty at all. I purchased this one and the difference is HUGE. I have nasty runner feet and a long-standing callous on one of my feet that is pretty much always there in various degrees. This Microplane file took it just about completely off and it does make my feet smooth. I didn&#x27;t feel a thing, was amazing how much skin came off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have said, be careful! It&#x27;s easy to file off a bit too much so your feet are tender after.</li>
            <li> I rarely leave comments about products I purchase on Amazon although customer feedback has really helped inform my decisions in making purchases, including this one. Consequently, I felt compelled to write a review about Microplane XL-Pro. As a long-standing, but unhappy, PedEgg user I must say that is this foot file takes the technology to a totally different level. I have been using PedEgg for Men given that the white-pink-polka-dotted-dainty-fainty size, which  appears to be targeting  women customers, is really difficult to grasp. Replacing the blades and even the PedEgg for Men itself is becoming increasingly difficult not to mention expensive. Microplane XL Pro runs rings around PedEgg in terms of filing and ease of use. The handle makes the task of filing a breeze. It takes half the time of PedEgg and leaves my feet smooth beyond anything I have ever experienced. The fact that blade replacement is available is an additional bonus. I just tossed my last (and unused) PedEgg in trash and have no plans of looking back!!</li>
            <li> This foot file and buffer does what it is supposed to do. I use it less often than with other products because it is so effective. I use a specific heel cream everyday and my feet look very good.</li>
            <li> Finally, a product that works! My husband&#x27;s very rough heels have been wrecking havoc on my sheets for years. Pedicures are little too metro for him, so I&#x27;ve been on a constant hunt for something to address this. We&#x27;ve tried pumices, other foot files, the stupid Ped-Egg, and nothing came close to this. You actually have to be careful because, while completely safe, it&#x27;s so effective it&#x27;s easy to get carried away and not realize how much skin you&#x27;ve removed. I&#x27;m also happy because I can use it to lengthen the time between pedicures. I like that you can buy replacement plates so you don&#x27;t have to buy another whole product when the blades wear out. It&#x27;s ergonomically designed and it just works.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best thing I ever purchase.</li>
            <li> Great ! High Quality !</li>
            <li> The very first time I used it, it shaved off the heavy callous I develop on the edge of my big toe. Just one treatment. Ped Egg I had to go over it every day. Even then, it wouldn&#x27;t take all away in one use. I had to keep using it daily. If I tried to use it a bit more aggressively, it would just tear the skin. Not this product. No tearing of skin. Smooth skin left remaining. Plus, the handle on this is so comfortable to hold. I was amazed at how much dead skin the Foot File collected when I popped the blade off for cleaning. Definitely, this is a keeper and highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this!!!</li>
            <li> Works grate.. Get it?</li>
            <li> This is the best implement I&#x27;ve found yet to get the dead skin off my formerly scary feet. I like it because it&#x27;s extremely efficient, but I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m in danger of cutting myself. I have to buy a new one every few months because eventually they get dull (I give them a workout), but it&#x27;s totally worth it. My feet are finally normal-looking and smooth, and the cracks have healed up.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews, and as I used it I was mindful that many said to be careful because it will remove your skin. I used it, gently, and could not believe how baby-smooth my feet were.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot afford as many pedicures as I would like, but this little tool does a better job than what you would get in a salon. And it works in seconds, not minutes.&lt;br /&gt;I use it about once every 3-4 weeks. The first time, I got rid of every rough and craggy spot. The second time was just maintenance, really -- and that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve needed since. I bought it with the suggested O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Creme. I need so little of it, it will likely last 8 months, if not a year. Buy it, use it gently and sparingly -- and enjoy soft, nice feet.</li>
            <li> a gift for someone that loved mine.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my physician the product met all expections.  It is easy and comfortable to use and does an outstanding job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a couple of times already and absolutely love this product.  It works just as described and is quick, easy and painless.</li>
            <li> felt item would break when pressure was applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the PedEgg which was ok. I had to do A LOT of rubbing with it and it would just do an ok job. Not great, just ok. When I ordered this micro-plane I really didn&#x27;t expect a big difference in performance. I sure was wrong!....I LOVE this micro-plane! My heels were cracked and dirty looking before I started but after just rubbing for about 2 minutes they are smooth as a babies bottom!!....Love... love... love... this product!</li>
            <li> This foot file does an amazing job of removing dead skin and making your feet smooth. Highly recommended if you have feet that are worn out from overuse and dry from winter.  Pair this with a wonderful lotion and you will have smooth silky feet in no time!</li>
            <li> I have used files and a planar, but nothing compares to this animal. At first glance you wonder how it won&#x27;t shred your feet into a bloody mess. After a few seconds of use it was clear, not only is it painless, but removes the thick skin rather quickly. A couple minutes is all it took for both feet. The area behind the metal file collects the &amp;#34;trimmings&amp;#34; which is, for lack of a better word, disgusting but also very convenient. The handle is sturdy with a shape that is well suited for the task. The blades are made in the USA (no explanation of quality necessary).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The buffing cartridge is a great bonus not available with most other metal files. It has a much different feel, especially after using the aggressive cartridge. My advice is to use this file in between sessions of the coarse version, particularly to gradually remove any deep fissures. I did not pay attention if it came with instructions, but when using the buffer, it&#x27;s best to perform circular motions due to the shape of the apertures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As others have mentioned, don&#x27;t get too carried away. Play it safe and find a comfort zone. Walking around with a painful fissure is one thing, having both heels on fire is a whole new level of hurt.</li>
            <li> I have beautiful feet but after 15 years of ballet they are not soft. I spend over 2K a year on pedicures and have purchased countless things to try and fix this but nothing did it &amp;#34;well&amp;#34;.........THIS DOES! Just to give you a sense of what I own... Emoji battery operated pedi buffer and Clarisonic Pedi Sonic. Neither could really deal with the areas where the skin was just thick. It was never a bunion thing but the skin just hardened to protect that part of the foot where the dance shoes rubbed. The tools above would smooth but would never really get rid of the thickened skin. THIS DID. Now I can imagine that I will have to use it regularly but nothing will restore them back to baby feet. If you doubt it just try it.</li>
            <li> Really does what its supposed to do. Easily removes that extra layer of skin. The shavings stay in the handle and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I had a Pedi-Egg foot file on a stick that I really liked and thought did a great job of cutting through the hooves that develop at the end of my legs.  It broke and I started looking for a replacement.  Given the good reviews, I thought I&#x27;d try this one, since it looked to have a much sturdier handle.  Wow, what a difference!.  When it arrived I tried it out for a couple minutes just to see how easy it was to use.  I was checking the ergonomics of the handle more than the performance of the blades, but when I went to remove the blade cartridge I was amazed by how much yuck was in there.  In a couple minutes with not much effort, I had cleared more dead skin off my feet than I usually did in half an hour of using my old Pedi-Egg.  I checked my heels and they were smooth.  I always ended up with grooves cut into the callous from the Pedi-Egg that I&#x27;d have to buff away with another foot file, but not with this baby.  I love the Microplane.  The blades lock in tightly, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about them popping out during use.  The handle is comfortable to use and doesn&#x27;t bend or flex when using it.  The blades are amazing.  The Microplane doesn&#x27;t require anywhere near as much pressure as the Pedi-Egg did to achieve far better results.  The cap also fastens securely to cover the blades so you can throw this in a drawer without worrying about nicking anything.  I&#x27;ve combined use of the foot file with the Nightcare Gel Heel Socks socks by Justin Blair and my heels are in the best shape they&#x27;ve ever been.  I may not need to go out for a pedicure again.</li>
            <li> I was using another product that didn&#x27;t remove all of the dead skin no matter how much I rubbed.  This product worked perfectly the first time, and with the smoothing head, eliminated the need to use anything else.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My favorite addiction! I love to see how much callus I am able to get off my feet! So gross! ;)</li>
            <li> Loved this at first. However, quickly noticed that it was extremely hard to get certain areas because the shape is completely flat. It also broke after only 3 month of use, and I dont have crazy alligator feet or anything. Still a decent product for the price, but there are better for just a few more dollars.</li>
            <li> This little file works like a charm. It  has my feet feeling baby soft in no time. One cartridge for course work and the other to finish it off. I love it and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and works great. The curvature of the handle makes handling very easy. Changing the discs can be a little clunky on the first try because it feels like you might break something trying to snap them back in. Once you do it a few times, it&#x27;s not a big deal. Item is priced right and should last a long time if used properly.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars, if I could figure out how to change the plates. The instructions are no help really.</li>
            <li> Not sure I need two cartridges.</li>
            <li> I was worried about using this until I saw it used at a nail salon.  No digging, no blood, no pain, just gentle sanding that is way more effective than any pumice stone or other item designed for getting rid of the tough, dry, scaly skin on your feet!</li>
            <li> love this product and would buy it for others!</li>
            <li> Works well for removing very thick calluses.  I have not used the &amp;#34;circular&amp;#34; blade.  It is fairly agressive at removing the skin but not so much that I was worried about removing too much skin.  The handle size/shape is comfortable and shape of head enables getting into curves.  Dead skin empties by pulling blade from handle but be careful putting it back on as the blades are sharp.  I have only used 5 times so I do not know how long the blade will last but compared to pumice, files, etc.,. this is the best device I have ever used and laready got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> There are much less expensive versions of this product in the marketplace but do not be fooled by the retail difference.  This unit actual works in a healthy way.  I have used some of the cheaper versions and they have torn by feet up because they are too aggressive in removing both the calluses and the healthy skin that is underneath.  I switched to a cheaper unit that I bought at a local beauty supply shop and used it for some time but I switched back to the microplane unit and I can see why it is more expansive than the other unit.</li>
            <li> Way better than a pet egg</li>
            <li> bought it because of good experience with original mode. but this one is purely bad design. Looks prettier but doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Best one I have used so far! You will be glad you bought it. Don&#x27;t buy the Ped Eggs people, buy this!</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for removing small calluses.  We have the larger Colossal foot rasp and love it but wanted a smaller, more controllable version for small calluses and corns.  This version cuts the same as the larger rasp but gives better control on smaller areas.  This is flat compared to the curved blade of the Colossal rasp, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to make much of a difference since everything you file on is curved.  The cartridge system is kind of fussy, but not a big deal.  These rasps just work so much better than any other type of rasp out there.</li>
            <li> But this is definitely the easiest and quickest product I&#x27;ve seen. Didn&#x27;t know my feet had so much dead skin on it, but definitely feels cleaner and smoother than before!</li>
            <li> Works well but I wish it was a bit smaller to fit between my toes.</li>
            <li> This foot file is AMAZING. I am a professional nail tech and I really love this product. The grater is sharp, gets the job done quickly and efficiently. The buffer plate is great for fine tuning afterwards. My only issue (hence the 4 star review) is that the plastic lip of the cartridge that keeps it in place weakened and broke after only 4 pedicures. I am confident this is because I left it submerged in disinfectant for too long (times get very busy in the salon and I tend to leave my tools in disinfectant for a few hours at a time with no issues). If you don&#x27;t plan on disinfecting these paddles, then this won&#x27;t be an issue for you. If you DO plan on disinfecting them, you might be better off washing them with soap and water and then using a spray disinfectant and allowing them to air dry instead of submerging them, or make sure you don&#x27;t submerge them longer than 10 minutes at a time.</li>
            <li> tried for first time; very easy to use; it filed down the hard painful callus on the ball of foot and on the side by the baby toe. Will still need to see the podiatrist but will be more comfortable between visits. Wide handle is easy to grip; blades are sharp so it is meant to be used at a shallow angle to the skin. Got the Black for my husband and the Teal for myself.</li>
            <li> I have serious calluses, and have looked for ages to find something to handle them. This takes them off, and in record time. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, and it&#x27;s easy to use. Clean up is a snap, just unclipp it, &amp; the dump the dead skin. Changing the heads is easy too, although I&#x27;ve never had one go dull on me yet (although it is sure to happen eventually). A great investment for your feet!</li>
            <li> Worked great for my stepdads feet. That&#x27;s saying something.</li>
            <li> I have used Ped egg for years and gave one of these new Microplane files to my daughter as a gift as it looks nicer in a gift basket and she loves it much better than the ped egg so I had to try it too and it is great!  The extra long handle is great for people like me with back problems!  You get so much more off of your foot in less time with this than the ped egg!  Highly recommended!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> As far as I am concerned, I would not use anything else.  I have used the Microplane Foot File for years.  I have problem feet and it keeps them so smooth.  I still have my original.  I bought one for travel, and one for a gift.</li>
            <li> Wow,  wonderful results, removes thick skin very well.  A tool that should last for years.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty much miraculous! OMG my feet feel (and look) human now! lol. I have used the Ped Egg for years, and loved it, but the past few years I can&#x27;t find one that is sharp, and the replacement blades are even worse. This product is like the Ped Egg used to be only way BETTER! Sharper, sturdy handle, which makes it easier to get all angles of your foot. The only part that is not quite as good is the shallow well for holding skin shavings. Also, the smoothing file is not as good as the emery files the Ped Egg comes with. I would say use the Microplane Foot File, and just buy some super fine sandpaper for smoothing.</li>
            <li> best price, best quality. It does what it says and it actually works. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been plagued with dry, callous-ridden feet for as long as I can remember and have spent plenty on of all kinds of ointments and files to keep my feet looking presentable.  Although the reviews were excellent on this product, I was still doubtful it would take care of &amp;#34;my feet.&amp;#34; Well, this is the best thing since sliced bread for your feet - all that and a bag of chips!! It doesn&#x27;t take much effort either.  I had smooth, lovely feet in about 10 mins.  I plan to purchase a few more for family members with the same problem.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying this at first and the price didn&#x27;t help out much.  I thought it was one of those things that is overpriced and is a p.o.s, but after I used it and almost fell on my ass, I was sold!  This thing made my feet very soft and smooth to the point my feet felt like silk.  I was literally sliding on carpet after I used it!  I also picked this up because every other file I found was too feminine in design, and this fit the bill with it&#x27;s more masculine appeal (no lame ass name like pedi-egg).  Guys just won&#x27;t buy things that says pedicure or manicure on them, lol!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say this thing worked wonders for my feet, and it certainly will do the same for yours!  It comes with two blade cartridges (bi-directional and multi-directional).  One is for filing (to remove excess skin) and the other is more of a buffer to make your feet extra smooth.  Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use anything else, and the best part about it is it has replaceable cartridges.  A must have item for everyone that cares about the appearance and health of their feet!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shared this with everyone on my Facebook because it REALLY is that damn good of a file!</li>
            <li> I had some very thick and splitting calluses on my heels. The foot file took them off for the most part. It was quick and painless. Unfortunately it dulled after that first use and I couldn&#x27;t get any more callus removed. My feet are much better but I did return this item since it&#x27;s so dull it&#x27;s now useless.</li>
