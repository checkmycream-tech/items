            <li>It&#x27;s very light smelling and smells like flowers.</li>

            <li>it&#x27;s like a sophisticated lavender.  </li>
            <li>It smells like lavender but with a more sophisticated scent ....</li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is one of my favorite scents from BBW.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love any of the B&amp;BW body lotions and creams.</li>
            <li>What can I say, it&#x27;s Bath and Body Works and one of my favorite scents, so</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m glad I thought of checking on line.</li>
            <li>So glad they decided not to discontinue this one :)</li>
            <li>I Love the smell.</li>
            <li>I do love this scent..</li>
            <li>I love this lotion and have used it for some time after shower or baths.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with the scent way before I even knew that this is a BBW product.</li>
            <li>I really love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love Moonlight Path.  </li>
            <li>My son got me the signature collections gift set for Christmas 2012, and just fell in love with this frangrance.</li>
            <li>The body spray and shower gel make you feel so feminine, I positively love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very clean soothing smell.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and nice.</li>
            <li>Its gentle fragrance was most pleasant to myself, yet, not irritating to friends with allergies.</li>
            <li>Some friends gave me a gift basket filled with Moonlight Path products and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.</li>
            <li>Love how it rubs right in, not greasy</li>
            <li>though it took forever to get here, it was well worth the wait!</li>
            <li>It has such a light scent and feels sooo good on my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing special about the price on here.</li>
            <li>Amazing smell, very relaxing and pretty.  </li>
            <li>This is a very sexy and light scent that is romantic.</li>
            <li>Moonlight Path is my absolute FAVORITE body lotion.</li>
            <li>But this lotion isn&#x27;t too sweet smelling at all.  </li>
            <li>the original fragrance comes back, along with the original bottle!!</li>
            <li>Sweet is not the right word.</li>
            <li>However Moonlight Path in my opinion is saccharin and much too cloying for me to enjoy.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite B&amp;B scent</li>
            <li>and I like to leave a bottle in my bathroom next to the soap so guests are able to use it after washing their hands if they want.</li>
            <li>Ordered this product two days later than another order and received this first--hmmm--I will surely be ordering from you again.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite lotions, and they don&#x27;t sell it in my local store-</li>
            <li>Totally recommend if you like lavender :)</li>
            <li>&#x27;scent&#x27; that I&#x27;ve enjoyed all these years is totally different . .</li>
            <li>And it seems to last longer than most creams.  </li>
            <li>A woman at staples had this and at first I thought it was a perfume</li>
            <li>I dont know how to compare this to any other scent, but it truly smells great and leaves my skin totally moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Scent stays strong for several hours.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>She got a real Christmas surprise.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister and she loves it so much.  </li>
            <li>Very creamy.  </li>
            <li>I found out about it from my daughter-in-law who really loves it.</li>
            <li>well, I don&#x27;t really know how to explain it</li>
            <li>And the skin absorbs it fast and keep it moisturized.</li>
            <li>It was the older version.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son&#x27;s new wife mother for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>Very soft on my, skin keeps me moisturized all day.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have the heart to come clean and tell them it&#x27;s less preferred.</li>
            <li>Creamy, leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>I like B&amp;BW a lot because of its variety of aromas and how it leaves the skin soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>My mom, who has a sensitive nose, loves it.</li>
            <li>I had also ordered from Bath &amp; Body Works another Signature Collection Product directly from their site</li>
            <li>The lotion makes my hands soft and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>It has a lovely, soft subtle scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not strong at all, unlike some of the other lotion I own.</li>
            <li>Even the name, &amp;#34;Moonlight Path&amp;#34;, was well chosen because it can show you the way subtly and confidently.</li>
            <li>Even though the store usually has a sale I was able to use a code and get the same online.</li>
            <li>It brings back memories from high school.</li>
            <li>I live in a rural area, 85 miles from a Bath &amp; Body Works and didn&#x27;t know when I would be there again.</li>
            <li>Because I am nearly out of the lotion, I attempted to resupply by ordering what I thought was the same product.  </li>

            <li> I am a long time customer of Bath and Body works</li>
            <li> It smells heavenly and the scent lasts a long time on your body.</li>
            <li> I totally agree with the other</li>
            <li> The scent lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t forget</li>
            <li> The fragrance hasn&#x27;t changed, don&#x27;t need a lot, just a small dab works well enough.</li>
            <li> But, the bottle didn&#x27;t have signs of previous usage or damaged cream.</li>
            <li> (I hate their vanilla scents and their fruity scents, they&#x27;re too darn sweet smelling!)</li>
            <li> I recommend this product hands down!</li>
            <li> This lotion is one of a few that I can wear because I am plagued with allergies.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to explain.</li>
            <li> addicted to it.</li>
            <li> I was afraid this was going to happen. . . .</li>
            <li> I had depended on it for years to keep my skin from suffering during the cold of winter and the sun-damage during the summer.</li>
            <li> so disappointed....</li>
            <li> I believe that I was deceived and I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Very, very disappointed.</li>

            <li> Moonlight Path is my absolute FAVORITE body lotion. It smells great and leaves my skin velvety smooth. This is the only body lotion I ever buy.</li>
            <li> Very nice product with a great fragrance.</li>
            <li> I use this as a moisturizer after a shower.  The scent is very nice and refreshing.  There isn&#x27;t anything I don&#x27;t like about this product.</li>
            <li> This lotion from the Bath and Body Works Signature Collection smells so yummy. I absolutely love bath and body works products!  This is one of the newer scents and I had to try it out.  I dont know how to compare this to any other scent, but it truly smells great and leaves my skin totally moisturized.  I get tons of compliments on the smell and I like to leave a bottle in my bathroom next to the soap so guests are able to use it after washing their hands if they want.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff, the smell lasts all day, I wake up in the morning and&lt;br /&gt;Still can smell it.  The shipping was on time like always, Im very pleased&lt;br /&gt;With this product</li>
            <li> best smell for lotion ever ! addicted to it.</li>

            <li> I bought this for my son&#x27;s new wife mother for Christmas.  We were talking one day and she said she just loved this product,  I thought well, Where could I find it.  She had not been able to find it anymore.  I went on Amazon.com.  There is was. She got a real Christmas surprise.  She just loved it.  I was so happy.  Mary Kelly</li>
            <li> excellent hand lotion and a wonderful smell you will love it try it now no greasy after feeling rubs in well</li>
            <li> Creamy, leaves skin soft. Smells fresh and nice.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite lotions, and they don&#x27;t sell it in my local store- so glad I found it on here.  Amazing smell, very relaxing and pretty.  I totally agree with the other review- it&#x27;s like a sophisticated lavender.  It&#x27;s just a wonderful smell, not too sweet, not to overpowering, but a smell that just makes you smile and relax every time you smell it :)  Totally recommend if you like lavender :)</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling lotions ever! It&#x27;s a very clean soothing smell. I would definitely recommend this to any woman who uses lotion often. It&#x27;s a nice smell that is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite B&amp;B scent (I hate their vanilla scents and their fruity scents, they&#x27;re too darn sweet smelling!) But this lotion isn&#x27;t too sweet smelling at all.  It smells like lavender but with a more sophisticated scent .... it&#x27;s hard to explain. I recommend this product hands down!</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is one of my favorite scents from BBW. It has a lovely, soft subtle scent.</li>
            <li> ..again, I can not buy it in Hong Kong!! so disappointed....the texture and smell is very good...hope I can find it in Hong Kong one day...</li>
            <li> This is a very sexy and light scent that is romantic. I love it and I think it would be an awesome scented candle. :)</li>
            <li> excellent aroma, happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I love any of the B&amp;BW body lotions and creams. Even though the store usually has a sale I was able to use a code and get the same online.</li>
            <li> I was delighted when I found that I could buy my favorite lotion from Amazon Prime and get free shipping. I live in a rural area, 85 miles from a Bath &amp; Body Works and didn&#x27;t know when I would be there again. This lotion is one of a few that I can wear because I am plagued with allergies. The smell and feel of this lotion is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I was afraid this was going to happen. . . . .the &#x27;scent&#x27; that I&#x27;ve enjoyed all these years is totally different . . .along with the bottle.  I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s just the way it is and has to be.  However,  I am saying good-bye. . . . .unless the original fragrance comes back, along with the original bottle!!</li>
            <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s Bath and Body Works and one of my favorite scents, so of course I&#x27;m going to like it!  Works great as a lotion too.</li>
            <li> I am a long time customer of Bath and Body works and I will continue to patronize the brand. However Moonlight Path in my opinion is saccharin and much too cloying for me to enjoy.  It&#x27;s incredibly sad too because for many years now my family continues to purchase this scent for me as a gift and I don&#x27;t have the heart to come clean and tell them it&#x27;s less preferred.</li>
            <li> I have checked a couple of Bath &amp; Body Works and they said they don&#x27;t sell it anymore.  So I&#x27;m glad I thought of checking on line.</li>
            <li> I love the smell! Always have. It brings back memories from high school. So glad they decided not to discontinue this one :)</li>
            <li> I Love the smell. People have always commented on me using it how they like it also.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister and she loves it so much.  I think I might get one for my self.</li>
            <li> Very creamy.  And it seems to last longer than most creams.  I found out about it from my daughter-in-law who really loves it.</li>
            <li> The fragrance hasn&#x27;t changed, don&#x27;t need a lot, just a small dab works well enough. Scent stays strong for several hours.</li>
            <li> According to my wife, it works the way it&#x27;s supposed to. It smells nice, the bottle looks nice and the price was affordable. What&#x27;s not to like</li>
            <li> Great fragrance.......not overpowering, light, sensual, sexy.........Use it for all the seasons, but winter.........Would recommend it to anyone.............Love how it rubs right in, not greasy</li>
            <li> I like B&amp;BW a lot because of its variety of aromas and how it leaves the skin soft and touchable. The product I received was well covered against accidents, but overall it didn&#x27;t came as the picture. It was the older version. But, the bottle didn&#x27;t have signs of previous usage or damaged cream.</li>
            <li> This lotion is perfect. It&#x27;s very light smelling and smells like flowers. My mom, who has a sensitive nose, loves it. It&#x27;s not strong at all, unlike some of the other lotion I own. A little goes a long way, so don&#x27;t forget that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it took forever to get here, it was well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> Was a gift. They absolutely loved the fragrance...</li>
            <li> Just like buying at the store. I do love this scent..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing special about the price on here.</li>
            <li> It was so great to find that this discontinued body lotion was still available. I had depended on it for years to keep my skin from suffering during the cold of winter and the sun-damage during the summer. Its gentle fragrance was most pleasant to myself, yet, not irritating to friends with allergies.Even the name, &amp;#34;Moonlight Path&amp;#34;, was well chosen because it can show you the way subtly and confidently.</li>
            <li> I have Moonlight Path Body Lotion Signature Collection, which contain the ingredients Vitamin E, Jojoba, and Shea Butter.  Because I am nearly out of the lotion, I attempted to resupply by ordering what I thought was the same product.  After all it is advertised with the same name and company.  What I received was a product called Moonlight Path, by Bath &amp; Body Works, and the ingredients listed was only Shea &amp; Vitamin E.  It smells like regular lanolin lotion.  I believe that I was deceived and I am very disappointed.  I had also ordered from Bath &amp; Body Works another Signature Collection Product directly from their site and I received just what I orderd.  Why could Amazon not do that.  I&#x27;ve ordered quite a bit from Amazon and this is the 1st time that I have not received what I ordered.  Very, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Thank you for returning my money. I ordered the Bath and Body Lotion for a friend. She will try again in her name, later.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion and have used it for some time after shower or baths. It has such a light scent and feels sooo good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Very soft on my, skin keeps me moisturized all day. The scent is not overpowering, I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with the scent way before I even knew that this is a BBW product. A woman at staples had this and at first I thought it was a perfume but then she showed me this. I really love the scent. It smells.... well, I don&#x27;t really know how to explain it and this might sound weird but this smells relaxing. Sweet is not the right word. But every time I&#x27;d use this product, it kinda reminds me of babies. And we all know that babies smell really really nice. The scent lasts for a very long time. And the skin absorbs it fast and keep it moisturized. This is by far the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;m planning on buying the cologne too.</li>
            <li> I love Moonlight Path.  Some friends gave me a gift basket filled with Moonlight Path products and I&#x27;ve been hooked ever since.</li>
            <li> what we were looking for</li>
            <li> My son got me the signature collections gift set for Christmas 2012, and just fell in love with this frangrance. It smells heavenly and the scent lasts a long time on your body. The lotion makes my hands soft and will continue to use it. The body spray and shower gel make you feel so feminine, I positively love this product.</li>
            <li> What a great price for this body lotion. I would definitely purchase again and i recommend this product to the reader of this rating.</li>
