            <li>It cleans and smells great,</li>
            <li>The citrus scent greatly overpowers the mint scent, but the citrus has a pleasant scent, so I didn&#x27;t mind.</li>

            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>This one smells good and gets dirt from my hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is great for men, it smells refreshing instead of perfumey.</li>
            <li>I ended up being very pleased with how it performs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to treat yourself now and then.</li>
            <li>Does a good job too like most crew products.</li>
            <li>It has a nice cooling feel.</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t feel rich like a good shampoo.</li>
            <li>The citrus mint is nice be very, very mild.</li>
            <li>I also love the way it smells, so it is a thumbs up all around.</li>
            <li>There are better products out there.</li>
            <li>I love using this stuff.  </li>
            <li>There are better products out there however</li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li>really strong smelling up until then.</li>
            <li>Fortunately I caught it before my boyfriend did.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the fresh feeling from the mint.  </li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean after using it.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>I like this shampoo, but -- admittedly -- I haven&#x27;t tried too many different shampoos, so there may be better shampoos.</li>
            <li>I assumed I would enjoy the shampoo as much .&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you get dried out hair like I did, this would be a great product for you.</li>
            <li>Kind in mind everyone is different and this may not work for you.</li>
            <li>It really didn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean either .&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, for what it&#x27;s worth, I do plan to buy more American Crew Citrus Mint when I run out.</li>
            <li>This product is minty, but with a distinct citrus note that makes it interesting and different.</li>
            <li>Most of the time I am just &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; with the various shampoos I try.</li>
            <li>Reactions to shampoos are very subjective</li>
            <li>My husband absolutely loves this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Thanks ,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the way my head feels after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The packaging is nice and I like the green color.</li>
            <li>has a slightly cooling feel but its brief and will be done by the time you get out of the shower, otherwise it cleans well and smells good.</li>
            <li>This is decent shampoo and does the job it&#x27;s intended to do.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shampoo as a change-of-pace from the normal.</li>
            <li>The feel is just right and the smell is terrific!</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about the fragrance, because I get tired of so many companies playing it safe and making minty men&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>Besides the tape its as expected...just really sketchy, especially because it was part of a gift box.</li>
            <li>It is a light shampoo that suds well and cleans well without feeling heavy or chemical-laden.</li>
            <li>Cleans hair without stripping natural oils.  </li>
            <li>I used this with American Crew conditioner and my hair was extremely soft with no tangles.</li>
            <li>no regrets in buying this shampoo off the net!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very watered down</li>

            <li> The only problem with this shampoo is that my bottle is empty!</li>
            <li> I think it makes my stiff grey hair softer.</li>
            <li> and I think the quality of such a product is hard to pin down.</li>
            <li> The consistency also seemed to be &#x27;watered down&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It must be common wisdom that you can&#x27;t go wrong with mint fragrance for a guy.</li>
            <li> Not impressed and would not recommend.</li>

            <li> Reactions to shampoos are very subjective and I think the quality of such a product is hard to pin down. However, for what it&#x27;s worth, I do plan to buy more American Crew Citrus Mint when I run out. The packaging is nice and I like the green color. It cleans well and leaves my hair manageable. I was a little worried about the fragrance, because I get tired of so many companies playing it safe and making minty men&#x27;s products. It must be common wisdom that you can&#x27;t go wrong with mint fragrance for a guy. This product is minty, but with a distinct citrus note that makes it interesting and different. I like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Besides the tape its as expected...just really sketchy, especially because it was part of a gift box. Fortunately I caught it before my boyfriend did.</li>
            <li> I am in my 40s so I&#x27;ve been through close to a bazillion shampoos. Most of the time I am just &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; with the various shampoos I try. I do recall discovering Aussie products about 20 years ago or so . . . that was when I learned that shampoo alone may not be enough and that conditioner could give my hair some extra body (I think they had a 3 minute conditioner product that was all that back then). Well, shampoos have come a long way and there are boutique brands in barber shops and beauty salons. But for my money, no shampoo beats the Citrus Mint from American Crew. The feel is just right and the smell is terrific! 5 stars all the way.</li>
            <li> works great and makes my hair feel good. It&#x27;s nice to treat yourself now and then. Get yourself a bottle.</li>
            <li> My husband absolutely loves this shampoo. He said it makes his scalp tingly in a good way, helping him wake up. I also love the way it smells, so it is a thumbs up all around.</li>
            <li> My husband used this product and thought it was &amp;#34;more manly&amp;#34; than the &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; shampoos I like. He claims that he can a tell a difference to this product vs. drugstore and will re-purchase.</li>
            <li> I use the Crew Gel all the time . I assumed I would enjoy the shampoo as much .&lt;br /&gt; I couldn&#x27;t feel the mint but could smell the citrus . It really didn&#x27;t make my hair feel clean either .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will stick with the gel I think .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Thanks ,&lt;br /&gt; Phil</li>
            <li> This shampoo is great for men, it smells refreshing instead of perfumey. Does a good job too like most crew products.</li>
            <li> Not impressed and would not recommend. It&#x27;s very watered down and I don&#x27;t feel any tingling while using it but can smell some of the mint.  My hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean after using it. There are better products out there.</li>
            <li> I love using this stuff.  Wakes me right up in the morning or refreshes me after a hard days work in the yard.</li>
            <li> This is decent shampoo and does the job it&#x27;s intended to do. There are better products out there however and I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. The citrus mint is nice be very, very mild. The consistency also seemed to be &#x27;watered down&#x27;. It just doesn&#x27;t feel rich like a good shampoo.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shampoo as a change-of-pace from the normal. I ended up being very pleased with how it performs. It is a light shampoo that suds well and cleans well without feeling heavy or chemical-laden. The citrus scent greatly overpowers the mint scent, but the citrus has a pleasant scent, so I didn&#x27;t mind. I used this with American Crew conditioner and my hair was extremely soft with no tangles.</li>
            <li> I really like the way my head feels after using this shampoo. It smells pretty good too. I will buy more.</li>
            <li> The smell is like the conditioner, great after it has been washed out of your hair, really strong smelling up until then. I&#x27;ve used it every day during showers and my hair is great. Normally with shampoos my hair gets dried out and has no natural oils left, but this shampoo hasn&#x27;t had that problem. If you get dried out hair like I did, this would be a great product for you.</li>
            <li> i do like american crew shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners, this one is no different. has a slightly cooling feel but its brief and will be done by the time you get out of the shower, otherwise it cleans well and smells good.</li>
            <li> Does as it says. Cleans hair without stripping natural oils.  Keeps the scalp from drying out. Highly recommended. Kind in mind everyone is different and this may not work for you. All I&#x27;m saying it is work a try.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. Product as described.</li>
            <li> It cleans your hair. It has a nice cooling feel. It suds up really good and it&#x27;s a good price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shampoo. It smells good. I like this shampoo, but -- admittedly -- I haven&#x27;t tried too many different shampoos, so there may be better shampoos. This one smells good and gets dirt from my hair.</li>
            <li> The only problem with this shampoo is that my bottle is empty! It cleans and smells great, no regrets in buying this shampoo off the net!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the fresh feeling from the mint.  I think it makes my stiff grey hair softer.</li>
