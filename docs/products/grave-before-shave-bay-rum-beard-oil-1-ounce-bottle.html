            <li>The Bay rum smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells AMAZING and makes my beard glow.  </li>
            <li>Smell is great if you enjoy coconut rum but can clash with colognes.  </li>

            <li>The scent is amazing.</li>
            <li>Really Amazing Works</li>
            <li>Grave Before Shave beard oil is amazing.</li>
            <li>Not like a Fukushima glow, but it gives it a nice luster and softness.  </li>
            <li>There is a nice glimmer to my beard after i use this stuff that&#x27;s not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li>I have found that Aveeno body wash softens the beard better than this stuff, but without the good smell of course.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my beard sure smells good and feels healthier.</li>
            <li>the oil really makes your beard shine and smell great!!</li>
            <li>It has a good scent that isn&#x27;t over the top.</li>
            <li>Makes it nice and silky, keeps it from getting knotted up when on the motorcycle, and the surprise</li>
            <li>I could kind of make out coconut with tea tree.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>Nice rummy aroma without making you smell like you&#x27;ve been at the rum all day.</li>
            <li>The absolute best beard oil, period!  </li>
            <li>Started really growing my beard out, and this beard oil works great, and smells great as well.</li>
            <li>Awesome beard oil , highly recommended !</li>
            <li>The smell is nice, but not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product is great for keeping a beard looking neat and clean without stray hairs, for which this product is made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In all seriousness, great product, helped greatly with dry itchy skin that I always got when trying to grow out my beard before, helps soften it and smells great.</li>
            <li>The scent is very mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Oil is not sticky and washes off your hands very easily.</li>
            <li>This is a very strong scented oil and the smell can hang with you longer than 12 hours.</li>
            <li>The scent is also very strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li>Very strong smell.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and my wife probably enjoys it more than I do!</li>
            <li>Most everything I found had more woodsy scents to them, but I didn&#x27;t want him to smell like a Christmas tree!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love GbS beard oil, I&#x27;ve tried every kind the offer, my favorites are the pine scent (makes me feel like a lumberjack )and the bay rum.</li>
            <li>Best oil I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to shape my beard and have it retain its shape without having to use any wax or leave-in conditioner, which is a nice change of pace.</li>
            <li>Very nice, very wet, great scent!</li>
            <li>Tames fly aways to a certain extent and nice smell.</li>
            <li>First of all great stuff.</li>
            <li>Also great and fast shipping !</li>
            <li>Great product, thanks!</li>
            <li>I read a bunch of reviews saying that it smelled great, and it really does!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good sweet scent but not bay run</li>

            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough this is the best beard product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li>Guess I ought to wash my hands better before petting the cat....</li>
            <li>better then that, it makes my skin under my beard glorious.</li>
            <li>great smelling stuff, gets deep on the skin and makes it feel good.</li>

            <li>Love my Grave Before Shave Bay Rum beard oil.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The smell is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>It is alright and it smells ok</li>
            <li>I have found that the wax/ balms work better though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure at the moment if it&#x27;s helping with growth!but</li>
            <li>I think using a better boar bristle brush might help</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite sents, &#x27;n</li>
            <li>I love this oil.</li>
            <li>I love the Grave</li>
            <li>oh boy do I love the stuff.</li>
            <li>and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>It gives my beard a healthy shine and helps manage pesky fly-aways.</li>
            <li>I have tried all the GBS scents and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love the way my beard looks, and smells.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for two reasons, I love the brand name &amp;#34;Grave</li>
            <li>Like static electricity has built up in my beard.</li>
            <li>The scent is not overpowering, it&#x27;s a nice, light scent.</li>
            <li>He loves it, I love it.</li>
            <li>Extra - awesome stickers!</li>
            <li>My gf like the Head Hunter scent better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I think you guys need to start paying me a commission!! :)</li>
            <li>so I was very excited to try this out.</li>
            <li>I like the Honest Amish scent better, but this is pretty nice too once I got used to it.</li>
            <li>The Bay Rum smell is a nice fresh manly scent, yet in no way overpowering!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, but honestly I get better results from the $6 bottle of Moroccan hair oil I but at the store.</li>
            <li>The only reason it doesn&#x27;t have 5 stars is the scent fades towards the end of the day and doesn&#x27;t smell very pleasant at all.</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li>So, I took my chances with the Bay Rum Scent, and I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Scent is fairly strong and lasts most of the day.  </li>
            <li>Smells great (kind of like a cross between a tree oil scent and a rum scent).</li>
            <li>The smell of this oil is just far superior than your own mothers cooking.</li>
            <li>It smells great and makes my already epic beard even better.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff it smells great and makes my beard soft and itch free.</li>
            <li>My beard stays smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s scent runs smoothly into my nasal cavity causing me to be more of a man and shun the bald skinned lady boys away.</li>
            <li>Completely eliminated the itchiness and smells great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to grow my beard longer and more full since using this product.</li>
            <li>Now it is soft, and smells great.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m going to be happily putting this stuff on everyday because it smells friggin AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Husband loved the scent, and it makes his beard SO much softer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple other beard oils and found this to be the best.</li>
            <li>The balm on the other hand was perfect.</li>
            <li>Smells great and leaves my beard and skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Once they got a whiff of this beard oil, it was easy pickings.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>My beard is much softer and more easily managed and my wife and I both love the smell (when the appropriate amount is used).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My roommate was the first to say it smelled amazing.  </li>
            <li>To me, it has more of a sickly sweet, soapy, mothball smell.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s true of all beard oils.</li>
            <li>Best product I ever used hands down</li>
            <li>I normally use Honest Amish beard oil, which I love, but wanted to give this stuff a try.</li>
            <li>This is the best beard oil I have used to date, it is extremely addictive makes your beard nice and soft with a clean sheen.  </li>
            <li>The oil helps condition my long beard, and has a nice scent, but the scent is kind of potent to be under the nose all day.</li>
            <li>It makes your beard super soft and keeps it smelling great...</li>
            <li>Before Shave&#x27;s Bay Rum scent - and for good reason - it&#x27;s a high quality oil with a sweet rum scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm, but lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li>As a comparison, the oil from Honest Amish, which smells better, also has a marked improvement on how my beard looks after just one application.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the scent.  </li>
            <li>Now for the important stuff.</li>
            <li>something that he would enjoy using.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and applies to beard well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a distinct change for the better since I&#x27;ve started using this product.  </li>
            <li>After using many different oils, this one was recommended to me and is by far one of the best I have used.</li>
            <li>I put it on every morning, and use the GBS Bay Rum Beard Balm at night, for light control.  </li>
            <li>just had to add both to the shopping cart, and they shipped me Bourbon scented oil for free when I bought the Bourbon balm.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Keeps my beard shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It only takes about 3-4 drops for me to hit my face with a great smelling conditioning every day.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product on account of the fact that is smells amazing.  </li>
            <li>It smells fantastic as well.</li>
            <li>I have a decently filled out 6 month beard</li>
            <li>It gives my beard a light shine and makes it workable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This oil is light and the scent is mellow.</li>
            <li>Overall though it is very nice, and scent is fabulous, just not quite the softness I crave.</li>
            <li>The oil is light, the fragrance is top draw, and it keep my beard nice and not dry.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t do much for his beard and had a very strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product probably does exactly what it is designed for, but I bought it more to keep my beard and</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different oils and this is as good as any of the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with the sent, which is masculine, but not musky.  </li>
            <li>She rarely touches my beard let alone shove her nose in it!</li>
            <li>The smell is phenomenal (seriously, I love it.), the product works exactly how you&#x27;d expect, makes the beard soft and glorious and I really love the art style.</li>
            <li>love the way it conditions my beard and leaves it soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and it helps with dry and itchy skin.</li>
            <li>Pretty good but would be better if I could actually smell a bit of coconut.</li>
            <li>It does have a very nice smell to it, but as far as doing anything of real relevance, I just didn&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li>The feel of the beard is certainly smoother, and everyone seems to love the look and smell.  </li>
            <li>Now its soft and shiny and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Already, in just a week, his beard looks full and shiny.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell good</li>
            <li>The scent becomes your own, and it goes on and soaks in so naturally.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but wish the bottle was larger.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend, while he liked how soft it made his beard</li>
            <li>Made my husband&#x27;s beard nice and soft, and smells manly.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the scent of this beard oil.</li>
            <li>a good product overall.</li>
            <li>I love the scent of this, and it really does work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rustic and sweet, but not overbearing and fades over time.</li>
            <li>Not bad in the context,</li>
            <li>And it was really strong for the first two hours.</li>
            <li>This is a fine beard oil that will make your beard soft and manageable for the better part of the day.</li>
            <li>Beard oil smells great and can&#x27;t wait to try all the other scents.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, if you want to exude super manliness, look awesome, smell superb, have to fight your way through a pile of naked broads every day, have ladies willing strip naked for you, make more money, increase the length and girth of your manhood, and generally kick ass, then by all means, buy this stuff and start using immediately.    </li>
            <li>The scent is subtle and perfect.</li>
            <li>The smell  is clean, fresh and manly.</li>
            <li>The smell is phenomenal it actually edges out Dream Beard Gentleman Beard for my favorite, my wife loves the smell of it as well to the extent she kisses my neck</li>
            <li>The scent is rather mild.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>shipped this out ridiculously quick</li>
            <li>He mentioned how my goatee is super manly now and that I deserve to have a 50% raise just for being so manly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s also happy that it really does help with &amp;#34;beardruf!&amp;#34; We will definitely buy it again once he runs out.</li>
            <li>Nice weight, not too heavy, and it does keep my &amp;#34;corporate&amp;#34; beard in a nice sheen and feel to the hand.  </li>
            <li>Smell is a little strong but pleasant and fades throughout the day.</li>
            <li>smell is pretty light on this one too.</li>
            <li>the scent can be a bit strong if you use too much.  </li>
            <li>It was soooo strong and perfumey and made my beard really oily</li>
            <li>It smells good, too, even if it&#x27;s a little TOO strong.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my husband for Christmas, and not only does he love it, but I can&#x27;t quit sniffing his beard!</li>
            <li>Great scent, and has really helped to minimize my crazy fly away beard hairs.  </li>
            <li>I also purchased the Honest Amish wax which is better for reigning in a wild beard but does not actually help with softness or dandruff.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, conditions my beard and isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li>Not only does it condition your beard, it leaves an amazing smell that ladies will complement you on.</li>
            <li>keeps my beard soft and healthy looking..</li>
            <li>I have noticed, even after months of use, that his mustache and beard are incredibly soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really style it too much, but after 3 or 4 days almost all of my beard was able to stay were</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Again, the lady&#x27;s will not be able to keep their hands from stroking and basking in all the glory of the tropical scented glory of your soft luxurious beard.</li>
            <li>By far, this is my favorite of all of the beard oils I have purchased.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>The sent is just okay as far as I am concerned</li>
            <li>So after a few more whiffs and applying the oil to my beard it has a fresh warm spicy scent that reminds me of the Caribbean Islands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought several beard oils and this is by far my favorite!!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really matter much, though, because even though the scent is strong initially it quickly fades.</li>
            <li>Permeates the beard and seem to absorb pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It as also very good for the skin under as I normally get a little dandruff but not so with this product.</li>
            <li>My beard is about 4months right now, 2 inches</li>
            <li>Price is right too.</li>
            <li>Little bit does the job with a nice fragrance also!</li>
            <li>Now I say &amp;#34;not dry&amp;#34; because while not dry is good, I want soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using this oil has reduce the dryness that usually impacts my beard greatly when the temperature begins to drop.</li>
            <li>Works like most oils, nothing special other than the cool smell.</li>
            <li>Ehh...no better or no worse than many other beard oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My wife very much likes the scent on my beard too.</li>
            <li>Works well, would prefer a little stronger bay rum scent but a good beard oil</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Personally I like the balm better.</li>
            <li>First, let me start with the packaging.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>This is my first time ordering this beard oil.  </li>
            <li>However, it didn&#x27;t work any magic on my beard&#x27;s actual appearance though.</li>
            <li>First time user of beard oils, and I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a week of not using it, I decided to give it another shot, and for the first time, noticed that it&#x27;s a dropper, not a squirter.</li>
            <li>This is the first beard oil I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>I hit amazon, and came across Grave Before Shave Bay Rum Beard Oil, and it seems that I hit a home run on my first time at bat.  </li>
            <li>At first my wife did not like it, but she has come around.</li>
            <li>The only reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t totally love the scent.</li>
            <li>In fact she&#x27;s much happier now that I don&#x27;t smell like I&#x27;m fresh from the lumber mill.</li>
            <li>It was his first beard oil</li>
            <li>First Day:</li>
            <li>have a fairly merry beard, not too long, but certainly full enough for my niece to believe I am a professional pirate, and this helps to keep it smooth, under control and not suffer from dreaded &amp;#34;beard &#x27;druff&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Truth is I didn&#x27;t like the scent the first time I opened the bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really digging the scent!</li>
            <li>(the first being their pine scent) and boy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li>Plus, he really dug the pirate theme!</li>
            <li>Makes your beard soft and smooth, and fixes beardruff issues.</li>
            <li>The oil is nice and thick, and coats my beard easily.</li>
            <li>It truly is a great product that made my rough and unruly manly face hair able to be appreciated by even little princess.</li>
            <li>and I think these guys have a new loyal customer.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t go without it, great scent, and it keeps your beard soft and tame.</li>
            <li>The feedback from their wives is all positive as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy at all, and my beard pretty much absorbs it like it&#x27;s candy.  </li>
            <li>Just as described, very nice subtle after notes of coconut.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and calms down the stragglers.</li>
            <li>We decided on this because of the high ratings and honestly his beard got a bit rough...</li>
            <li>I was told to try beard oil for an easy, daily style for my moustache.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my love because his beard was so dry and scratchy.</li>
            <li>My stash has become super soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li>It makes my husband&#x27;s beard super soft and has made it come in a bit thicker as well.</li>
            <li>a positive note, I really like how the oil went on...</li>
            <li>I was previously using a very &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; smelling oil that, while it was conditioning the beard nicely, the scent was wearing off within minutes.</li>
            <li>Few drops rubbed in n brushed in, the itch is gone, beard&#x27;s softer, and smells great (comparable to bay rum soap).</li>
            <li>I am incredibly impressed I&#x27;ve never really fancied beard oil before (never liked it)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Added bonus: the dropper REALLY helps to get the oil to your skin if you have a longer beard like I do.</li>
            <li>This stuff will stay in your beard much longer and leaves a very shinny finish.</li>
            <li>I opened my package and it really caught my eye.</li>
            <li>I use beard shampoo and beard balm, but that was just very temporary relief.</li>
            <li>but after only 3 uses it has made my beard softer and i dont use an after shave anymore seeing as how i enjoy the smell of Bay Rum</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very manly</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Worked very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s oil, so don&#x27;t use too much 4 to 5 drops</li>
            <li>Thanks LN</li>
            <li>dropper is really an inefficient way to apply it.</li>
            <li>I find that it has really helped to train the mustache and keep it out of the way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the entire bottle now, so I feel comfortable reviewing it.</li>
            <li>and it just didn&#x27;t flow/massage in very well.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of days of getting used to the smell, I didn&#x27;t notice it too much, which I prefer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Watch how much you use though...</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t offer much in the way of &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;, but it does get rid of the prickliness my beard has.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried hair conditioners without much luck.  </li>
            <li>GBS also has a facebook presence, and they occasionally offer specials available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>will absolutely do business again.</li>
            <li>Conditions very well.</li>
            <li>Too much of a perfume smell for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and as an added bonus, my wife really digs the sent.</li>
            <li>I know the broads really dig it, too.</li>
            <li>While the shipping was fast, this oil has no smell of coconut, rum, etc.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a very tropical &amp;#34;bay rum&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs really well also.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Really helped moisturize my beard.</li>
            <li>My Wife absolutely loves the smell.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>And it really softens his beard.</li>
            <li>Really improved the look of his beard.  </li>
            <li>Fast,  efficient.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well on the beard, and I do not care for the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recently started growing a full length beard for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>Not as heavy as the balm, may be more useful for thinner beards.</li>
            <li>The fragrance almost seems to come into its own after a few uses.</li>
            <li>and they included a few super cool stickers in the package.&lt;br /&gt;Overall worth every penny and 10/10</li>
            <li>Not to slick as most oils tend to be, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I get a little lime and cocoanut, but the scent seems to have a very strong flowery element.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for something more spicy with clove, cinnamon, and citrus like other bay rum products.</li>
            <li>scent is pretty powerful and took a bit of getting used to, but overall I like this beard oil.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, oils didn&#x27;t preform as expected (seemed to dry up and disappear within and hour)</li>
            <li>Exactly as description describes, my beard is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>This thinner consistency also seems to penetrate the hair itself much better as my beard&#x27;s a lot softer than after using previous products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite confident my beard would snap a comb in half</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if your sport of choice is skirt lifting.</li>
            <li>-HIGHLY- recommend this to anyone and everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>High recommendation.</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell and last longer than other oils I have tried.</li>
            <li>While at a shopping mall I met some hot broad and immediately she commented on how manly my beard looked as she petted my goatee.</li>
            <li>My 2 little girls love to snuggle and sniff.</li>
            <li>It keeps his beard soft, tamable, and has a subtle fragrance that smells good.</li>
            <li>The scent is good, albeit a little reminiscent of Old Spice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottle reminds me of old medicine bottles and the dropper is made of glass and shows that these guys really thought about every aspect of their product.</li>
            <li>But, normally I like coconut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall it works pretty well, though it doesn&#x27;t soften my course beard as much as I had hoped and</li>
            <li>Normally my beard is quite volumous, but with this it looks neat and kempt.</li>
            <li>I use 4 drops each morning and feel like a new man.  </li>
            <li>My new go to for beard oil.</li>
            <li>I have what most people would consider a long beard (about 7 inches long)</li>
            <li>The delicate (but masculine) scent is quite nice for both of us.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply (just a small amount goes a long way), Smell is a very light on me, adds shine to the white goat I have growing.</li>
            <li>but I wanted to start taking care of my beard at a very early stage.</li>
            <li>It is a very old time barber shop type of smell that I like.  </li>
            <li>I looked at many different brands and some of the prices seemed a little much.</li>
            <li>As I was walking into my office all the hot chicks were totally eyeballing me.</li>
            <li>Massive fan of the Fisticuffs beard oils, this was the first one I bought</li>
            <li>Keep my beard shinny and soft!</li>
            <li>When it first arrived I couldn&#x27;t believe it was finally here.</li>
            <li>Seems to dry/absorb and leave a light residue that gives my beard some shine and weighs the hairs down and helps keep them in place after brushing/shaping.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t understand all of these amazing reviews as I was confident at least a few others would have thought the same.</li>
            <li>Totally made his beard less scraggly and really healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>It quickly got rid of the little bit of beardruff I had, and it was easy to apply (I used three drops down each jawline, plus a couple drops on my mustache).</li>
            <li>I really like what it does for my beard, and overall i like the scent.</li>
            <li>Keeps beard soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It leaves his beard really soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>The smell far exceeded my expectation.</li>
            <li>Got it to make my beard soft.</li>
            <li>Since I wrote the below, I&#x27;ve completely changed my mind.</li>
            <li>But she&#x27;s a six year old girl.</li>
            <li>The oil leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>works as advertised, keeping my beards soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>He seems to like this product so far.</li>
            <li>He does not like sticky or greasy things anywhere near his hair but he loves this stuff.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an old school dropper.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few woodsier beard oils and they just didn&#x27;t fit my personality or my beard.</li>
            <li>Masculine, but not piney.</li>
            <li>The boyfriend was using a dread/wax/balm for ages and his beard was EXTREMELY soft.</li>
            <li>Probably what i love most about this product is that I some times get sores on my skin from where the beard hairs get pulled, it&#x27;s very itch and annoying when I get them, since using this</li>
            <li>My beard is significantly softer after just a few uses</li>
            <li>It gets long and thick very quickly and so I was looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t just be fun to open as a gift but</li>
            <li>I said thanks for the raise (long overdue) and immediately headed to the nearest bar to celebrate my victory.  </li>
            <li>After only a weak my beard is noticeably softer and after only the first use it was way more manageable.</li>
            <li>Doe&#x27;s the the job no more dry stiff beard soft &amp; shiney smells great to my lady loves it</li>
            <li>helps calm my beard down and soften the hair.</li>
            <li>My beard feels soft and it now possesses it&#x27;s own gravitational pull due to its radiant shine emanating such vasts amounts of raw energy.</li>
            <li>Moms never want their boys to grow up, and she&#x27;s the sole detractor for this new hobby of mine.  </li>
            <li>A fresh slightly coconutty scent my wife enjoys.</li>
            <li>Giving it 3 stars because i&#x27;ve only started to use it and can&#x27;t vouch for what it actually does or doesn&#x27;t do for my beard, which in the end should really be what the product is judged for.</li>
            <li>He finally used it for the first time today and it already has his beard feeling softer and his skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dry.</li>
            <li>Not only was the smell very strong and did not dissipate as other review claimed, but it also made my beard feel greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li>previous one I purchased was unscented, as I was unsure if I wanted to smell THAT all day right under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the other scents are great...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Didn&#x27;t completely solve all of my dry skin issues, even when using enough to make my beard way too oily and combing it in really well.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s got a full beard and he only used a little and it looked oily so use just a tad.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic, a little will go a long way, and it makes your beard look majestic as fawk!</li>
            <li>For me, just a couple of drops and my coarse hair is soft and shiney.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d describe it as how us mid-westerners think the beach/ocean smells...very fresh, almost a saltiness, but without the dead fish odor of course.  </li>
            <li>Guess that&#x27;s just something I&#x27;m going to have to live with as long as I grow a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Grave Before Shave Beard Oil - Bay Rum Scent has a fantastic smell, seriously.</li>
            <li>Third Day: Boss told me that I&#x27;m kicking major ass at work.</li>
            <li>My beard is a year old this month, and I intend to have it for a long time.</li>
            <li>I like how it makes my beard lay down and the scent is very pleasing and not overbearing.</li>
            <li>this stuff smells great and it really made my beard softer, where it was previously like a wire brush, now I can touch it without cutting my fingers!</li>
            <li>It gives a little shine while the oil is absorbing.  </li>
            <li>At first it makes my beard all relaxed and soft but over the course of a few hours it goes extremely frizzy.</li>

            <li> This stuff smells AMAZING and makes my beard glow.  </li>
            <li> Smell is great if you enjoy coconut rum but can clash with colognes.  </li>

            <li> Really Amazing Works</li>
            <li> Grave Before Shave beard oil is amazing.</li>
            <li> Not like a Fukushima glow, but it gives it a nice luster and softness.  </li>
            <li> There is a nice glimmer to my beard after i use this stuff that&#x27;s not at all greasy.  </li>
            <li> I have found that Aveeno body wash softens the beard better than this stuff, but without the good smell of course.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my beard sure smells good and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> the oil really makes your beard shine and smell great!!</li>
            <li> It has a good scent that isn&#x27;t over the top.</li>
            <li> Makes it nice and silky, keeps it from getting knotted up when on the motorcycle, and the surprise</li>
            <li> I could kind of make out coconut with tea tree.</li>
            <li> Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Nice rummy aroma without making you smell like you&#x27;ve been at the rum all day.</li>
            <li> The absolute best beard oil, period!  </li>
            <li> Started really growing my beard out, and this beard oil works great, and smells great as well.</li>
            <li> Awesome beard oil , highly recommended !</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, but not overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product is great for keeping a beard looking neat and clean without stray hairs, for which this product is made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In all seriousness, great product, helped greatly with dry itchy skin that I always got when trying to grow out my beard before, helps soften it and smells great.</li>
            <li> The scent is very mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> Light, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Oil is not sticky and washes off your hands very easily.</li>
            <li> This is a very strong scented oil and the smell can hang with you longer than 12 hours.</li>
            <li> The scent is also very strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li> Very strong smell.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and my wife probably enjoys it more than I do!</li>
            <li> Most everything I found had more woodsy scents to them, but I didn&#x27;t want him to smell like a Christmas tree!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love GbS beard oil, I&#x27;ve tried every kind the offer, my favorites are the pine scent (makes me feel like a lumberjack )and the bay rum.</li>
            <li> Best oil I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to shape my beard and have it retain its shape without having to use any wax or leave-in conditioner, which is a nice change of pace.</li>
            <li> Very nice, very wet, great scent!</li>
            <li> Tames fly aways to a certain extent and nice smell.</li>
            <li> First of all great stuff.</li>
            <li> Also great and fast shipping !</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a good sweet scent but not bay run</li>
            <li> Love it smells so good very good and well priced only thing I could say wish it had a spray top instead of a dripper</li>
            <li> Makes my beard noticeably softer an more manageable.</li>
            <li> just so she can smell it a bit more.</li>
            <li> Love.</li>
            <li> I try not to wash my beard but twice a week, barring any mishaps or rib eating contests, but I found myself washing mine more just to get relief.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough this is the best beard product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Guess I ought to wash my hands better before petting the cat....</li>
            <li> better then that, it makes my skin under my beard glorious.</li>
            <li> great smelling stuff, gets deep on the skin and makes it feel good.</li>

            <li> This is my favorite.</li>
            <li> , felt like it was mostly just cologne you rub into your beard.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it improves more with longer use.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure how to describe the smell, but it is a sweeter smell that I had imagined.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the scent.</li>

            <li> Works noticeably better than the beard balm I was using.</li>
            <li> It was better than with the beard balm though.</li>
            <li> Put on this wonderful-smelling product and immediately noticed how much better I looked.</li>
            <li> I KNOW it was the beard oil that put me over the top.  </li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d asked her for her name or phone number, but there&#x27;s more where that came from - now</li>
            <li> Love my Grave Before Shave Bay Rum beard oil.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The smell is overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> It is alright and it smells ok</li>
            <li> I have found that the wax/ balms work better though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure at the moment if it&#x27;s helping with growth!but</li>
            <li> I think using a better boar bristle brush might help</li>
            <li> Love the scent.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite sents, &#x27;n</li>
            <li> I love this oil.</li>
            <li> I love the Grave</li>
            <li> oh boy do I love the stuff.</li>
            <li> and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> It gives my beard a healthy shine and helps manage pesky fly-aways.</li>
            <li> I have tried all the GBS scents and this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love the way my beard looks, and smells.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for two reasons, I love the brand name &amp;#34;Grave</li>
            <li> Like static electricity has built up in my beard.</li>
            <li> The scent is not overpowering, it&#x27;s a nice, light scent.</li>
            <li> He loves it, I love it.</li>
            <li> Extra - awesome stickers!</li>
            <li> My gf like the Head Hunter scent better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I think you guys need to start paying me a commission!! :)</li>
            <li> so I was very excited to try this out.</li>
            <li> I like the Honest Amish scent better, but this is pretty nice too once I got used to it.</li>
            <li> The Bay Rum smell is a nice fresh manly scent, yet in no way overpowering!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but honestly I get better results from the $6 bottle of Moroccan hair oil I but at the store.</li>
            <li> The only reason it doesn&#x27;t have 5 stars is the scent fades towards the end of the day and doesn&#x27;t smell very pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li> So, I took my chances with the Bay Rum Scent, and I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Scent is fairly strong and lasts most of the day.  </li>
            <li> Smells great (kind of like a cross between a tree oil scent and a rum scent).</li>
            <li> The smell of this oil is just far superior than your own mothers cooking.</li>
            <li> It smells great and makes my already epic beard even better.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it smells great and makes my beard soft and itch free.</li>
            <li> My beard stays smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scent runs smoothly into my nasal cavity causing me to be more of a man and shun the bald skinned lady boys away.</li>
            <li> Completely eliminated the itchiness and smells great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to grow my beard longer and more full since using this product.</li>
            <li> Now it is soft, and smells great.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m going to be happily putting this stuff on everyday because it smells friggin AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Husband loved the scent, and it makes his beard SO much softer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple other beard oils and found this to be the best.</li>
            <li> The balm on the other hand was perfect.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my beard and skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Once they got a whiff of this beard oil, it was easy pickings.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not too strong.</li>
            <li> My beard is much softer and more easily managed and my wife and I both love the smell (when the appropriate amount is used).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My roommate was the first to say it smelled amazing.  </li>
            <li> To me, it has more of a sickly sweet, soapy, mothball smell.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s true of all beard oils.</li>
            <li> Best product I ever used hands down</li>
            <li> I normally use Honest Amish beard oil, which I love, but wanted to give this stuff a try.</li>
            <li> This is the best beard oil I have used to date, it is extremely addictive makes your beard nice and soft with a clean sheen.  </li>
            <li> The oil helps condition my long beard, and has a nice scent, but the scent is kind of potent to be under the nose all day.</li>
            <li> It makes your beard super soft and keeps it smelling great...</li>
            <li> Before Shave&#x27;s Bay Rum scent - and for good reason - it&#x27;s a high quality oil with a sweet rum scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm, but lasts throughout the day.</li>
            <li> As a comparison, the oil from Honest Amish, which smells better, also has a marked improvement on how my beard looks after just one application.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the scent.  </li>
            <li> Now for the important stuff.</li>
            <li> something that he would enjoy using.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and applies to beard well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a distinct change for the better since I&#x27;ve started using this product.  </li>
            <li> After using many different oils, this one was recommended to me and is by far one of the best I have used.</li>
            <li> I put it on every morning, and use the GBS Bay Rum Beard Balm at night, for light control.  </li>
            <li> just had to add both to the shopping cart, and they shipped me Bourbon scented oil for free when I bought the Bourbon balm.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It only takes about 3-4 drops for me to hit my face with a great smelling conditioning every day.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product on account of the fact that is smells amazing.  </li>
            <li> It smells fantastic as well.</li>
            <li> I have a decently filled out 6 month beard</li>
            <li> It gives my beard a light shine and makes it workable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This oil is light and the scent is mellow.</li>
            <li> Overall though it is very nice, and scent is fabulous, just not quite the softness I crave.</li>
            <li> The oil is light, the fragrance is top draw, and it keep my beard nice and not dry.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do much for his beard and had a very strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product probably does exactly what it is designed for, but I bought it more to keep my beard and</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different oils and this is as good as any of the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with the sent, which is masculine, but not musky.  </li>
            <li> She rarely touches my beard let alone shove her nose in it!</li>
            <li> The smell is phenomenal (seriously, I love it.), the product works exactly how you&#x27;d expect, makes the beard soft and glorious and I really love the art style.</li>
            <li> love the way it conditions my beard and leaves it soft and more manageable.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and it helps with dry and itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Pretty good but would be better if I could actually smell a bit of coconut.</li>
            <li> It does have a very nice smell to it, but as far as doing anything of real relevance, I just didn&#x27;t see it.</li>
            <li> The feel of the beard is certainly smoother, and everyone seems to love the look and smell.  </li>
            <li> Now its soft and shiny and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Already, in just a week, his beard looks full and shiny.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell good</li>
            <li> The scent becomes your own, and it goes on and soaks in so naturally.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but wish the bottle was larger.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, while he liked how soft it made his beard</li>
            <li> Made my husband&#x27;s beard nice and soft, and smells manly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the scent of this beard oil.</li>
            <li> a good product overall.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this, and it really does work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rustic and sweet, but not overbearing and fades over time.</li>
            <li> Not bad in the context,</li>
            <li> And it was really strong for the first two hours.</li>
            <li> This is a fine beard oil that will make your beard soft and manageable for the better part of the day.</li>
            <li> Beard oil smells great and can&#x27;t wait to try all the other scents.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if you want to exude super manliness, look awesome, smell superb, have to fight your way through a pile of naked broads every day, have ladies willing strip naked for you, make more money, increase the length and girth of your manhood, and generally kick ass, then by all means, buy this stuff and start using immediately.    </li>
            <li> The scent is subtle and perfect.</li>
            <li> The smell  is clean, fresh and manly.</li>
            <li> The smell is phenomenal it actually edges out Dream Beard Gentleman Beard for my favorite, my wife loves the smell of it as well to the extent she kisses my neck</li>
            <li> The scent is rather mild.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> shipped this out ridiculously quick</li>
            <li> He mentioned how my goatee is super manly now and that I deserve to have a 50% raise just for being so manly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s also happy that it really does help with &amp;#34;beardruf!&amp;#34; We will definitely buy it again once he runs out.</li>
            <li> Nice weight, not too heavy, and it does keep my &amp;#34;corporate&amp;#34; beard in a nice sheen and feel to the hand.  </li>
            <li> Smell is a little strong but pleasant and fades throughout the day.</li>
            <li> smell is pretty light on this one too.</li>
            <li> the scent can be a bit strong if you use too much.  </li>
            <li> It was soooo strong and perfumey and made my beard really oily</li>
            <li> It smells good, too, even if it&#x27;s a little TOO strong.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband for Christmas, and not only does he love it, but I can&#x27;t quit sniffing his beard!</li>
            <li> Great scent, and has really helped to minimize my crazy fly away beard hairs.  </li>
            <li> I also purchased the Honest Amish wax which is better for reigning in a wild beard but does not actually help with softness or dandruff.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, conditions my beard and isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li> Not only does it condition your beard, it leaves an amazing smell that ladies will complement you on.</li>
            <li> keeps my beard soft and healthy looking..</li>
            <li> I have noticed, even after months of use, that his mustache and beard are incredibly soft and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really style it too much, but after 3 or 4 days almost all of my beard was able to stay were</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Again, the lady&#x27;s will not be able to keep their hands from stroking and basking in all the glory of the tropical scented glory of your soft luxurious beard.</li>
            <li> By far, this is my favorite of all of the beard oils I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> The sent is just okay as far as I am concerned</li>
            <li> So after a few more whiffs and applying the oil to my beard it has a fresh warm spicy scent that reminds me of the Caribbean Islands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several beard oils and this is by far my favorite!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really matter much, though, because even though the scent is strong initially it quickly fades.</li>
            <li> Permeates the beard and seem to absorb pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It as also very good for the skin under as I normally get a little dandruff but not so with this product.</li>
            <li> My beard is about 4months right now, 2 inches</li>
            <li> Price is right too.</li>
            <li> Little bit does the job with a nice fragrance also!</li>
            <li> Now I say &amp;#34;not dry&amp;#34; because while not dry is good, I want soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using this oil has reduce the dryness that usually impacts my beard greatly when the temperature begins to drop.</li>
            <li> Works like most oils, nothing special other than the cool smell.</li>
            <li> Ehh...no better or no worse than many other beard oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My wife very much likes the scent on my beard too.</li>
            <li> Works well, would prefer a little stronger bay rum scent but a good beard oil</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Personally I like the balm better.</li>
            <li> First, let me start with the packaging.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering this beard oil.  </li>
            <li> However, it didn&#x27;t work any magic on my beard&#x27;s actual appearance though.</li>
            <li> First time user of beard oils, and I decided to give this one a try.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a week of not using it, I decided to give it another shot, and for the first time, noticed that it&#x27;s a dropper, not a squirter.</li>
            <li> This is the first beard oil I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> I hit amazon, and came across Grave Before Shave Bay Rum Beard Oil, and it seems that I hit a home run on my first time at bat.  </li>
            <li> At first my wife did not like it, but she has come around.</li>
            <li> The only reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t totally love the scent.</li>
            <li> In fact she&#x27;s much happier now that I don&#x27;t smell like I&#x27;m fresh from the lumber mill.</li>
            <li> It was his first beard oil</li>
            <li> First Day:</li>
            <li> have a fairly merry beard, not too long, but certainly full enough for my niece to believe I am a professional pirate, and this helps to keep it smooth, under control and not suffer from dreaded &amp;#34;beard &#x27;druff&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Truth is I didn&#x27;t like the scent the first time I opened the bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really digging the scent!</li>
            <li> (the first being their pine scent) and boy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> Plus, he really dug the pirate theme!</li>
            <li> Makes your beard soft and smooth, and fixes beardruff issues.</li>
            <li> The oil is nice and thick, and coats my beard easily.</li>
            <li> It truly is a great product that made my rough and unruly manly face hair able to be appreciated by even little princess.</li>
            <li> and I think these guys have a new loyal customer.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go without it, great scent, and it keeps your beard soft and tame.</li>
            <li> The feedback from their wives is all positive as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy at all, and my beard pretty much absorbs it like it&#x27;s candy.  </li>
            <li> Just as described, very nice subtle after notes of coconut.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and calms down the stragglers.</li>
            <li> We decided on this because of the high ratings and honestly his beard got a bit rough...</li>
            <li> I was told to try beard oil for an easy, daily style for my moustache.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my love because his beard was so dry and scratchy.</li>
            <li> My stash has become super soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li> It makes my husband&#x27;s beard super soft and has made it come in a bit thicker as well.</li>
            <li> a positive note, I really like how the oil went on...</li>
            <li> I was previously using a very &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; smelling oil that, while it was conditioning the beard nicely, the scent was wearing off within minutes.</li>
            <li> Few drops rubbed in n brushed in, the itch is gone, beard&#x27;s softer, and smells great (comparable to bay rum soap).</li>
            <li> I am incredibly impressed I&#x27;ve never really fancied beard oil before (never liked it)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Added bonus: the dropper REALLY helps to get the oil to your skin if you have a longer beard like I do.</li>
            <li> This stuff will stay in your beard much longer and leaves a very shinny finish.</li>
            <li> I opened my package and it really caught my eye.</li>
            <li> I use beard shampoo and beard balm, but that was just very temporary relief.</li>
            <li> but after only 3 uses it has made my beard softer and i dont use an after shave anymore seeing as how i enjoy the smell of Bay Rum</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very manly</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Worked very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oil, so don&#x27;t use too much 4 to 5 drops</li>
            <li> Thanks LN</li>
            <li> dropper is really an inefficient way to apply it.</li>
            <li> I find that it has really helped to train the mustache and keep it out of the way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the entire bottle now, so I feel comfortable reviewing it.</li>
            <li> and it just didn&#x27;t flow/massage in very well.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of days of getting used to the smell, I didn&#x27;t notice it too much, which I prefer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Watch how much you use though...</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t offer much in the way of &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;, but it does get rid of the prickliness my beard has.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried hair conditioners without much luck.  </li>
            <li> GBS also has a facebook presence, and they occasionally offer specials available on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> will absolutely do business again.</li>
            <li> Conditions very well.</li>
            <li> Too much of a perfume smell for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and as an added bonus, my wife really digs the sent.</li>
            <li> I know the broads really dig it, too.</li>
            <li> While the shipping was fast, this oil has no smell of coconut, rum, etc.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting a very tropical &amp;#34;bay rum&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs really well also.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Really helped moisturize my beard.</li>
            <li> My Wife absolutely loves the smell.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell</li>
            <li> And it really softens his beard.</li>
            <li> Really improved the look of his beard.  </li>
            <li> Fast,  efficient.  </li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well on the beard, and I do not care for the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently started growing a full length beard for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy as the balm, may be more useful for thinner beards.</li>
            <li> The fragrance almost seems to come into its own after a few uses.</li>
            <li> and they included a few super cool stickers in the package.&lt;br /&gt;Overall worth every penny and 10/10</li>
            <li> Not to slick as most oils tend to be, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I get a little lime and cocoanut, but the scent seems to have a very strong flowery element.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for something more spicy with clove, cinnamon, and citrus like other bay rum products.</li>
            <li> scent is pretty powerful and took a bit of getting used to, but overall I like this beard oil.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, oils didn&#x27;t preform as expected (seemed to dry up and disappear within and hour)</li>
            <li> Exactly as description describes, my beard is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This thinner consistency also seems to penetrate the hair itself much better as my beard&#x27;s a lot softer than after using previous products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite confident my beard would snap a comb in half</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product if your sport of choice is skirt lifting.</li>
            <li> -HIGHLY- recommend this to anyone and everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> High recommendation.</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell and last longer than other oils I have tried.</li>
            <li> While at a shopping mall I met some hot broad and immediately she commented on how manly my beard looked as she petted my goatee.</li>
            <li> My 2 little girls love to snuggle and sniff.</li>
            <li> It keeps his beard soft, tamable, and has a subtle fragrance that smells good.</li>
            <li> The scent is good, albeit a little reminiscent of Old Spice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle reminds me of old medicine bottles and the dropper is made of glass and shows that these guys really thought about every aspect of their product.</li>
            <li> But, normally I like coconut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall it works pretty well, though it doesn&#x27;t soften my course beard as much as I had hoped and</li>
            <li> Normally my beard is quite volumous, but with this it looks neat and kempt.</li>
            <li> I use 4 drops each morning and feel like a new man.  </li>
            <li> My new go to for beard oil.</li>
            <li> I have what most people would consider a long beard (about 7 inches long)</li>
            <li> The delicate (but masculine) scent is quite nice for both of us.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply (just a small amount goes a long way), Smell is a very light on me, adds shine to the white goat I have growing.</li>
            <li> but I wanted to start taking care of my beard at a very early stage.</li>
            <li> It is a very old time barber shop type of smell that I like.  </li>
            <li> I looked at many different brands and some of the prices seemed a little much.</li>
            <li> As I was walking into my office all the hot chicks were totally eyeballing me.</li>
            <li> Massive fan of the Fisticuffs beard oils, this was the first one I bought</li>
            <li> Keep my beard shinny and soft!</li>
            <li> When it first arrived I couldn&#x27;t believe it was finally here.</li>
            <li> Seems to dry/absorb and leave a light residue that gives my beard some shine and weighs the hairs down and helps keep them in place after brushing/shaping.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand all of these amazing reviews as I was confident at least a few others would have thought the same.</li>
            <li> Totally made his beard less scraggly and really healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> It quickly got rid of the little bit of beardruff I had, and it was easy to apply (I used three drops down each jawline, plus a couple drops on my mustache).</li>
            <li> I really like what it does for my beard, and overall i like the scent.</li>
            <li> Keeps beard soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> It leaves his beard really soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> The smell far exceeded my expectation.</li>
            <li> Got it to make my beard soft.</li>
            <li> Since I wrote the below, I&#x27;ve completely changed my mind.</li>
            <li> But she&#x27;s a six year old girl.</li>
            <li> The oil leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> works as advertised, keeping my beards soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> He seems to like this product so far.</li>
            <li> He does not like sticky or greasy things anywhere near his hair but he loves this stuff.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s an old school dropper.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few woodsier beard oils and they just didn&#x27;t fit my personality or my beard.</li>
            <li> Masculine, but not piney.</li>
            <li> The boyfriend was using a dread/wax/balm for ages and his beard was EXTREMELY soft.</li>
            <li> Probably what i love most about this product is that I some times get sores on my skin from where the beard hairs get pulled, it&#x27;s very itch and annoying when I get them, since using this</li>
            <li> My beard is significantly softer after just a few uses</li>
            <li> It gets long and thick very quickly and so I was looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t just be fun to open as a gift but</li>
            <li> I said thanks for the raise (long overdue) and immediately headed to the nearest bar to celebrate my victory.  </li>
            <li> After only a weak my beard is noticeably softer and after only the first use it was way more manageable.</li>
            <li> Doe&#x27;s the the job no more dry stiff beard soft &amp; shiney smells great to my lady loves it</li>
            <li> helps calm my beard down and soften the hair.</li>
            <li> My beard feels soft and it now possesses it&#x27;s own gravitational pull due to its radiant shine emanating such vasts amounts of raw energy.</li>
            <li> Moms never want their boys to grow up, and she&#x27;s the sole detractor for this new hobby of mine.  </li>
            <li> A fresh slightly coconutty scent my wife enjoys.</li>
            <li> Giving it 3 stars because i&#x27;ve only started to use it and can&#x27;t vouch for what it actually does or doesn&#x27;t do for my beard, which in the end should really be what the product is judged for.</li>
            <li> He finally used it for the first time today and it already has his beard feeling softer and his skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dry.</li>
            <li> Not only was the smell very strong and did not dissipate as other review claimed, but it also made my beard feel greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> previous one I purchased was unscented, as I was unsure if I wanted to smell THAT all day right under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the other scents are great...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t completely solve all of my dry skin issues, even when using enough to make my beard way too oily and combing it in really well.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s got a full beard and he only used a little and it looked oily so use just a tad.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, a little will go a long way, and it makes your beard look majestic as fawk!</li>
            <li> For me, just a couple of drops and my coarse hair is soft and shiney.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d describe it as how us mid-westerners think the beach/ocean smells...very fresh, almost a saltiness, but without the dead fish odor of course.  </li>
            <li> Guess that&#x27;s just something I&#x27;m going to have to live with as long as I grow a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Grave Before Shave Beard Oil - Bay Rum Scent has a fantastic smell, seriously.</li>
            <li> Third Day: Boss told me that I&#x27;m kicking major ass at work.</li>
            <li> My beard is a year old this month, and I intend to have it for a long time.</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my beard lay down and the scent is very pleasing and not overbearing.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells great and it really made my beard softer, where it was previously like a wire brush, now I can touch it without cutting my fingers!</li>
            <li> It gives a little shine while the oil is absorbing.  </li>
            <li> At first it makes my beard all relaxed and soft but over the course of a few hours it goes extremely frizzy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exceptionally long, but long enough to cause irritation, which for me is any length whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty dry skin, and I&#x27;d been having pretty serious beard dandruff (which, trust me, is not fun).</li>
            <li> As far as for my beard, because I wear collared shirts at work I can&#x27;t really risk putting it in my beard past my jaw line because this stuff stays wet all day and will transfer to anything it touches.</li>
            <li> Starts out typical Bay Rum heavy on the cloves, then after a little while turns to more of a powdery vanilla type scent.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product but due to the frizzy effect I&#x27;ve had to explore other options.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t estimate how long it will last for those lengths.  </li>
            <li> , this stuff is going to last a long time, so if you&#x27;re worried about the money, I would say don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> but my husband says it does not last very long.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin under feel less itchy and the beard itself soft.</li>
            <li> For the record, that&#x27;s not a complaint, it works exactly as it should, I just worry about my shirts because they are expensive.</li>
            <li> A little too early to tell if it works yet.</li>
            <li> I do use at least twice as much oil as the directions say though.  </li>
            <li> I apply a few diffrent ways, I some times just apply the dropper directly to the beard</li>
            <li> Maybe it just needs long term use for any effect.</li>
            <li> The only down side to this stuff is that my wife (not a beard fan) has mentioned multiple times that she can smell it on the cats.</li>
            <li> I can definitely pick up the bay rum now, and the oil has grown to be much less flowery than my initial assessment.</li>
            <li> Within a few uses, we noticed his beard is less brittle and so much softer.</li>
            <li> This flowery scent is a little too much for me, so I reserve it for occasions when I might have to dress up a little.</li>
            <li> I might experiment with other oils just to test the waters, but I know where I will go back to if anything should be amiss.</li>
            <li> For the bearded man that wants to smell like and alcoholic without having to go through all that trouble of actually drinking!</li>
            <li> I have tried several other products and they do not compare.</li>
            <li> I apply it after a shower after a towel dry.  </li>
            <li> Turned my dry, flyaway beard into a woman magnet.  </li>
            <li> Anyhow, my wife got me this for Christmas, and since using it I&#x27;ve had almost no issues with dry skin in the beard district.</li>
            <li> I nailed two ladies during my lunch break and even had enough time to eat a slim jim and some crackers before heading back to the office to lay waste to my work.    </li>
            <li> I will definitely buy this again when it runs out, but a little bit goes a long way so that may be awhile.</li>
            <li> It could just be that the oil I was using previously was just a complete failure of a product, but I still have to give a major stamp of approval to this oil.</li>
            <li> The dropper makes it much easier to distribute throughout the beard with less waste and mess.</li>
            <li> and it just leaves my beard feeling very dry and brittle</li>
            <li> Little bottle lasted me about 5 months using it daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days now so after a couple weeks i will update my review</li>
            <li> minus having any styling ability.  </li>
            <li> 3 drops on my wet hands and rubbed it into my we beard.</li>
            <li> A few drops are all it takes, especially with a shorter beard like mine.  </li>
            <li> This oil is a bit thin and the perfume is too intense.</li>
            <li> Been using this only a few days</li>
            <li> but it did not really prevent my beard from itching that well.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way.</li>
            <li> Little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that I didn&#x27;t receive any stickers or little goodies like such, but that&#x27;s just me ranting.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews from some of the other &amp;#34;beardos&amp;#34;, this beard oil was the &amp;#34;beeswax&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> However, I will try other products to compare.</li>
            <li> ( evenly disrupted throughout).the other way is with a boar hair brush, I apply the oil to the brush bristles then run that through my beard.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this scent out of all the other oils I have used.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not exactly for shaping  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents.</li>
            <li> Not exactly the manly, pirate-esque aroma I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that calling my beard &amp;#34;unruly&amp;#34; would be an extreme understatement.</li>
            <li> Other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> This scent on this oil on the other hand lasts virtually all day.</li>
            <li> Not because I was unsatisfied with my other purchase, I was not, but I wanted to compare.</li>
            <li> A few drops go a long way</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve grown my beard in fully, and the first month is horrifyingly itchy.</li>
            <li> The smell at first was weird, since I never put anything into my beard before, and I wasn&#x27;t used to a scent that was located that close to my nose, but I asked a few people if they could smell it</li>
            <li> My husband has really thick, corse facial hair.</li>
            <li> This beard oil is a total slow burn.</li>
            <li> Instead, I stick a q-tip down in the bottle and rub that all over my beard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few other products in my beard, and this is one I like a lot.</li>
            <li> I have tried other oils that were heavy, and the smell was overpowering to the point that the smell wouldn&#x27;t even wash out after a shower.</li>
            <li> I seriously can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff.</li>
            <li> My beard is softer and my skin feels less itchy.  </li>
            <li> I used it for about a month and half and didn&#x27;t see any noticeable effects on my beard</li>
            <li> After using this for a week I seem to have a lot less split ends, though I still have some.  </li>
            <li> I have noticeably less beardruff.</li>
            <li> So I just put it on my mustache and then brush it down to my chin a little and leave it at that.</li>
            <li> Its a rather heavy scent with maybe a lot of coconut to it, but i smell no clove or hints of typical bay rum profiles.</li>
            <li> No more jabbing my wife in the lips with sharp wiskers.  </li>
            <li> All you need is a little.</li>
            <li> I have one of those dumb red beards and this helps it not be so bushy.</li>
            <li> A few drops is plenty.</li>
            <li> I can smell it for a few hours after I apply it to my beard</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday after I shower.</li>
            <li> He said, \\&quot;Please leave a few ladies for the rest of us\\&quot; as I pulled away in my muscle car while doing a burnout</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> No more itching or flakes.</li>
            <li> It has a &amp;#34;fresh from the barber&amp;#34; smell and is not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> I do want to point out, though - I ordered the Rum Bay version, and it has not a so faint smell of Patchouli mixed in it.</li>
            <li> I usually squeeze a dropper on each side of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Especially due to the Rum Bay scent.</li>
            <li> I have a small collection of beard oils, and I like the GBS oils quite a bit.</li>
            <li> not sure,</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as a stocking stuffer this past Christmas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard out there for a pimp, bearded or otherwise.</li>
            <li> , it makes your beard softer and it grows thicker and longer (at least with me it does)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong though, the scent wasn&#x27;t offensive, it just wasn&#x27;t at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> and I need at least 3-4 drops to keep it from drying out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s the fact it is scented that it loses some of it&#x27;s ability to keep my beard softer, and for longer.</li>
            <li> but I do have one complaint.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have one of those crazy long beards</li>
            <li> I hated this product the first time I used it</li>
            <li> and they said it was subtle.</li>
            <li> This was drying my beard out and making everything worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are no instructions or ingredients listed on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I have a medium length beard and get a lot of split ends and broken hairs that stick out everywhere and keep it from growing longer.  </li>
            <li> But alas, it just isnt for me.  </li>
            <li> Very subtle scent.</li>
            <li> This is not ideal if you want to comb your beard out or up because the weight of the oil keeps the beard looking neat and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ladies were powerless against my advances as they were mesmerized by the smell and softness of my beard.</li>
            <li> Weird baby powder-pseudo bay rum scent.</li>
            <li> Seriously..!!</li>
            <li> Not to mention, it will have the ladies going crazy.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong with GBS!</li>
            <li> Which isn&#x27;t a bad scent, but not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> After that, it wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> am disappointed in the following:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> So, if you&#x27;re expecting that, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bit disappointed that I don&#x27;t smell any coconut.  </li>
            <li> I was doubtful, but tried it.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is the b&#x27;ness! I use it as a moisturizer as well as a conditioner for my facial hair. A few drops is plenty.</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. Smells great (kind of like a cross between a tree oil scent and a rum scent). Worked almost immediately to relieve itching and has definitely reduced the beadruff. I will definitely buy this again when it runs out, but a little bit goes a long way so that may be awhile.</li>
            <li> Very good beard oil at a very good price. Makes my beard noticeably softer an more manageable. It as also very good for the skin under as I normally get a little dandruff but not so with this product. The scent is good, albeit a little reminiscent of Old Spice.&lt;br /&gt;Added bonus: the dropper REALLY helps to get the oil to your skin if you have a longer beard like I do. A very tiny drop in about 3-4 spots along the face and rub it in does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely will buy again!</li>
            <li> This is the best beard oil I have used to date, it is extremely addictive makes your beard nice and soft with a clean sheen.  The smell is phenomenal it actually edges out Dream Beard Gentleman Beard for my favorite, my wife loves the smell of it as well to the extent she kisses my neck just so she can smell it a bit more.</li>
            <li> SMELLS FANTASTIC!!!..I apply this twice a day..keeps my beard soft and healthy looking..</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Hope my boyfriends loves it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this and the balm. Personally I like the balm better. This stuff will stay in your beard much longer and leaves a very shinny finish. The scent is hit or miss, it doesn&#x27;t bother me but I definitely smell it and know it&#x27;s there. Would probably stick with the balm in the future.</li>
            <li> Awesome and wonderful are the words that come to mind. Just started using and already see results. My beard is significantly softer after just a few uses and I&#x27;ve had a friends take notice and compliment my beard. Definitely a must for those looking to grow a exemplary beard.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells great and it really made my beard softer, where it was previously like a wire brush, now I can touch it without cutting my fingers!</li>
            <li> Love. The aroma and works amazing</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome. My beard stays smooth and healthy looking. I love the smell and my wife probably enjoys it more than I do!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have one of those crazy long beards so I can&#x27;t estimate how long it will last for those lengths.  For me, just a couple of drops and my coarse hair is soft and shiney.  No more jabbing my wife in the lips with sharp wiskers.  The bay rum scent is to die for.  Not too strong.</li>
            <li> First, let me start with the packaging. It is awesome! I opened my package and it really caught my eye. The bottle reminds me of old medicine bottles and the dropper is made of glass and shows that these guys really thought about every aspect of their product. Now for the important stuff. I purchased this oil because I have been having some flaking and itching. I use beard shampoo and beard balm, but that was just very temporary relief. I try not to wash my beard but twice a week, barring any mishaps or rib eating contests, but I found myself washing mine more just to get relief. This was drying my beard out and making everything worse. I looked at many different brands and some of the prices seemed a little much. I came across this oil while looking through Amazon. I read the reviews and the price was where I wanted to be, so I chose this brand. I am happy I did because this stuff works great! No more itching or flakes. The smell is amazing and my wife likes it as well. It has a &amp;#34;fresh from the barber&amp;#34; smell and is not overwhelming at all. I started with just 8 drops and my beard and skin sucked it up. My beard is a year old this month, and I intend to have it for a long time. This oil is great and I think these guys have a new loyal customer.</li>
            <li> First of all great stuff. I really like what it does for my beard, and overall i like the scent. I do want to point out, though - I ordered the Rum Bay version, and it has not a so faint smell of Patchouli mixed in it. Not bad in the context, but I didn&#x27;t see this mentioned anywhere, and thought it should be.</li>
            <li> Great smelling beard oil. I love it! The Bay rum smell is amazing. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll need to buy any for a while, since I use only about 5 to 8 drops in the morning.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Keeps beard soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I&#x27;ve recently started growing a full length beard for the first time in my life. I&#x27;m only at 2 months of growth but I wanted to start taking care of my beard at a very early stage. Based on the reviews from some of the other &amp;#34;beardos&amp;#34;, this beard oil was the &amp;#34;beeswax&amp;#34;. My beard feels soft and it now possesses it&#x27;s own gravitational pull due to its radiant shine emanating such vasts amounts of raw energy. I highly recommend this product if your sport of choice is skirt lifting. My only complaint would be that I didn&#x27;t receive any stickers or little goodies like such, but that&#x27;s just me ranting. This product rules</li>
            <li> Works best on longer beards</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days now so after a couple weeks i will update my review but after only 3 uses it has made my beard softer and i dont use an after shave anymore seeing as how i enjoy the smell of Bay Rum</li>
            <li> This stuff smells AMAZING and makes my beard glow.  Not like a Fukushima glow, but it gives it a nice luster and softness.  Me gusta.</li>
            <li> Good product with a good scent.  There is a nice glimmer to my beard after i use this stuff that&#x27;s not at all greasy.  I also like that it softens my beard up...it basically does what its supposed to.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. However, I will try other products to compare.</li>
            <li> Wonderful stuff. Keeps my beard smelling good and under control.</li>
            <li> Takes a minute to get used to the smell. Really good product c</li>
            <li> I like how it makes my beard lay down and the scent is very pleasing and not overbearing.</li>
            <li> This is a great beard oil. My husband has really thick, corse facial hair. He was hesitant to use an oil with a scent but this almost smells like an aftershave. It leaves his beard really soft and manageable. I will reorder this product</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who grows a seasonal beard every year. It gets long and thick very quickly and so I was looking for something that wouldn&#x27;t just be fun to open as a gift but something that he would enjoy using. Already, in just a week, his beard looks full and shiny. Although, he wouldn&#x27;t appreciate that last adjective. The smell far exceeded my expectation. It&#x27;s very manly and I have to fight the urge to keep my nose buried in his beard on a regular basis. Highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time ordering this beard oil.  I put it on the second I opened the package.  My roommate was the first to say it smelled amazing.  The compliments just kept coming after that.  Not only does it smell good, it makes your beard softer and it grows thicker and longer (at least with me it does)</li>
            <li> Husband loved the scent, and it makes his beard SO much softer.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Little bit does the job with a nice fragrance also!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough this is the best beard product I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> The only down side to this stuff is that my wife (not a beard fan) has mentioned multiple times that she can smell it on the cats. Guess I ought to wash my hands better before petting the cat....</li>
            <li> Smells incredible and leaves the beard feeling noticeably softer without it feeling oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Smells good. Worked very well.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awesome and quite manly.  Tames my curly beard.  Wife loves the way it smells. Just a drop will do ya.</li>
            <li> Smells good and feels good on my mustache. The scent is rather mild. A little bit goes a long way. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the balm, Will do everything the balm does minus having any styling ability.  Smell is great if you enjoy coconut rum but can clash with colognes.  Not as heavy as the balm, may be more useful for thinner beards.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love GbS beard oil, I&#x27;ve tried every kind the offer, my favorites are the pine scent (makes me feel like a lumberjack )and the bay rum. my beard feel great, but better then that, it makes my skin under my beard glorious. I apply a few diffrent ways, I some times just apply the dropper directly to the beard ( evenly disrupted throughout).the other way is with a boar hair brush, I apply the oil to the brush bristles then run that through my beard. Probably what i love most about this product is that I some times get sores on my skin from where the beard hairs get pulled, it&#x27;s very itch and annoying when I get them, since using this I haven&#x27;t got them at all. Customer for life.....grave before shave baby.</li>
            <li> All you need is a little. Really good stuff and a good smell. i prefer this to a wax.</li>
            <li> great smelling stuff, gets deep on the skin and makes it feel good. a guys product for sure with a kick ass beard</li>
            <li> I love the following:&lt;br /&gt;1.This smells fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;2. This product is great for keeping a beard looking neat and clean without stray hairs, for which this product is made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed in the following:&lt;br /&gt;1. There are no directions on the bottle or box. I usually squeeze a dropper on each side of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;2. This is not ideal if you want to comb your beard out or up because the weight of the oil keeps the beard looking neat and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product probably does exactly what it is designed for, but I bought it more to keep my beard and face hydrated. I wish this was explained somewhere in the product description.</li>
            <li> My fiance loves how it smells and makes his beard look. And so do I! Beard Tested, wifey approved!</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my beard and skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> That smell just tells you, you want this in your beard! It&#x27;s oil, so don&#x27;t use too much 4 to 5 drops and you&#x27;ll smell and feel like a man that takes care of himself. Your beard will look healthier and nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong with GBS!</li>
            <li> Great product for the price ! Also great and fast shipping ! Thanks LN</li>
            <li> Works well, would prefer a little stronger bay rum scent but a good beard oil</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, but honestly I get better results from the $6 bottle of Moroccan hair oil I but at the store. Probably doesn&#x27;t have the same quality of ingredients, but I don&#x27;t think I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> Smells great! I have one of those dumb red beards and this helps it not be so bushy.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, if you&#x27;re considering it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Best oil I&#x27;ve tried so far. My beard is an unruly and coarse force to be reckoned with, but this stuff grabbed it by the short and curries and beat it into submission. After only a weak my beard is noticeably softer and after only the first use it was way more manageable. No longer does it sing du hast by ramstein, now I get out of the shower and my beard sings highway to the danger zone with an awesome drum solo thrown in. The scent ain&#x27;t too shabby either. Thesmell is somewhere between a mix of fergie and jesus. If u have a man beard and not some preteen patchy face bush.. you need this.</li>
            <li> Good smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beard still itches after 3 weeks use. I have found that Aveeno body wash softens the beard better than this stuff, but without the good smell of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye dropper is really an inefficient way to apply it. Instead, I stick a q-tip down in the bottle and rub that all over my beard. I tried using a cotton ball but that&#x27;s just wasteful because the cotton ball absorbs too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no instructions or ingredients listed on the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not really happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> The wife loves the smell.  I like that it tames my beard.</li>
            <li> Got it to make my beard soft. After 2 weeks I don&#x27;t think  it&#x27;s any softer but my beard sure smells good and feels healthier. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my husband.  It smells amazing!  I have noticed, even after months of use, that his mustache and beard are incredibly soft and healthy.  This is a very good product, and when it becomes available again, I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing!! My husband loved this. Only need a drop or two so it last forever!</li>
            <li> The smell of this oil is just far superior than your own mothers cooking. It&#x27;s scent runs smoothly into my nasal cavity causing me to be more of a man and shun the bald skinned lady boys away. Thank you GBS.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it smells great and makes my beard soft and itch free. It also helps with the flaky beard dandruff I get.</li>
            <li> Awesome....Works Great!!!!</li>
            <li> Wifey loves this stuff. The scent is so good that I&#x27;ve had no issues recommending it to tons of fellow bearded buds. The feedback from their wives is all positive as well.</li>
            <li> great stuff! Works as advertised. Love the scent.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing smell! The oil works great and makes my beard feel great. I already ordered more items from grave before shave!</li>
            <li> Buy this, if you have a beard!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this product!</li>
            <li> I was told to try beard oil for an easy, daily style for my moustache. I was doubtful, but tried it.&lt;br /&gt;Love this product!&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm, even under the nose all day!</li>
            <li> Very good, 3 drops will shine your mane. Tames fly aways to a certain extent and nice smell.</li>
            <li> Smooth Transaction, Great Product</li>
            <li> Great scent, and has really helped to minimize my crazy fly away beard hairs.  It has also softened my beard, which both my wife and I appreciate!</li>
            <li> Amazing beard oil. Smells fantastic and applies to beard well. Not to mention, it will have the ladies going crazy. My wife loves this scent out of all the other oils I have used.</li>
            <li> awesome stuff; best scent ive tried yet</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he did not like the aroma because he is a tattoo artist and works closely with his clients and doesn&#x27;t want to smell as though he&#x27;s been drinking. He&#x27;s got a full beard and he only used a little and it looked oily so use just a tad.&lt;br /&gt;I like it, but I&#x27;m not the one with the beard.</li>
            <li> I have what most people would consider a long beard (about 7 inches long) so I was very excited to try this out. Not only was the smell very strong and did not dissipate as other review claimed, but it also made my beard feel greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my beard feel, and my wife loves the way it smells.</li>
            <li> Purchased the Bay Rum for my husband and it smells yummy! It&#x27;s got a great fragrance and he likes how his beard feels now.  Can recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I seriously can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff.</li>
            <li> I will keep this simple; I have never used a beard oil before and so I don&#x27;t have a frame of reference except to say that this stuff is awesome! I apply it after a shower after a towel dry.  My beard is about 4months right now, 2 inches and I use about 8 drops. I can see this product lasting 2-3 months at the rate I use it.  While it&#x27;s not exactly for shaping  I find that it has really helped to train the mustache and keep it out of the way. It gives a little shine while the oil is absorbing.  Oil is not sticky and washes off your hands very easily. Is there a downside? I haven&#x27;t found one yet.</li>
            <li> My man has a beard and this stuff keeps it tamed. The delicate (but masculine) scent is quite nice for both of us.</li>
            <li> Great smell and keeps my beard from itching. Also keeps the skin from drying out and have not had problems with it clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! on my 4th bottle</li>
            <li> Best beard oil I&#x27;ve tried yet. Little bottle lasted me about 5 months using it daily. Just ordered the Bourbon scented one to try.</li>
            <li> Great product  buying more</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever! I&#x27;ve noticed a distinct change for the better since I&#x27;ve started using this product.  My beard is softer and my skin feels less itchy.  The scent is very pleasant and not over-powering in the slightest.  Stop doubting and start buying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I -HIGHLY- recommend this to anyone and everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipment was prompt and the packaging was well done.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes my beard softer. Can&#x27;t wait to try the other scents.</li>
            <li> Great oil and my wife likes the smell. Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the entire bottle now, so I feel comfortable reviewing it. It quickly got rid of the little bit of beardruff I had, and it was easy to apply (I used three drops down each jawline, plus a couple drops on my mustache). However, it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like Bay Rum. My dad used Bay Rum aftershave so I know the scent well, and this isn&#x27;t it. This smells more like baby powder! Which isn&#x27;t a bad scent, but not what I wanted. It didn&#x27;t really matter much, though, because even though the scent is strong initially it quickly fades. So, to sum up, the oil did keep my skin and beard healthy and happy, but it didn&#x27;t smell at all like Bay Rum.</li>
            <li> the oil really makes your beard shine and smell great!! my wife hates my beard but loves the smell when I walk by her.</li>
            <li> Works well and smells great.  I can smell it for a few hours after I apply it to my beard and I can&#x27;t stop inhaling deeply.</li>
            <li> scent is pretty powerful and took a bit of getting used to, but overall I like this beard oil. I like the Honest Amish scent better, but this is pretty nice too once I got used to it.</li>
            <li> The oil helps condition my long beard, and has a nice scent, but the scent is kind of potent to be under the nose all day. The dropper makes it much easier to distribute throughout the beard with less waste and mess.</li>
            <li> Since I wrote the below, I&#x27;ve completely changed my mind. This beard oil is a total slow burn. The fragrance almost seems to come into its own after a few uses. I can definitely pick up the bay rum now, and the oil has grown to be much less flowery than my initial assessment. This oil has grown on me to the point it has become my go to beard oil. The scent becomes your own, and it goes on and soaks in so naturally. So glad I stuck with this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meh. I normally use Honest Amish beard oil, which I love, but wanted to give this stuff a try. Especially due to the Rum Bay scent. Living by the beach, I thought this would be the perfect compliment to my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s just say, at this point I&#x27;m not too impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was nothing at all Bay Rum like. It&#x27;s almost...flowery. Like roses, maybe. My daughter loves it, and that&#x27;s great. But she&#x27;s a six year old girl. Not exactly the manly, pirate-esque aroma I was expecting. Don&#x27;t get me wrong though, the scent wasn&#x27;t offensive, it just wasn&#x27;t at all what I expected. And it was really strong for the first two hours. After that, it wasn&#x27;t bad. But again, not at all Bay Rum-like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, I really like how the oil went on...felt good in my beard and not at all greasy. However, it didn&#x27;t work any magic on my beard&#x27;s actual appearance though. Maybe it just needs long term use for any effect. As a comparison, the oil from Honest Amish, which smells better, also has a marked improvement on how my beard looks after just one application.</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great and has an amazing scent. Def not like patruli oil. My wife loves the smell and isn&#x27;t into patruli or woodsy smelling stuff</li>
            <li> After using many different oils, this one was recommended to me and is by far one of the best I have used. It has a good scent that isn&#x27;t over the top.</li>
            <li> Make beard smell good, shiny.</li>
            <li> Love it smells so good very good and well priced only thing I could say wish it had a spray top instead of a dripper</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff. Has a nice smell and last longer than other oils I have tried. I will buy from them again but will try out a different scent.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband and he LOVES it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few other products in my beard, and this is one I like a lot. The viscosity of the oil is good for getting it worked into the beard...I&#x27;ve had thicker stuff and it just didn&#x27;t flow/massage in very well.  This thinner consistency also seems to penetrate the hair itself much better as my beard&#x27;s a lot softer than after using previous products.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is very interesting...I&#x27;d describe it as how us mid-westerners think the beach/ocean smells...very fresh, almost a saltiness, but without the dead fish odor of course.  My wife very much likes the scent on my beard too.</li>
            <li> Smells good lol my girl loves it</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go without it, great scent, and it keeps your beard soft and tame. 5 stars. Will def order again.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Awesome dropper/applicator in bottle. Smells awesome.  Goes on easily.  And ladies loved it.</li>
            <li> I have a small collection of beard oils, and I like the GBS oils quite a bit. I wouldn&#x27;t call the scent &amp;#34;bay rum&amp;#34; though. I can&#x27;t quite place it, but it reminds me of a cross of baby powder and ...maybe cotton candy? not sure, but it&#x27;s pleasant. it does keep my beard and skin looking and feeling good!</li>
            <li> On my second bottle. I like it. Smells good and makes my beard alot softer.</li>
            <li> This is a fine beard oil that will make your beard soft and manageable for the better part of the day. I have tried a few different oils and this is as good as any of the best. I am not too keen on the scent. I get a little lime and cocoanut, but the scent seems to have a very strong flowery element. This is a very strong scented oil and the smell can hang with you longer than 12 hours. This flowery scent is a little too much for me, so I reserve it for occasions when I might have to dress up a little. I can use it to keep my mind off the tie wringing my neck.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and the dropper is a must have item. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent.  I love the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> First time user of beard oils, and I decided to give this one a try. It works great! The smell at first was weird, since I never put anything into my beard before, and I wasn&#x27;t used to a scent that was located that close to my nose, but I asked a few people if they could smell it and they said it was subtle. After a couple of days of getting used to the smell, I didn&#x27;t notice it too much, which I prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it conditions my beard and leaves it soft and more manageable. I don&#x27;t really style it too much, but after 3 or 4 days almost all of my beard was able to stay were I put it, which I love. I might experiment with other oils just to test the waters, but I know where I will go back to if anything should be amiss.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Watch how much you use though... the scent can be a bit strong if you use too much.  I don&#x27;t use it on the moustache for that reason, but I keep that trimmed any way.  It also doesn&#x27;t offer much in the way of &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34;, but it does get rid of the prickliness my beard has. Makes it nice and silky, keeps it from getting knotted up when on the motorcycle, and the surprise plus is that I can&#x27;t feel the hairs pulling at my chin when I use it. Can&#x27;t imagine having a longer beard without it.</li>
            <li> Just incredible!  Buy it. On my third bottle.</li>
            <li> The oil leaves my hair soft and shiny. It&#x27;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the smell doesn&#x27;t do it for me. It seems more perfumy than bay rummy. To me, it has more of a sickly sweet, soapy, mothball smell. I could kind of make out coconut with tea tree. Maybe? But, normally I like coconut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for something more spicy with clove, cinnamon, and citrus like other bay rum products. Clubman Pinaud Virgin Island Bay Rum aftershave is the closest I can get to that spicy smell I&#x27;m looking for and was hoping to find something similar in beard oil form. So, if you&#x27;re expecting that, you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hated this product the first time I used it and so did my wife. It was soooo strong and perfumey and made my beard really oily looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of not using it, I decided to give it another shot, and for the first time, noticed that it&#x27;s a dropper, not a squirter. So I dropped. 3 drops on my wet hands and rubbed it into my we beard. Now I love it! My beard is much softer and more easily managed and my wife and I both love the smell (when the appropriate amount is used).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 3-5 drops a day, this stuff is going to last a long time, so if you&#x27;re worried about the money, I would say don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s worth it. I also purchased the Honest Amish wax which is better for reigning in a wild beard but does not actually help with softness or dandruff. I&#x27;m glad I have both, but I like this stuff better.</li>
            <li> Keeps the beard nice and soft, and smells great.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but wish the bottle was larger. Works like most oils, nothing special other than the cool smell.</li>
            <li> Ehh...no better or no worse than many other beard oils I&#x27;ve tried. Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Made of win and awesome!</li>
            <li> Love the smell but my husband says it does not last very long.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome, everytime I hug someone and they smell the oil they love it!</li>
            <li> I have all 4 scents by grave before shave. This is my favorite. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the scent.  Thankfully my brother was though so i just gave it to him.  I used it for about a month and half and didn&#x27;t see any noticeable effects on my beard, felt like it was mostly just cologne you rub into your beard.</li>
            <li> Finished my bottle and loved how it made my beard turn out!</li>
            <li> This oil smells good, makes my beard look good, and moisturizes my skin.  Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorites. I have the Bay Rum beard balm as well... Smells awesome, nourishes the beard and skin...and has just the right amount of shine.</li>
            <li> I like the smell.  It is a very old time barber shop type of smell that I like.  My wife will have to get used to it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend, while he liked how soft it made his beard it made his skin breakout and he only used a couple drops at a time.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve grown my beard in fully, and the first month is horrifyingly itchy. Hirsute friends recommended beard oil, I bought this one on good faith reviews, and it works beautifully. Few drops rubbed in n brushed in, the itch is gone, beard&#x27;s softer, and smells great (comparable to bay rum soap). Use it sparingly, gents. One bottle of this lasts over a month. If you look greasy, you&#x27;re overdoing it</li>
            <li> This is the first beard oil I&#x27;ve used.  I have a medium length beard and get a lot of split ends and broken hairs that stick out everywhere and keep it from growing longer.  I&#x27;ve tried hair conditioners without much luck.  After using this for a week I seem to have a lot less split ends, though I still have some.  Hopefully it improves more with longer use.  It does soften the hairs somewhat and help with itchy skin.  Seems to dry/absorb and leave a light residue that gives my beard some shine and weighs the hairs down and helps keep them in place after brushing/shaping.  I do use at least twice as much oil as the directions say though.  Overall it works pretty well, though it doesn&#x27;t soften my course beard as much as I had hoped and whether it improves growth remains to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is fairly strong and lasts most of the day.  Starts out typical Bay Rum heavy on the cloves, then after a little while turns to more of a powdery vanilla type scent.  I&#x27;m a bit disappointed that I don&#x27;t smell any coconut.  Pretty good but would be better if I could actually smell a bit of coconut.</li>
            <li> Every time I apply this oil I have flashbacks of the beach, blue waters, and coconut suntan lotion. Again, the lady&#x27;s will not be able to keep their hands from stroking and basking in all the glory of the tropical scented glory of your soft luxurious beard.</li>
            <li> I have recently decided to grow a beard.  It happened almost by accident, as I decided to just not shave everywhere one day.  I skipped the areas I tended to nick myself shaving, and here I am, months later, with a beard.  It&#x27;s not exceptionally long, but long enough to cause irritation, which for me is any length whatsoever.  So I did some youtube research, and they were all suggesting beard oil, something I had never heard of.  I hit amazon, and came across Grave Before Shave Bay Rum Beard Oil, and it seems that I hit a home run on my first time at bat.  The scent is light, but excellent, and my girlfriend, who questioned my beard-growing ways, loves it.  I put it on every morning, and use the GBS Bay Rum Beard Balm at night, for light control.  A few drops are all it takes, especially with a shorter beard like mine.  The feel of the beard is certainly smoother, and everyone seems to love the look and smell.  I use 4 drops each morning and feel like a new man.  Except mom.  Moms never want their boys to grow up, and she&#x27;s the sole detractor for this new hobby of mine.  Oh well, can&#x27;t win them all.  5 stars for quality, scent, feel and appearance.  GBS also has a facebook presence, and they occasionally offer specials available on Amazon.  For example, I picked up another oil and balm scent  combination from them- just had to add both to the shopping cart, and they shipped me Bourbon scented oil for free when I bought the Bourbon balm.  Great deals, great stuff, GBS!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that calling my beard &amp;#34;unruly&amp;#34; would be an extreme understatement. I&#x27;ve got about a 10 inch-long goatee and each individual hair that falls out looks like a combination between a trophy truck&#x27;s suspension coil and the windiest roller coaster you&#x27;ve ever seen. I&#x27;m quite confident my beard would snap a comb in half should one ever dare to traverse it. With all that being said, this oil turned my beard to butter immediately. I&#x27;ve been able to shape my beard and have it retain its shape without having to use any wax or leave-in conditioner, which is a nice change of pace. It could just be that the oil I was using previously was just a complete failure of a product, but I still have to give a major stamp of approval to this oil. Oh, and like I said, the scent is incredible. You&#x27;ll just have to experience it for yourself.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Made my husband&#x27;s beard nice and soft, and smells manly.</li>
            <li> Jeezum crow this stuff is fantastic! I am incredibly impressed I&#x27;ve never really fancied beard oil before (never liked it) but I believe this has made me a regular user. The smell is phenomenal (seriously, I love it.), the product works exactly how you&#x27;d expect, makes the beard soft and glorious and I really love the art style. I wish that I&#x27;d seen the bay rum mustache wax when I ordered this but alas I ended up getting lavender and it too is a fantastic product.&lt;br /&gt;They shipped this out ridiculously quick and they included a few super cool stickers in the package.&lt;br /&gt;Overall worth every penny and 10/10 will absolutely do business again.</li>
            <li> Nice rummy aroma without making you smell like you&#x27;ve been at the rum all day. No judgment if you have though. It&#x27;s hard out there for a pimp, bearded or otherwise.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve used a couple other beard oils and found this to be the best. The smell is great and my girlfriend loves it. I use it almost every day and even on the days I forget to use it my beard feels smoother than it would if I go a couple days without it. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your beard shiny and works great.  I love the scent.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll hear a lot of beardsmen raving about Grave Before Shave&#x27;s Bay Rum scent - and for good reason - it&#x27;s a high quality oil with a sweet rum scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm, but lasts throughout the day. Price is right too.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. Love the smell.</li>
            <li> smells great, does the job</li>
            <li> Fragrance is too candy-like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several beard oils and this is by far my favorite!! The scent is awesome wish they sold it as a cologne, will buy more scents from this company, consider me a customer for life!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product from an excellent company.  Beard oil smells great and can&#x27;t wait to try all the other scents.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing. I ordered it for my bf who absolutely loved it. I wish it came in a box or something, but the product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> For the bearded man that wants to smell like and alcoholic without having to go through all that trouble of actually drinking! In all seriousness, great product, helped greatly with dry itchy skin that I always got when trying to grow out my beard before, helps soften it and smells great.</li>
            <li> Great smell, and helps prevent the split-ends that I tend to get when my beard gets longer.  I will continue to buy this brand.</li>
            <li> If you have a beard, you need this product.  Turned my dry, flyaway beard into a woman magnet.  The scent is subtle and perfect. Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  Took about a week to notice the goat getting softer.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pretty light on this one too.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic, a little will go a long way, and it makes your beard look majestic as fawk!</li>
            <li> This oil is great. Very subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Stop reading reviews and buy it already.</li>
            <li> Doe&#x27;s the the job no more dry stiff beard soft &amp; shiney smells great to my lady loves it</li>
            <li> Bought this beard oil for my husband and he absolutely loved it!! The scent isnt overpowering at all and smells amazing! Within a few uses, we noticed his beard is less brittle and so much softer. Definately will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Excellent! Wasn&#x27;t sure how to describe the smell, but it is a sweeter smell that I had imagined. At first my wife did not like it, but she has come around.</li>
            <li> The only reason it&#x27;s not 5 stars is because I don&#x27;t totally love the scent. Other than that I like it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my love because his beard was so dry and scratchy. Now its soft and shiny and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the scent of this beard oil. I was previously using a very &amp;#34;woody&amp;#34; smelling oil that, while it was conditioning the beard nicely, the scent was wearing off within minutes. This scent on this oil on the other hand lasts virtually all day. I&#x27;ll come home from work, having put it on in the morning, and still catch wiffs of it. And it smells good! A fresh slightly coconutty scent my wife enjoys. In fact she&#x27;s much happier now that I don&#x27;t smell like I&#x27;m fresh from the lumber mill.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the scent. By far, this is my favorite of all of the beard oils I have purchased. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Great product, not greasy at all. Smell is a little strong but pleasant and fades throughout the day. Conditions very well.</li>
            <li> Love the scent alone. And it stopped itching on the skin.</li>
            <li> This oil is a bit thin and the perfume is too intense.</li>
            <li> As a beard oil it is as good as any that I have used. I&#x27;m rating it three stars cause it said it was a bay run scent but is not close to that at all. It&#x27;s a good sweet scent but not bay run which is what they said and what I thought I was buying.</li>
            <li> Great scent and makes my beard noticeably softer to the touch.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday after I shower. Mosuturizes my skin and smells great!</li>
            <li> Too much of a perfume smell for me.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he loves it! And so do I, actually. It smells WONDERFUL. It was his first beard oil and it really makes his beard look great. And I can&#x27;t get enough of it, so it&#x27;s a win-win. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Awesome oil. I love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I have pretty dry skin, and I&#x27;d been having pretty serious beard dandruff (which, trust me, is not fun). Itchy, flaky, the works. Anyhow, my wife got me this for Christmas, and since using it I&#x27;ve had almost no issues with dry skin in the beard district. It&#x27;s been nigh on miraculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and as an added bonus, my wife really digs the sent. So that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, oils didn&#x27;t preform as expected (seemed to dry up and disappear within and hour) but the smell is one of the best out there!! May be my beard was just soaking it up so I&#x27;m not blaming the product.</li>
            <li> Great smelling. Easy to use. Noticeable results. &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
            <li> favorite beard product, the smell, the softness it goves my beard, and the lady friend loves the way it smells.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good, I use it every couple of days. The sent is just okay as far as I am concerned</li>
            <li> Great scent my favorite one out of the group</li>
            <li> The absolute best beard oil, period!  It does everything the ad says, and then some!  The Bay Rum smell is a nice fresh manly scent, yet in no way overpowering!</li>
            <li> Very good smell. Just as described, very nice subtle after notes of coconut.</li>
            <li> Works noticeably better than the beard balm I was using. It also doesn&#x27;t leave my fingers as greasy as the beard balm did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t completely solve all of my dry skin issues, even when using enough to make my beard way too oily and combing it in really well. It was better than with the beard balm though. Guess that&#x27;s just something I&#x27;m going to have to live with as long as I grow a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is pleasant and not overpowering at all. Within a couple minutes, I don&#x27;t even notice it all.</li>
            <li> works as advertised, keeping my beards soft and manageable.  Great scent, too; my girlfriend likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!! I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough. Been using this only a few days but it&#x27;s changed my life!    First Day: Put on this wonderful-smelling product and immediately noticed how much better I looked. I know the broads really dig it, too. As I was walking into my office all the hot chicks were totally eyeballing me. Once they got a whiff of this beard oil, it was easy pickings. The ladies were powerless against my advances as they were mesmerized by the smell and softness of my beard. I nailed two ladies during my lunch break and even had enough time to eat a slim jim and some crackers before heading back to the office to lay waste to my work.    Second Day: While at a shopping mall I met some hot broad and immediately she commented on how manly my beard looked as she petted my goatee. Shortly thereafter I nailed her in my car in the parking lot. I KNOW it was the beard oil that put me over the top.  I wish I&#x27;d asked her for her name or phone number, but there&#x27;s more where that came from - now that I&#x27;ve got my beard oil!    Third Day: Boss told me that I&#x27;m kicking major ass at work. He mentioned how my goatee is super manly now and that I deserve to have a 50% raise just for being so manly. I said thanks for the raise (long overdue) and immediately headed to the nearest bar to celebrate my victory.  On the drive home, I was pulled over by the police, but after they noticed my beard awesomeness the officer gave me a high-five and let me go on my way. He said, \\&quot;Please leave a few ladies for the rest of us\\&quot; as I pulled away in my muscle car while doing a burnout (It&#x27;s stick-shift of course).    If you want to be a virgin and loser then don&#x27;t buy this stuff. On the other hand, if you want to exude super manliness, look awesome, smell superb, have to fight your way through a pile of naked broads every day, have ladies willing strip naked for you, make more money, increase the length and girth of your manhood, and generally kick ass, then by all means, buy this stuff and start using immediately.    Also makes a great cereal topping (not recommended for beginners)</li>
            <li> Good priced beard oil. Bay run is a great lingering scent. I recommend it</li>
            <li> Smells great!  A little too early to tell if it works yet.</li>
            <li> Keeps my beard shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> Love my Grave Before Shave Bay Rum beard oil.  I smell just like a pirate, women are throwing themselves at me and my beard is fuller then ever.....</li>
            <li> The scent is very mild and pleasant.  Using this oil has reduce the dryness that usually impacts my beard greatly when the temperature begins to drop.</li>
            <li> Great scent but it did not really prevent my beard from itching that well.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have tried several other products and they do not compare.</li>
            <li> The smell is overwhelming.  Smells like perfume.  Not manly at all!</li>
            <li> This is the best beard oil I have tried!! The smell is great!! I get tons of compliments on it!!</li>
            <li> While the shipping was fast, this oil has no smell of coconut, rum, etc.  The smell is similar to hair tonic or some type of hair oil.  I was expecting a very tropical &amp;#34;bay rum&amp;#34; scent.  The scent is also very strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li> Great for a nice nose pick me up and for keeping the beard tamed. Makes the skin under feel less itchy and the beard itself soft.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my brother.. He seems to like this product so far.</li>
            <li> smells wonderful. works great. brings out the inner pirate!</li>
            <li> My woman likes the smell. I have noticeably less beardruff.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. Smells great! I use it before I apply Moustache wax in the morning and again at night. My stash has become super soft and conditioned.</li>
            <li> It is alright and it smells ok</li>
            <li> Good beard oil! It smells good, too, even if it&#x27;s a little TOO strong.</li>
            <li> Works great will buy again</li>
            <li> My husband loved this. I gave it to him as a Christmas present. He cant get enough of the smell. He does not like sticky or greasy things anywhere near his hair but he loves this stuff. It absorbs quickly and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> Best product I ever used hands down</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Started really growing my beard out, and this beard oil works great, and smells great as well. Wonderful product!</li>
            <li> Massive fan of the Fisticuffs beard oils, this was the first one I bought and I still think it is the best.&lt;br /&gt;I have a fairly merry beard, not too long, but certainly full enough for my niece to believe I am a professional pirate, and this helps to keep it smooth, under control and not suffer from dreaded &amp;#34;beard &#x27;druff&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes about 3-4 drops for me to hit my face with a great smelling conditioning every day. I don&#x27;t find it greasy and it hasn&#x27;t led to any spots or blocked pores. Really great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells INCREDIBLE! It makes my husband&#x27;s beard super soft and has made it come in a bit thicker as well. The only reason it doesn&#x27;t have 5 stars is the scent fades towards the end of the day and doesn&#x27;t smell very pleasant at all.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> Truth is I didn&#x27;t like the scent the first time I opened the bottle but my wife sure did! So after a few more whiffs and applying the oil to my beard it has a fresh warm spicy scent that reminds me of the Caribbean Islands. I&#x27;m really digging the scent! The oil absorbs really well also. For reference I&#x27;m mixing about 6 drops in the palm of my hand and rubbing it in. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells ah-mazing!! I bought it for my husband for Christmas, and not only does he love it, but I can&#x27;t quit sniffing his beard! The smell  is clean, fresh and manly. He&#x27;s also happy that it really does help with &amp;#34;beardruf!&amp;#34; We will definitely buy it again once he runs out.</li>
            <li> This before shave beard oil, feels great, smells incredible and leaves my skin feeling amazing. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Really helped moisturize my beard. I have found that the wax/ balms work better though</li>
            <li> Very good scent and shines the beard really nice. I&#x27;m not too sure at the moment if it&#x27;s helping with growth!but a good product overall.</li>
            <li> Very nice, very wet, great scent! I use this to soften up my mustache and it works perfectly for that purpose. As far as for my beard, because I wear collared shirts at work I can&#x27;t really risk putting it in my beard past my jaw line because this stuff stays wet all day and will transfer to anything it touches. So I just put it on my mustache and then brush it down to my chin a little and leave it at that. For the record, that&#x27;s not a complaint, it works exactly as it should, I just worry about my shirts because they are expensive. I think using a better boar bristle brush might help but I think over all this stuff will always transfer to anything it touches if there is acquitted oil used on your beard and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s true of all beard oils. Someone like me should probably use a beard balm instead and I may try that in the future. Love the scent. Love it!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product on account of the fact that is smells amazing.  The wife loves the scent as well.  But alas, it just isnt for me.  I used it for about a week and it just leaves my beard feeling very dry and brittle (steel wool comes to mind).  I guess I will have to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as a stocking stuffer this past Christmas. He finally used it for the first time today and it already has his beard feeling softer and his skin doesn&#x27;t feel as dry. Also smells great. Winner!</li>
            <li> I bought this beard oil for my boyfriend and he loves it. Totally made his beard less scraggly and really healthy and shiny. Plus I adore the smell. This stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> The smell of it is PERFECT!!!</li>
            <li> Seriously..!! This stuff is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Completely eliminated the itchiness and smells great</li>
            <li> This is the stuff! I have a coarse beard and this oil helps calm my beard down and soften the hair. It smells fantastic as well. I&#x27;ve been able to grow my beard longer and more full since using this product. I&#x27;ve finally crossed the line from looking like &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t give a F%&amp;K&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;Holiday handsome.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Very strong smell. I have a decently filled out 6 month beard and I need at least 3-4 drops to keep it from drying out. Only problem is that 2 drops seems to be the limit for my nose.</li>
            <li> Wife smelled this on me today and, lol...Jackpot! !! ...Definitely buy it</li>
            <li> I love it. Exactly as description describes, my beard is soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite sents, &#x27;n the ladys like it too!</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this, and it really does work. Normally my beard is quite volumous, but with this it looks neat and kempt.</li>
            <li> Great beard oil conditions and leaves my beard smelling wonderful.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because of all the rave reviews on its scent. I know this may be subjective, but this smells nothing like Bay Rum to me. Its a rather heavy scent with maybe a lot of coconut to it, but i smell no clove or hints of typical bay rum profiles. Maybe i got a bum batch? Disappointing. Giving it 3 stars because i&#x27;ve only started to use it and can&#x27;t vouch for what it actually does or doesn&#x27;t do for my beard, which in the end should really be what the product is judged for.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. It smells awesome. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Keep my beard shinny and soft!</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend when I ordered the balm. This product didn&#x27;t do much for his beard and had a very strong fragrance. The balm on the other hand was perfect. It keeps his beard soft, tamable, and has a subtle fragrance that smells good.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and calms down the stragglers.</li>
            <li> I love the Grave Before Shave product line. This is my second bottle of their beard oil (the first being their pine scent) and boy oh boy do I love the stuff. It gives my beard a light shine and makes it workable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the scent it gives off is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I have 3 of the Grave Before Shave beard oils (Viking, OG, and Bay Rum) and this is my favorite.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the other scents are great... but this one is my personal preference and daily blend.  It&#x27;s not greasy at all, and my beard pretty much absorbs it like it&#x27;s candy.  It makes your beard super soft and keeps it smelling great... my wife loves it.  Excellent service as well, very quick with getting your order out the door.  Oh yea, and the applicator is perfect... it&#x27;s an old school dropper.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few woodsier beard oils and they just didn&#x27;t fit my personality or my beard. I got this bay run beard oil and it&#x27;s delightful. Masculine, but not piney.</li>
            <li> Greatest Scent Ever. I still have not met a woman that can resist the smell of Bay Rum. Do yourself a favor and later up with this. You will thank me later... I promise.</li>
            <li> I just got this today, and I absolutely love it!  I&#x27;m very pleased with the sent, which is masculine, but not musky.  The oil is nice and thick, and coats my beard easily. It gives my beard a healthy shine and helps manage pesky fly-aways. It&#x27;s easier to manage than waxes too. I&#x27;ll definitely be back for more.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, great smell! Not to slick as most oils tend to be, absorbs quickly. Light, pleasant scent. Also loved the stickers they included in the packaging.</li>
            <li> Smelling o so fine!!! Always good when your beard smells that of a god!</li>
            <li> I have tried all the GBS scents and this one is my favorite. This oil is light and the scent is mellow. I have tried other oils that were heavy, and the smell was overpowering to the point that the smell wouldn&#x27;t even wash out after a shower. I love the way my beard looks, and smells.</li>
            <li> This was my second beard oil I tried. Not because I was unsatisfied with my other purchase, I was not, but I wanted to compare. I got the Beard Oil and Conditioner, no brand name, just BEARD OIL on the label and it was perfect quite frankly. But how do I know? I hadn&#x27;t tried anything else!&lt;br /&gt;So I purchased this for two reasons, I love the brand name &amp;#34;Grave Before Shave Beard Oil&amp;#34;, and I wanted one with a scent.&lt;br /&gt;The previous one I purchased was unscented, as I was unsure if I wanted to smell THAT all day right under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grave Before Shave Beard Oil - Bay Rum Scent has a fantastic smell, seriously. It&#x27;s rustic and sweet, but not overbearing and fades over time. My Wife absolutely loves the smell. She rarely touches my beard let alone shove her nose in it! So a gold star for that! The oil is light, the fragrance is top draw, and it keep my beard nice and not dry. Now I say &amp;#34;not dry&amp;#34; because while not dry is good, I want soft too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s the fact it is scented that it loses some of it&#x27;s ability to keep my beard softer, and for longer. I don&#x27;t know. Overall though it is very nice, and scent is fabulous, just not quite the softness I crave.</li>
            <li> Great oil. Weird baby powder-pseudo bay rum scent.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love the smell!</li>
            <li> Never tried beard oil before, but I&#x27;m hooked. Easy to apply (just a small amount goes a long way), Smell is a very light on me, adds shine to the white goat I have growing. Great product, thanks!</li>
            <li> I really like the smell but I do have one complaint. At first it makes my beard all relaxed and soft but over the course of a few hours it goes extremely frizzy. Like static electricity has built up in my beard. I really like the product but due to the frizzy effect I&#x27;ve had to explore other options. Still have the oil and will try it again to see if I still have the same outcome.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he just can&#x27;t seem to find beard oil on store shelves anywhere. Most everything I found had more woodsy scents to them, but I didn&#x27;t want him to smell like a Christmas tree! So, I took my chances with the Bay Rum Scent, and I was not disappointed! The scent is not overpowering, it&#x27;s a nice, light scent. It kind of reminds me of summertime! And it really softens his beard. He loves it, I love it. So, it&#x27;s a win-win situation. I will definitely be buying this again!</li>
            <li> Really improved the look of his beard.  Smells great.  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product. It does have a very nice smell to it, but as far as doing anything of real relevance, I just didn&#x27;t see it. Nothing that I couldn&#x27;t have gotten from using coconut oil, which I&#x27;m going back to. A little does go a long way. I did about 4-5 drops and aside from smelling good, it makes your beard fairly shiny for about 2 hours. I am not an Amazon troll at all, but this product simply did nothing for me to the point of going out and buying it again. I can&#x27;t understand all of these amazing reviews as I was confident at least a few others would have thought the same. I might try their beard balm next but the oil for me is a no-go.</li>
            <li> The scent is amazing. Definitley a girl pleaser</li>
            <li> These guys kill it.. and product is always great.  Fast,  efficient.  Extra - awesome stickers!</li>
            <li> I get tons of compliments on how great my beard looks and smells now</li>
            <li> Really Amazing Works well, I became a pirate shortly after use. My gf like the Head Hunter scent better.</li>
            <li> Best beard oil ever. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Smells awesome and not too oily. Permeates the beard and seem to absorb pretty quickly. Just don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I got it for my boyfriend who&#x27;s beard was like a brillo pad.  Now it is soft, and smells great.  Plus, he really dug the pirate theme!</li>
            <li> Awesome beard oil , highly recommended !</li>
            <li> Great smell, not too potent.  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Has a great smell - not too wood-chippy, not to fruity (literally) like some I&#x27;ve tried.  Nice weight, not too heavy, and it does keep my &amp;#34;corporate&amp;#34; beard in a nice sheen and feel to the hand.  High recommendation.</li>
            <li> Simply great. Misses loves it. A few drops go a long way</li>
            <li> Great smell by a great company.</li>
            <li> Great product will buy again</li>
            <li> Great stuff, conditions my beard and isn&#x27;t heavy. My new go to for beard oil.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Use it every morning after a shower. Smells great and softens my beard.</li>
            <li> Grave Before Shave beard oil is amazing. Not only does it condition your beard, it leaves an amazing smell that ladies will complement you on.</li>
            <li> Loved it. When it first arrived I couldn&#x27;t believe it was finally here. I&#x27;ve heard so much great things about this product I just had to try it. I&#x27;m glad I did. It smells great, and it helps with dry and itchy skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and smells even better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful product. It smells great and makes my already epic beard even better. My wife loves the way it makes my man wonder (beard) look and feel. My 2 little girls love to snuggle and sniff. It truly is a great product that made my rough and unruly manly face hair able to be appreciated by even little princess.</li>
            <li> Timely delivery and an amazing product!</li>
            <li> Just got this stuff. I read a bunch of reviews saying that it smelled great, and it really does! I haven&#x27;t had enough time for it to soften up my beard but I&#x27;m going to be happily putting this stuff on everyday because it smells friggin AMAZING! Do yourself a favor and buy some of this beard oil 😎👍</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well on the beard, and I do not care for the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very good stuff. Makes your beard soft and smooth, and fixes beardruff issues. The smell is nice, but not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have turned on a TON of my bearded brethren to Grave Before Shave beard balms and oils... I think you guys need to start paying me a commission!! :)</li>
            <li> Makes my beard smell great! Little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> The boyfriend was using a dread/wax/balm for ages and his beard was EXTREMELY soft. He finally ran out after 3 years using the same tub of the stuff and finally went with my suggestion using something that actually was meant for the beard? We decided on this because of the high ratings and honestly his beard got a bit rough... Anyway, it wasn&#x27;t for him, I thought it smelled okay but not as impressive as everyone made it seem... -shrug-</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Smells like the Carribean.</li>
