            <li>This product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Renavive has made an amazing difference in his quality of life.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, which never happened.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own, but</li>
            <li>Renavive is a true product with great results.</li>
            <li>I had studied all of the available brands and this one appears to be superior.  </li>
            <li>i strongly recommend !</li>
            <li>I knew it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>and I will also include the deed to your very own bridge in the the New York City area as a nice bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(yeah, I&#x27;m glad I had an idea of what was going on).  </li>
            <li>I also wasn&#x27;t very impressed with the various websites that contained info on the products...</li>
            <li>sure if it&#x27;s that or the Renavive</li>
            <li>i just used this combination and am feeling alot better now.</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>I WAS READY FOR THE DOCTOR TO BOOK MY SURGERY, WHEN HE TOLD ME THE GREAT NEWS.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kidney stone pain is on the top 5 of my &amp;#34;Ultimate Pain List&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Just today I read an article on the Internet where people discuss what was more painful:kidney stones or childbirth.</li>
            <li>so I have nothing to judge it by on it being better but everyone who as had one before said that they hurt like hell.</li>
            <li>Many stones are passed with the person never even knowing it with others needing surgical intervention.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll know for sure in two months when I get another x-ray.</li>
            <li>In any case, there are effective treatments for stones (the most effective for my money is the search, grab and crush surgical method which is quick, painless and cheap).</li>
            <li>stuff works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Pretty good stuff</li>
            <li>many years ago I went to Mayo Clinic for stone ultra sound breakup...</li>
            <li>Was fine for about six months</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t have much hope that it would work, but figured it could not hurt and decided to try anything this time.  </li>
            <li>i ordered this with hydrangea and stone free and chanca piedra herbal tea</li>
            <li>IT COMES OUT WITH THE SMOOTH SIDE FACEING OUT</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s natural ingredients sounded good</li>
            <li>Because of their naturopathic makeup, I couldn&#x27;t find any significant clinical trials.  </li>
            <li>ITS TRUE...</li>
            <li>I did much research on remedies, and I always appreciated honest and thorough feedback from others regarding their experience, so</li>
            <li>HE QUICKLY RECOMMENDED ME SURGERY, AND BEING SCARED WITH&lt;br</li>
            <li>He prescribed me  a medication to help with the pain and quick removal of the sand.</li>
            <li>MY VERY FIRST FEEDBACK...</li>
            <li>Even if the stones are still there, no infection makes it worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a try...</li>
            <li>when I couldn&#x27;t pass the last stone on my own.</li>
            <li>I have a 5mm stone in my lower right ureter.</li>
            <li>like magic within half an hour all is better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve felt compelled to share my experience using Renavive, as dealing with your first kidney stone can be a life-altering experience.  </li>
            <li>I continued this regiment during September and October, and was pleased that I didn&#x27;t experience any further pain.  </li>
            <li>Incidentally, the amount in each capsule of Renavive is a bit higher than in Uriflow, if that makes a difference to you.    </li>
            <li>I did not take any&lt;br /&gt;Asprin or any other pain reliever just to be sure the relief was real..it was!</li>
            <li>let me start out by saying this was my first Kidney Stone...</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I do not have MS, my online reading alerted me to the need for more Vitamin D in my present state of health.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks for being there for me!</li>
            <li>I needed to write the review two years ago when I had the kidney stone &amp;#34;adventure&amp;#34;.But ,first, I was so concerned about the issue, then ,when I recovered from the  kidney stone ,I forgot.</li>
            <li>Man/Woman up at the first symptoms of a stone, go to your doctor and start treatment.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m taking the second bottle and l&#x27;m feeling much better.</li>
            <li>This is the first time to use Renavive and I will order this product again.</li>
            <li>As a side-note, I decided against Uriflow because it appeared stock was limited and Renavive contained most (if not all) of the same ingredients andhad more content per pill.  </li>
            <li>POSITIVE, AND</li>
            <li>I was pleased they were capsules and easy to swallow, as I&#x27;ve had issues in the past downing large pills.  </li>
            <li>I grabbed a large glass of water ...added some lemon juice to it, as that is supposed to help break up stones...and took a Renavive</li>
            <li>and then another large glass of water.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really help in my case, but I can not say for certain if it wouldn&#x27;t help others</li>
            <li>this was later confirmed by a CT-scan.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had as much pain since taking Renavive.</li>
            <li>I have been taking the product for 9 days straight.</li>
            <li>fast forward to sunday afternoon..</li>
            <li>i was told i had a 2mm stone stuck in my urethra ready to drop into my bladder</li>
            <li>and i really dont like taking them</li>
            <li>igot ready for work and took i capsule of the RENAVIVE  and 2 of my pain pills</li>
            <li>But since these products are not regulated you really don&#x27;t know what your getting or how much..</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon for carrying it with this vendor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it really does work to help kidney stones away.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>did that for a few months and the kind of forgot to take them.  </li>
            <li>There is one minor thing about Uriflow that I prefer, which was that Uriflow includes cranberry in the capsules and Renavive doesn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s so easy to take cranberry separately, that I really don&#x27;t care anymore.  </li>
            <li>two pills a day, one before breakfast and the other before dinner (I was told at least 30 mins before was best).  </li>
            <li>It helped my spasms within a half hour of my first dose and was more effective then even the narcotics I have been prescribed for pain in the past.  </li>
            <li>I am probably disrupting normal function of my kidney with an unusual overload of supplements...</li>
            <li>My left kidney is full of stones.  </li>
            <li>I still have kidney pain, but it is less and getting better.</li>
            <li>Previously used Uriflow and was satisfied with the product but found it to be inconsistent in it&#x27;s availability.</li>
            <li>I took this stuff with high hopes but it didn&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
            <li>Help de solve my kidney stone would highly recommend</li>
            <li>So, while this isn&#x27;t quite a miracle cure for me, it&#x27;s definitely moving things in the right direction and I will continue to take it.</li>
            <li>I had a 8.3 mm stone in my right kidney and a 4-5 mm stone in my left kidney to start and ended up with 8mm stone in my right kidney and a 4-5mm stone in my left kidney...</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m a 50 year old male who is in general good health except for a few pounds</li>
            <li>would give it a 5, but I was taking so many meds, not sure if it was Renavive that did the trick, but things started moving along after I started taking it.</li>
            <li>The key to the product is correct dosage and taking it consistently.  </li>
            <li>After the first week the pain began to diminish and in the second it was gone.</li>
            <li>Still new to the product, but so far, I have to say, it has been truly miraculous.  </li>
            <li>AND with same positive results...</li>
            <li>now today I am recovering from a minor operation and I&#x27;m taking 2000mg vit c per day among many other supplements to speed my recovery...</li>
            <li>Also, I made my purchase directly from the product website...</li>
            <li>I have been very hesitant to try anything that is considered homeopathic or not endorsed by anyone in the US medical profession.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it over the weekend from the manufacturer directly overnight</li>
            <li>He was having them quite frequently before trying this.</li>
            <li>COMPLETELY...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve passed 4 stones naturally</li>
            <li>I  had high hopes for this product especially the Chanca Piedra component..</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll notice that NO ONE holds out a cure for them as they will go to jail the first time some one dies from using any snake oil cure for those kinds of stones).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing you know this if you&#x27;re reading this review, but 10mm is WAY to big to pass naturally.  </li>
            <li>I have 3 small children at home and work full time.</li>
            <li>I am a medical professional and took this product twice daily as directed for 90 days...</li>
            <li>I have had a few more episodes like this every few months...and every time just take my lemon water and Renavive...and</li>
            <li>Kidney stones are an inevitable result of taking a lot of Vitamin D and anyone who is susceptible to Multiple Sclerosis or other similar things, must have the right amount of Vitamin D.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The largest measurement ever for the largest stone was 2.5cm and in December, that stone was down to 1.8cm .. a fairly large difference.  </li>
            <li>I would take it more often if it was less expensive, and it does bother my stomach a little, but the annoyance is worth the help it offers.</li>

            <li> now today I am recovering from a minor operation and I&#x27;m taking 2000mg vit c per day among many other supplements to speed my recovery...</li>
            <li> Also, I made my purchase directly from the product website...</li>
            <li> I have been very hesitant to try anything that is considered homeopathic or not endorsed by anyone in the US medical profession.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it over the weekend from the manufacturer directly overnight</li>
            <li> He was having them quite frequently before trying this.</li>
            <li> COMPLETELY...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve passed 4 stones naturally</li>
            <li> I  had high hopes for this product especially the Chanca Piedra component..</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll notice that NO ONE holds out a cure for them as they will go to jail the first time some one dies from using any snake oil cure for those kinds of stones).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing you know this if you&#x27;re reading this review, but 10mm is WAY to big to pass naturally.  </li>
            <li> I have 3 small children at home and work full time.</li>
            <li> I am a medical professional and took this product twice daily as directed for 90 days...</li>
            <li> I have had a few more episodes like this every few months...and every time just take my lemon water and Renavive...and</li>
            <li> Kidney stones are an inevitable result of taking a lot of Vitamin D and anyone who is susceptible to Multiple Sclerosis or other similar things, must have the right amount of Vitamin D.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The largest measurement ever for the largest stone was 2.5cm and in December, that stone was down to 1.8cm .. a fairly large difference.  </li>
            <li> I would take it more often if it was less expensive, and it does bother my stomach a little, but the annoyance is worth the help it offers.</li>
            <li> I highly doubt it because of my past experiences.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s been 3-4 weeks now) and it apparently did what it was supposed to do...break down the stone</li>
            <li> THIS YEAR, BACK IN FEB, I HAD EXTREME PAIN, SO I DECIDED TO GO TO THE&lt;br</li>
            <li> , but I haven&#x27;t had a single UTI since July</li>
            <li> You are simply avoiding reality if you think you can solve a stone any other way!</li>
            <li> I too was skeptical when I first heard about it from my brother, but I have been taking it for 3 years now and never had a kidney stone since!  </li>
            <li> He also indicated that even though the stone would be broken up that I&#x27;d still have to pass stone fragments, which he indicated are generally very small...but not in all cases.  </li>
            <li> I started taking the product as directed a few days after my initial attack...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that, with continued use, the stones continue to shrink and eventually disappear, as I&#x27;m REALLY not in the mood for percutaneous nephrolithotomy.  </li>
            <li> I take on empty stomach and eat nothing for an hour...</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is really a NO STAR REVIEW</li>
            <li> It actually dissolved them after a month and eased the pain in a few days.</li>
            <li> Started taking  one every other day...</li>
            <li> /&gt;PEOPLE IN MY FAMILY WERE SKEPTICAL, BUT I WAS CLEARLY READY TO TRY ANYTHING.</li>
            <li> IS NOT FUN</li>
            <li> NO FUN  </li>
            <li> ordered the Renavive product on Wednesday of last week from Amazon.com and the product arrived, as promised, yesterday - Friday late afternoon.</li>
            <li> My urologist indicated it could be the stone had passed down from the ureter into the bladder and was causing the irritation.  </li>
            <li> Almost immediately the pain began to settle down.</li>
            <li> I took the recommended dosage and within 3 and a half days I passed an 8mm kidney stone with virtually no pain.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting slight &amp;#34;spasms&amp;#34; and twitches from my kidney...</li>
            <li> ON THIS SUBJECT</li>
            <li> Within half an hour, all the pain and desire to pee was gone.  </li>
            <li> The doctor came in and said that Xray didn&#x27;t show any kidney stone, but added that kidney stone, probably crushed into sand and it will give me some hard time when coming out.</li>
            <li> , I am taking this to avoid the predictable agony of kidney stones.  </li>
            <li> Renavive has not bothered my knees yet and when I have felt irritation or discomfort, a pill once a day seems to do the trick after a few days.</li>
            <li> I started taking it a few years ago when I had kidney stones.</li>
            <li> this is not highly accurate for getting the status of kidney stones, but I wanted to get an idea.  </li>

            <li> all this pain meds slow my system down</li>
            <li> Soon after, I had a brief but painful kidney stone attack, which my urologist indicated was likely the stone trying to make its way from the kidney into the ureter.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how well this works yet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken this product for small, passable, calcium kidney stones.</li>

            <li> I have been having problems with small kidney stones passing, no more since I started taking this product.</li>
            <li> that evening my RENAVIVE came in and i took two pills with a bottle of water and my usual pain meds and went to bed...</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is helping or not yet.</li>
            <li> but in the meantime you&#x27;re groggy and not sure of what you&#x27;re doing and guess what you STILL have pain.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, that after I took this product NO MORE pain.</li>
            <li> so small that I didn&#x27;t even feel it passing.  </li>
            <li> Used uriflow in the past but over time that affected my knee joints.</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money!  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a hard sell.</li>
            <li> Yes, sand gave me hard time,but it was nothing  comparing with what I came through.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve felt compelled to share my experience using Renavive, as dealing with your first kidney stone can be a life-altering experience.  I did much research on remedies, and I always appreciated honest and thorough feedback from others regarding their experience, so I felt it was my turn.  In September of 2011, a 6mm kidney stone was found on an x-ray taken of my back...this was later confirmed by a CT-scan.  Within a week, I noticed blood in my urine that continued for a couple of days (yeah, I&#x27;m glad I had an idea of what was going on).  Soon after, I had a brief but painful kidney stone attack, which my urologist indicated was likely the stone trying to make its way from the kidney into the ureter.  When I met with him I was told I could have lithroscopy to break up the stone.  However, I was told the hospital cost alone would be at least $15k, plus another $3k for the doctor.  My jaw just dropped, as I knew even with insurance I&#x27;d be talking several thousand dollars out of pocket.  He also indicated that even though the stone would be broken up that I&#x27;d still have to pass stone fragments, which he indicated are generally very small...but not in all cases.  I had a co-worker that went through a lot of grief with his kidney stone, so I started researching my options.  I came upon some reviews of Renavive and Uriflow, and I have to admit I was fairly skeptical.  Because of their naturopathic makeup, I couldn&#x27;t find any significant clinical trials.  I also wasn&#x27;t very impressed with the various websites that contained info on the products...the lone exception was the audio testimonials on the Renavive site...they were very interesting to listen to.  To me, they seemed very authentic.  Also, because of the money-back guarantee I figured I would give the product a two-month test, and then make a visit back to my urologist.  As a side-note, I decided against Uriflow because it appeared stock was limited and Renavive contained most (if not all) of the same ingredients andhad more content per pill.  Also, I made my purchase directly from the product website...they had a coupon to save $5 (I was given a coupon code during a chat session on the website).  I started taking the product as directed a few days after my initial attack...two pills a day, one before breakfast and the other before dinner (I was told at least 30 mins before was best).  I was pleased they were capsules and easy to swallow, as I&#x27;ve had issues in the past downing large pills.  When taking the pill in the morning, I accompanied the dosage with lemon water (using lemon concentrate, the equivalent of one lemon).  I continued this regiment during September and October, and was pleased that I didn&#x27;t experience any further pain.  At that end of October I visited my urologist and asked if I could have an X-ray or similar to verify the status of the kidney stone.  Because of the radiation dose of CT-scans, he recommended an X-ray...this is not highly accurate for getting the status of kidney stones, but I wanted to get an idea.  When the X-ray came back there was no sign of the kidney stone.  The urologist indicated I must have passed it without knowing it, but admitted the X-ray could not be conclusive.  I had to chuckle because previously he told me that passing a 6mm stone would be very painful, if at all possible...and now he&#x27;s saying it might have passed without me knowing!  Hmmmm.  So, in the middle of November I started experiencing discomfort related to a constant urge to urinate...not painful, but quite the annoying thing!  My urologist indicated it could be the stone had passed down from the ureter into the bladder and was causing the irritation.  Well, this continued for about two weeks and then the irritation just stopped.  About 2-3 days later, imagine my shock as the stone passed...hallelujah!!!  I took the stone to my urologist for analysis and the size indicated was around 6mm, so the same as determined from the initial X-ray.  I know some people have commented that Renavive made their stones shrink or go away...in my case, it simply helped in passing without any pain.  Based on my personal experience and urologist visits, I have to conclude that taking Renavive definitely made the difference for me in passing the stone without pain.</li>
            <li> I switched to Renavive from Uriflow not quite a year ago because of the price. The reason I took Uriflow for several years was because it had dramatically lowered my incidence of UTIs.  Since switching to Renavive (I&#x27;ve also stopped a prescription drug, so I&#x27;m not 100% sure if it&#x27;s that or the Renavive that&#x27;s made the difference . . or the combination.), but I haven&#x27;t had a single UTI since July and it&#x27;s April now.  Even if the stones are still there, no infection makes it worth the price.  When looking at my last ultrasound results, my urologist did a double take because the stones were smaller.  The largest measurement ever for the largest stone was 2.5cm and in December, that stone was down to 1.8cm .. a fairly large difference.  I&#x27;m hoping that, with continued use, the stones continue to shrink and eventually disappear, as I&#x27;m REALLY not in the mood for percutaneous nephrolithotomy.  There is one minor thing about Uriflow that I prefer, which was that Uriflow includes cranberry in the capsules and Renavive doesn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s so easy to take cranberry separately, that I really don&#x27;t care anymore.  Incidentally, the amount in each capsule of Renavive is a bit higher than in Uriflow, if that makes a difference to you.    So, while this isn&#x27;t quite a miracle cure for me, it&#x27;s definitely moving things in the right direction and I will continue to take it.</li>
            <li> I took this stuff with high hopes but it didn&#x27;t seem to work. Went back to the docs for another ct scan and my stones were still there.</li>
            <li> I have Multiple Sclerosis. I bought Renavive thinking that it might help in terms of cleansing my kidneys and urinary track. I took it for a week and it caused problems with my GI track: diarrhea, stomach upset. If you have MS and are thinking of taking this please be cautious.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how well this works yet.  I still have kidney pain, but it is less and getting better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve taken this product for small, passable, calcium kidney stones. I researched some of the ingredients and decided to try it. It did seem to help. I would take it more often if it was less expensive, and it does bother my stomach a little, but the annoyance is worth the help it offers.</li>
            <li> Great product from a fantastic supplier!</li>
            <li> Help de solve my kidney stone would highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is a great produce If you have kidney stones it works great.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from kidney stones on and off for 5 years.  Have endured lithotripsies, stents, a cystoscopy and just waiting for them to pass.  Have tried the low oxalate diet, and lemonade/lemon water treatments and they have continued to come back bigger each time.  I have been very hesitant to try anything that is considered homeopathic or not endorsed by anyone in the US medical profession.  I had a flare up of stones again recently.  I just could not deal with the thought of being laid up for another week or month waiting it out for the doctor to tell me that it was time for another procedure. I have 3 small children at home and work full time. These stones were really starting to impact our quality of life.  I have done alot of research online and decided on Renavive. I honestly didn&#x27;t have much hope that it would work, but figured it could not hurt and decided to try anything this time.  I ordered it over the weekend from the manufacturer directly overnight and it arrived on Tuesday.  I took the recommended dosage and within 3 and a half days I passed an 8mm kidney stone with virtually no pain.  This was the same size kidney stone that I had last year and was laid up for 3 weeks waiting for it to pass on it&#x27;s own, which never happened.  I had the cystoscopy and stent and then a 2 week recovery from all that.  This product is amazing.  I have never reviewed anything online before but think it is horrible that no one had ever told me anything about these alternative treatments for kidney stones.  I could have lucked out this time with the stone passing on it&#x27;s own, but I highly doubt it because of my past experiences.  It helped my spasms within a half hour of my first dose and was more effective then even the narcotics I have been prescribed for pain in the past.  I will NEVER be without a bottle of this in my house and will take it as a preventative measure against futures stones.  I cannot recommend this product enough!!  It may not work for everyone but itdefinitely worked for me.</li>
            <li> After taking this supplement for 2 months, my husband reports he has had no more problems with kidney stone attacks.  He was having them quite frequently before trying this.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really help in my case, but I can not say for certain if it wouldn&#x27;t help others</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had as much pain since taking Renavive.</li>
            <li> Still new to the product, but so far, I have to say, it has been truly miraculous.  I will follow up at a future date.</li>
            <li> many years ago I went to Mayo Clinic for stone ultra sound breakup...it worked...they told me in their opinion..in some people...1000mg of vit c per day could cause stones...and I&#x27;d been having 3000mg per day...now today I am recovering from a minor operation and I&#x27;m taking 2000mg vit c per day among many other supplements to speed my recovery...and I&#x27;m getting slight &amp;#34;spasms&amp;#34; and twitches from my kidney...I am probably disrupting normal function of my kidney with an unusual overload of supplements...this  has been goin on for sevl days...ANYHOW...I took Renavive...6 capsules per day and immediately symptoms r gone...I take on empty stomach and eat nothing for an hour...this is my 4th time using Renavive....AND with same positive results...</li>
            <li> I have been having problems with small kidney stones passing, no more since I started taking this product. I will always have this on hand. I take it daily to prevent stones from forming.</li>
            <li> Called 911 &amp; was taken to the hospital. Thought I has a burst appendix. Turns out I had a 3ml kidney stone.  After 3 days of pain &amp; meds that knocked me out, Mom did some research &amp; found Renavive, ordered it &amp; it broke it up within the week. I passed the stone without pain, and it definately was NOT a 3ml but a much, much smaller one.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it a 5, but I was taking so many meds, not sure if it was Renavive that did the trick, but things started moving along after I started taking it.</li>
            <li> stuff works pretty good. i ordered this with hydrangea and stone free and chanca piedra herbal tea a combination of this has made me urinate two stones.  3 weeks after drinking this stuff. i strongly recommend ! which one worked best i wouldnt know but all are good i just used this combination and am feeling alot better now.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but I have to say..on the third day taking Renavive the kidney pain was gone. I did not take any&lt;br /&gt;Asprin or any other pain reliever just to be sure the relief was real..it was!</li>
            <li> I have a 5mm stone in my lower right ureter. I have been taking the product for 9 days straight. The product has failed to dissolve this stone and now I probably have to undergo lithotripsy or ureteroscopy to remove this stone that won&#x27;t pass. I knew it was too good to be true. Stones can&#x27;t be dissolved once formed. I was scammed!</li>
            <li> I use Amazon quite a bit.....I read all reviews and make my decision based on what was said..let me start out by saying this was my first Kidney Stone...i&#x27;m a 50 year old male who is in general good health except for a few pounds i have never really been sick or to the Hospital.my kidney stone started to hurt july 19th..by he 23rd my wife found me curled up in a ball on the bedroom floor because of pain..we went to the emergency room and was immediately seen..i was given TURDOL Through an IV with saline...pain was gone in 10 minutes..i was discharged about 2 hours later with a prescription of FLOMAX and PERCOCET  .5-325 x 12..the pain was in check for 12 hours..fast forward to sunday afternoon..just couldn&#x27;t take the pain anymore even with the pain meds...Another emergency room visit... another IV of saline and TURDOL this time with DILLOTTEN ....i was told i had a 2mm stone stuck in my urethra ready to drop into my bladder...same news as Wednesday......OK its JULY 27th and this is unreal the pain im in....I was given another SCRIPT of FLOMAX and PERCOCET...this time .75-325....all this pain meds slow my system down and i really dont like taking them but i had such anxiety getting caught somewhere with the pain and no recourse so i did... I searched on the WEB and stumbled on the Homepage of RENAVIVE...after reading all and every Review as skeptical as i was i ordered a bottle Next Day Air Fed EX...this was on Wednesday July 30th..  On thursday July 31st i finally had my appointment to my UROLOGIST...they took a urine sample and an X-ray...He told me the same thing... 2mm Stone stuck...as he tried to push me into Surgery to remove the stone...I freaked at what the procedure was and told him NO and at that point he got very Angry and rushed me out of his office....after i paid his co-pay that is....that evening my RENAVIVE came in and i took two pills with a bottle of water and my usual pain meds and went to bed...Friday morning August 1st i woke up with no pain...igot ready for work and took i capsule of the RENAVIVE  and 2 of my pain pills just incase...something felt different through out the day and i didnt take anymore pain meds...THE PAIN WAS GONE.... COMPLETELY...I ALMOST DONT BELIEVE IT BUT ITS TRUE...THIS DOES WORK...IT IS FOR ME...ITS SATURDAY MORNING AND IM AT WORK TYPING THIS...MY VERY FIRST FEEDBACK...I TOOK A CAPSULE THIS MORNING JUST LIKE THE INSTRUCTIONS READ...DONT BELIEVE THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY ON THIS SUBJECT...ALL THEY WANT IS THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THE OPERATIONS GENERATE...IF YOU ARE SUFFERING LIKE I WAS GIVE THIS A TRY...YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE AND EVERYTHING TO GAIN....THANK YOU RENAVIVE FOR GIVING ME PEACE BACK....I&#x27;M A BELIEVER....</li>
            <li> I think this product worked well for me, but I&#x27;m not 100% convinced that I passed my kidney stone because I used it.  I will say that I was using Renavive, and I passed the stone.  Was it coincidence, or was it serendipity?  I would say Renavive worked for me.  I took it for several days and I passed the stone.  I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I too was skeptical when I first heard about it from my brother, but I have been taking it for 3 years now and never had a kidney stone since!  I seemed to be a manufacturer of them and none have even shown up in x-rays! I will continue to use them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From Gordalitto in the Midwest.</li>
            <li> It works and it does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for about a month now.  Not sure if it is helping or not yet.</li>
            <li> Worked for kidney stone took for three days and pain all gone.</li>
            <li> Renavive has helped me to control my kidney health. Would recommend this to anyone who&#x27;s prone to kidney stones.</li>
            <li> PLEASE READ THIS.  IF YOU HAVE KIDNEY STONES, BUY THIS PRODUCT.&lt;br /&gt;EARLIER THIS YEAR, BACK IN FEB, I HAD EXTREME PAIN, SO I DECIDED TO GO TO THE&lt;br /&gt;HOSPITAL.  THE DOCTOR TOLD ME, THAT I HAD 5 STONES.  THE LARGEST BEING 1.7CM,&lt;br /&gt;AND THE OTHERS 1.3 CM.  HE QUICKLY RECOMMENDED ME SURGERY, AND BEING SCARED WITH&lt;br /&gt;THE IDEA OF GOING UNDER THE KNIFE, I OPTED TO SURF THE NET. I KNEW I HAD NOTHING TO LOSE,&lt;br /&gt;SO I BOUGHT \\&quot;RENAVIVE\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PEOPLE IN MY FAMILY WERE SKEPTICAL, BUT I WAS CLEARLY READY TO TRY ANYTHING. DAYS WENT BY, AND&lt;br /&gt;I STARTED TO SEE THAT MY URINE WAS CLEARING UP, AND FLAKES STARTED TO APPEAR IN MY URINE.ABOVE ALL, NO PAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAYING POSITIVE, AND 4 MONTHS LATER, I WAS SHOCKED TO HEAR THAT ALL 5, YES 5 STONES HAD DISSOLVED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I COULD NOT BELIEVE IT.  I WAS READY FOR THE DOCTOR TO BOOK MY SURGERY, WHEN HE TOLD ME THE GREAT NEWS.&lt;br /&gt;THE CAT SCAN SHOWED NO KIDNEY STONES.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVERYONE, PLEASE TRY IT. YOU WILL SEE GREAT RESULTS. IT HELPED ME, AND IT WILL HELP YOU. IF I COULD REACH OUT&lt;br /&gt;TO 10 PEOPLE OUT THERE, THEN I FEEL I&#x27;VE DONE SOMETHING TO IMPROVE PEOPLE&#x27;S LIVES.</li>
            <li> I am a medical professional and took this product twice daily as directed for 90 days...I had a baseline ultrasound prior to starting the product and at the end of the 90 days had it redone..I had a 8.3 mm stone in my right kidney and a 4-5 mm stone in my left kidney to start and ended up with 8mm stone in my right kidney and a 4-5mm stone in my left kidney...No change..My stones are Calcium Mono Phosphate which are very hard stones..Even lithotripsy is often repeated to break up this type of stone..I wish it had worked but no such luck..Based on my research I  had high hopes for this product especially the Chanca Piedra component..But since these products are not regulated you really don&#x27;t know what your getting or how much..</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever had a kidney stone, you know the pain.  The feeling that you have to constantly urinate EVEN AFTER you just went.  The medical profession likes to give you things that will ultimately help?, but in the meantime you&#x27;re groggy and not sure of what you&#x27;re doing and guess what you STILL have pain.  I went thru all of this and THEN I found this product.  I have to say, that after I took this product NO MORE pain. It&#x27;s likely gone (it&#x27;s been 3-4 weeks now) and it apparently did what it was supposed to do...break down the stone so small that I didn&#x27;t even feel it passing.  I will continue to use this as a preventative measure.....(i.e. didn&#x27;t like the paint).  It worked great for me and I&#x27;m a hard sell.</li>
            <li> All of a sudden when I was 56,  I started getting kidney stones.  I tried to control the stones with diet...but was still developing them every couple of months.  As I was researching on line what else I could do I found this.  I figured it was worth a try...lots cheaper than my last visit to the hospital when I couldn&#x27;t pass the last stone on my own. Started taking  one every other day...and then after two weeks  decreased to one a week...did that for a few months and the kind of forgot to take them.  Was fine for about six months then Bam...woke up one morning with stone symptoms starting.  I grabbed a large glass of water ...added some lemon juice to it, as that is supposed to help break up stones...and took a Renavive and then another large glass of water. Within half an hour, all the pain and desire to pee was gone.  I have had a few more episodes like this every few months...and every time just take my lemon water and Renavive...and like magic within half an hour all is better.  Thank God for Renavive!</li>
            <li> I had studied all of the available brands and this one appears to be superior.  Thanks, Amazon for carrying it with this vendor.&lt;br /&gt;It is designed to dissolve kidney stones.  Kidney stones are an inevitable result of taking a lot of Vitamin D and anyone who is susceptible to Multiple Sclerosis or other similar things, must have the right amount of Vitamin D.&lt;br /&gt;While I do not have MS, my online reading alerted me to the need for more Vitamin D in my present state of health.&lt;br /&gt;So, I am taking this to avoid the predictable agony of kidney stones.  I am told that they can be excruciating.  This dissolves and keeps them dissolved.  Again....thanks for being there for me!</li>
            <li> Pretty good stuff but can buy cheaper elsewhere</li>
            <li> I use this product, and have recommended to others who suffer from kidney stones.  I have also bought this product and given it to others in need.  The key to the product is correct dosage and taking it consistently.  Kidney stone pain is on the top 5 of my &amp;#34;Ultimate Pain List&amp;#34;.  Renavive is a true product with great results.</li>
            <li> I needed to write the review two years ago when I had the kidney stone &amp;#34;adventure&amp;#34;.But ,first, I was so concerned about the issue, then ,when I recovered from the  kidney stone ,I forgot.Just today I read an article on the Internet where people discuss what was more painful:kidney stones or childbirth.I left my response with recommendations to try Renavive. Then I returned to Amazon to share my story. To make the story short. The next day after I got back from ER, where I was told that I had 7mm kidney stone and needed to see urologist, I called for  an appointment . I scheduled it, but waiting time was  two weeks. I couldn&#x27;t waist the 2 weeks doing nothing and having that monster inside of me. After I researched all kidney  stone removal remedies I decided to give Renavive a try. I ordered overnight delivery and started taking Renavive the next day. In two weeks I was called by the urologist office and was told to come and have my Xray done before the appointment. The next day after I had the Xray done, I had the appointment. Once I arrived to the appointment I was told that they needed my urine for the test. The doctor came in and said that Xray didn&#x27;t show any kidney stone, but added that kidney stone, probably crushed into sand and it will give me some hard time when coming out. He prescribed me  a medication to help with the pain and quick removal of the sand.I was on the cloud 9 from happiness. Yes, sand gave me hard time,but it was nothing  comparing with what I came through. I  am not promoting Renavive here, I am just sharing my experience. My guess is that Renavive made the stone crush .By the way, I mentioned Renavive to the doctor, but he seemed indifferent to it.</li>
            <li> I passed my kidney stone with 0 pain after it made it&#x27;s way out of my kidneys.... I have never had one before so I have nothing to judge it by on it being better but everyone who as had one before said that they hurt like hell.</li>
            <li> IM TRYING IT  THATS ALL I CAN SAY  EVERY BODY RATED IT HILY&lt;br /&gt;  SO I HOPE IT WORKES  NOT LIKE ITS CHEEP  ITS NOT CHEEP&lt;br /&gt; AND PASSING STONES  IS NOT FUN TO DO  SO I TRYING SOMETHING&lt;br /&gt;  FOR THE PROBLEM  I SEEN THE STONES WHEN I WAS GETTING&lt;br /&gt; X RAYS  IN THE HOSPITAL SO I KNOW THERE THERE AND I ALREADT WHENT THREW PASSING A STONE AND THAT WAS NO FUN  YOU BLEED&lt;br /&gt; HOPEFULLY IT COMES OUT WITH THE SMOOTH SIDE FACEING OUT&lt;br /&gt;  AND THAT WAS JUST ONE  SO I THOUGHT I GIVE IT A TRY  WHAT IS ONE TO DO BUT TRY  AND HOPE  AND HOPE</li>
            <li> Used uriflow in the past but over time that affected my knee joints. Renavive has not bothered my knees yet and when I have felt irritation or discomfort, a pill once a day seems to do the trick after a few days. Good to have a bottle handy.</li>
            <li> Please....all of you believers in renavive......send me all of your money and I will send you a quart of snake oil and I will also include the deed to your very own bridge in the the New York City area as a nice bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is really a NO STAR REVIEW AS AMAZON REQUIRES A RATING TO PUBLISH A REVIEW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you think this stuff works you are simply responding out of fear and ignorance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hold myself out as an EXPERT on kidney stones.........having gone through 7 of them in 41 years. I am here to tell you that this (and all similar products) ARE A 100% SCAM! If you study and learn about kidney stones, what causes them and how they are treated, you will learn that, YES, they hurt and NO, they won&#x27;t kill you (gall stones will though and you&#x27;ll notice that NO ONE holds out a cure for them as they will go to jail the first time some one dies from using any snake oil cure for those kinds of stones). In any case, there are effective treatments for stones (the most effective for my money is the search, grab and crush surgical method which is quick, painless and cheap). Man/Woman up at the first symptoms of a stone, go to your doctor and start treatment. I&#x27;ve passed 4 stones naturally (yes, it hurts like h-e-l-l but the pain won&#x27;t kill you) and three were solved with optical surgery! Many stones are passed with the person never even knowing it with others needing surgical intervention. You are simply avoiding reality if you think you can solve a stone any other way! So.....face up to it and get through it......and, PLEASE, quit giving money to these scam artists!</li>
            <li> Since October 4th, 2014 I had a recurrence of a kidney stone. Immense pain in my back (kidney area) and even in my abdomen. Went to the ER room......they gave me an I V hookup and pain pills (Norco). Still the pain persisted off and on in waves and I continued to take Norco with Ibuprofen, as needed. Then last Wednesday, I read about Renavive. I was skeptical. However, I thought &amp;#34;what do I have to lose?&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s natural ingredients sounded good and so did the majority of the reviews here.&lt;br /&gt;COINCIDENCE OR NOT?&lt;br /&gt;I ordered the Renavive product on Wednesday of last week from Amazon.com and the product arrived, as promised, yesterday - Friday late afternoon. I was in a lot of pain and had just taken another Ibuprofen........then I immediately opened the Renavive and  took just one caplet. Almost immediately the pain began to settle down. I had a good dinner and went to sleep. I awakened at midnight with immense pain and took another Norco and 1/2 ibuprofen.&lt;br /&gt;THEN..............&lt;br /&gt;Fell back asleep and at 7 am the STONE PASSED!!!!! WITHOUT PAIN............JUST PLOPPED OUT.....................I do not believe it was a coincidence that using Renavive just ONE CAPLET played a great part in this process!!! I only wished that I had found out about this product earlier in the week. Now I plan to take at lease 1 caplet a week to maintain my sanity and to realize that my stones and any residuals are being washed away!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! - NO PAIN; NO DISCOMFORT NOW!!!</li>
            <li> Started having symptoms of kidney stones and read about this product online. Took as directed for 10 days and problem solved.</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money!  Product had no effect on my kidney stones whatsoever.  Would never buy it again or recommend.</li>
            <li> My husband suffers from chronic kidney stones and changes to his diet have had little affect.  After litherotripsy and ESWL and the painful recovery for both, I started looking for other solutions.  Renavive has made an amazing difference in his quality of life. As soon as he starts to feel the symptoms of a stone he starts taking the pills and they truly dissolve them.  At one ultrasound he had a 10mm stone (that&#x27;s almost half an inch folks!) and after taking Renavive for a month there was literally no trace of the stone on the follow up ultrasound. I&#x27;m guessing you know this if you&#x27;re reading this review, but 10mm is WAY to big to pass naturally.  Truly awesome product, worth every penny</li>
            <li> Great product. I have been using it for years and it really does work to help kidney stones away. I started taking it a few years ago when I had kidney stones. It actually dissolved them after a month and eased the pain in a few days.</li>
            <li> This product really works. Before that I was starting to have pain in the kidney area and realized that I must have kidney stones. After the first week the pain began to diminish and in the second it was gone. Now I&#x27;m taking the second bottle and l&#x27;m feeling much better. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been taking ths for a month.  No benefits yet.  My left kidney is full of stones.  I have a laser treatment soon.</li>
            <li> Previously used Uriflow and was satisfied with the product but found it to be inconsistent in it&#x27;s availability. This is the first time to use Renavive and I will order this product again.</li>
            <li> Scans showed a 3mm stone four months ago.  Hopefully it&#x27;s gone.  No problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll know for sure in two months when I get another x-ray.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell that it did anything for me. I still have stones and am looking for another remedy to help me.</li>
