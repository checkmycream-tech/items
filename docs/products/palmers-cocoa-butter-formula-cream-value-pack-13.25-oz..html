            <li>Can&#x27;t get anything better for this price!!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my pregnancy to prevent stretch marks, but this stuff is AMAZING for everything!  </li>
            <li>And it smells nice, too!</li>
            <li>Excellent prodcut, we love this Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, if you don&#x27;t mind smelling like coconut.</li>
            <li>I heard it was also good for stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>I was not offered a free refund and the best I could hope for was an exchange.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this brand before and always loved it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really good product and has helped keep me moisturized and reduce my stretch marks</li>
            <li>This is a good buy for the amount you get</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;I read your comment about the size before buying, but got it anyway since Amazon is so good about returns.  </li>
            <li>So for me this one is a good deal, it&#x27;s all relative.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>But, otherwise loved it.</li>
            <li>Not to oily and smells good.</li>
            <li>but it goes away when you rub it in good.</li>
            <li>I actually really loved the way it felt on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could though because I loved the moisturizing ability of this cream.</li>
            <li>The light aroma of chocolate is delightful.</li>
            <li>I will stick to shea butter and all the good butters.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not too greasy and smells really good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect jar that I used on my pregnant belly (before and after baby).</li>
            <li>Love the size for this great size.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product, smells good...</li>
            <li>Love, love!!</li>
            <li>Just what I needed :) Good size, good quality</li>
            <li>Has a pleasant smell unlike others I have tried, but very light.  </li>
            <li>I love it and it has a nice smell to it!</li>
            <li>My sister and I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>This product is lovely!  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Am I glad that I did!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Anyone who has used pure cocoa butter knows the delicious chocolate smell that the product has.  </li>
            <li>Coco butter formula is amazing</li>
            <li>This price for this size is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing amazing.</li>
            <li>Great fit and washes well.</li>
            <li>my product of choice, nice.</li>
            <li>This stuff feels so good on my belly and keeps it moisturized and itch free!</li>
            <li>Substantive with a nice aroma.  </li>
            <li>Its an all purpose cream for any kind of marks.</li>
            <li>I recommend the product, just suggest getting it in a spray to make it easier to apply for your own sake.</li>
            <li>and her scar looks really nice.</li>
            <li>is that it contains more cocoa butter than a good amount of the brands you can pick up at the grocery store,</li>
            <li>I needed the deluxe every time I came in.</li>
            <li>I put some in my hand and then rub both hands together to warm and soften it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably too soon to tell how effective it&#x27;s going to be for that</li>
            <li>You dont need to warm this up, it just melts in your hand, just like butter.</li>
            <li>this formula absorbs quickly but it does leave a silky residue which doesn&#x27;t both me because it keeps my hydrated, the scent is beyond delightful, and the price is just dirt cheap for the amount of uses</li>
            <li>Great for preventing stretch marks, I bought this as a gift for a pregnant friend.</li>
            <li>I am definitely glad I found the value size on here though- so much more for your money!</li>
            <li>I use every night before going to bed and my skin is a smooth as a babies!! :)</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the smell of this cocoa butter and love the results!</li>
            <li>Palmers Cocoa Butter is the best stuff for keeping your skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I have soft flawless skin.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great for lips, feet, whole body!  </li>
            <li>it seems great and it leaves my body feeling soft and smooth with the great cocoa butter fragrance</li>
            <li>I like the body oil a lot better.  </li>
            <li>Now I use this for something more</li>
            <li>This helps me have a nice smooth looking vagina with no bumps or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it would (probably) work.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day and we don&#x27;t need to continue to add more lotion.</li>
            <li>I use it all over now, and look forward to an even  better complexion.</li>
            <li>mostly what you are paying for with Palmer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I have never found any substitute that works better than Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter formula.</li>
            <li>excellent product i was in a house fire and had surgery for burns on shoulders this works on my scars to flatten them terrific lip balm also</li>
            <li>This moisturizer really works and smells so great.</li>
            <li>I use this almost every day and love it.</li>
            <li>Actually so much better for tattoos than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I love using Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li>Just okay for me.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream -</li>
            <li>I repeat as many times as I want after that.</li>
            <li>Can be more than a bit greasy, but it gets soaked into the skin.  </li>
            <li>We use at our dental office, patients love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite Palmer&#x27;s cream.  </li>
            <li>, This stuff truly works, my scar is there, but sure does not appear to be from knee replacement.</li>
            <li>Ok people, know what you&#x27;re buying.  </li>
            <li>love cocoa butter, use it mostly every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My kids and I love using it at night.  </li>
            <li>Feet never felt better.  </li>
            <li>Who doesn&#x27;t love cocoa butter?</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li>I love Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter products.</li>
            <li>I used this product on bruises I obtained when I was released from the hospital and had bruises where many injections were given me about my body.  </li>
            <li>great price fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Per Palmer&#x27;s website, the cream is the most concentrated and intensive of their cocoa butter formulas.</li>
            <li>I will stick to the concentrated cream, it works wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t make my hands feel gross.</li>
            <li>But when I did a search of &amp;#34;cocoa butter rash&amp;#34; Palmer&#x27;s was the named brand in all of the top links.</li>
            <li>I really love the feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the Palmer&#x27;s skin lotion products.  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite brands of cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>I love most about this product</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the smell too</li>
            <li>:).</li>
            <li>I make sure I concentrate around the cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My feet look and feel fantastic!</li>
            <li>Then I rub the top of each hand and massage the oil into my cuticles and nails.</li>
            <li>I have seen more than one woman resort to this treatment and it works.</li>
            <li>I also think it holds up better in the jar than more lotion-type treatments.  </li>
            <li>It helps to soften the skin making it more pliable and I have noticed the scar line disappearing.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin smooth and soft, and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>Who ever gave this a one star is dumb.love love love love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I AM GOING TO BUY MORE.</li>
            <li>and I thought it would now be safe to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>but it sure feels silky and</li>
            <li>I love the smell of cocoa</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll be softer underneath the top layer.</li>
            <li>Repeat purchase with an extremely satisfied consumer.</li>
            <li>But I LOVE Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter.  </li>
            <li>This was followed up with a discussion about the many benefits of cocoa butter, so I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I know that often stretch marks have to do with genetics, but I am almost SURE this has something to do with it.</li>
            <li>Buying the two 7.25 oz sizes is much more profitable.</li>
            <li>its smells great, keep your body moisturised for the whole day.</li>
            <li>Love this.  </li>
            <li>I now use it for many skin issues-old scars,cracked heels and finger tips and lips etc.  </li>
            <li>Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa butter is a very rich cream that gives me an almost immediate soothing and softening effect.  </li>
            <li>Using it now once again for pregnancy and so far so good!</li>
            <li>I love this Palmers product,it lasts for a long time and it is perfect after a shower.</li>
            <li>I love this product,  it is an excellent product for dry and roughened skin.</li>
            <li>Very healthy and moisturizing, but greasy so not as useful as a face cream.  </li>
            <li>I we not disappointed!</li>
            <li>Worth it!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because of the awesome job this product did for skin softening, I used it on my horribly dry and cracked hands.  </li>
            <li>Cocoa butter in a tub is the best stuff for winter dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Came clean!</li>
            <li>I have very dry skin, and this is the greatest!</li>
            <li>but its effective and definatly worth it to give a try..</li>
            <li>It is good and really moisturizing your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have always loved cocoa butter as a nice thick lotion that smells great.</li>
            <li>Love the product, but found it significantly cheaper in stores.</li>
            <li>So if you have a strong sense of smell you may not like the scent.</li>
            <li>Very good for dry skin</li>
            <li>The lotion it self seemed to work fine</li>
            <li>Feels good and is much better than a general  baby or massage oil.</li>
            <li>but that is absolutely fine with me if it means no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mild eczema for about 4 years now and like most people who suffer with eczema, I&#x27;ve tried almost everything.</li>
            <li>good stuff, very soft, goes on smooth and leaves your skin feeling moist, over time it will correct discoloration in your skin</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a huge baby bump to cause them either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cream is helping with both of those issues and that alone is a huge yes for it.&lt;br /&gt;Also,</li>
            <li>This tub is huge.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer, especially in winter.</li>
            <li>the item is fantastic.</li>
            <li>and my face is dewy and line free after years of using this.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks of this stuff, my face was flawless.  </li>
            <li>I still need about two more nights worth</li>
            <li>would still recommend this product, as this is a better product than others for its pros and economical.</li>
            <li>- what is available on Walmart&#x27;s website is the lotion in a pump bottle, and they add shipping, so it adds up to 2 bottles of lotion for $16.24;</li>
            <li>So cheap an its in a huge bottle</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin smooth as well.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy this product, keeps your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>Love this, my skin is so soft, not sticky, love love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Order the multi-pack and enjoy.</li>
            <li>and she got a smooth skin.</li>
            <li>Smooth it on.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate not to have any stretch marks after my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>been using during Pregnancy and so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good...</li>
            <li>Smells like cocoa (sweet smell and not so strong...</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended!!!!</li>
            <li>I cannot stress enough how much I love the scent as well, it smells like chocolate cake almost, it&#x27;s quite sweet and stays around for awhile, though because of the scent it may not be the best for people that are sensitive to fragrances.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so rich and moisturizing that I still have it on my face when I wake up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still going to use it of course, and as a solid there is more there, but I just wish that this was listed more prominently in the description.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I have used this cream for a long time and it is great and its not tested on animals which is a plus</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how effective it was in returning the skin to a reasonably normal appearance.</li>
            <li>Arrives quickly and is smooth.  </li>
            <li>Great for keeping dry skin moist all day and for reducing the appearance of scars.</li>
            <li>I have all three formulas, for different parts of the body: the regular lotion is good for all over after a shower, the concentrated cream is excellent for hands and rough spots like elbows and knees, and the cream is best for dry feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>Came right away!</li>
            <li>And the price is right!  </li>
            <li>Very nice quality cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I use it under my eyes, on my face in the winter, and on my neck; it&#x27;s great for rough winter hands, too.  </li>
            <li>my skin is ashy again, I need this thick wonderful smelling concoction to stay moist.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ingredients: De-ionized Water, Cocoa Butter, Sweet Almond Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, Emulsifying Wax, Abyssinica Seed Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20</li>
            <li>A good body cream when extra moisturizing is needed, but avoid sun when using.</li>
            <li>but this makes your skin so so soft and adds a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>cream is also fantastic for fresh stretch marks (you know, the ones that are still red/purple/brown).</li>
            <li>and I am good to go the next day.  </li>
            <li>It smells so sweet, like I have muffins in my pockets at all times.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a sweet tooth, and smelling this all the time</li>
            <li>It is very oily, but this is more like a cream.</li>
            <li>Everything was fine, thanks!</li>
            <li>I was pregnant and still using it.</li>
            <li>I started using this product at 6 weeks pregnant, twice a day.  </li>
            <li>As indicated by many studies and research getting stretch mark has many factors and no topical applications can help avoid them.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Also, I believe a pregnant woman should continually moisten her skin for it allow the stretching, which in turn reduces the stretch marks.</li>
            <li>This value sized product has a ton of product in it which is great, I know its going to last me my whole pregnancy -</li>
            <li>It dries quickly on my stomach, and I&#x27;ve never had problems with it causing my clothes to stick to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 34 weeks pregnant and (fingers crossed)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not at all oily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>This is my go to gift for all my pregnant girlfriends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Bought this to prevent stretch marks and started lathering it on when I was about 16 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li>The smell of this product is not unpleasant, but a man would probably not pick this product for the smell it has.  </li>
            <li>This was actually what I liked best about the formula over others recommended for belly bumps such as Mustela Ultimate Hydration Body Lotion and Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee Belly Butter.  </li>
            <li>The first time I got too much, and was able to soften hands, arms, neck....</li>
            <li>good for razor burn and dry patches.</li>
            <li>It is good for moisturizing dry skin</li>
            <li>Still good stuff for dry skin.</li>
            <li>but I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li>I was sold on it and the immense love of my mom!  </li>
            <li>I recommend it, but be aware of what you will be getting!</li>
            <li>For mild eczema, next to Aquaphor, this is the best under the counter product you can get that doesn&#x27;t contain any extremely harmful steroids.</li>
            <li>and It is also very greasy, but you can just lightly pat the excess off after you rub it in.</li>
            <li>really itchy!&lt;br /&gt;Happened to me too with the fragrance free cocoa butter but never with the one in the tube.</li>
            <li>Gets rid of stretch marks very smell and also smells fantastic</li>
            <li>its creamy and light and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula was by far my favorite product for preventing stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will try again, using it more frequently, to give it another shot.</li>
            <li>It advertises being useful on scars and stretch marks</li>
            <li>It has been my old standby for many years.  </li>
            <li>It does have a richer, greasier texture, but it quickly absorbed by thirsty skin.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, the only CON was how greasy it is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been pregnant, so I have yet to see how effective it is on that, but cocoa extract has long been known for its beneficial uses on skin.</li>
            <li>I tend to be really dry in the winter and this is an excellent cream to use for my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>while it does still have mineral oil in it, cocoa butter is fairly high on the list as well when a good lot of brands have a tiny bit in theirs.</li>
            <li>I have lots of allergies and itching, and it helps quite a bit if I use it right after my shower.  </li>
            <li>I put it on right after a shower.</li>
            <li>I had to reorder it to get the right item.</li>
            <li>I typically apply it shortly after I get out of the shower for the best results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good cocobutter cream, not overly whipped or watered down.  </li>
            <li>Great for fading light scars, goes on thick but absorbs quickly and keeps me feeling soft all day.</li>
            <li>Once you use it on a regular basis it keeps your skin very moisturized and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>this is one of the \\&quot;must-haves\\&quot; for pregnant moms with really itchy skin.</li>
            <li>Its a good creme, its even helping minimize one of my previous scars.</li>
            <li>but I have dry skin so the fact that it keeps my skin nice and moisturized all day means the world to me.</li>
            <li>MY BODY CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT IT!!!</li>
            <li>I use this product primarily on my legs and it keeps them very soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find it in a larger container which makes each application a little more reasonable.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very, very oily</li>
            <li>apparently, no site to store free shipping available.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is more similar to petroleum jelly than lotion.  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S PART OF MY MOISTURIZING DAILY METHOD... :-)</li>
            <li>I used this cream because it was thick and smelled great.  </li>
            <li>I continued to use the cream and after another couple weeks my skin looked almost exactly like it did prepregnancy.  </li>
            <li>and I love it, especially on my legs after I get out of the</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty neutral</li>
            <li>The first batch I received was not sealed and had a thumb print in it.</li>
            <li>Thought this was more of a lotion, but it&#x27;s actual cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>If you are so inclined to use lotion before bed this should be your first pick.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>the more recent ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But it definitely helps avoid getting more.</li>
            <li>I started using this product when I carried my first born.</li>
            <li>Used it for my first pregnancy to prevent stretch marks and no stretch marks..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many different lotions and creams that I can&#x27;t even begin to remember them all.</li>
            <li>It made the skin on my backside so smooth and soft that I started using it all over my body.</li>
            <li>Love it and will continue to use in the future</li>
            <li>many products promise the same.</li>
            <li>Ok for moisturization just doesn&#x27;t seem the same as many years ago, seems like a different formula.</li>
            <li>I was able to get enough oils to rub on my skin.</li>
            <li>The earlier you put it on, the better.</li>
            <li>I tried it as an all-over lotion the first night</li>
            <li>It absorbs into my skin and after I towel off, my skin is soooo soft!!!!</li>
            <li>I first bought this in the normal size at a local store and have loved it through my pregnancy so far</li>
            <li>Love the extra large container.</li>
            <li>This is an effective moisturizer, but it is extremely greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am currently pregnant and will try and update this after my pregnancy to see how it performed keeping new stretch marks from appearing....</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s kept my feet, legs, abdmen, arms, and hands smooth, soft, healthy, and in better shape than a lot of more other products showering the market (some more expensive than this).  </li>
            <li>The thicker, richer body of Palmer&#x27;s made me feel that my skin stayed more hydrated and protected throughout the day, even when my skin was stretched to the max during my 9th month of pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little bit to set in, but it is great in cold winter to keep you from drying out and great in the summer to get a golden tan (also spf 4, like you&#x27;re worried about that with cocoa butter</li>
            <li>This particular jar appears to be unavailable at most of the websites I checked, such as Target, Walmart, etc.  </li>
            <li>I use it because I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I had been getting cracked, dry skin on my soles, and I have had cracking in my finger cuticle for many years.  </li>
            <li>My mom swears by this stuff, and she&#x27;s a smart lady, so I trust this product.  </li>
            <li>Large jar.</li>
            <li>I thought I was buying a large jar of the lotion, but soon realized that this was not the lotion.</li>
            <li>Works great to moisturize and I get less ingrown hairs on my legs since using it daily.</li>
            <li>Less effective on more irritated areas of the skin, but highly recommend it nonetheless as it clears up minor areas of eczema within a couple days.</li>
            <li>While it does list the ounces, please be warned that this is a more solid form of the product instead of a more typical liquid form of the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Even in the middle of our harsh Midwestern winters, this stuff keeps my skin happy.</li>
            <li>The container is huge; it will probably take me at least a year or more to use it all, and I put it on 2x a day.</li>
            <li>It prevents it very well.</li>
            <li>Haha</li>
            <li>Really evens out skin complexion.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended and I will be buying this again and again!</li>
            <li>I really like this cocoa butter.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very oily product</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it all that much as a result and probably wouldn&#x27;t ever buy it again.</li>
            <li>Acne scars have disappeared at a much quicker pace as compared to anything else.</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother and softer than it used to be, and I am greatful for that.  </li>
            <li>use this every night at bedtime and my skin is so much softer.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>I have really itchy skin and anything I wear increases the urge to scratch.</li>
            <li>But it really helps when you would rather die and not scratch your skin.</li>
            <li>It really helps...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it very often.  </li>
            <li>Been using it a couple times here and there for some brown scars I had, but it didn&#x27;t really help that much.</li>
            <li>I use cocoa butter all over my body for the winter, but use it as my staple foot lotion to get my soles ready for sandal season.</li>
            <li>Gently aids in the disappearance of scars.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I like that this is in a jar and much easier to get out to apply to my body.  </li>
            <li>There is no way you will use this whole thing during pregnancy unless you use it 3 times a day.</li>
            <li>I purchased it to help smooth out the scar from recent surgery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very oily...  </li>
            <li>and instead I am now using organic Coconut butter, because my skin kept getting dryer and just leaving it very greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that has as much to do with this product as it does my genetics</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any warm and tender feelings toward Walmart, but I do object to paying double for the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li>I rub the cream into my feet for about 10 minutes then cover them with nice heavy socks for about an hour -</li>
            <li>My skin is healthier, and I don&#x27;t have to put it on very frequently to keep it that way (maybe once a week since first getting the cracking under control).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply</li>
            <li>, IT has a very strong smell and would make you white clothes turn into yellow and the beds sheets as well..</li>
            <li>It shrunk the ginormous pores on my nose, which I haven&#x27;t been able to do with any other product.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other lotion I have tried.</li>
            <li>I guess since other listings also list the ounces, I was more under the impression that this would be liquid as well.</li>
            <li>originally bought it because I had some stretch marks left on my backside from my puberty years.</li>
            <li>It might not be appreciated by a young, married couple.</li>
            <li>Maybe I have sensitive lips, but I have to say that my lips dry out more than anyone</li>
            <li>I am 34 weeks pregnant with my first child, and still have not developed any stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>Note that this is not a review about the product itself, which is amazing; but the price was unbelievable at $15+</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this product has done so much in just a week</li>
            <li>this is not the same as the cocoa butter massage lotion which is much lighter in texture and meant more for a daily moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li>It is very concentrated, so just use a little, you can add more if you need it.</li>
            <li>Great value, for some reason this is a hard to find item at my local target or CVS, so</li>
            <li>A fantastic formula for dry skin.</li>
            <li>I mix with the regular Palmers lotion every day and it keeps my skin silky soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>: This cream is solid in the tub, but melts quickly in your hand.</li>
            <li>Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter is classic.</li>
            <li>I used a product very similar to this when I was pregnant living in Italy.</li>
            <li>I use it especially on my feet as they dry and callus very easily without it.  </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for scars.  </li>
            <li>$ 11.95 is too high a price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even smoothed out many of those little nicks and scars that you pick up over the years.</li>
            <li>After using stuff cocoa butter from the store, I finally know what the cream should really be like!!</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and absorbs quickly, and actually, I do not find that I have to reapply frequently, as some customers noted--and I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>I am always in the sun and my skin is always dry, but Palmers Cocoa butter does the trick and keeps my skin smooth and silky soft!</li>
            <li>I first opened the jar, the top layer was hard but just swiping my fingers over it</li>
            <li>Very moist and soft.</li>
            <li>having this larger size is economical and lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>I normally put a Layer on then let it sit so it will absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li>In a few more months, I wager the scar is indiscernible.</li>
            <li>Normally I would think it was just his skin.</li>
            <li>Really economical as compared with the price for the smaller size.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the place I got my 9.5oz jars in NYC had a better price per ounce, but now that I&#x27;m in San Francisco I can&#x27;t find the 7.25oz for less than $9!  </li>
            <li>I have extremely dry skin, this stuff leaves me feeling soft and smooth all over.</li>
            <li>Obviously this product can be used for many other parts of your body too to keep the moisture locked in on your skin, so it really is what I&#x27;d call a &#x27;miracle&#x27; skin care product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s healing much faster, and it&#x27;s actually doing a better job of keeping the pigments in the skin instead of sucking it out like the other products.</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by my vascular surgeon for use on my scar line after an above knee amputation of my right leg.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s rich and creamy texture, the ultimate hydration cream (especially when you&#x27;re pregnant belly is getting bigger).</li>
            <li>I use this daily to keep my skin moist mostly in the winter when my skin gets very dry.  </li>
            <li>We have used other coco butter products and settled on this as its light and non greasy.</li>
            <li>You dont even have to keep applying it all day like other lotions and cream available in the market.</li>
            <li>I send a jar to any of my girlfriends that are newly expecting mothers.  </li>
            <li>The new one I received was also not sealed but looked brand new.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without my cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li>but I think you&#x27;re better off buying raw cocoa butter to help with skin elasticity and to moisturize since it&#x27;s cheaper and</li>
            <li>this product did not help me with itchy and dry skin which started once I was 6M pregnant.</li>
            <li>Rub it in your hands for a few seconds if it&#x27;s too solid to warm it up for application.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s perfect for after shaving because of the waxy base, it really locks in moisture</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used cocoa butter products in the past, and Palmer&#x27;s had been my favorite.  </li>
            <li>and I have many small scars</li>
            <li>I thought it would be more of a cocoa butter lotion that I have tried from Palmer&#x27;s in the past.</li>
            <li>the someone that had the exact same procedure 2 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Of course it left me and my clothing pretty greasy</li>
            <li>Exactly the same size.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see the wooden light pole in my periphials and slid right down it after impact!</li>
            <li>A little goes a long ways which is nice, as it seems to be a little pricey.&lt;br /&gt;Works very well on bottom of feet and has helped tremendously with dryness and cracking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a pleasant smell - not strong -  just slightly cocoa-ish.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick and keeps my skin hydrated for hours!</li>
            <li>I love this &amp;#34;palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter formula with vitamin e&amp;#34; that is in a jar/tub that heals and softens rough, dry skin and helps smoothes marks and scars.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff moisturizes any dry skin without that greasy feeling after, also takes care of those contact rashes that come up sometimes from rough clothes, etc....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter, but I feel a little mislead by the description of this item.</li>
            <li>I apply it frequently throughout the day so my skin won&#x27;t get irritated.</li>
            <li>I remember I applied it before going to the hospital to deliver my son, and the nurses even commented on how soft my skin was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this straight for several weeks and there was no change.</li>
            <li>The cream may seem heavy, but it&#x27;s well absorbed, and actually creates a smooth even complexion with regular use.  </li>
            <li>(My baby is 9 months old).</li>
            <li>It literally keeps my lips moist and soft for up to 12 hours.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll put it on when I go to bed and wake up to soft, moist lips.</li>
            <li>Even though my skin is sensitive, it doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all</li>
            <li>Also, put it on your feet with a pair of socks over night and in the morning will be baby soft.</li>
            <li>still even I only gained 26 pounds through my whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li>But let me remind you again, it doesn&#x27;t completely remove nor prevent them.</li>
            <li>Really enhances the naked form.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and supple without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>No doubt that it&#x27;ll be completely gone by the end of the year.</li>
            <li>will always have this product near....</li>
            <li>This makes my hand and feet so soft.</li>
            <li>I have tried using a tiny amount and really rubbing it it, but it doesn&#x27;t make a difference.  </li>
            <li>My feet are so soft, almost like a baby bottom.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Even my 20 year old stretch marks are fading.</li>
            <li>There is no waste in the application, and my skin feels velvety.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s still a lot left despite how much we&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft in your hands once you work it.</li>
            <li>We use Palmer&#x27;s for soft tissue work, scar mobilizations and scar therapy.</li>
            <li>So far no stretch marks</li>
            <li>It helps the skin heal faster naturally.</li>
            <li>It makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li>Everyone says I have soft skin and its because of this.</li>
            <li>It leaves a soft touch on my skin.</li>
            <li>but so far just</li>
            <li>The size of this lotion can for sure last you a while for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Its so thick and creamy I love it.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s ok, but other than feeling like i&#x27;m actually putting oil on my skin this lotion feels no different</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and not nearly as chocolate-like as the regular lotion or concentrated cream - there is almost a shea butter like scent to it.</li>
            <li>I apply this cocoa butter to my arms, legs and torso right out of the shower while my skin is wet.</li>
            <li>I had my first baby in February and tried several different products to keep my skin moisturized throughout my pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>, Glucose/Glucose Oxidase/Lactoperosidase (natural preservative), Stearic Acid (vegetable source), Soy Lecithin, d-alpha Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Natural French Vanilla Fragrance, Organic Natural Cocoa, Cedar Bark Extract (natural preservative), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), d-Panthenol, Aloe Vera, Allantoin, Citric Acid, Grapefruit Seed Extract and Rhodiola rosea</li>
            <li>used this product consistently twice every day over major period of pregnancy stage, especially during the 3rd trimester, however I did develop stretch marks near my under belly and some on the sides.</li>
            <li>I love this coco butter formula, recommended for dry skin types only as it is extremely greasy.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure how accurate that argument is.  </li>
            <li>I typically apply it all over my pregnant belly after a shower and before going to bed since that has been my whole reason for buying this; but I have used it sparingly on my elbows and hands as well if they are feeling dry.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li>First off you have to scrape some out of the jar, it is harder than any lotion or cream I am used to.  </li>
            <li>The Vitamin E and Cocoa Butter are very soothing and healing to dry skin, cuts, abrasions and scars.</li>
            <li>It hydrates and keeps me away from dry skin which is really helpful at this stage</li>
            <li>I use to use this lotion when I was pregnant and after for a few months.</li>
            <li>have been using it on stretch marks around my calf and they are not completely gone, but I sure see them fading a little.. and the difference it definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li>other reviewers have mentioned, it can be greasy when you first apply it.</li>
            <li>After about 3-4 weeks of rubbing the cream into my belly every night I saw major improvements.  </li>
            <li>If you can get away with regular old hand lotion, this may not be for you.</li>
            <li>The down side, it softened all my nails too, and most of them tore off within a few days of using this product.  </li>
            <li>it is even better than I ever imagined in keeping my lower legs moisturized and it removed all the dry hard skin on my ankles.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very soft and the bumps are getting smaller and smaller.  </li>
            <li>other thing that bothered me is that it was really sticky on my skin.</li>
            <li>As I said I use it nearly every day; not generally on my face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now 40 weeks pregnant and still have a little left in the second jar.  </li>
            <li>I live in CO and the dry air out here has played havoc with my feet.</li>
            <li>complaints, this worked really well for my legs and feet which get especially dry during the winter.</li>
            <li>While I do have scars, their appearance is minimal and I am very routined about its regular application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another thing that I tried was using it on my face on my forehead on a few lines and a few scars on my face, and they reduced/blended in like 2 days :).&lt;br</li>
            <li>first, it might seem a little greasy but it will soak into your skin quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the techs are amazed at my soft feet, my own little secret.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks and helps my skin stay soft all day long.</li>
            <li>but after a few days of using this particular jar I have developed a rash that is not going away.</li>
            <li>It is very firm and cannot be easily absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>The only thing that keeps my dry skin soft!</li>
            <li>BUT, why does it cost exactly half as much on Walmart&#x27;s website?  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it for dry skin and keeping your skin soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lost a bit of weight over the last couple of years, and, while this cream didn&#x27;t have any effect on the stretch marks I&#x27;ve had a long time, it did completely fade</li>
            <li>My mother has been using it for a few years, and I&#x27;ve been an avid user for the last year.  </li>
            <li>I used this product, and within a few days the skin was finally soft and back to normal.  </li>
            <li>The Value Size lasts for at least a couple of months, and you can&#x27;t beat the price compared to similar products marketed to pregnant women.</li>
            <li>It does feel super moisturizing, but I can&#x27;t get past the greasiness!</li>
            <li>It has also decreased the oil in my T-zone which would always become shiny within a few hours; I can go pretty much the whole without having to worry about the oil and shine.</li>
            <li>As mentioned, the stretch marks are NOT very long and pronounced, but definitely visible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this cocoa butter for a few weeks, and my 16 year old stretch marks have nearly vanished!</li>
            <li>The only con is that it&#x27;s a little bit greasy, but otherwise it appears to work really well.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it to any other cocoa butter users!</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t get anything better for this price!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my pregnancy to prevent stretch marks, but this stuff is AMAZING for everything!  </li>
            <li> And it smells nice, too!</li>
            <li> Excellent prodcut, we love this Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, if you don&#x27;t mind smelling like coconut.</li>
            <li> I heard it was also good for stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I was not offered a free refund and the best I could hope for was an exchange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this brand before and always loved it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really good product and has helped keep me moisturized and reduce my stretch marks</li>
            <li> This is a good buy for the amount you get</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;I read your comment about the size before buying, but got it anyway since Amazon is so good about returns.  </li>
            <li> So for me this one is a good deal, it&#x27;s all relative.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> But, otherwise loved it.</li>
            <li> Not to oily and smells good.</li>
            <li> but it goes away when you rub it in good.</li>
            <li> I actually really loved the way it felt on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could though because I loved the moisturizing ability of this cream.</li>
            <li> The light aroma of chocolate is delightful.</li>
            <li> I will stick to shea butter and all the good butters.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not too greasy and smells really good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect jar that I used on my pregnant belly (before and after baby).</li>
            <li> Love the size for this great size.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, smells good...</li>
            <li> Love, love!!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed :) Good size, good quality</li>
            <li> Has a pleasant smell unlike others I have tried, but very light.  </li>
            <li> I love it and it has a nice smell to it!</li>
            <li> My sister and I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This product is lovely!  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Am I glad that I did!  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Anyone who has used pure cocoa butter knows the delicious chocolate smell that the product has.  </li>
            <li> Coco butter formula is amazing</li>
            <li> This price for this size is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing amazing.</li>
            <li> Great fit and washes well.</li>
            <li> my product of choice, nice.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels so good on my belly and keeps it moisturized and itch free!</li>
            <li> Substantive with a nice aroma.  </li>
            <li> Its an all purpose cream for any kind of marks.</li>
            <li> I recommend the product, just suggest getting it in a spray to make it easier to apply for your own sake.</li>
            <li> and her scar looks really nice.</li>
            <li> is that it contains more cocoa butter than a good amount of the brands you can pick up at the grocery store,</li>
            <li> I needed the deluxe every time I came in.</li>
            <li> I put some in my hand and then rub both hands together to warm and soften it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably too soon to tell how effective it&#x27;s going to be for that</li>
            <li> You dont need to warm this up, it just melts in your hand, just like butter.</li>
            <li> this formula absorbs quickly but it does leave a silky residue which doesn&#x27;t both me because it keeps my hydrated, the scent is beyond delightful, and the price is just dirt cheap for the amount of uses</li>
            <li> Great for preventing stretch marks, I bought this as a gift for a pregnant friend.</li>
            <li> I am definitely glad I found the value size on here though- so much more for your money!</li>
            <li> I use every night before going to bed and my skin is a smooth as a babies!! :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell of this cocoa butter and love the results!</li>
            <li> Palmers Cocoa Butter is the best stuff for keeping your skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I have soft flawless skin.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s great for lips, feet, whole body!  </li>
            <li> it seems great and it leaves my body feeling soft and smooth with the great cocoa butter fragrance</li>
            <li> I like the body oil a lot better.  </li>
            <li> Now I use this for something more</li>
            <li> This helps me have a nice smooth looking vagina with no bumps or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it would (probably) work.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day and we don&#x27;t need to continue to add more lotion.</li>
            <li> I use it all over now, and look forward to an even  better complexion.</li>
            <li> mostly what you are paying for with Palmer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have never found any substitute that works better than Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter formula.</li>
            <li> excellent product i was in a house fire and had surgery for burns on shoulders this works on my scars to flatten them terrific lip balm also</li>
            <li> This moisturizer really works and smells so great.</li>
            <li> I use this almost every day and love it.</li>
            <li> Actually so much better for tattoos than anything I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love using Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li> Just okay for me.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream -</li>
            <li> I repeat as many times as I want after that.</li>
            <li> Can be more than a bit greasy, but it gets soaked into the skin.  </li>
            <li> We use at our dental office, patients love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Palmer&#x27;s cream.  </li>
            <li> , This stuff truly works, my scar is there, but sure does not appear to be from knee replacement.</li>
            <li> Ok people, know what you&#x27;re buying.  </li>
            <li> love cocoa butter, use it mostly every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My kids and I love using it at night.  </li>
            <li> Feet never felt better.  </li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love cocoa butter?</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I love Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter products.</li>
            <li> I used this product on bruises I obtained when I was released from the hospital and had bruises where many injections were given me about my body.  </li>
            <li> great price fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Per Palmer&#x27;s website, the cream is the most concentrated and intensive of their cocoa butter formulas.</li>
            <li> I will stick to the concentrated cream, it works wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t make my hands feel gross.</li>
            <li> But when I did a search of &amp;#34;cocoa butter rash&amp;#34; Palmer&#x27;s was the named brand in all of the top links.</li>
            <li> I really love the feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love the Palmer&#x27;s skin lotion products.  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite brands of cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I love most about this product</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the smell too</li>
            <li> :).</li>
            <li> I make sure I concentrate around the cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My feet look and feel fantastic!</li>
            <li> Then I rub the top of each hand and massage the oil into my cuticles and nails.</li>
            <li> I have seen more than one woman resort to this treatment and it works.</li>
            <li> I also think it holds up better in the jar than more lotion-type treatments.  </li>
            <li> It helps to soften the skin making it more pliable and I have noticed the scar line disappearing.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin smooth and soft, and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Who ever gave this a one star is dumb.love love love love love love this product.</li>
            <li> I AM GOING TO BUY MORE.</li>
            <li> and I thought it would now be safe to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> but it sure feels silky and</li>
            <li> I love the smell of cocoa</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll be softer underneath the top layer.</li>
            <li> Repeat purchase with an extremely satisfied consumer.</li>
            <li> But I LOVE Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter.  </li>
            <li> This was followed up with a discussion about the many benefits of cocoa butter, so I decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I know that often stretch marks have to do with genetics, but I am almost SURE this has something to do with it.</li>
            <li> Buying the two 7.25 oz sizes is much more profitable.</li>
            <li> its smells great, keep your body moisturised for the whole day.</li>
            <li> Love this.  </li>
            <li> I now use it for many skin issues-old scars,cracked heels and finger tips and lips etc.  </li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa butter is a very rich cream that gives me an almost immediate soothing and softening effect.  </li>
            <li> Using it now once again for pregnancy and so far so good!</li>
            <li> I love this Palmers product,it lasts for a long time and it is perfect after a shower.</li>
            <li> I love this product,  it is an excellent product for dry and roughened skin.</li>
            <li> Very healthy and moisturizing, but greasy so not as useful as a face cream.  </li>
            <li> I we not disappointed!</li>
            <li> Worth it!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because of the awesome job this product did for skin softening, I used it on my horribly dry and cracked hands.  </li>
            <li> Cocoa butter in a tub is the best stuff for winter dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Came clean!</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and this is the greatest!</li>
            <li> but its effective and definatly worth it to give a try..</li>
            <li> It is good and really moisturizing your skin.  </li>
            <li> I have always loved cocoa butter as a nice thick lotion that smells great.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but found it significantly cheaper in stores.</li>
            <li> So if you have a strong sense of smell you may not like the scent.</li>
            <li> Very good for dry skin</li>
            <li> The lotion it self seemed to work fine</li>
            <li> Feels good and is much better than a general  baby or massage oil.</li>
            <li> but that is absolutely fine with me if it means no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mild eczema for about 4 years now and like most people who suffer with eczema, I&#x27;ve tried almost everything.</li>
            <li> good stuff, very soft, goes on smooth and leaves your skin feeling moist, over time it will correct discoloration in your skin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a huge baby bump to cause them either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cream is helping with both of those issues and that alone is a huge yes for it.&lt;br /&gt;Also,</li>
            <li> This tub is huge.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, especially in winter.</li>
            <li> the item is fantastic.</li>
            <li> and my face is dewy and line free after years of using this.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of this stuff, my face was flawless.  </li>
            <li> I still need about two more nights worth</li>
            <li> would still recommend this product, as this is a better product than others for its pros and economical.</li>
            <li> - what is available on Walmart&#x27;s website is the lotion in a pump bottle, and they add shipping, so it adds up to 2 bottles of lotion for $16.24;</li>
            <li> So cheap an its in a huge bottle</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin smooth as well.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy this product, keeps your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> Love this, my skin is so soft, not sticky, love love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Order the multi-pack and enjoy.</li>
            <li> and she got a smooth skin.</li>
            <li> Smooth it on.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate not to have any stretch marks after my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> been using during Pregnancy and so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good...</li>
            <li> Smells like cocoa (sweet smell and not so strong...</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> I cannot stress enough how much I love the scent as well, it smells like chocolate cake almost, it&#x27;s quite sweet and stays around for awhile, though because of the scent it may not be the best for people that are sensitive to fragrances.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so rich and moisturizing that I still have it on my face when I wake up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still going to use it of course, and as a solid there is more there, but I just wish that this was listed more prominently in the description.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for a long time and it is great and its not tested on animals which is a plus</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how effective it was in returning the skin to a reasonably normal appearance.</li>
            <li> Arrives quickly and is smooth.  </li>
            <li> Great for keeping dry skin moist all day and for reducing the appearance of scars.</li>
            <li> I have all three formulas, for different parts of the body: the regular lotion is good for all over after a shower, the concentrated cream is excellent for hands and rough spots like elbows and knees, and the cream is best for dry feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> Came right away!</li>
            <li> And the price is right!  </li>
            <li> Very nice quality cream for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use it under my eyes, on my face in the winter, and on my neck; it&#x27;s great for rough winter hands, too.  </li>
            <li> my skin is ashy again, I need this thick wonderful smelling concoction to stay moist.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients: De-ionized Water, Cocoa Butter, Sweet Almond Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, Emulsifying Wax, Abyssinica Seed Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20</li>
            <li> A good body cream when extra moisturizing is needed, but avoid sun when using.</li>
            <li> but this makes your skin so so soft and adds a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> cream is also fantastic for fresh stretch marks (you know, the ones that are still red/purple/brown).</li>
            <li> and I am good to go the next day.  </li>
            <li> It smells so sweet, like I have muffins in my pockets at all times.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a sweet tooth, and smelling this all the time</li>
            <li> It is very oily, but this is more like a cream.</li>
            <li> Everything was fine, thanks!</li>
            <li> I was pregnant and still using it.</li>
            <li> I started using this product at 6 weeks pregnant, twice a day.  </li>
            <li> As indicated by many studies and research getting stretch mark has many factors and no topical applications can help avoid them.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Also, I believe a pregnant woman should continually moisten her skin for it allow the stretching, which in turn reduces the stretch marks.</li>
            <li> This value sized product has a ton of product in it which is great, I know its going to last me my whole pregnancy -</li>
            <li> It dries quickly on my stomach, and I&#x27;ve never had problems with it causing my clothes to stick to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 weeks pregnant and (fingers crossed)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not at all oily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> This is my go to gift for all my pregnant girlfriends.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Bought this to prevent stretch marks and started lathering it on when I was about 16 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is not unpleasant, but a man would probably not pick this product for the smell it has.  </li>
            <li> This was actually what I liked best about the formula over others recommended for belly bumps such as Mustela Ultimate Hydration Body Lotion and Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee Belly Butter.  </li>
            <li> The first time I got too much, and was able to soften hands, arms, neck....</li>
            <li> good for razor burn and dry patches.</li>
            <li> It is good for moisturizing dry skin</li>
            <li> Still good stuff for dry skin.</li>
            <li> but I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> I was sold on it and the immense love of my mom!  </li>
            <li> I recommend it, but be aware of what you will be getting!</li>
            <li> For mild eczema, next to Aquaphor, this is the best under the counter product you can get that doesn&#x27;t contain any extremely harmful steroids.</li>
            <li> and It is also very greasy, but you can just lightly pat the excess off after you rub it in.</li>
            <li> really itchy!&lt;br /&gt;Happened to me too with the fragrance free cocoa butter but never with the one in the tube.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of stretch marks very smell and also smells fantastic</li>
            <li> its creamy and light and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula was by far my favorite product for preventing stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will try again, using it more frequently, to give it another shot.</li>
            <li> It advertises being useful on scars and stretch marks</li>
            <li> It has been my old standby for many years.  </li>
            <li> It does have a richer, greasier texture, but it quickly absorbed by thirsty skin.</li>
            <li> It smells nice, the only CON was how greasy it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been pregnant, so I have yet to see how effective it is on that, but cocoa extract has long been known for its beneficial uses on skin.</li>
            <li> I tend to be really dry in the winter and this is an excellent cream to use for my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> while it does still have mineral oil in it, cocoa butter is fairly high on the list as well when a good lot of brands have a tiny bit in theirs.</li>
            <li> I have lots of allergies and itching, and it helps quite a bit if I use it right after my shower.  </li>
            <li> I put it on right after a shower.</li>
            <li> I had to reorder it to get the right item.</li>
            <li> I typically apply it shortly after I get out of the shower for the best results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good cocobutter cream, not overly whipped or watered down.  </li>
            <li> Great for fading light scars, goes on thick but absorbs quickly and keeps me feeling soft all day.</li>
            <li> Once you use it on a regular basis it keeps your skin very moisturized and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> this is one of the \\&quot;must-haves\\&quot; for pregnant moms with really itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Its a good creme, its even helping minimize one of my previous scars.</li>
            <li> but I have dry skin so the fact that it keeps my skin nice and moisturized all day means the world to me.</li>
            <li> MY BODY CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT IT!!!</li>
            <li> I use this product primarily on my legs and it keeps them very soft and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to find it in a larger container which makes each application a little more reasonable.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very, very oily</li>
            <li> apparently, no site to store free shipping available.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is more similar to petroleum jelly than lotion.  </li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S PART OF MY MOISTURIZING DAILY METHOD... :-)</li>
            <li> I used this cream because it was thick and smelled great.  </li>
            <li> I continued to use the cream and after another couple weeks my skin looked almost exactly like it did prepregnancy.  </li>
            <li> and I love it, especially on my legs after I get out of the</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty neutral</li>
            <li> The first batch I received was not sealed and had a thumb print in it.</li>
            <li> Thought this was more of a lotion, but it&#x27;s actual cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> If you are so inclined to use lotion before bed this should be your first pick.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> the more recent ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it definitely helps avoid getting more.</li>
            <li> I started using this product when I carried my first born.</li>
            <li> Used it for my first pregnancy to prevent stretch marks and no stretch marks..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many different lotions and creams that I can&#x27;t even begin to remember them all.</li>
            <li> It made the skin on my backside so smooth and soft that I started using it all over my body.</li>
            <li> Love it and will continue to use in the future</li>
            <li> many products promise the same.</li>
            <li> Ok for moisturization just doesn&#x27;t seem the same as many years ago, seems like a different formula.</li>
            <li> I was able to get enough oils to rub on my skin.</li>
            <li> The earlier you put it on, the better.</li>
            <li> I tried it as an all-over lotion the first night</li>
            <li> It absorbs into my skin and after I towel off, my skin is soooo soft!!!!</li>
            <li> I first bought this in the normal size at a local store and have loved it through my pregnancy so far</li>
            <li> Love the extra large container.</li>
            <li> This is an effective moisturizer, but it is extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am currently pregnant and will try and update this after my pregnancy to see how it performed keeping new stretch marks from appearing....</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s kept my feet, legs, abdmen, arms, and hands smooth, soft, healthy, and in better shape than a lot of more other products showering the market (some more expensive than this).  </li>
            <li> The thicker, richer body of Palmer&#x27;s made me feel that my skin stayed more hydrated and protected throughout the day, even when my skin was stretched to the max during my 9th month of pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little bit to set in, but it is great in cold winter to keep you from drying out and great in the summer to get a golden tan (also spf 4, like you&#x27;re worried about that with cocoa butter</li>
            <li> This particular jar appears to be unavailable at most of the websites I checked, such as Target, Walmart, etc.  </li>
            <li> I use it because I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I had been getting cracked, dry skin on my soles, and I have had cracking in my finger cuticle for many years.  </li>
            <li> My mom swears by this stuff, and she&#x27;s a smart lady, so I trust this product.  </li>
            <li> Large jar.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a large jar of the lotion, but soon realized that this was not the lotion.</li>
            <li> Works great to moisturize and I get less ingrown hairs on my legs since using it daily.</li>
            <li> Less effective on more irritated areas of the skin, but highly recommend it nonetheless as it clears up minor areas of eczema within a couple days.</li>
            <li> While it does list the ounces, please be warned that this is a more solid form of the product instead of a more typical liquid form of the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Even in the middle of our harsh Midwestern winters, this stuff keeps my skin happy.</li>
            <li> The container is huge; it will probably take me at least a year or more to use it all, and I put it on 2x a day.</li>
            <li> It prevents it very well.</li>
            <li> Haha</li>
            <li> Really evens out skin complexion.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended and I will be buying this again and again!</li>
            <li> I really like this cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very oily product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it all that much as a result and probably wouldn&#x27;t ever buy it again.</li>
            <li> Acne scars have disappeared at a much quicker pace as compared to anything else.</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother and softer than it used to be, and I am greatful for that.  </li>
            <li> use this every night at bedtime and my skin is so much softer.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> I have really itchy skin and anything I wear increases the urge to scratch.</li>
            <li> But it really helps when you would rather die and not scratch your skin.</li>
            <li> It really helps...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it very often.  </li>
            <li> Been using it a couple times here and there for some brown scars I had, but it didn&#x27;t really help that much.</li>
            <li> I use cocoa butter all over my body for the winter, but use it as my staple foot lotion to get my soles ready for sandal season.</li>
            <li> Gently aids in the disappearance of scars.</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> I like that this is in a jar and much easier to get out to apply to my body.  </li>
            <li> There is no way you will use this whole thing during pregnancy unless you use it 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to help smooth out the scar from recent surgery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very oily...  </li>
            <li> and instead I am now using organic Coconut butter, because my skin kept getting dryer and just leaving it very greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that has as much to do with this product as it does my genetics</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any warm and tender feelings toward Walmart, but I do object to paying double for the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  </li>
            <li> I rub the cream into my feet for about 10 minutes then cover them with nice heavy socks for about an hour -</li>
            <li> My skin is healthier, and I don&#x27;t have to put it on very frequently to keep it that way (maybe once a week since first getting the cracking under control).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply</li>
            <li> , IT has a very strong smell and would make you white clothes turn into yellow and the beds sheets as well..</li>
            <li> It shrunk the ginormous pores on my nose, which I haven&#x27;t been able to do with any other product.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other lotion I have tried.</li>
            <li> I guess since other listings also list the ounces, I was more under the impression that this would be liquid as well.</li>
            <li> originally bought it because I had some stretch marks left on my backside from my puberty years.</li>
            <li> It might not be appreciated by a young, married couple.</li>
            <li> Maybe I have sensitive lips, but I have to say that my lips dry out more than anyone</li>
            <li> I am 34 weeks pregnant with my first child, and still have not developed any stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> Note that this is not a review about the product itself, which is amazing; but the price was unbelievable at $15+</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this product has done so much in just a week</li>
            <li> this is not the same as the cocoa butter massage lotion which is much lighter in texture and meant more for a daily moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It is very concentrated, so just use a little, you can add more if you need it.</li>
            <li> Great value, for some reason this is a hard to find item at my local target or CVS, so</li>
            <li> A fantastic formula for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I mix with the regular Palmers lotion every day and it keeps my skin silky soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> : This cream is solid in the tub, but melts quickly in your hand.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter is classic.</li>
            <li> I used a product very similar to this when I was pregnant living in Italy.</li>
            <li> I use it especially on my feet as they dry and callus very easily without it.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product for scars.  </li>
            <li> $ 11.95 is too high a price</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even smoothed out many of those little nicks and scars that you pick up over the years.</li>
            <li> After using stuff cocoa butter from the store, I finally know what the cream should really be like!!</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and absorbs quickly, and actually, I do not find that I have to reapply frequently, as some customers noted--and I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I am always in the sun and my skin is always dry, but Palmers Cocoa butter does the trick and keeps my skin smooth and silky soft!</li>
            <li> I first opened the jar, the top layer was hard but just swiping my fingers over it</li>
            <li> Very moist and soft.</li>
            <li> having this larger size is economical and lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> I normally put a Layer on then let it sit so it will absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li> In a few more months, I wager the scar is indiscernible.</li>
            <li> Normally I would think it was just his skin.</li>
            <li> Really economical as compared with the price for the smaller size.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the place I got my 9.5oz jars in NYC had a better price per ounce, but now that I&#x27;m in San Francisco I can&#x27;t find the 7.25oz for less than $9!  </li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin, this stuff leaves me feeling soft and smooth all over.</li>
            <li> Obviously this product can be used for many other parts of your body too to keep the moisture locked in on your skin, so it really is what I&#x27;d call a &#x27;miracle&#x27; skin care product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s healing much faster, and it&#x27;s actually doing a better job of keeping the pigments in the skin instead of sucking it out like the other products.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my vascular surgeon for use on my scar line after an above knee amputation of my right leg.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rich and creamy texture, the ultimate hydration cream (especially when you&#x27;re pregnant belly is getting bigger).</li>
            <li> I use this daily to keep my skin moist mostly in the winter when my skin gets very dry.  </li>
            <li> We have used other coco butter products and settled on this as its light and non greasy.</li>
            <li> You dont even have to keep applying it all day like other lotions and cream available in the market.</li>
            <li> I send a jar to any of my girlfriends that are newly expecting mothers.  </li>
            <li> The new one I received was also not sealed but looked brand new.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without my cocoa butter.  </li>
            <li> but I think you&#x27;re better off buying raw cocoa butter to help with skin elasticity and to moisturize since it&#x27;s cheaper and</li>
            <li> this product did not help me with itchy and dry skin which started once I was 6M pregnant.</li>
            <li> Rub it in your hands for a few seconds if it&#x27;s too solid to warm it up for application.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s perfect for after shaving because of the waxy base, it really locks in moisture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used cocoa butter products in the past, and Palmer&#x27;s had been my favorite.  </li>
            <li> and I have many small scars</li>
            <li> I thought it would be more of a cocoa butter lotion that I have tried from Palmer&#x27;s in the past.</li>
            <li> the someone that had the exact same procedure 2 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Of course it left me and my clothing pretty greasy</li>
            <li> Exactly the same size.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see the wooden light pole in my periphials and slid right down it after impact!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways which is nice, as it seems to be a little pricey.&lt;br /&gt;Works very well on bottom of feet and has helped tremendously with dryness and cracking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a pleasant smell - not strong -  just slightly cocoa-ish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and thick and keeps my skin hydrated for hours!</li>
            <li> I love this &amp;#34;palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter formula with vitamin e&amp;#34; that is in a jar/tub that heals and softens rough, dry skin and helps smoothes marks and scars.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff moisturizes any dry skin without that greasy feeling after, also takes care of those contact rashes that come up sometimes from rough clothes, etc....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter, but I feel a little mislead by the description of this item.</li>
            <li> I apply it frequently throughout the day so my skin won&#x27;t get irritated.</li>
            <li> I remember I applied it before going to the hospital to deliver my son, and the nurses even commented on how soft my skin was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this straight for several weeks and there was no change.</li>
            <li> The cream may seem heavy, but it&#x27;s well absorbed, and actually creates a smooth even complexion with regular use.  </li>
            <li> (My baby is 9 months old).</li>
            <li> It literally keeps my lips moist and soft for up to 12 hours.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put it on when I go to bed and wake up to soft, moist lips.</li>
            <li> Even though my skin is sensitive, it doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all</li>
            <li> Also, put it on your feet with a pair of socks over night and in the morning will be baby soft.</li>
            <li> still even I only gained 26 pounds through my whole pregnancy.</li>
            <li> But let me remind you again, it doesn&#x27;t completely remove nor prevent them.</li>
            <li> Really enhances the naked form.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and supple without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> No doubt that it&#x27;ll be completely gone by the end of the year.</li>
            <li> will always have this product near....</li>
            <li> This makes my hand and feet so soft.</li>
            <li> I have tried using a tiny amount and really rubbing it it, but it doesn&#x27;t make a difference.  </li>
            <li> My feet are so soft, almost like a baby bottom.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Even my 20 year old stretch marks are fading.</li>
            <li> There is no waste in the application, and my skin feels velvety.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s still a lot left despite how much we&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft in your hands once you work it.</li>
            <li> We use Palmer&#x27;s for soft tissue work, scar mobilizations and scar therapy.</li>
            <li> So far no stretch marks</li>
            <li> It helps the skin heal faster naturally.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin soft.</li>
            <li> Everyone says I have soft skin and its because of this.</li>
            <li> It leaves a soft touch on my skin.</li>
            <li> but so far just</li>
            <li> The size of this lotion can for sure last you a while for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Its so thick and creamy I love it.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s ok, but other than feeling like i&#x27;m actually putting oil on my skin this lotion feels no different</li>
            <li> The scent is mild and not nearly as chocolate-like as the regular lotion or concentrated cream - there is almost a shea butter like scent to it.</li>
            <li> I apply this cocoa butter to my arms, legs and torso right out of the shower while my skin is wet.</li>
            <li> I had my first baby in February and tried several different products to keep my skin moisturized throughout my pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> , Glucose/Glucose Oxidase/Lactoperosidase (natural preservative), Stearic Acid (vegetable source), Soy Lecithin, d-alpha Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Natural French Vanilla Fragrance, Organic Natural Cocoa, Cedar Bark Extract (natural preservative), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), d-Panthenol, Aloe Vera, Allantoin, Citric Acid, Grapefruit Seed Extract and Rhodiola rosea</li>
            <li> used this product consistently twice every day over major period of pregnancy stage, especially during the 3rd trimester, however I did develop stretch marks near my under belly and some on the sides.</li>
            <li> I love this coco butter formula, recommended for dry skin types only as it is extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how accurate that argument is.  </li>
            <li> I typically apply it all over my pregnant belly after a shower and before going to bed since that has been my whole reason for buying this; but I have used it sparingly on my elbows and hands as well if they are feeling dry.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> First off you have to scrape some out of the jar, it is harder than any lotion or cream I am used to.  </li>
            <li> The Vitamin E and Cocoa Butter are very soothing and healing to dry skin, cuts, abrasions and scars.</li>
            <li> It hydrates and keeps me away from dry skin which is really helpful at this stage</li>
            <li> I use to use this lotion when I was pregnant and after for a few months.</li>
            <li> have been using it on stretch marks around my calf and they are not completely gone, but I sure see them fading a little.. and the difference it definitely noticeable.</li>
            <li> other reviewers have mentioned, it can be greasy when you first apply it.</li>
            <li> After about 3-4 weeks of rubbing the cream into my belly every night I saw major improvements.  </li>
            <li> If you can get away with regular old hand lotion, this may not be for you.</li>
            <li> The down side, it softened all my nails too, and most of them tore off within a few days of using this product.  </li>
            <li> it is even better than I ever imagined in keeping my lower legs moisturized and it removed all the dry hard skin on my ankles.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very soft and the bumps are getting smaller and smaller.  </li>
            <li> other thing that bothered me is that it was really sticky on my skin.</li>
            <li> As I said I use it nearly every day; not generally on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now 40 weeks pregnant and still have a little left in the second jar.  </li>
            <li> I live in CO and the dry air out here has played havoc with my feet.</li>
            <li> complaints, this worked really well for my legs and feet which get especially dry during the winter.</li>
            <li> While I do have scars, their appearance is minimal and I am very routined about its regular application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another thing that I tried was using it on my face on my forehead on a few lines and a few scars on my face, and they reduced/blended in like 2 days :).&lt;br</li>
            <li> first, it might seem a little greasy but it will soak into your skin quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the techs are amazed at my soft feet, my own little secret.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks and helps my skin stay soft all day long.</li>
            <li> but after a few days of using this particular jar I have developed a rash that is not going away.</li>
            <li> It is very firm and cannot be easily absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> The only thing that keeps my dry skin soft!</li>
            <li> BUT, why does it cost exactly half as much on Walmart&#x27;s website?  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it for dry skin and keeping your skin soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lost a bit of weight over the last couple of years, and, while this cream didn&#x27;t have any effect on the stretch marks I&#x27;ve had a long time, it did completely fade</li>
            <li> My mother has been using it for a few years, and I&#x27;ve been an avid user for the last year.  </li>
            <li> I used this product, and within a few days the skin was finally soft and back to normal.  </li>
            <li> The Value Size lasts for at least a couple of months, and you can&#x27;t beat the price compared to similar products marketed to pregnant women.</li>
            <li> It does feel super moisturizing, but I can&#x27;t get past the greasiness!</li>
            <li> It has also decreased the oil in my T-zone which would always become shiny within a few hours; I can go pretty much the whole without having to worry about the oil and shine.</li>
            <li> As mentioned, the stretch marks are NOT very long and pronounced, but definitely visible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this cocoa butter for a few weeks, and my 16 year old stretch marks have nearly vanished!</li>
            <li> The only con is that it&#x27;s a little bit greasy, but otherwise it appears to work really well.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it to any other cocoa butter users!</li>
            <li> And boom, just like that, the itchy, sometimes painful dry skin I&#x27;d battled my whole life was all better.</li>
            <li> One of the best solutions I&#x27;ve found for dry, cracking skin -- especially in cold weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African American, 21, and I have extremely dry skin that gets quite itchy in the winter.</li>
            <li> Even a single thread out of place can result in big red marks on my baby tummy.</li>
            <li> So I have completely stopped using this product as it is not worth it.</li>
            <li> Now, that may seem like a long time, but this is the ONLY remedy that has given me the permanent results I desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a diabetic, it has kept my skin on my legs and feet from cracking open from walking on hard surfaces so much.  </li>
            <li> always have dry skin in the wintertime, especially on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a definite cure for dry skin.</li>
            <li> but it definitely helped with the dry skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so one tub of this goes very far.</li>
            <li> Yes it is roughly the same size as the 9.5 oz, but this 13.25oz does not have the same hollow wall that the 9.5oz has; the 13.25oz wall is only the width of one piece of plastic.  </li>
            <li> I wonder why I waited so long to try this and wasted so much money on other creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll notice the redness on your skin fading, the itch immediately goes away, and it&#x27;s thick enough to stay on your skin without having to reapply for a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> I can tell the difference of my stretched marks before and after using this product...</li>
            <li> I will always buy this product, as long as it is available.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Product lasts so long.</li>
            <li> Within a few weeks after applying this formula on those bruises, they disappeared to where my skin at those bruised areas, were completely normal!--To</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so moist for so long.  </li>
            <li> I use it on minor burns, scars, cuts, scratches, even bug bites.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for the last year or so because it works wonders on rough or stretched skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely greasy (not like lotion at all) and left rash/itchness on my tummy.</li>
            <li> My father has used this product for as long as I can remember too, well over 20 years!</li>
            <li> As for stretch marks and dry skin, I can not verify that it works for that because I never tried it for that</li>
            <li> Helps with dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is severely dry and itchy and this helps a lot</li>
            <li> If there is any place on your body that is dry and needs healing, feet, elbows and hands, you have to buy this cream.</li>
            <li> At night maybe if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> have dry skin.</li>
            <li> My dry, itchy skin practically drank it.</li>
            <li> I use this for my particularly dry skin areas, and I use coconut oil for everywhere else</li>
            <li> that isn&#x27;t AS dry.</li>
            <li> and i send it to my aunt as she said she got dry skin on the Hand.</li>
            <li> anywhere else I have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> I would put up with being dry and itchy before putting on lotion.  </li>
            <li> I had some scarring on my arm that left dark marks and bumps.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s getting rid of my stretch marks because I haven&#x27;t used it for a long enough time, but definitely leaves my skin feeling smoother.</li>
            <li> It does tend to leave you feeling a little greasy after applying but it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I can wear regular lotion and a half hour</li>
            <li> Even when I used less I could feel it sticking the next day.</li>
            <li> The skin gets noticably less red immediately after application.</li>
            <li> It became very very dry and scaly.</li>
            <li> He has very dry skin and nothing seemed to be helping until he tried this.</li>
            <li> Have been using this roughly for a month, and while I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements on the stretch marks I already had, I&#x27;m at least not seeing any new developing ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, this is very thick, very greasy.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is once you apply to your big ol belly and put on a tshirt, all the shirts you wear will have a grease stained appearance where the lotion rubs off on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is not at all what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Needs a liberal amount of application - hence will be empty in a month or less&lt;</li>
            <li> Its so greasy and not very fragnant too.</li>
            <li> I would apply in the evening, and rotate around a few nighttime tshirts, so only a couple shirts would be ruined.</li>
            <li> I guess everyone is expected to know how to use it.</li>
            <li> It is too heavy to use as a face lotion except for specific problems like wind burn.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as nourishing to my hands as I expected.</li>
            <li> I am crazy about this cocoa butter, which I ordered for the first time last year.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> am also using it for two other purposes.</li>
            <li> This is very different formula than the palmers coco butter I had used in the past.</li>
            <li> Only got one small stretch mark, but can&#x27;t give all the credit to this butter - it&#x27;s probably my genes too.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products from Palmer&#x27;s like Strecth marks lotion and oil for itchy skin.</li>
            <li> And all of my surgery scars are minimal!</li>
            <li> All the tales of this product warding off stretch marks due to pregnancy; are truth.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works.</li>
            <li> Other things to note</li>
            <li> Now that it&#x27;s down a bit, it&#x27;s very soft in the jar, so if you&#x27;re concerned about how hard it seems to be, don&#x27;t worry!</li>
            <li> , the cream is very thick, (it&#x27;s somewhat similar to the texture of shortening) but it really is not that difficult to wash off with a little soap and water and the results are so worth it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Keeps the skin a little greasy (not very oily though)&lt;br</li>
            <li> used the Cocoa Butter Formula at least twice a day once I discovered it during the middle of my pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> I apply religiously at least 3 times daily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m prone to dark elbows and knees, and this cream has all but erased the darkness.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how this works for strectch marks that have been on your skin for long.</li>
            <li> It also makes my skin feel icky and gross.</li>
            <li> I often shower in the evening before bed to cut down on my getting-ready time in the mornings before work, so</li>
            <li> The &#x27;Concentrated Cream&amp;#34; is a little less intensive, and then the regular cocoa butter lotion is the least intensive.</li>
            <li> I used it everyday, and I have very minimal stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oily and has a slight odor to it, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend dousing yourself in it, but the results are almost immediate after applying.</li>
            <li> Some people say it&#x27;s genetics, but I have stretchmarks from previous weight loss/gain</li>
            <li> My skin was firmer and my stretch marks a lot less noticable.  </li>
            <li> Reduces or slightly prevents stretch marks (YMMV)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Rub it in for longer and use less.  </li>
            <li> I had surgery 3 months ago and my scar is less noticeable</li>
            <li> It also made my belly feel less taunt.</li>
            <li> I did this to soften my hands and then ,one day, I noticed how long and hard my nails had become.</li>
            <li> Mineral Oil is listed second and is not good for your skin.</li>
            <li> The summer heat will make u look like a oily and sweaty mess.</li>
            <li> I used the product for about a week and noticed a little rash after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Cream itself is a little sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> She still uses it now to get rid of any little ones.</li>
            <li> This product arrived defective -- all dried up.  </li>
            <li> My skin tone was uneven, and muddy.  </li>
            <li> Here are a few things that I like about it and</li>
            <li> the few times I used it.</li>
            <li> It has a firm consistency in the jar</li>
            <li> It is a bit heavy</li>
            <li> Give it a few applications.  </li>
            <li> in terms of size I wrote this comment on another comment, they said the Size was not accurate, and thus a rip off:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got a terrible case of hives a few months ago, and a patch of skin on my calf that was just pretty much solid hives never really recovered.  </li>
            <li> You might sometimes want to apply plain coconut oil on your tummy if you are just not relieved by any product..</li>
            <li> Initially bought to combat crazy winter dry skin and help sooth my eczema (as mentioned in some reviews).</li>
            <li> The only few things wrong with it is I don&#x27;t like the smell of choco</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this is simple a bad batch or if this company does not store their supplies properly, but I would not recommend!</li>
            <li> I had a severe leg accident with compound fractures where my bones broke through a few places that caused nerve damage and left some ugly scarring and strange pain sensitivity.</li>
            <li> I bought four of these products online because I was being too lazy to go in search.</li>
            <li> I have a small frame and am smalled boned, as well.  </li>
            <li> I use it as chapstick, on scars, and small cuts and scratches.</li>
            <li> I just cannot get past the smell, it&#x27;s not for me.  </li>
            <li> I may buy a small bottle of the lotion, as the product in the jar is too greasy on my hands unless I am using it overnight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought cocoa butter dozens of times in the past.</li>
            <li> , the product was wrapped in a grocery bag (the small ones from the produce aisle), and there was no &amp;#34;safety seal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is how it should look.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps to clear, or at least reduce, the ugly appearance of stretch marks!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, my stomach stretched quite a bit</li>
            <li> Hard to get out of the container</li>
            <li> but sometimes it is hard to get out because of the thickness of the lotion.  </li>
            <li> This tub was delivered and inside, the cream was hard &amp; solidified.</li>
            <li> it was hard like a rock.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars, but I was unhappy with the following things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but at least now my feet don&#x27;t hurt when I walk on them</li>
            <li> that was just my skin acting all crazy to it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> i read reviews on internet after getting rash after using the product and it seems to be a common with palmers cream</li>
            <li> and when you are on a hard surface floor, you can be prone to developing hard, tough skin.  </li>
            <li> I was completely wrong about this being half the price at Walmart</li>
            <li> and it actually makes my eczema flare out. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and keeps my moist.</li>
            <li> Not for everybody though-- Very thick.</li>
            <li> Very thick.  </li>
            <li> Once you rub it in well, it leaves no residue behind and does not get onto your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even gotten a lot of my friends addicted.</li>
            <li> my hands and arms were like a thin layer of grease.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Currently I use it on my feet every night (I was tired of hearing the pedicurist telling me</li>
            <li> My mother used it on me when I was a child on one of the worst scars imaginable on my face - running behind my older brother playing football with his friends and going for the pass.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida where the ocean and pool can be cruel to my skin.</li>
            <li> There not too bad but bad enough</li>
            <li> The tear usually began at the nail bed, so my ragged fingertips are awfully painful.  </li>
            <li> My doctor suggested a cocoa-butter based product after a surgery left me with a nasty scar.  </li>
            <li> For the price you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> I notice my skin is softer and the faint stretch marks I did have are not noticeable any longer</li>
            <li> My stretcharks grow like crazy</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for Cocoa Butter products and just buy whatever, that&#x27;s like going to the store for peanut butter and getting mad because you picked up a crunchy without realizing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical before I bought the product.</li>
            <li> They have cracked so badly</li>
            <li> i cant say thing anything bad about cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed by the price - it was overpriced.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed with how greasy it is.  </li>
            <li> was something I just couldn&#x27;t tolerate :(  </li>
            <li> I hate the way it feels</li>
            <li> , I hate putting it on, I hate</li>
            <li> hate hate it!  </li>
            <li> and I must say that I have never been disappointed with the moisture it delivers, even in the harshest of winters!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hated it!</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying I have always hated lotion!  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great value, for some reason this is a hard to find item at my local target or CVS, so having this larger size is economical and lasts longer.  I swear by this product, I have used this on my feet every day after my shower for years.  When I get my pedicures the techs are amazed at my soft feet, my own little secret.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the ingredients before I purchased this.  Mineral Oil is listed second and is not good for your skin.</li>
            <li> I like the body oil a lot better.  This product arrived defective -- all dried up.  I was hesitant to re-order it because I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll get another defective product.  I think I&#x27;ll stick with the oil instead.  Works great.</li>
            <li> I love this &amp;#34;palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter formula with vitamin e&amp;#34; that is in a jar/tub that heals and softens rough, dry skin and helps smoothes marks and scars. Now I use this for something more personal- after I shave my vagina I use this as a moisturizer to help prevent ingrown hairs and red shaving bumps from producing. It prevents it very well. I also use cortisone cream with Aloe Vera with it. This helps me have a nice smooth looking vagina with no bumps or ingrown hairs. I love it. I apply it frequently throughout the day so my skin won&#x27;t get irritated. It obviously helps to prevent irritation. I recommend it for this purpose. As for stretch marks and dry skin, I can not verify that it works for that because I never tried it for that but I&#x27;m sure it would (probably) work. It is a superb moisturizer. I love it and it has a nice smell to it! I will be buying another jar here on amazon, my jar now, was not purchased online.</li>
            <li> This cocoa butter lotion is great. We use it daily after we shower. It lasts all day and we don&#x27;t need to continue to add more lotion.</li>
            <li> Sold out at my local Target. I ordered this with next day shipping! Came right away! No fingerprints or smudges. Came clean! I use this on my face and body and it smoothes out my skin. I need it especially for my outer thighs because I get bumps there but every time I use this, they&#x27;re gone along with the scarring! Might work for some, might not! It&#x27;s all about how your skin takes to it and also diet and health.</li>
            <li> I had my first baby in February and tried several different products to keep my skin moisturized throughout my pregnancy.  Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula was by far my favorite product for preventing stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers have mentioned, it can be greasy when you first apply it. The consistency is more similar to petroleum jelly than lotion.  This was actually what I liked best about the formula over others recommended for belly bumps such as Mustela Ultimate Hydration Body Lotion and Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee Belly Butter.  The thicker, richer body of Palmer&#x27;s made me feel that my skin stayed more hydrated and protected throughout the day, even when my skin was stretched to the max during my 9th month of pregnancy.  Once you rub it in well, it leaves no residue behind and does not get onto your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Cocoa Butter Formula at least twice a day once I discovered it during the middle of my pregnancy.  I remember I applied it before going to the hospital to deliver my son, and the nurses even commented on how soft my skin was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I send a jar to any of my girlfriends that are newly expecting mothers.  The Value Size lasts for at least a couple of months, and you can&#x27;t beat the price compared to similar products marketed to pregnant women.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mild eczema for about 4 years now and like most people who suffer with eczema, I&#x27;ve tried almost everything. After hearing some people recommend me cocoa butter, I immediately bought myself a jar of it. It&#x27;s oily and has a slight odor to it, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend dousing yourself in it, but the results are almost immediate after applying. You&#x27;ll notice the redness on your skin fading, the itch immediately goes away, and it&#x27;s thick enough to stay on your skin without having to reapply for a decent amount of time. For mild eczema, next to Aquaphor, this is the best under the counter product you can get that doesn&#x27;t contain any extremely harmful steroids. Less effective on more irritated areas of the skin, but highly recommend it nonetheless as it clears up minor areas of eczema within a couple days.</li>
            <li> I have got mystery stretch marks on my back as a teenager. I used this straight for several weeks and there was no change. I will try again, using it more frequently, to give it another shot. Great moisturizer, especially in winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a believer in moisturizing my skin, and I was blessed with a great complexion.  After taking toxic medication for 1 year, my skin had lost it&#x27;s luster.  My skin tone was uneven, and muddy.  I&#x27;d used cocoa butter products in the past, and Palmer&#x27;s had been my favorite.  I bought a jar of the cocoa butter formula and used it on my hands and face.  Not only do I see an improvement, but I receive compliments on my complexion again.  I can see hints of  the glow I had when I was 25.  The cream may seem heavy, but it&#x27;s well absorbed, and actually creates a smooth even complexion with regular use.  I use it all over now, and look forward to an even  better complexion.</li>
            <li> This is not a cream.  It is very firm and cannot be easily absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, smells good... But it didn&#x27;t work for me - I have LOTS of stretch marks!!!</li>
            <li> I bought four of these products online because I was being too lazy to go in search. I was a bit disappointed by the price - it was overpriced. Note that this is not a review about the product itself, which is amazing; but the price was unbelievable at $15+</li>
            <li> I can tell the difference of my stretched marks before and after using this product...Highly Recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> It advertises being useful on scars and stretch marks but I have not seen any improvements.  It is a great moisturizer but I think you&#x27;re better off buying raw cocoa butter to help with skin elasticity and to moisturize since it&#x27;s cheaper and mostly what you are paying for with Palmer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I used this cream from the minute I found out I was pregnant and still using it. (My baby is 9 months old). I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks and helps my skin stay soft all day long.</li>
            <li> One of the best solutions I&#x27;ve found for dry, cracking skin -- especially in cold weather. I use it every night at bed time and sometimes during the work day. It is one of my Subscribe &amp; Save items. Don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> Its so thick and creamy I love it. I use it because I have super sensitive skin and I have many small scars but I think that this does help minimize over time. I use to use this lotion when I was pregnant and after for a few months. I dont know why I had stopped using it but I will definitely buy more!</li>
            <li> Great product. Use it on hands and feet every night under gloves and socks. The only thing that keeps my dry skin soft!</li>
            <li> Maybe I have sensitive lips, but I have to say that my lips dry out more than anyone I know. I have never found any substitute that works better than Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter formula. It literally keeps my lips moist and soft for up to 12 hours. I&#x27;ll put it on when I go to bed and wake up to soft, moist lips. Obviously this product can be used for many other parts of your body too to keep the moisture locked in on your skin, so it really is what I&#x27;d call a &#x27;miracle&#x27; skin care product. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it!</li>
            <li> I first bought this in the normal size at a local store and have loved it through my pregnancy so far (I now have about 3 months to go). It does tend to leave you feeling a little greasy after applying but it doesn&#x27;t last long. I typically apply it all over my pregnant belly after a shower and before going to bed since that has been my whole reason for buying this; but I have used it sparingly on my elbows and hands as well if they are feeling dry. I am definitely glad I found the value size on here though- so much more for your money!</li>
            <li> the item is fantastic. I took off a star because of the price. I just saw the same item at a local Wal-Mart for under $7 today. the container was the same size but said 9.25 oz.</li>
            <li> I use this as a night cream. It&#x27;s so rich and moisturizing that I still have it on my face when I wake up. Even though my skin is sensitive, it doesn&#x27;t irritate it at all and my face is dewy and line free after years of using this. When I get compliments on my skin, I tell people about Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter in the jar (the lotion in the bottle is great, but not as a night cream).</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t see any results after 6 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> A fantastic formula for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin, this stuff leaves me feeling soft and smooth all over. I can wear regular lotion and a half hour my skin is ashy again, I need this thick wonderful smelling concoction to stay moist. If you can get away with regular old hand lotion, this may not be for you. If your mother slathered you in Vaseline during the summer so it wouldn&#x27;t look as if you had been rolling in flour, this is the stuff for you. Also, put it on your feet with a pair of socks over night and in the morning will be baby soft.</li>
            <li> My family has a history of using Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter.  My mother used it on me when I was a child on one of the worst scars imaginable on my face - running behind my older brother playing football with his friends and going for the pass.  I didn&#x27;t see the wooden light pole in my periphials and slid right down it after impact! After a few weeks of this stuff, my face was flawless.  I was sold on it and the immense love of my mom!  I use it on my daughter.  Ironically enough she ran into a tree limb with her face and I knew where to go!  Her face is once again flawless too!</li>
            <li> Awesome to prevent stretch marks. This is the only stuff that works. Our youngest thinks it smells like skittles. Haha</li>
            <li> My doctor suggested a cocoa-butter based product after a surgery left me with a nasty scar.  I bought some Palmer&#x27;s and now I wish I had done so sooner!  It moisturizes so well.  I would give it 5 stars, but I was unhappy with the following things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not at all what I expected.  Anyone who has used pure cocoa butter knows the delicious chocolate smell that the product has.  The smell of this product is not unpleasant, but a man would probably not pick this product for the smell it has.  It is girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the awesome job this product did for skin softening, I used it on my horribly dry and cracked hands.  It felt wonderful and the moisturizing effects lasted about 12 hours.  The down side, it softened all my nails too, and most of them tore off within a few days of using this product.  The tear usually began at the nail bed, so my ragged fingertips are awfully painful.  Since I stopped using this product on my hands, my nails have started growing back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for scars.  I am amazed at the results.  And the price is right!  You don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune to see results.</li>
            <li> good stuff, very soft, goes on smooth and leaves your skin feeling moist, over time it will correct discoloration in your skin</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. My stretcharks grow like crazy still even I only gained 26 pounds through my whole pregnancy. Also it&#x27;s too greasy. I hated it!</li>
            <li> my product of choice, nice.</li>
            <li> I prefer the Palmers version of Cocoa Butter! I we not disappointed!</li>
            <li> Anyone who has used Palmer&#x27;s knows that it is the best. I use the lip balm all the time. I live in CO and the dry air out here has played havoc with my feet. They have cracked so badly I can&#x27;t even get a pedicure to fix them. I was so happy when I saw this. Three days of slathering this on my feet and sleeping in socks and it&#x27;s like night and day. I still need about two more nights worth and I&#x27;d say based on the climate here I will have to reapplies but at least now my feet don&#x27;t hurt when I walk on them AND I can go get a pedicure again.</li>
            <li> MY BODY CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT IT!!! IT&#x27;S PART OF MY MOISTURIZING DAILY METHOD... :-)</li>
            <li> Works great to moisturize and I get less ingrown hairs on my legs since using it daily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but this product has done so much in just a week I thought I would share. It shrunk the ginormous pores on my nose, which I haven&#x27;t been able to do with any other product. It has also decreased the oil in my T-zone which would always become shiny within a few hours; I can go pretty much the whole without having to worry about the oil and shine. The only few things wrong with it is I don&#x27;t like the smell of choco and It is also very greasy, but you can just lightly pat the excess off after you rub it in.</li>
            <li> I started using this product at 6 weeks pregnant, twice a day.  I&#x27;m now 40 weeks pregnant and still have a little left in the second jar.  I have NO stretchmarks.  Some people say it&#x27;s genetics, but I have stretchmarks from previous weight loss/gain so I&#x27;m not sure how accurate that argument is.  This stuff feels so good on my belly and keeps it moisturized and itch free!</li>
            <li> My son was almost 10 pounds and 24 inches when he was born.  I have a small frame and am smalled boned, as well.  Needless to say, my stomach stretched quite a bit and I got stretch marks from the pregnancy.  I used this cream because it was thick and smelled great.  Let me tell you...it worked great, too!  After about 3-4 weeks of rubbing the cream into my belly every night I saw major improvements.  My skin was firmer and my stretch marks a lot less noticable.  I continued to use the cream and after another couple weeks my skin looked almost exactly like it did prepregnancy.  This is the best stuff for strectch marks and firming skin in my book!</li>
            <li> excellent product i was in a house fire and had surgery for burns on shoulders this works on my scars to flatten them terrific lip balm also</li>
            <li> This moisturizer really works and smells so great. A fat baker with acne recommended it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typed all the Ingredients from my product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: De-ionized Water, Cocoa Butter, Sweet Almond Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, Emulsifying Wax, Abyssinica Seed Oil, Vegetable Glycerin, Cetyl Alcohol, Ceteareth-20, Glucose/Glucose Oxidase/Lactoperosidase (natural preservative), Stearic Acid (vegetable source), Soy Lecithin, d-alpha Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Natural French Vanilla Fragrance, Organic Natural Cocoa, Cedar Bark Extract (natural preservative), Retinyl Palmitate (Vitamin A), d-Panthenol, Aloe Vera, Allantoin, Citric Acid, Grapefruit Seed Extract and Rhodiola rosea (Root) Extract.</li>
            <li> Love, love!! Can&#x27;t get anything better for this price!! I use every night before going to bed and my skin is a smooth as a babies!! :)</li>
            <li> This is the best Cocoa butter Ive ever tried..</li>
            <li> I use this almost every day and love it. Here are a few things that I like about it and that you should know:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Smells like cocoa. Of course. I don&#x27;t mind it at all.&lt;br /&gt;2. Feels like butter. Yep. Looks like it too.&lt;br /&gt;3. Helps with dry skin. I slather it on my entire body and I love it, especially on my legs after I get out of the trouble.&lt;br /&gt;4. It also comes in a travel size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints, this worked really well for my legs and feet which get especially dry during the winter. I typically apply it shortly after I get out of the shower for the best results. I have also heard that this can help with stretch marks during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, if you don&#x27;t mind smelling like coconut. The Vitamin E and Cocoa Butter are very soothing and healing to dry skin, cuts, abrasions and scars.</li>
            <li> Gift and the recipient loves it!</li>
            <li> Actually so much better for tattoos than anything I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s healing much faster, and it&#x27;s actually doing a better job of keeping the pigments in the skin instead of sucking it out like the other products.</li>
            <li> Very good for dry skin</li>
            <li> excellent. smells like chocolate and keeps you moisturized all day. can&#x27;t speak for its effects on stretch marks since i haven&#x27;t been applying it to them religiously...</li>
            <li> I used the product for about a week and noticed a little rash after a couple of days. Today I noticed that it went from all over my arms to my chest...really itchy!&lt;br /&gt;Happened to me too with the fragrance free cocoa butter but never with the one in the tube. There must be a different ingredient in those ones.&lt;br /&gt;But that was just my skin acting all crazy to it.&lt;br /&gt;The other thing that bothered me is that it was really sticky on my skin. Even when I used less I could feel it sticking the next day. But have to say it smells really good! But still no lotion for me.</li>
            <li> The product as it states is cocoa butter, so it does moisten the skin (somewhat greases it) but it doesn&#x27;t remove or prevents stretch marks. As indicated by many studies and research getting stretch mark has many factors and no topical applications can help avoid them.&lt;br /&gt;This product at best does alleviate or reduce the degree of stretch marks so they are not so pronounced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this product consistently twice every day over major period of pregnancy stage, especially during the 3rd trimester, however I did develop stretch marks near my under belly and some on the sides. As mentioned, the stretch marks are NOT very long and pronounced, but definitely visible. I didn&#x27;t have a huge baby bump to cause them either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Keeps the skin moist&lt;br /&gt;- Smells like cocoa (sweet smell and not so strong... which I don&#x27;t detest)&lt;br /&gt;- Ease of use&lt;br /&gt;- Reduces or slightly prevents stretch marks (YMMV)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Keeps the skin a little greasy (not very oily though)&lt;br /&gt;- Needs a liberal amount of application - hence will be empty in a month or less&lt;br /&gt;- Does not prevent or remove stretch marks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still recommend this product, as this is a better product than others for its pros and economical. Also, I believe a pregnant woman should continually moisten her skin for it allow the stretching, which in turn reduces the stretch marks. But let me remind you again, it doesn&#x27;t completely remove nor prevent them. If you do get stretch marks don&#x27;t blame this product and vice versa.</li>
            <li> Really evens out skin complexion.  How did I go three decades of my life without this stuff?  Really enhances the naked form.</li>
            <li> Palmers Cocoa Butter is the best stuff for keeping your skin soft and supple. I live in Florida where the ocean and pool can be cruel to my skin. I apply this cocoa butter to my arms, legs and torso right out of the shower while my skin is wet. It absorbs into my skin and after I towel off, my skin is soooo soft!!!! And it smells nice, too! Highly recommended and I will be buying this again and again!</li>
            <li> Coco butter formula is amazing I want to rid these stretch marks. There not too bad but bad enough</li>
            <li> I got a terrible case of hives a few months ago, and a patch of skin on my calf that was just pretty much solid hives never really recovered.  It became very very dry and scaly. I put lotion on it numerous times a day but it didn&#x27;t make any difference at all. I used this product, and within a few days the skin was finally soft and back to normal.  Very happy!</li>
            <li> I really like this cocoa butter. It leaves my skin soft and supple without feeling greasy. I will continue to purchase via amazon because the price it great.</li>
            <li> I love using Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter.  My mother has been using it for a few years, and I&#x27;ve been an avid user for the last year.  I had some scarring on my arm that left dark marks and bumps.  I use the palmer&#x27;s after every shower.  It makes my skin very soft and the bumps are getting smaller and smaller.  The darkness is still there, but they are definitely smoother.  My mom swears by this stuff, and she&#x27;s a smart lady, so I trust this product.  I heard it was also good for stretch marks.  I&#x27;ve never been pregnant, so I have yet to see how effective it is on that, but cocoa extract has long been known for its beneficial uses on skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Palmer&#x27;s for years. It&#x27;s my go to miracle product. I use it as chapstick, on scars, and small cuts and scratches. It increase healing time on wounds. I&#x27;ve even gotten a lot of my friends addicted.</li>
            <li> Just okay for me.  I just cannot get past the smell, it&#x27;s not for me.  Don&#x27;t think I will continue to use.  The lotion it self seemed to work fine the few times I used it.</li>
            <li> Works great on my skin.</li>
            <li> -- Update as of 6/1/2015&lt;br /&gt;I am changing my review from 3 to 1 star as after using for 5 months religiously twice a day I still got stretch marks. I understand this can happen with any product if one is prone to getting stretch marks they will.&lt;br /&gt;But this product did not help me with itchy and dry skin which started once I was 6M pregnant. So I have completely stopped using this product as it is not worth it. I do not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is chocolaty. So if you have a strong sense of smell you may not like the scent. Cream itself is a little sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using during Pregnancy and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I had total knee replacement surgery and used Palmers on the scar as soon as the bandage came off. My surgeon had recommended cocoa butter and vitamin e lotion but did not recommend a brand. I chose Palmers because of their reputation. My doctor was very pleased as am I as how wonderfully the scar is almost disappearing. I recommend this product highly!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good cocobutter cream, not overly whipped or watered down.  Substantive with a nice aroma.  I use some after swimming.</li>
            <li> Very healthy and moisturizing, but greasy so not as useful as a face cream.  A good body cream when extra moisturizing is needed, but avoid sun when using.</li>
            <li> I love this cream - I have lots of allergies and itching, and it helps quite a bit if I use it right after my shower.  BUT, why does it cost exactly half as much on Walmart&#x27;s website?  I don&#x27;t have any warm and tender feelings toward Walmart, but I do object to paying double for the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I was completely wrong about this being half the price at Walmart - what is available on Walmart&#x27;s website is the lotion in a pump bottle, and they add shipping, so it adds up to 2 bottles of lotion for $16.24; apparently, no site to store free shipping available.  I may buy a small bottle of the lotion, as the product in the jar is too greasy on my hands unless I am using it overnight.  A very good product no matter what.  This particular jar appears to be unavailable at most of the websites I checked, such as Target, Walmart, etc.  Have not looked in Costco yet, and their website does not have it.[[ASIN:B001UHSVOY Cocoa Butter Formula with Vitamin E Cream Unisex by Palmer&#x27;s, 13.25 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s getting rid of my stretch marks because I haven&#x27;t used it for a long enough time, but definitely leaves my skin feeling smoother. The smell is pretty neutral</li>
            <li> The first batch I received was not sealed and had a thumb print in it. I was not offered a free refund and the best I could hope for was an exchange. The new one I received was also not sealed but looked brand new. I&#x27;ve purchased this brand before and always loved it but after a few days of using this particular jar I have developed a rash that is not going away. Very disappointed. I am not sure if this is simple a bad batch or if this company does not store their supplies properly, but I would not recommend!</li>
            <li> Thought this was more of a lotion, but it&#x27;s actual cocoa butter. I thought it would be more of a cocoa butter lotion that I have tried from Palmer&#x27;s in the past. This was too greasy for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very oily product so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting it on and just go. The summer heat will make u look like a oily and sweaty mess. I normally put a Layer on then let it sit so it will absorb into my skin. I repeat as many times as I want after that. It&#x27;s a really good product and has helped keep me moisturized and reduce my stretch marks</li>
            <li> Wonderful for night creme.  Can be more than a bit greasy, but it gets soaked into the skin.  I find that it keeps the skin moist and supple.  It might not be appreciated by a young, married couple. My sister and I love it!</li>
            <li> I got this to use on my belly for pregnancy..it&#x27;s great for moisturizing skin, but the smell is so not for me.  I haven&#x27;t used it all that much as a result and probably wouldn&#x27;t ever buy it again.</li>
            <li> The scent of cocoa butter is so yummy, and this is a really great product!</li>
            <li> We use at our dental office, patients love it.</li>
            <li> Using for years on my face. Acne scars have disappeared at a much quicker pace as compared to anything else. Does not irritate my skin, goes on like butter. This price for this size is amazing.</li>
            <li> Great value.  I am halfway through my pregnancy, utilizing it daily and still have 3/4 left.</li>
            <li> Hard to get out of the container but this makes your skin so so soft and adds a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> Great for pregnancy/stretch marks</li>
            <li> This product is great.  We have used other coco butter products and settled on this as its light and non greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream for years and it&#x27;s kept my feet, legs, abdmen, arms, and hands smooth, soft, healthy, and in better shape than a lot of more other products showering the market (some more expensive than this).  I use it on a regular basis depending on what I have done that day.  As a diabetic, it has kept my skin on my legs and feet from cracking open from walking on hard surfaces so much.  I also walk in my home barefoot alot and when you are on a hard surface floor, you can be prone to developing hard, tough skin.  Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa butter is a very rich cream that gives me an almost immediate soothing and softening effect.  My skin is much smoother and softer than it used to be, and I am greatful for that.  This is a good buy for the amount you get and I reorder it all the time.  I think it&#x27;s a good value.</li>
            <li> Great lotion. If you are so inclined to use lotion before bed this should be your first pick. Once you use it on a regular basis it keeps your skin very moisturized and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Palmer&#x27;s cream.  I mix with the regular Palmers lotion every day and it keeps my skin silky soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this product,  it is an excellent product for dry and roughened skin. The price is a great bargain too.</li>
            <li> I just had my R knee replaced 12/15/13, This stuff truly works, my scar is there, but sure does not appear to be from knee replacement. I apply religiously at least 3 times daily. In a few more months, I wager the scar is indiscernible.</li>
            <li> We will continue to purchase this product as need arises.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin, and this is the greatest! It is very concentrated, so just use a little, you can add more if you need it. The first time I got too much, and was able to soften hands, arms, neck....you get the picture. Smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Works better than any other lotion I have tried. I put it on right after a shower. My skin is severely dry and itchy and this helps a lot</li>
            <li> great moisturizer.  good for razor burn and dry patches.</li>
            <li> Love the product, but found it significantly cheaper in stores.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways which is nice, as it seems to be a little pricey.&lt;br /&gt;Works very well on bottom of feet and has helped tremendously with dryness and cracking.&lt;br /&gt;I am also using it for two other purposes. I had a severe leg accident with compound fractures where my bones broke through a few places that caused nerve damage and left some ugly scarring and strange pain sensitivity. This cream is helping with both of those issues and that alone is a huge yes for it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, wife is using it as a bit of a massage oil/cream  when working on my leg muscles and rubbing out swelling and such. Feels good and is much better than a general  baby or massage oil.</li>
            <li> Large jar. Will reorder again.</li>
            <li> Well for me it is too greasy.  Meaning you put it on my hands and arms and I could not put on a shirt and my hands and arms were like a thin layer of grease.  I took me some time to wash it off.  So have not used it again.</li>
            <li> Recommended by my home nurse after a hip replacement. My skin itched a lot. She recommended that I put this cream on the incision. It made it stop itching and it healed well.</li>
            <li> This is very different formula than the palmers coco butter I had used in the past. It&#x27;s extremely greasy (not like lotion at all) and left rash/itchness on my tummy. i read reviews on internet after getting rash after using the product and it seems to be a common with palmers cream</li>
            <li> Ok people, know what you&#x27;re buying.  If you&#x27;re looking for Cocoa Butter products and just buy whatever, that&#x27;s like going to the store for peanut butter and getting mad because you picked up a crunchy without realizing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love cocoa butter, use it mostly every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it is greasy, YOU HAVE TO RUB IT IN.  Rub it in for longer and use less.  It takes a little bit to set in, but it is great in cold winter to keep you from drying out and great in the summer to get a golden tan (also spf 4, like you&#x27;re worried about that with cocoa butter on!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes it smells like chocolate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No it is not lotion, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called BUTTER.  Yes there is cocoa butter lotion called Cocoa Butter LOTION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take some getting used to, and you still may not like it.  As I said I use it nearly every day; not generally on my face but it&#x27;s great for lips, feet, whole body!  Great for massage ;)  but again, DON&#x27;T USE TOO MUCH.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in terms of size I wrote this comment on another comment, they said the Size was not accurate, and thus a rip off:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I read your comment about the size before buying, but got it anyway since Amazon is so good about returns.  Yes it is roughly the same size as the 9.5 oz, but this 13.25oz does not have the same hollow wall that the 9.5oz has; the 13.25oz wall is only the width of one piece of plastic.  Also it wouldn&#x27;t need to be much bigger, it is only 3.75oz more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the place I got my 9.5oz jars in NYC had a better price per ounce, but now that I&#x27;m in San Francisco I can&#x27;t find the 7.25oz for less than $9!  So for me this one is a good deal, it&#x27;s all relative.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This product gives you a lot for your money, and it has worked well at staving off stretch mark growth during my pregnancy. The only con is that it&#x27;s a little bit greasy, but otherwise it appears to work really well.</li>
            <li> I used this butter during both of my pregnancies for stretch marks.  Only got one small stretch mark, but can&#x27;t give all the credit to this butter - it&#x27;s probably my genes too.</li>
            <li> used this for stretch marks on my thighs and after a week they already started to fade! AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I&#x27;ve been using this product on my face and body for years and I must say that I have never been disappointed with the moisture it delivers, even in the harshest of winters! I will always buy this product, as long as it is available.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for the last year or so because it works wonders on rough or stretched skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m prone to dark elbows and knees, and this cream has all but erased the darkness. No doubt that it&#x27;ll be completely gone by the end of the year. Now, that may seem like a long time, but this is the ONLY remedy that has given me the permanent results I desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is also fantastic for fresh stretch marks (you know, the ones that are still red/purple/brown). I&#x27;ve lost a bit of weight over the last couple of years, and, while this cream didn&#x27;t have any effect on the stretch marks I&#x27;ve had a long time, it did completely fade the more recent ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended product!</li>
            <li> Since our children are grown, I had forgotten all about this product. If there is any place on your body that is dry and needs healing, feet, elbows and hands, you have to buy this cream. I bought one for my night stand, and the pump for my kitchen.&lt;br /&gt;I will always have this product near....</li>
            <li> For the price you cannot go wrong. Truly works. Gets rid of stretch marks very smell and also smells fantastic</li>
            <li> This makes my hand and feet so soft. It smells like chocolate icing. My kids and I love using it at night.  We even use it as a lip balm.</li>
            <li> Even hours after applying the cream it is still greasy looking and it&#x27;s sticky to the touch. It is good for moisturizing dry skin but it&#x27;s just too greasy looking. Just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I use this to make a surgery scar lighter.  it works.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!&lt;br /&gt;I always have dry skin in the wintertime, especially on my feet.&lt;br /&gt;I use this every night at bedtime and my skin is so much softer.&lt;br /&gt;At first, it might seem a little greasy but it will soak into your skin quickly.&lt;br /&gt;It has a pleasant smell - not strong -  just slightly cocoa-ish. Plus, it&#x27;s 1/4 the price of the fancy brands.</li>
            <li> I had surgery 3 months ago and my scar is less noticeable the someone that had the exact same procedure 2 years ago.  I take one finger from each hand and rub back and forth for a couple minutes a day.</li>
            <li> I like this lotion.  I put it on morning and night and it stays on all day.  It&#x27;s very thick and keeps my moist.</li>
            <li> Soften skin, smooths skin.  Love it!</li>
            <li> this is one of the \\&quot;must-haves\\&quot; for pregnant moms with really itchy skin.I have really itchy skin and anything I wear increases the urge to scratch. Even a single thread out of place can result in big red marks on my baby tummy. I have tried other products from Palmer&#x27;s like Strecth marks lotion and oil for itchy skin. This one is the best. Its so greasy and not very fragnant too. But it really helps when you would rather die and not scratch your skin. Its an all purpose cream for any kind of marks. I am not sure how this works for strectch marks that have been on your skin for long. But it definitely helps avoid getting more. You dont even have to keep applying it all day like other lotions and cream available in the market. Twice, at the max, is enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;go try it girl..It really helps... You might sometimes want to apply plain coconut oil on your tummy if you are just not relieved by any product.. coconut oil is mother of all products. Best luck..</li>
            <li> its very good but there is an issue, IT has a very strong smell and would make you white clothes turn into yellow and the beds sheets as well..but its effective and definatly worth it to give a try..</li>
            <li> I am 34 weeks pregnant with my first child, and still have not developed any stretch marks.  I can&#x27;t say, however, that it&#x27;s from this product.  I was really disappointed with how greasy it is.  I only use it when I know I&#x27;m going to shower soon after.  I often shower in the evening before bed to cut down on my getting-ready time in the mornings before work, so I don&#x27;t use it very often.  I cannot put it on after a shower, because my shirt will stick to my belly, and it feels gross!  Even hours later, there is a sheen across my stomach.  I have tried using a tiny amount and really rubbing it it, but it doesn&#x27;t make a difference.  It does feel super moisturizing, but I can&#x27;t get past the greasiness!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter, but I feel a little mislead by the description of this item. While it does list the ounces, please be warned that this is a more solid form of the product instead of a more typical liquid form of the moisturizer. I guess since other listings also list the ounces, I was more under the impression that this would be liquid as well. I&#x27;m still going to use it of course, and as a solid there is more there, but I just wish that this was listed more prominently in the description.</li>
            <li> Great product, quantity and size.  Used it to recover from bunion surgery.  Feet never felt better.  Can&#x27;t beet the size for the price!</li>
            <li> This value sized product has a ton of product in it which is great, I know its going to last me my whole pregnancy - even using it 2x a day. Its a good creme, its even helping minimize one of my previous scars. I just wish I had gotten it in a different application container, like a spray - this stuff sticks to the bottom of your fingernails when you get it out. It dries quickly on my stomach, and I&#x27;ve never had problems with it causing my clothes to stick to me. I recommend the product, just suggest getting it in a spray to make it easier to apply for your own sake.</li>
            <li> After our daughter had a back surgery neurosurgeon recommended using cocoa butter on a scar to soften it and make it nicer. He said it will give the same result as fancy scaring products. And indeed - it&#x27;s two months post op and I am applying it twice a day and her scar looks really nice.</li>
            <li> AAAAAAAA++++++++++thanks</li>
            <li> I tend to be really dry in the winter and this is an excellent cream to use for my dry winter skin. Who doesn&#x27;t love cocoa butter? it seems great and it leaves my body feeling soft and smooth with the great cocoa butter fragrance</li>
            <li> I bought this for my pregnancy to prevent stretch marks, but this stuff is AMAZING for everything!  I use it under my eyes, on my face in the winter, and on my neck; it&#x27;s great for rough winter hands, too.  It smells great, too.  When this tub runs out, I&#x27;ll be buying another.  I&#x27;ll never buy another lotion again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 34 weeks pregnant and (fingers crossed) no stretch marks anywhere yet! I&#x27;ve been applying it liberally on my stomach since 4 months every night. It prevents itching and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> Been using it a couple times here and there for some brown scars I had, but it didn&#x27;t really help that much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this cocoa butter for a few weeks, and my 16 year old stretch marks have nearly vanished! I&#x27;ve always used the lotion, but this cream is excellent!</li>
            <li> I started using this product when I carried my first born. I worked perfectly to eliminate stretch marks. Now, I am using it for rashes that cause by allergies. It eases the itchiness. I am so glad I found this product.</li>
            <li> I use cocoa butter all over my body for the winter, but use it as my staple foot lotion to get my soles ready for sandal season. My feet are so soft, almost like a baby bottom. BUT I just found them at my local BJ&#x27;s store for $ 5.39. Will be returning this items $ 11.95 is too high a price</li>
            <li> I have eczema, it helps me retain moisture as well as keeping the scars away. This product is pricey but it is the best for all skin types!</li>
            <li> It is good and really moisturizing your skin.  The size of this lotion can for sure last you a while for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I love Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter products. Been using them since 1999. Gently aids in the disappearance of scars.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without my cocoa butter.  Thank You !!</li>
            <li> I used this cocoa butter starting in my second trimester of my pregnancy. I used it everyday, and I have very minimal stretch marks. My only complaint is once you apply to your big ol belly and put on a tshirt, all the shirts you wear will have a grease stained appearance where the lotion rubs off on. I would apply in the evening, and rotate around a few nighttime tshirts, so only a couple shirts would be ruined. But, otherwise loved it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff moisturizes any dry skin without that greasy feeling after, also takes care of those contact rashes that come up sometimes from rough clothes, etc....</li>
            <li> Great product. I am always in the sun and my skin is always dry, but Palmers Cocoa butter does the trick and keeps my skin smooth and silky soft! It&#x27;s nice and thick and keeps my skin hydrated for hours!</li>
            <li> Great product. Love the extra large container. Product lasts so long. It&#x27;s great not to have to keep restocking.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality cream for dry skin. It works very well. I use it at night and during the day. I apply it to the heels of my feet with white socks.</li>
            <li> Superb product!  Use as directed and excellent results realized!  I used this product on bruises I obtained when I was released from the hospital and had bruises where many injections were given me about my body.  Within a few weeks after applying this formula on those bruises, they disappeared to where my skin at those bruised areas, were completely normal!--To the effect that I could not tell where those bruises ever were!  Great product!!</li>
            <li> Great cream for the feet and hands. Greasy.</li>
            <li> Cocoa butter in a tub is the best stuff for winter dry skin.  Rub it in your hands for a few seconds if it&#x27;s too solid to warm it up for application.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed :) Good size, good quality</li>
            <li> Great for preventing stretch marks, I bought this as a gift for a pregnant friend. Do yourself a favor and buy the giant size.</li>
            <li> So cheap an its in a huge bottle so I ordered a total of 3 tubs at once. It was cheaper than walmart too</li>
            <li> Great skin cream.  I am using it for a surgical scar.</li>
            <li> the best butter for your skin.</li>
            <li> great price fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It has been my old standby for many years.  I use it especially on my feet as they dry and callus very easily without it.  It keeps my skin smooth as well.  Some on my feet and arms at night and I am good to go the next day.  I was happy to find it in a larger container which makes each application a little more reasonable.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product, keeps your skin smooth. Not to oily and smells good.</li>
            <li> Per Palmer&#x27;s website, the cream is the most concentrated and intensive of their cocoa butter formulas. The &#x27;Concentrated Cream&amp;#34; is a little less intensive, and then the regular cocoa butter lotion is the least intensive. I have all three formulas, for different parts of the body: the regular lotion is good for all over after a shower, the concentrated cream is excellent for hands and rough spots like elbows and knees, and the cream is best for dry feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This cream is solid in the tub, but melts quickly in your hand. It does have a richer, greasier texture, but it quickly absorbed by thirsty skin. The scent is mild and not nearly as chocolate-like as the regular lotion or concentrated cream - there is almost a shea butter like scent to it. It leaves a bit of shine/sheen to the skin as well.</li>
            <li> The jar I received has a gouge in the surface of the cocoa butter, like someone dragged their finger across to sample it. I don&#x27;t want to buy used lotion.</li>
            <li> Yes, this is very thick, very greasy. It&#x27;s not something you use on your face during the day.  At night maybe if you have dry skin. I&#x27;ve used this religiously on my entire body since I was 15 and without sounding vain (if that&#x27;s possible) I have soft flawless skin. Not for everybody though-- Very thick.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would be similar to the concentrated cream that comes in a tube ([[ASIN:B0000530O0 Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula with Vitamin E, Concentrated Cream, 3.75 oz (100 g)]].  First off you have to scrape some out of the jar, it is harder than any lotion or cream I am used to.  Second off, your hands feel greasy after you have rubbed it in.  Ultimately I went and washed my hands after putting it on.  I will stick to the concentrated cream, it works wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t make my hands feel gross.</li>
            <li> Working like a charm!</li>
            <li> Love this, my skin is so soft, not sticky, love love it.</li>
            <li> Very thick.  Only a bit needed.  Wonderful on elbows, knees, and heels.</li>
            <li> I used this twice a day during pregnancy and I have zero stretch marks!  Of course it left me and my clothing pretty greasy but that is absolutely fine with me if it means no stretch marks. I will definitely use this for future pregnancies.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter is classic. I&#x27;m African American, 21, and I have extremely dry skin that gets quite itchy in the winter. After a shower I put this all over my body. It also mixes well with cold-pressed coconut oil.</li>
            <li> Awesome product works great for pregnancy rub on your belly during pregnancy and wallah no strectch marks!!!!</li>
            <li> This helps my skin after I have had the doctor burn off sun damaged skin.  The skin gets noticably less red immediately after application.</li>
            <li> Used it on my son. It caused him to break out in a rash all over. Normally I would think it was just his skin. But when I did a search of &amp;#34;cocoa butter rash&amp;#34; Palmer&#x27;s was the named brand in all of the top links. Several pages of it. Please research this brand before you put it on your children!</li>
            <li> I use this daily to keep my skin moist mostly in the winter when my skin gets very dry.  I really love the feel of my skin.  Very moist and soft.</li>
            <li> I love the Palmer&#x27;s skin lotion products.  I like that this is in a jar and much easier to get out to apply to my body.  I have the same product in a squeeze bottle but sometimes it is hard to get out because of the thickness of the lotion.  Yes, I will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite brands of cocoa butter. It has a firm consistency in the jar but it melts like &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; when you start to rub it on your skin. It is a bit heavy but I have dry skin so the fact that it keeps my skin nice and moisturized all day means the world to me. I cannot stress enough how much I love the scent as well, it smells like chocolate cake almost, it&#x27;s quite sweet and stays around for awhile, though because of the scent it may not be the best for people that are sensitive to fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;What I love most about this product is that it contains more cocoa butter than a good amount of the brands you can pick up at the grocery store, while it does still have mineral oil in it, cocoa butter is fairly high on the list as well when a good lot of brands have a tiny bit in theirs. Also, a little goes a long way so I get tons of use out of it and if you are in a pinch for packing it works great as an all over moisturizer after being out in the sun (yes I&#x27;ve tried it on my face and it didn&#x27;t break me out but I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin so just do what you feel is best!) I can use this as a deep moisturizer on my feet at night as well and it&#x27;s perfect for after shaving because of the waxy base, it really locks in moisture so you don&#x27;t get irritated skin.&lt;br /&gt;For me this formula absorbs quickly but it does leave a silky residue which doesn&#x27;t both me because it keeps my hydrated, the scent is beyond delightful, and the price is just dirt cheap for the amount of uses you get out of it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Used it for my first pregnancy to prevent stretch marks and no stretch marks.. Using it now once again for pregnancy and so far so good! Love the smell too and it&#x27;s a great price.</li>
            <li> I had not found this size anywhere and it was a great deal for the price.  The product quality is perfect.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have found this product sooner. Even my 20 year old stretch marks are fading. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is the best cocoa butter</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like feeling afterward</li>
            <li> I used a product very similar to this when I was pregnant living in Italy. Not one stretch mark anywhere on my body. I also used this to help prevent scarring after undergoing a radical mastectomy. While I do have scars, their appearance is minimal and I am very routined about its regular application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Currently I use it on my feet every night (I was tired of hearing the pedicurist telling me I needed the deluxe every time I came in. :). I rub the cream into my feet for about 10 minutes then cover them with nice heavy socks for about an hour - overnight would also work great too. I make sure I concentrate around the cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the cream is very thick, (it&#x27;s somewhat similar to the texture of shortening) but it really is not that difficult to wash off with a little soap and water and the results are so worth it! My feet look and feel fantastic! And all of my surgery scars are minimal! Just note: this is not the same as the cocoa butter massage lotion which is much lighter in texture and meant more for a daily moisturizing lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Love the size for this great size.  Really economical as compared with the price for the smaller size.</li>
            <li> I use Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter as a skin moistener on my face and hands. I put some in my hand and then rub both hands together to warm and soften it. Then I rub the top of each hand and massage the oil into my cuticles and nails. I did this to soften my hands and then ,one day, I noticed how long and hard my nails had become. Between using this and nail buffing cream with a chamois nail buffer, my nails look great.</li>
            <li> This. Stuff. Is. The. Best.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin. I&#x27;ve used so many different lotions and creams that I can&#x27;t even begin to remember them all. Then I tried this, and I&#x27;ve never gone back.&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought it because I had some stretch marks left on my backside from my puberty years. Well, it worked on those. Stretch marks all but invisible now. It made the skin on my backside so smooth and soft that I started using it all over my body. My dry, itchy skin practically drank it. And boom, just like that, the itchy, sometimes painful dry skin I&#x27;d battled my whole life was all better. Even in the middle of our harsh Midwestern winters, this stuff keeps my skin happy. It&#x27;s even smoothed out many of those little nicks and scars that you pick up over the years. Miracle in a jar. Never stop making it.</li>
            <li> Legendary! All the tales of this product warding off stretch marks due to pregnancy; are truth. I have seen more than one woman resort to this treatment and it works. I don&#x27;t agree that it gets rid of scars that are already visible; but I do believe that it helps to prevent them.</li>
            <li> this is the best moisturizer and eye-makeup remover there is!  (even for water proof liners and mascaras!)</li>
            <li> Excellent prodcut, we love this Cocoa Butter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 weeks now and have no stretch marks on my belly yet .. It hydrates and keeps me away from dry skin which is really helpful at this stage</li>
            <li> It smells like chocolate! It&#x27;s a definite cure for dry skin. It&#x27;s great for your face too!</li>
            <li> I am crazy about this cocoa butter, which I ordered for the first time last year. It is easy to apply and absorbs quickly, and actually, I do not find that I have to reapply frequently, as some customers noted--and I have very dry skin.  There is no waste in the application, and my skin feels velvety.  I also think it holds up better in the jar than more lotion-type treatments.  Also, no parabens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chocolate smell is a form of aroma therapy, and if you have had a stressful day, unscrew the lid and take a whiff---ahhh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order the multi-pack and enjoy.</li>
            <li> Great for fading light scars, goes on thick but absorbs quickly and keeps me feeling soft all day. I use this for my particularly dry skin areas, and I use coconut oil for everywhere else that isn&#x27;t AS dry. My father has used this product for as long as I can remember too, well over 20 years!</li>
            <li> Great price for the quantity.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to me by my vascular surgeon for use on my scar line after an above knee amputation of my right leg.  It helps to soften the skin making it more pliable and I have noticed the scar line disappearing.  For the price this is a great value!</li>
            <li> This product is lovely!  Arrives quickly and is smooth.  Has a pleasant smell unlike others I have tried, but very light.  I use it for hands, feet, elbows, knees, and even on my hair and have noticed such a difference!  A little goes a long way.  Will definitely reorder when I&#x27;m close to being out.</li>
            <li> My wife used this daily for her pregnancy to reduce stretch marks, and it worked! She still uses it now to get rid of any little ones. There&#x27;s still a lot left despite how much we&#x27;ve used it. The quantity and quality was great! Leaves skin smooth and soft, and it smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Who ever gave this a one star is dumb.love love love love love love this product. It smells delicious like chocolate from heaven. It&#x27;s so soft in your hands once you work it. People its greasy but it goes away when you rub it in good. Amazing amazing.I used queen helena before this but I&#x27;m switching now.</li>
            <li> So far so good...no stretch marks yet. Will update at the end! I am also alternating it with Mederma lotion.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, it&#x27;s very, very oily so you have to wear it before bed, but dang, it stays on for days if you don&#x27;t shower. I haven&#x27;t necessarily noticed my stretch marks fading, but I don&#x27;t use it every day. I use it maybe 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> I used it since years and i send it to my aunt as she said she got dry skin on the Hand. Now is all perfect and she got a smooth skin.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps to clear, or at least reduce, the ugly appearance of stretch marks! Love it and will continue to use in the future</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for a long time and it is great and its not tested on animals which is a plus</li>
            <li> I bought this to put on my belly during my pregnancy.  I actually really loved the way it felt on my skin.  It leaves my skin so moist for so long.  I just couldn&#x27;t stomach the smell of it.  It smells so sweet, like I have muffins in my pockets at all times.  I don&#x27;t have a sweet tooth, and smelling this all the time was something I just couldn&#x27;t tolerate :(  I wish I could though because I loved the moisturizing ability of this cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this for use in the physical therapy clinic that I work in. We use Palmer&#x27;s for soft tissue work, scar mobilizations and scar therapy. The texture and smoothness is perfect for all of these applications and we recommend  Palmer&#x27;s for patient use once their scars have healed to keep them moisturized.</li>
            <li> Received item promptly and as described.</li>
            <li> My knee replacement surgeon suggested this product and it&#x27;s been terrific. My scar is getting lighter and lighter. It&#x27;s a great way to massage my knee, too. I use it for a hand and foot cream, too. It&#x27;s not at all oily and absorbs quickly. The light aroma of chocolate is delightful. I wish it came with suggestions for use. They aren&#x27;t anywhere, even on the Internet. I guess everyone is expected to know how to use it. The price on Amazon was excellent.</li>
            <li> I use this product primarily on my legs and it keeps them very soft and hydrated.  I like the feel of the cocoa butter and it does not leave a residue on my skin.</li>
            <li> great PRODUCT-THE BEST FOR MY SKIN,&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS A GREAT PRICE-CAN&#x27;T BEAT IT&lt;br /&gt;LASTS FOREVER.  I AM GOING TO BUY MORE.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical before I bought the product. I had read at multiple places about the benefits of cocoa butter for getting rid of stretch marks, deep moisturization etc.. but lets face it.. many products promise the same. So I went for it anyways. I have been using the product for almost a month now and I thought it would now be safe to write a review.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it on stretch marks around my calf and they are not completely gone, but I sure see them fading a little.. and the difference it definitely noticeable. Another thing that I tried was using it on my face on my forehead on a few lines and a few scars on my face, and they reduced/blended in like 2 days :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S: the cocoa butter is oily, so I would definitely suggest using it overnight instead of during the day especially if you are planning to apply it on your face.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and have been using it for years. It was delivered and the packaging was great. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
            <li> Great for elbows and calves!</li>
            <li> i cant say thing anything bad about cocoa butter. its creamy and light and the price was reasonable. love it</li>
            <li> I love this Palmers product,it lasts for a long time and it is perfect after a shower.Makes my skin glow!</li>
            <li> This tub is huge. There is no way you will use this whole thing during pregnancy unless you use it 3 times a day. So far no stretch marks but I have a ways to go.</li>
            <li> Ok for moisturization just doesn&#x27;t seem the same as many years ago, seems like a different formula. I will stick to shea butter and all the good butters. Company did have state of the art customer service though.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to help smooth out the scar from recent surgery. It&#x27;s probably too soon to tell how effective it&#x27;s going to be for that but it sure feels silky and I love the smell of cocoa butter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the jar, the top layer was hard but just swiping my fingers over it I was able to get enough oils to rub on my skin. Now that it&#x27;s down a bit, it&#x27;s very soft in the jar, so if you&#x27;re concerned about how hard it seems to be, don&#x27;t worry! It&#x27;ll be softer underneath the top layer.</li>
            <li> This is the best to reduce marks and for skin,&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!! And I use it for my kids too, it works!!!</li>
            <li> it is even better than I ever imagined in keeping my lower legs moisturized and it removed all the dry hard skin on my ankles. I wonder why I waited so long to try this and wasted so much money on other creams and lotions. This cream is the best for dryness.</li>
            <li> great stuff, works great</li>
            <li> Have been using for years. Great for keeping dry skin moist all day and for reducing the appearance of scars.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it on minor burns, scars, cuts, scratches, even bug bites. It helps the skin heal faster naturally. The earlier you put it on, the better. The container is huge; it will probably take me at least a year or more to use it all, and I put it on 2x a day.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby to use on his legs. He has very dry skin and nothing seemed to be helping until he tried this. He is on his second jar of it and loves it. Second time I ordered this, they made a mistake and sent me regular cocoa butter.  It is very oily, but this is more like a cream. I had to reorder it to get the right item. It works well for my husband and if he is happy, I am happy.</li>
            <li> This is an effective moisturizer, but it is extremely greasy.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin soft. It also makes my skin feel icky and gross. I can&#x27;t stand whenever lotions do that. Other than that it works.</li>
            <li> I had been getting cracked, dry skin on my soles, and I have had cracking in my finger cuticle for many years.  This stuff is great.  Give it a few applications.  I put it on my feet and rub the leftover on my finger cuticle or anywhere else I have dry skin.  My skin is healthier, and I don&#x27;t have to put it on very frequently to keep it that way (maybe once a week since first getting the cracking under control).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apply after bathing to seal in moisture.</li>
            <li> This is my go to gift for all my pregnant girlfriends.&lt;br /&gt;I used it throughout my pregnancy and it helped moisturize my skin and keep the stretch marks away.&lt;br /&gt;It is not too greasy and smells really good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very oily...  Maybe it&#x27;s the mineral oil.  Still good stuff for dry skin.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so one tub of this goes very far. I notice my skin is softer and the faint stretch marks I did have are not noticeable any longer and I don&#x27;t even feel them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently pregnant and will try and update this after my pregnancy to see how it performed keeping new stretch marks from appearing....</li>
            <li> I love this coco butter formula, recommended for dry skin types only as it is extremely greasy. Smells great and makes my skin shine.</li>
            <li> After using stuff cocoa butter from the store, I finally know what the cream should really be like!! It&#x27;s a perfect jar that I used on my pregnant belly (before and after baby). Worth it!!</li>
            <li> Repeat purchase with an extremely satisfied consumer.</li>
            <li> Let me preface this by saying I have always hated lotion!  I hate the way it feels, I hate putting it on, I hate hate hate it!  I would put up with being dry and itchy before putting on lotion.  But I LOVE Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter.  A co-worker suggested it (to another co-worker) for preventing stretch marks and being wonderful all around.  This was followed up with a discussion about the many benefits of cocoa butter, so I decided to give it a try.  Am I glad that I did!  I love it!  It does not have the greasy feel of lotion. It does take a while to soak in, but the awesome benefits and the delightful smell more than make up for that.  I apply once nightly, and remain moisturized through a shower, a day, swimming, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought cocoa butter dozens of times in the past. Cocoa butter is known for it&#x27;s rich and creamy texture, the ultimate hydration cream (especially when you&#x27;re pregnant belly is getting bigger). This tub was delivered and inside, the cream was hard &amp; solidified. Definitely NOT the cocoa butter you would expect to get. Other things to note, the product was wrapped in a grocery bag (the small ones from the produce aisle), and there was no &amp;#34;safety seal&amp;#34; on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will not order anything from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> Great fit and washes well.</li>
            <li> Bought this to prevent stretch marks and started lathering it on when I was about 16 weeks pregnant. 27 weeks now (But I&#x27;m having twins, so I&#x27;m measuring at 31 weeks), and not a stretch mark to be seen! I know that often stretch marks have to do with genetics, but I am almost SURE this has something to do with it. Absolutely love the smell of this cocoa butter and love the results!</li>
            <li> Initially bought to combat crazy winter dry skin and help sooth my eczema (as mentioned in some reviews). While it does help moisturize cracked heels, I find it a bit greasy and it actually makes my eczema flare out. :(</li>
            <li> Everything was fine, thanks!</li>
            <li> This is nowhere close to being 13.15 ozs.  This is the same size as the 9.5oz.  Exactly the same size.  This is a rip off on price.  Buying the two 7.25 oz sizes is much more profitable.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a large jar of the lotion, but soon realized that this was not the lotion. This is a solid vat of cocoa butter. I tried it as an all-over lotion the first night and my husband said I was glistening! LOL.  Second night I just put it on my feet and stretch marks and used the lotion for the rest of me. That system seems to work well and I can see my stretch marks disappearing. I recommend it, but be aware of what you will be getting!</li>
            <li> I use this daily to hopefully prevent stretch marks. Have been using this roughly for a month, and while I haven&#x27;t seen any improvements on the stretch marks I already had, I&#x27;m at least not seeing any new developing ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant!</li>
            <li> its smells great, keep your body moisturised for the whole day.</li>
            <li> Everyone says I have soft skin and its because of this. It leaves a soft touch on my skin.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s ok, but other than feeling like i&#x27;m actually putting oil on my skin this lotion feels no different that the rest of the lotions out there. I will update this post after i have my baby to give feedback regarding stretch marks but so far just ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I STOPPED USING IT and instead I am now using organic Coconut butter, because my skin kept getting dryer and just leaving it very greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will switch the starts to 1 now.</li>
            <li> You dont need to warm this up, it just melts in your hand, just like butter. Smooth it on. It doesn&#x27;t take much, it goes a long way. I would recommend it for dry skin and keeping your skin soft.</li>
            <li> Love this.  It truly is a miracle cream.</li>
            <li> Bought as a moisturizer (not to fade any markings or anything like that). I have always loved cocoa butter as a nice thick lotion that smells great.</li>
            <li> Use it for Massage Cream.</li>
            <li> Works great on helping with scar recovery after surgery.</li>
            <li> Works well. But I got it and it was hard like a rock. Not sure if that is how it should look. But it works.</li>
            <li> considering what this costs in the drug store - this is a great value!  highly recommend it to any other cocoa butter users!</li>
            <li> This is the product used by my physical therapist for surgical scars.  As soon as the stitches came out she was rubbing this into the healing wound before working the repaired joint. I couldn&#x27;t believe how effective it was in returning the skin to a reasonably normal appearance. I now use it for many skin issues-old scars,cracked heels and finger tips and lips etc.  It is too heavy to use as a face lotion except for specific problems like wind burn. Great product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as nourishing to my hands as I expected.</li>
            <li> I used this cocoa butter through out my pregnancy to help keep my skin moist and hopefully to prevent stretch marks. I was fortunate not to have any stretch marks after my pregnancy. I don&#x27;t think that has as much to do with this product as it does my genetics (my mom never got any from her two pregnancies) but it definitely helped with the dry skin. It also made my belly feel less taunt. It smells nice, the only CON was how greasy it is. I tried to just rub it all over my belly/back/legs/feet until it settled in.</li>
