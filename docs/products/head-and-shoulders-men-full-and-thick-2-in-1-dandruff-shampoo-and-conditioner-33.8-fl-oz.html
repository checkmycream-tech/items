            <li>After using this product his hair looks better than it has for many years.</li>

            <li>H&amp;S. Does what it&#x27;s pretty much supposed to.</li>
            <li>Does the job pretty well, and it leaves a quite refreshing scent unlike the normal ones that make you want to spew after using for a long time.</li>
            <li>I just wish it really help me keep my hair longer.  </li>
            <li>it also saves from over using too much.</li>
            <li>This variant leaves my hair silky and thick, smells good too.</li>

            <li>The Thick and Full 2-in-1 formula smells feminine and reminds me of apples, although it is listed as Men&#x27;s on the label.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used Head and Shoulder products, alternating with other shampoos for as long as I can remember. I switched back and forth with other products every other day to keep my hair feeling fuller and more moisturized. At some points in my life I even used moisturizers, but all that changed with this version of H&amp;S. Now my hair seems as healthy as it could be with just this one shampoo.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son ....he loves the product....and it was a good deal</li>
            <li> While I am pleased with the effectiveness of this product for controlling dandruff, I am not a fan of the scent. My husband and I are long time Head and Shoulders users, and we like many of the different fragrances, especially the Classic Clean. The Thick and Full 2-in-1 formula smells feminine and reminds me of apples, although it is listed as Men&#x27;s on the label. I cancelled the subscription on this and ordered the Classic Clean instead.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with all the items.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s ok. It is not as good as original.</li>
            <li> I have tried several shampoos but keep switching back to Head and Shoulders for my dandruff. This is not as good as Classic Clean but still gets the job done. Scalp feels clean and conditioner makes the hair soft. I find the pump very convenient to use! Will continue to use this.</li>
            <li> Only when I consistently use head and shoulders does my dandruff stay away.  If I switch to any shampoo and use it for more than a week and don&#x27;t use H&amp;S, it snows whenever I move my head.  That&#x27;s happened 3-4 times throughout my time as an adult, and I think &amp;#34;I&#x27;ll try this cheaper shampoo... it should work, right?&amp;#34; Nope. Stuck with H&amp;S, but stay dandruff free.</li>
            <li> We always appreciate the pump on the bottle for ease of use.  Head and Shoulders has been part of our routine since I was a child.  And don&#x27;t forget, it&#x27;s great for cradle cap on babies!  It is the best dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve found.  My husband says he feels it does make his hair feel not so fly away and a bit thicker.</li>
            <li> My hubby loves the pump and has been using the product for years. When a coupon is provided, I purchase it on here.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the scent at all.</li>
            <li> Does the job pretty well, and it leaves a quite refreshing scent unlike the normal ones that make you want to spew after using for a long time.</li>
            <li> My husband has thin hair.  After using this product his hair looks better than it has for many years.</li>
            <li> Pump top is a nice touch</li>
            <li> I have been using Head and Shoulders Shampoo for over 20 years now. It has made my hair dandruff free and smooth. This variant leaves my hair silky and thick, smells good too. I will still continue using it for as long as I still have hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very nice, - just like any H &amp; S shampoos. We always use H &amp; S in my family. For some reason, my hair doesn&#x27;t always agree with other shampoos, - even those that are priced higher than this brand.</li>
            <li> I have used Head and Shoulders for a long time and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I opened the box this came in I found the pump for the shampoo broken into many pieces. There were only three air-cushions in the box and one of them was busted. I have never been impressed by how Amazon packs their products for shipping, but this time, it was totally without effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also came in three business days when I used two-day shipping, though that is on UPS, I believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got my replacement in two days and this time it came undamaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a few months now I have to say, I really  like the Head and Shoulders \\&quot;Classic Clean\\&quot; MUCH more tan This one. I never had dandruff with Classic Clean, but I still do with this stuff.</li>
            <li> The pump bottle is convenient and mess free.</li>
            <li> Leaked in bag that it was in</li>

            <li> The shampoo was open when we got it. It leaked everywhere l.</li>
            <li> works well on my hair</li>
            <li> One of my favorite shampoos. I like how it suds and how it washes off. To each their own preferences, but this is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Hard to avoid when I shower even with my eyes closed this shampoo still burns</li>
            <li> THE AROMA IS A BIT STRONG, BUT I AM SATISFIED WITH THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Its shampoo. By H&amp;S. Does what it&#x27;s pretty much supposed to.</li>
