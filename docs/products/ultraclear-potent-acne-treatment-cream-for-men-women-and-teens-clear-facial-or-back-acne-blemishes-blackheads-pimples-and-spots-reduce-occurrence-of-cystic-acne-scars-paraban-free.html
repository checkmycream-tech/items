            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>So happy!!</li>
            <li>ingredients are not the best in the world, but this cream is not the one I&#x27;ll use for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>Something beautiful and wonderful because Amazon quality and originality code</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good acne product.</li>
            <li>really amazing and effective to combat this skin problem.</li>
            <li>I just cannot stop thanking my friend for this and would recommend this amazing cream to all my pals who are suffering from acne.</li>
            <li>Her mother insisted she keep going to the dermatologist and taking $300 a tube cream that doesn&#x27;t work any better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to ask for more.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would work better, but no so.</li>
            <li>and the smell is strong .</li>
            <li>My shipment came in early, which was nice..</li>
            <li>My acne is not bad, just some blemishes, so I&#x27;ll use the cream just on the blemishes.</li>
            <li>Not for the weak heart - but its just as great as prescription drugs and for a fraction of the price !</li>
            <li>I payed $20 for this and it would have been nice to get something that actually was useful.</li>
            <li>Right before I started using UltraClear&#x27;s acne cream another skin treatment product had made me break out.</li>
            <li>I thought the first jar was too soon to comment on</li>
            <li>Will definitely be ordering more, and recommending it to friends.</li>
            <li>The first night I used this cream the next morning my skin felt and looked better.</li>
            <li>And, now after using it for a month, my skin is clean and clear.</li>
            <li>With Extreme UltraClear I finally saw great results.</li>
            <li>This claimed to be paraben free but the product sent has several kinds of parabens, despite the plastic cover that says &amp;#34;now paraben free!&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>it was so tiny it fit in the palm of my hand, which was dissapointing.</li>
            <li>Been using it for about a week now and haven&#x27;t noticed much change in my facial spot or blemishes</li>
            <li>My break outs always last for a long time and don&#x27;t go away for about a month, but only after a few days I saw great results with Ultraclear Extreme!</li>
            <li>I was fed up of looking at the acne on my face and was finding ways to get back my clear and shinning skin.</li>
            <li>So, when a friend suggested me to try Ultraclear Extreme, I readily agreed.</li>

            <li> When you first put it on it has a slight smell to it (not stink) but it only last for a  few minutes.</li>
            <li> Too bad, it would have been nice.</li>
            <li> I break out less since I have been using it with other new products that I bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The product says on the label that it was extra strength formula, not a chance it is not really any different between any other product on the market and their formula.</li>
            <li> Most expensive trash I ever bought!</li>
            <li> Just a big waste of money.</li>
            <li> Still had a little breakouts here and there.</li>
            <li> waste of $$</li>
            <li> ultra waste!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve often tried other acne treatments after I got break outs, but they either make it worse or didn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
            <li> It felt thick and unnatural and it contained parabens</li>
            <li> She has really bad acne especially that time of the month.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just the bill payer (walking wallet) in this game</li>
            <li> I think it may have broken me out.</li>
            <li> but it stinks a lot.</li>
            <li> Made acne worse if anything.. Highly disappointed!</li>
            <li> However, the product was disgusting.</li>
            <li> worst acne cream ever.i tried using it.</li>
            <li> Really awful.</li>
            <li> It had a horrible odor.</li>

            <li> This worked for my daughter. BUUUT!!!! Her mother insisted she keep going to the dermatologist and taking $300 a tube cream that doesn&#x27;t work any better. I&#x27;m just the bill payer (walking wallet) in this game so I play my role.</li>
            <li> This claimed to be paraben free but the product sent has several kinds of parabens, despite the plastic cover that says &amp;#34;now paraben free!&amp;#34;. The ingredients listed on the jar are completely different from those listed in the item description. Will try to return.</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a week now and haven&#x27;t noticed much change in my facial spot or blemishes</li>
            <li> My shipment came in early, which was nice.. However, the product was disgusting. It is separated into what I can only describe as a watery substance and some rocky stuff on the bottom. It is the color of vomit, and smells like it too. I payed $20 for this and it would have been nice to get something that actually was useful. Most expensive trash I ever bought!</li>
            <li> I break out less since I have been using it with other new products that I bought on Amazon. It&#x27;s a good acne product. I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> The product says on the label that it was extra strength formula, not a chance it is not really any different between any other product on the market and their formula.</li>
            <li> I wish I could rate it (No Stars) but I can&#x27;t. When I got the jar it was so tiny it fit in the palm of my hand, which was dissapointing. I used it for about 3 weeks until it ran out and my skin was the same. Still had a little breakouts here and there. Just a big waste of money. But hey everyone&#x27;s skin is different maybe it&#x27;ll work for you. But I wouldn&#x27;t risk it. Oh yeah and the smell is strong .</li>
            <li> I thought the first jar was too soon to comment on so I bought a second jar. Bottom line is the product did not meet my expectation</li>
            <li> Not for the weak heart - but its just as great as prescription drugs and for a fraction of the price !</li>
            <li> ultra waste! worst acne cream ever.i tried using it. for a month,absolutely does not work. waste of $$</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage son who has tons of pimples. They have gone away.  I just ordered another jar</li>
            <li> Excellent product! So happy!!</li>
            <li> My acne is not bad, just some blemishes, so I&#x27;ll use the cream just on the blemishes. I just received the cream and put it on the blemishes. I don&#x27;t know if it will work but it stinks a lot. Really awful. If it will work I&#x27;ll change the review that, now, is only based on the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are not the best in the world, but this cream is not the one I&#x27;ll use for the rest of my life. I prefer Clinique, Lierac, La Roche Posay and similar. And parabens are almost everywhere, so let&#x27;s give it a try.</li>
            <li> in my house we had tried various creams but this finally helped clarify the stains caused by acne anywhere on the body. I recommend it widely.&lt;br /&gt;most stains and lesions caused by acne disappeared with daily use, applying it in als affected areas. really amazing and effective to combat this skin problem. I&#x27;m about to ask for more.</li>
            <li> Right before I started using UltraClear&#x27;s acne cream another skin treatment product had made me break out. My break outs always last for a long time and don&#x27;t go away for about a month, but only after a few days I saw great results with Ultraclear Extreme! I&#x27;ve often tried other acne treatments after I got break outs, but they either make it worse or didn&#x27;t do anything. With Extreme UltraClear I finally saw great results. Will definitely be ordering more, and recommending it to friends.</li>
            <li> I was fed up of looking at the acne on my face and was finding ways to get back my clear and shinning skin. So, when a friend suggested me to try Ultraclear Extreme, I readily agreed. Believe it or not, after applying the cream for a couple of days, I could notice a big difference in my skin. And, now after using it for a month, my skin is clean and clear. I just cannot stop thanking my friend for this and would recommend this amazing cream to all my pals who are suffering from acne.</li>
            <li> No results. Made acne worse if anything.. Highly disappointed!</li>
            <li> Something beautiful and wonderful because Amazon quality and originality code</li>
            <li> She has really bad acne especially that time of the month.  Nothing we have tried has worked well.  I was hoping this would work better, but no so.</li>
            <li> My son, my daughter and I tried this cream and it did not help our acne.  Too bad, it would have been nice.</li>
            <li> I gave this a try. It had a horrible odor. I think it may have broken me out. It felt thick and unnatural and it contained parabens (though I&#x27;ve been reading the formula may have changed and no longer contains parabens). Mine did.</li>
            <li> The first night I used this cream the next morning my skin felt and looked better. When you first put it on it has a slight smell to it (not stink) but it only last for a  few minutes.</li>
