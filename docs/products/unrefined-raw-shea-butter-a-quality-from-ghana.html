            <li>so this was a much better deal.</li>
            <li>It is meant more of an ingredient to add to homemade lotions</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m gonna try this out &amp;&amp;&amp; hopefully it&#x27;s as AWESOME as the Yellow &amp;#34;/</li>
            <li>and they love it too.</li>
            <li>It melted well for my hand and foot balm that my coworkers are also in love with.  </li>

            <li>It does have a strong plant like odor that does not bother me at all</li>
            <li>Came on time, shipping in a USPS bubble style envelope - which caused it to deform a bit from the heat and handing of shipment - but otherwise it arrive in fine condition.</li>
            <li>Love it arrived quickly with no problems</li>
            <li>I am in love with it, I got so much bang for my buck!!</li>
            <li>It is so authentic, so fresh, so earthy..</li>
            <li>Super easy to refine.  </li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased.. will order more..</li>
            <li>so it arrives in a more &#x27;normal&#x27; shape :)</li>
            <li>This company&#x27;s website tells you how to clean and use it, which I was thankful for.</li>
            <li>Is that right?!</li>
            <li>The smell is very smoky and nutty as most reviewers have stated.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the 3.2lbs &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>very buttery and smooth and easy to apply to the skin.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I finally found a manufacture that makes me feel at home :)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many lotions I have bought that claim Shea Butter as the main ingredient</li>
            <li>It was corrected, product arrived quickly without additional postage.</li>
            <li>and I started using it right away.</li>
            <li>It was delivered super fast</li>
            <li>recommend warming in a double boiler then whipping the shea butter to a more manageable consistency.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thank you for offering it to us in personal sizes :)</li>
            <li>It makes my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My skin has not burned in the sun, and my man thinks I am soft, smooth and smell earthy.  </li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s super yellow which is exciting!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this seller To anyone who wants a really good quality shea butter that is natural and unrefined and is not gritty.</li>
            <li>You pretty much get a lifetime</li>
            <li>got it mostly to use for my eczema, stretched earlobes, and scars from surgeries.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know much about shea butter</li>
            <li>the package need more careful.</li>
            <li>She really appreciated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I made scented shea butter for the whole family.</li>
            <li>This is the real deal, people say the smell is unbearable</li>
            <li>I really want  one butter cream for everything.  </li>
            <li>Other shea butter manufactures claim to export from Africa, but this is truly authentic shea butter.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed to make a lotion for my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>It would be great as it is or for melting down and mixing with other oils.</li>
            <li>Very yellowish and soft.</li>
            <li>Not bad but the bag it came in isnt to partical and it didnt smell like other unrefined shea butters i have used before.</li>
            <li>and I used strong scented oil that dominated the raw shea butter smell.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s suppose to be like that it might be rancid, but I did rub it on my hands and it made it soft</li>
            <li>It IS a RAW product, so needs to be refined or at least filtered before use, which is great</li>
            <li>I have not seen much of a difference in my acne scars but as long as it makes my skin soft</li>
            <li>Same quality of what I normally order, but for less.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It came in chunks in a bag with one large chunk and several smaller ones.</li>
            <li>Though it is raw and unfiltered the one I received was so clean</li>
            <li>Warning: Do not wet the Shea Butter because mold will grow.</li>
            <li>It is not a lovely perfume smell but it is not bad.</li>

            <li> It is not a lovely perfume smell but it is not bad.</li>
            <li> swear by shea butter and buying unrefined Raw bulk straight from Ghana</li>
            <li> But since there was so much of it, I melted some down, put it into an empty jar, and gave some to my mom as a birthday gift.</li>
            <li> The skin has begun to clear dark patches and smoothness is returning.</li>
            <li> It was definitely less expensive than most places, too.</li>
            <li> My only issue is with the I packaging,  other than that I would order again.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day.</li>
            <li> One part of it is yellow with white spots and another is GREEN?!?</li>
            <li> I ordered three pounds of this shea butter because the shea butter lotion I usually get is only 14 ounces and costs about the same</li>
            <li> I will order the 10 pound of black soap and unrefined shea in the future.</li>
            <li> Just as expected and</li>
            <li> but wasnt what i expected</li>
            <li> It came Just as I expected!</li>
            <li> It blend well with the other oils</li>
            <li> , I have not used any other product.  </li>
            <li> Just one day after I spent hours dealing with it (melting it, transferring it to containers, cooling it down, putting it on my skin and in my hair, etc)</li>
            <li> I am really trying to get away from using commercial products that are bad for you.  </li>
            <li> but I did not want to mess with it</li>
            <li> usually mix in coconut and vitamin E and other oils with healing powers.&lt;br /&gt;Shea</li>
            <li> I have given a few people some</li>
            <li> The butter was blended with a hand mixer to make it fluffy and easier to use.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not true!</li>
            <li> .. we wanted a raw product.</li>
            <li> I am Nigerian and this raw shea butter is just like (if not better)</li>
            <li> A lady gave me a small sample of your product.  </li>
            <li> Had a small issue with the weight.</li>
            <li> Not real happy about it.  </li>
            <li> Tired of spending a small fortune on junk from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Quite difficult to gauge when using it in cream.</li>
            <li> So the smell of shea butter gives me bad memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order Ivory :(</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Same quality of what I normally order, but for less.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend warming in a double boiler then whipping the shea butter to a more manageable consistency.&lt;br /&gt;I usually mix in coconut and vitamin E and other oils with healing powers.&lt;br /&gt;Shea butter has helped aid in healing from sunburn and to prevent peeling.&lt;br /&gt;I swear by shea butter and buying unrefined Raw bulk straight from Ghana is BEST.&lt;br /&gt;Although I like the appearance of the yellow, I think I will try the ivory next</li>
            <li> One part of it is yellow with white spots and another is GREEN?!? Is that right?! I don&#x27;t think so, I don&#x27;t know much about shea butter but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s suppose to be like that it might be rancid, but I did rub it on my hands and it made it soft</li>
            <li> Loved it, will be ordering more soon. Used it to make a whipped body butter for Xmas baskets. The ladies in my family are very happy with the quality. I&#x27;m happy knowing it&#x27;s just not a moisturizer,being unrefined, their skin is going to benefit in so many ways.</li>
            <li> good . the package need more careful.</li>
            <li> Great stuff...... good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> this Shay butter is very good quality.this very buttery and smooth and easy to apply to the skin. It would be great as it is or for melting down and mixing with other oils. For the price, this is a very good deal. I would highly recommend this seller To anyone who wants a really good quality shea butter that is natural and unrefined and is not gritty.</li>
            <li> Super easy to refine.  Love the quality of this product.  Thank you for offering it to us in personal sizes :)</li>
            <li> It came Just as I expected! I would buy  it again. I Have used this before. making creams for family.</li>
            <li> This Shea butter makes me itch</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product  to work with a made body butter and my brother made shaving cream with it and they both turned out great I will be buying this again</li>
            <li> I really liked this stuff. So much of it for only a few dollars. You pretty much get a lifetime supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it mostly to use for my eczema, stretched earlobes, and scars from surgeries. But since there was so much of it, I melted some down, put it into an empty jar, and gave some to my mom as a birthday gift. She really appreciated it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I had to stop using it after a while for personal reasons. Just one day after I spent hours dealing with it (melting it, transferring it to containers, cooling it down, putting it on my skin and in my hair, etc) my parents kicked me out of the house. So the smell of shea butter gives me bad memories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this butter I use it every day...for my hair and skin...</li>
            <li> I purchased this to split with my friends, it did arrive in chunks and not a brick like it was pictured. However that probably happened in shipping. It worked perfectly for us though because I was going to have to break it up anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works just like I was hoping, it is great quality and my skin is so soft and silky!! I would purchase again, and will!</li>
            <li> I ordered three pounds of this shea butter because the shea butter lotion I usually get is only 14 ounces and costs about the same so this was a much better deal. Though it is raw and unfiltered the one I received was so clean I didn&#x27;t want to risk diminishing the wonderful properties of it by doing anything to it. The smell is very smoky and nutty as most reviewers have stated. It is not a lovely perfume smell but it is not bad. I kind of like it. It smells kind of like toasted nuts. It is meant more of an ingredient to add to homemade lotions but I did not want to mess with it so I use it as is. It is quite oily that way so I put it on in the shower and let the water wash away the excess greasiness. It makes my skin so soft and smooth. I have not seen much of a difference in my acne scars but as long as it makes my skin soft I&#x27;m happy</li>
            <li> It is so authentic, so fresh, so earthy..I am in love with it, I got so much bang for my buck!! AND it&#x27;s super yellow which is exciting!</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter was just as described.  It blend well with the other oils and I used strong scented oil that dominated the raw shea butter smell. I made scented shea butter for the whole family. My only issue is with the I packaging,  other than that I would order again.</li>
            <li> This shea butter was an excellent choice for me, as I am new to making my own body butter.  I have made jars of body butter for various people.  I am really trying to get away from using commercial products that are bad for you.  This also has served as hair creame for me as well.</li>
            <li> The price of this pack cannot be beat and even if you do have to clean it a bit, it is still a great purchase. Gracias</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use it again for shaving--too globby.</li>
            <li> Not bad but the bag it came in isnt to partical and it didnt smell like other unrefined shea butters i have used before. Wont purchase from this seller.</li>
            <li> Love it arrived quickly with no problems</li>
            <li> RICH AND CREAMY, my wife said it was the best shea butter we ever brought.</li>
            <li> Came on time, shipping in a USPS bubble style envelope - which caused it to deform a bit from the heat and handing of shipment - but otherwise it arrive in fine condition. It IS a RAW product, so needs to be refined or at least filtered before use, which is great.. we wanted a raw product. Overall, very pleased.. will order more.. next time, probably the box so it arrives in a more &#x27;normal&#x27; shape :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t order Ivory :( well ... I&#x27;m gonna try this out &amp;&amp;&amp; hopefully it&#x27;s as AWESOME as the Yellow &amp;#34;/ Thanks for the 3.2lbs &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I am Nigerian and this raw shea butter is just like (if not better) then the ones I purchase from the Nigerian markets when I travel. It&#x27;s super creamy and goes on very easily. Other shea butter manufactures claim to export from Africa, but this is truly authentic shea butter. I am so glad I finally found a manufacture that makes me feel at home :)</li>
            <li> Just as expected and I know now that I will definitely be sticking to the &amp;#34;yellow&amp;#34; shea butter. I have given a few people some and they love it too. Great beneficial properties, will order more!</li>
            <li> Great buy but wasnt what i expected</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough if this. I use it every single day. Have recommended it to several of my friends and will continue to endorse it.</li>
            <li> Very yellowish and soft. Quite difficult to gauge when using it in cream.</li>
            <li> Product was good however the smell is overbearing.</li>
            <li> For all you people with ingrown hairs, THIS IS THE SOLUTION! I can&#x27;t tell you how many lotions I have bought that claim Shea Butter as the main ingredient, it&#x27;s not true! I bought this unrefined shea butter hoping it would hydrate my skin enough to vanish those ingrown hairs and keratin bump build ups, I love it! This is the real deal, people say the smell is unbearable but I personally don&#x27;t mind the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product ,  because the quality is very good! I found  it on line &amp; read all the reviews. It is really the best !</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed to make a lotion for my sensitive skin! It was definitely less expensive than most places, too.</li>
            <li> I bought 3lbs of this Shea Butter and LOVE IT! It came in chunks in a bag with one large chunk and several smaller ones. I have been using this for everything. It is smooth, feels great on the skin, not grainy at all and I haven&#x27;t seen any impurities. It was delivered super fast and I started using it right away. It melted well for my hand and foot balm that my coworkers are also in love with.  It does have a strong plant like odor that does not bother me at all and if I added more grapefruit oil it probably wouldn&#x27;t even be noticed.</li>
            <li> The Shea Butter arrived promptly and I received a lot for the price I paid. This company&#x27;s website tells you how to clean and use it, which I was thankful for. The butter was blended with a hand mixer to make it fluffy and easier to use. I use it to seal my ends or as a Pre-Poo. Warning: Do not wet the Shea Butter because mold will grow.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this product.  I had been using the junk shea products at the beauty supply stores off and on for years.  Not real happy about it.  Just did not know any better.  I have vitiligo and have to use sunblock.  If I don&#x27;t my skin will burn immediately from sun exposure.  Then all the different lotions, day creams, night creams, foot creams, hair oils, eye creams, skin brighteners. toners, peels etc.  I have just retired, at 55, and need one product for everything.  Tired of spending a small fortune on junk from Macy&#x27;s. A lady gave me a small sample of your product.  I am very pleased.  My skin has not burned in the sun, and my man thinks I am soft, smooth and smell earthy.  Great foot massages and well  Enough said about that.  Love the results of this product from head to toe.  I have read about different ways of blending the shea butter to create body butter with different oils  or butters.  I am open to any and all suggestions that have worked for others.  I really want  one butter cream for everything.  I have read many list of uses for shea butter-please help me out.  One thing I can attest to, I have not used any other product.  Is there a shampoo mixture that I could make?    UPDATE: The customer service is wonderful.  Had a small issue with the weight. I think the decimal point was the issue. It was corrected, product arrived quickly without additional postage. I will order the 10 pound of black soap and unrefined shea in the future. The products have worked for my daughters&#x27; eczema-a 20 year problem.  The skin has begun to clear dark patches and smoothness is returning.</li>
