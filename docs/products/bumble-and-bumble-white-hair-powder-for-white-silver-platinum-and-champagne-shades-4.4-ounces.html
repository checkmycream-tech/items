    <ol>
            <li>and she&#x27;s very happy with the result</li>
            <li>and I have found this to be the best brand and value on the market.  </li>
            <li>It is great as a volumizer, texturizer, or de-greaser when your hair gets oily after a couple days.  </li>
            <li>this is a great trick for 2 reasons...</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>and this is a great &amp;#34;fill-in&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>In addition to freshening hair, it adds great volume.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff !!</li>
            <li>For the price, this was not as good as the TIGI brand.  </li>
            <li>Great for good looks and bright hair on a special occasion.</li>
            <li>Also great on just washed hair, but you&#x27;ll get much greater volume, but I actually think it works best for me, if I wait a day then use this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and much cheaper than extensions!!</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for all women with fine and gentle hair.</li>
            <li>I purchase many items from Amazon</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed with this that the more days I go the fuller my hair gets.</li>
            <li>(gotta love &#x27;em).</li>
            <li>Love it, but spray it at the recommended distance from hair or it will clump.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is hair magic in a can.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Can easily add 2-3 days to a salon blow-out.  </li>
            <li>I have dark blond and silver hair, and this color blends perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I have lots of fine hair.</li>
            <li>The original b&amp;b spray comes in a plastic cylinder with some paper info and all I got was a bottle with already stains on the nozzle.</li>
            <li>As an 80 year old with thinning hair on top, this product makes you look like you have a mop of hair!  </li>
            <li>then it&#x27;s not a bad product as it does voluminize and absorb the scalp oil</li>
            <li>Gives a nice matte effect because of the white.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s kind of jarring when you&#x27;re styling your hair and your hands come back brown, so just be mindful</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried severla other hair powders and nothing works as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>Not so easy to use with shorter hair or near the hair line.  </li>
            <li>The finish is kind of powdery, dry and matte.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean my hair but uses the natural oils to my benefit.</li>
            <li>NO TERRIBLE SCENT either, which is a huge bonus compared to some of the products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>I use this little guy: take the fine end of my teasing brush (or a fine tooth come handle end works).</li>
            <li>so the White powder is fine for my color.</li>
            <li>Use it little by little, but works great!</li>
            <li>I have light blonde hair</li>
            <li>but I will be more careful if an item cannot be returned or refunded.</li>
            <li>1-gives roots so much volume, 2-prevents</li>
            <li>It works so well and really does what I need it to: volume and lift.</li>
            <li>My hair is really thinning as I get older</li>
            <li>I love this product but the price is a little high, so I go for the drug store brands now.  </li>
            <li>This product which is a great product usually lasts for 3-4 months however the item I received from Amazon lasted less than 3 weeks thus costing over $12 week--a zip off.  </li>
            <li>otherwise I think there are other similar products on the market which offer more economy.</li>
            <li>I find this product and the B&amp;B hair spray and Surf spray are the key products that get me consistent results.</li>
            <li>Its pretty expensive, so its kind of a gamble on the color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this product at a Sephora store before and the container always seems to be half full, this purchase met all expectations.  </li>
            <li>I love a bed head look and do as little to actually fix my hair as possible.</li>
            <li>I use to have to wash my daily to control the greese and thanks to Bumble and Bumble white hair powder</li>
            <li>I use that to separate my hair starting about 2 inches from my ear, separating the hair, front to back, in 1-2 inch sections and spray a quick line of the white in the separation and go on repeating to the other side, about 2 inches from my ear.</li>
            <li>(for reference I am a dirty blonde with light highlights and both the white and the blondish powder blend really well for me).</li>

            <li> I have used all sorts of different dry shampoos and hair powders, and I always come back to B&amp;b.</li>
            <li> I use it as a dry shampoo essentially.</li>
            <li> Not really for daily use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive but worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Dry shampoo now, is what hair spray was for the 80s, and I am an addict.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dry shampoo/volumizer for years</li>
            <li> I either flip my head or not, and will either: &#x27;comb&#x27; my fingers through my hair and rest on the crown and shake them to blend the white and work it through a  little or shake a lot, depending on what my hair is doing and what look I&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> I like my hair to have some &#x27;grit&#x27; in the texture and use other products to enhance that (Surf Spray).   </li>
            <li> Try other colors if you have dark hair.</li>

            <li> If I had no other styling product in my cabinet, I would at least have this!  </li>
            <li> I let it dry about 5 minutes, usually finish up mascara or something.</li>
            <li> It was expensive and didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and can&#x27;t go one day without it.</li>
            <li> One bottle usually lasts for  a little over half a year.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this products from&lt;br /&gt;Salons at least 3 other times.  </li>
            <li> It deserves 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;However, the seller Sleekhair is pretty bad, I think they sent me a used one from a hairdresser&#x27;s station.</li>
            <li> Very expensive, but a high quality product.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say I WILL purchase this product again but NOT from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product at a Sephora store before and the container always seems to be half full, this purchase met all expectations.  As an 80 year old with thinning hair on top, this product makes you look like you have a mop of hair!  It&#x27;s great and much cheaper than extensions!!</li>
            <li> My wife uses this and she&#x27;s very happy with the result</li>
            <li> Dry shampoo now, is what hair spray was for the 80s, and I am an addict.  I have light blonde hair and I have found this to be the best brand and value on the market.  It is great as a volumizer, texturizer, or de-greaser when your hair gets oily after a couple days.  If I had no other styling product in my cabinet, I would at least have this!  Gives a nice matte effect because of the white.  Try other colors if you have dark hair.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;white\\&quot; hair powder was REALLY white.  It ways its for blondes but there is no way.  They need to have a powder for BLONDES.  Its pretty expensive, so its kind of a gamble on the color.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product from Amazon.com--I have purchased this products from&lt;br /&gt;Salons at least 3 other times.  This product which is a great product usually lasts for 3-4 months however the item I received from Amazon lasted less than 3 weeks thus costing over $12 week--a zip off.  I contacted the Manufacturer Bumble and Bumble and they said that Amazon was not authorized to sell Bumble and Bumble products, if I had purchased at an authorized salon (for the same price) they would replace the product.  There is no way to get a refund or replacement from Amazon.  Needless to say I WILL purchase this product again but NOT from&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.  I purchase many items from Amazon but I will be more careful if an item cannot be returned or refunded.</li>
            <li> For the price, this was not as good as the TIGI brand.  It was expensive and didn&#x27;t last long. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is $35 and only lasted for three applications!  I thought I must&#x27;ve bought a defective can but not so since others have had the identical experience.  If you don&#x27;t mind spending an average $10 per use then it&#x27;s not a bad product as it does voluminize and absorb the scalp oil otherwise I think there are other similar products on the market which offer more economy.</li>
            <li> Not so easy to use with shorter hair or near the hair line.  Very expensive, but a high quality product.  The finish is kind of powdery, dry and matte.</li>
            <li> It does even out the color of white or silver hair, especially when the sun has yellowed parts of the hair. Easy to use but it will be flakey if you over apply. Great for good looks and bright hair on a special occasion. Not really for daily use.</li>
            <li> I use to have to wash my daily to control the greese and thanks to Bumble and Bumble white hair powder i can go 4-5 days and looks like it did the day i washed it.  I&#x27;ve tried severla other hair powders and nothing works as good as this one.  My hair dresser suggested to use it on roots prior to drying/styling hair..this is a great trick for 2 reasons...1-gives roots so much volume, 2-prevents it from getting oliy quicker.  I can&#x27;t speak for the darker colors but for me being blond and using the white, it lightens my roots too.  It&#x27;s expensive but worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this dry shampoo/volumizer for years and it&#x27;s great. One bottle usually lasts for  a little over half a year. It deserves 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;However, the seller Sleekhair is pretty bad, I think they sent me a used one from a hairdresser&#x27;s station. The original b&amp;b spray comes in a plastic cylinder with some paper info and all I got was a bottle with already stains on the nozzle.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff !! It works so well and really does what I need it to: volume and lift. I use it as a dry shampoo essentially. It doesn&#x27;t clean my hair but uses the natural oils to my benefit. I&#x27;ve noticed with this that the more days I go the fuller my hair gets. I have lots of fine hair. And I&#x27;m always looking how to get lots of volume. I have shoulder length hair and what my friends describe as &#x27;rock and roll&#x27; hair. ;) (gotta love &#x27;em). I love a bed head look and do as little to actually fix my hair as possible. This works so well for my way of doing things.   Way I use this little guy: take the fine end of my teasing brush (or a fine tooth come handle end works). I use that to separate my hair starting about 2 inches from my ear, separating the hair, front to back, in 1-2 inch sections and spray a quick line of the white in the separation and go on repeating to the other side, about 2 inches from my ear. Goal: to get spray at the root and evenly distributed around my head. I do something similar in the back, going horizontally. I let it dry about 5 minutes, usually finish up mascara or something. I either flip my head or not, and will either: &#x27;comb&#x27; my fingers through my hair and rest on the crown and shake them to blend the white and work it through a  little or shake a lot, depending on what my hair is doing and what look I&#x27;m going for. I get hair with volume and texture. Also great on just washed hair, but you&#x27;ll get much greater volume, but I actually think it works best for me, if I wait a day then use this.  I like my hair to have some &#x27;grit&#x27; in the texture and use other products to enhance that (Surf Spray).   I find this product and the B&amp;B hair spray and Surf spray are the key products that get me consistent results. This after 10+years of trying everything in a salon, I&#x27;ve found my &#x27;must&#x27; have hair products if on a deserted island.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for all women with fine and gentle hair. I use it everyday and can&#x27;t go one day without it.</li>
            <li> I love this product but the price is a little high, so I go for the drug store brands now.  I am a lighter blonde so the White powder is fine for my color.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff. I have used all sorts of different dry shampoos and hair powders, and I always come back to B&amp;b. I use the blondish when I am trying to extend my between-wash days, and the white when I am just looking for texture. The blondish leaves a film and it&#x27;s kind of jarring when you&#x27;re styling your hair and your hands come back brown, so just be mindful (for reference I am a dirty blonde with light highlights and both the white and the blondish powder blend really well for me). NO TERRIBLE SCENT either, which is a huge bonus compared to some of the products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Love it, but spray it at the recommended distance from hair or it will clump.  Use it little by little, but works great!</li>
            <li> I use this all the time.  My hair is really thinning as I get older and this is a great &amp;#34;fill-in&amp;#34; product.  Can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t cover. It does give me an extra to wash my hair though!</li>
            <li> This stuff is hair magic in a can.  In addition to freshening hair, it adds great volume.  I have dark blond and silver hair, and this color blends perfectly.  Can easily add 2-3 days to a salon blow-out.  Expensive, but worth it.</li>
