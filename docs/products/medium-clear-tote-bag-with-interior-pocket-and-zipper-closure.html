            <li> I LOVE THIS BAG</li>
            <li> Okay for the price.</li>
            <li> I have noticed, though, that after 5 months of use, it&#x27;s wearing more than anticipated.</li>
            <li> I love the size of this one.  </li>
            <li> The price was good and it was exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My first impression was good.</li>

            <li> This is the perfect size, is see through, durable and zips closed.</li>

            <li> It folds up easily</li>
            <li> Very sturdy with plenty of room inside and the clear zipper pocket attached inside was an excellent place to put my name badge for work to keep it protected without having to remove it each time I entered work</li>

            <li> Excellent choice for the money spent!!</li>

            <li> I work retail and this is the best clear bag that I have found so far.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t appear to be the bag that was shipped to me, it wouldn&#x27;t fit a magazine e let alone</li>

            <li> being able to see my makeup makes it so much easier.</li>
            <li> The plastic is not bad and does not have the plastic odor.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li> I received my purse quickly and it was just like it was shown.</li>
            <li> The size is great, not too big and the long handle makes it comfortable to carry!</li>
            <li> It is a little soft or flexible plastic which is perfect.</li>
            <li> This tote fits the criteria required for where I work and the fact that it is clear makes it even more desirable.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice because I don&#x27;t lose track of things as I sometimes do in a regular tote.  </li>
            <li> Iuse a clear bag for work, so this bag really came in handy.</li>
            <li> Useful for my needs.</li>
            <li> The bag is just the right size for our needs.</li>
            <li> Just the right size I needed for work</li>
            <li> Durable, the size is just right.</li>
            <li> Just the right size and quality for the price.if you are in retail, this will work for you.</li>
            <li> I was right in style.</li>
            <li> I brought it for work everyone love it and want to order one not to big just the right size</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what I needed in it&#x27;s size, zippered closure and colour.</li>
            <li> item is exactly as it appears on the picture.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> This item was exactly what I needed for work.</li>
            <li> The bag is ok but the plastic is starting to rip</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> so I have to use the second one I purchased while I look for a better quality bag</li>
            <li> It holds everything I need for work and more and can hold several pounds of weight.</li>
            <li> This will be my first return to Amazon.</li>
            <li> Next time I will purchase something thats lists exactly what it is!!!</li>
            <li> so my nice purse doesn&#x27;t get wet!</li>
            <li> It will easily hold a 10\\&quot; tablet and several magazines.</li>
            <li> Love the size not to small straps are comfortable to carry and can see what I&amp;#34;m carrying in the see through bag</li>
            <li> Too large.</li>

            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> They were inexpensive and look to be be very durable.</li>
            <li> It is made very well.</li>
            <li> fast shipping</li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and she loves the size.  </li>
            <li> BECAUSE WE WORK IN A VERY SECURED AREA.</li>
            <li> I can fit a water bottle plus snacks if needed along with everything else a female normally carries.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend  because they are very durable.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it were a tad bit larger, but the product is true to size.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my roomate who works at a high security facility.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I loaded it up too much, but we must have clear and this works.</li>
            <li> I WANTED THIS BAG, AND NORMALLY WHEN YOU BUY ONLINE THE PRODUCT, IT ARRIVES AND IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE</li>
            <li> nice cloth straps and zipper works well plus a small pocket inside for keys!</li>
            <li> My bag was torned and I was looking for new</li>
            <li> (Amazon)graciously ate the charges to overnight a new tote to me.  </li>
            <li> Not super strong, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t carry a bag like this normally, but the new NFL rule requires it.&lt;br /&gt;Since everyone else also had a clear bag--</li>
            <li> I needed a clear bag for work!</li>
            <li> so my employer can see exactly what is in my bag, instead of having to open my bag at the end of my shift for inspection.</li>
            <li> I love the inside pocket, I use my bag for work don&#x27;t need to remove my work badge to get past security because they can see it.</li>
            <li> I needed it for work to uphold a new clear bag policy for all employees and it fulfills the requirement.  </li>
            <li> I needed this because of the new NFL regulations requiring a clear bag taken into the stadiums.  </li>
            <li> Opened my new clear bag today.</li>
            <li> On both sides of the clear plastic, about an inch below the black binding at the top, the plastic has cracked open.</li>
            <li> Large enough...</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not stiff .</li>
            <li> It is large enough to use for an overnight bag if so desired.  </li>
            <li> It seemed well constructed and large enough to hold everything I&#x27;d need.</li>
            <li> I needed something a little bigger and maybe more &amp;#34;sturdy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I will consider buying more ,1 request that barcode sticker that u put on the bag was hard</li>
            <li> I Needed a clear vinyl bag for work</li>
            <li> She works in a place where the bags must be clear.</li>
            <li> Just wish it was made from a heavier grade of clear plastic.</li>
            <li> I needed a clear bag for the location where I do volunteer work.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as I work in a prison and we need to carry clear bags.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my girlfriend who works in retail and is required to use a clear bags when working.</li>
            <li> My company requires us to use clear bags.</li>
            <li> I was given a clear fanny pack, but I needed to carry a book so during my break I had something to read.</li>
            <li> Needed a clear tote bag to carry my preferred hair care products to my hair dresser.  </li>
            <li> Ordered this bag because we have to have a clear bag that security can see what we are binging in and out of the building.  </li>
            <li> We have to have clear bags for work...</li>
            <li> I needed a clear bag for work.  </li>
            <li> FOR AFTER THEY SAW MINE, WE HAVE TO HAVE THE CLEAR BAGS</li>
            <li> My job requires a clear bag.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain too much since it hasn&#x27;t totally fallen apart on me</li>
            <li> very well made,great for my purpose,good size and quality,had other people at work want to purchase.like very much,my friend is buying one.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a sturdy all around bag especially for places that require see through bags for security purposes</li>
            <li> This bag is not very heavy.</li>
            <li> I also ordered the next size up which is so large that I can carry my hangbag in it along with the extra stuff.</li>
            <li> has worked great over the last year, even in cold weather it has not cracked or anything</li>
            <li> We can carry only clear bag.</li>
            <li> We are required to carry all personal items in a clear bag.</li>
            <li> I may look for something different as I need to carry a clear bag at work.</li>
            <li> I actually like this clear plastic bag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike others, who may need it since they work in retail and need to carry their personal items in a clear bag, I bought it&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> Due to that, the bag was very wrinkled.</li>
            <li> It is a little small for what I wanted to use it for but it will be okay.  </li>
            <li> The quality is evident from the thick clear vinyl to the well stitched handles and seams.  </li>
            <li> We have to use clear bags at my job,this bag is sturdy and very long lasting.  </li>
            <li> nice look,sturdy,specious and less expensive.</li>
            <li> I NEED a clear bag for work and this lasted less than a month.</li>
            <li> So when I added the usual--lunch, extra shoes, folding umbrella, etc my old tote was too heavy which I carried in addition to a handbag that carries a woman&#x27;s essentials.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s big enough to hold a magazine and all her other items.  </li>
            <li> (I tend to overstuff my bags, including 1-2 hardcover books), it&#x27;s only JUST developed a hole in the vinyl (and that&#x27;s courtesy of my cat making biscuits with his sharp claws).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pocket, where I dump all of my loose change (amongst other items) has also held up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bag is much smaller than I expected, I wish the demensions were listed...</li>
            <li> and I have not had the bag long.  </li>
            <li> The handles don&#x27;t seem to stand up to the weight over a long period of time.  </li>
            <li> I brought this to a Football game hoping it would pass the new clear bag rules and it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Bag arrived with a \\&quot;impossible to get off\\&quot; bar code right in the middle of the clear plastic.</li>
            <li> Would recommend this bag to anyone looking a small clear bag for what ever use.</li>
            <li> Plastic cracking slightly after only a month.</li>
            <li> I measured a bag I currently use, and this one&#x27;s measurements are about the same, but it is too small.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little bigger, brought this to carry to the beach, guess i will use it instead to go thru airport security and check points at stadium games.</li>
            <li> It looked a little bit bigger in the picture.  </li>
            <li> I would have like just a little bigger, cut it is working well.  </li>
            <li> but I was expecting it to be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I thought it would be, but it works for what I need it for.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I expected, but I made it work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;According to the maker of the bag Amazon shipping adds the bar code for some unknown reason.</li>
            <li> I already have a pink one that  </li>
            <li> I only need to carry a single folder, a wallet, a pair of sunglasses, a make-up bag, and a small umbrella.</li>
            <li> There is a small pocket inside for the little items and the straps are just big enough to sling over her</li>
            <li> Out of my class of 7 people, my bad is the only one to last out of the first 5 months.</li>
            <li> When this bag arrived I was a little surprised with the size being small</li>
            <li> /&gt;Government buildings, and some other places, require you to place your purse and other materials on scanners.  </li>
            <li> Not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li> bottle of water, two baseball caps, a wallet, phone, several small ziploc bags for snacks.</li>
            <li> AND SO DOES THE OTHER PEOPLE I PURCHASED THEM</li>
            <li> It is to small and I can&#x27;t get enough items in it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly NOT worth the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a leather tote bag that was too heavy when it was empty.</li>
            <li> Low quality plastic and very small compared to how it looks on display.</li>
            <li> I use for work and have had less than 6 months and is already falling apart.  </li>
            <li> but some where along the line a sticker was put on that made a mess.</li>
            <li> I like the little zipper compartment.</li>
            <li> A little cheaper made than I had hoped for, but ya get what ya pay for, I guess.</li>
            <li> I use it for my magazines and my kindle and a few other small things.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use this bag everyday in costmetology school and it is stuffed.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought it in august of 2012, and despite heavy use</li>
            <li> Alas, I will be sending it back, because it is too small to hold all my pool gear.</li>
            <li> To small.</li>
            <li> I am not sure I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I carry my keys and pepper spray in the small inside pocket.</li>
            <li> I can put a wallet, thermos of coffee, my lunch and a small makeup bag inside for my workday.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just this one</li>
            <li> Was disappointed how fast this bag broke.</li>
            <li> or if it is just a weak product.  </li>
            <li> The material was flimsy, poor quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I have had this about 10 months now, and it is really starting to go to crap.</li>
            <li> I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this tote at all.</li>
            <li> The bag is $13.99 but the shipping is very expensive for poor quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed I can&#x27;t use it for Football games but will use it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this purchase.</li>

            <li> The material was flimsy, poor quality for the price. It should have been priced lower. I would rather however have better quality.</li>
            <li> Great tote for retail.  We have to use clear bags at my job,this bag is sturdy and very long lasting.  It really carries everything I need and more. Ty I love it.</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what I needed in it&#x27;s size, zippered closure and colour. Although I would have have liked a sturdier plastic, I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Bag arrived with a \\&quot;impossible to get off\\&quot; bar code right in the middle of the clear plastic. At best leaves a smear on the bag.&lt;br /&gt;According to the maker of the bag Amazon shipping adds the bar code for some unknown reason. It is a very nice bag but some where along the line a sticker was put on that made a mess.</li>
            <li> I really like this bag, it&#x27;s sturdy and durable. I needed it for work to uphold a new clear bag policy for all employees and it fulfills the requirement.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it were a tad bit larger, but the product is true to size.</li>
            <li> Great Bag.  This perfectly met my needs for work.  Not a bit of problems.  It is the perfect size.</li>
            <li> I am working for retailer.We can carry only clear bag.My bag was torned and I was looking for new,I visit every store butI couldn&#x27;t find a one.once I visit amazon.And surprise..I found this.Though I replace the order but I was scared that will I get the same which I want or not.But now I am happy this the one I want,nice look,sturdy,specious and less expensive.My co-worker also buy the same.</li>
            <li> item is exactly as it appears on the picture. it is roomy and no-nonesense...good for somebody with lots of stuff to carry around.</li>
            <li> Well made. Handles are perfect for carrying or over the shoulder. Very nice bag for the money. Cute size for most body types.</li>
            <li> Perfect for airline travel.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little bigger, brought this to carry to the beach, guess i will use it instead to go thru airport security and check points at stadium games.</li>
            <li> I Needed a clear vinyl bag for work and I&#x27;m pleased with it. Good quality &amp; size for the price</li>
            <li> Bag is much smaller than I expected, I wish the demensions were listed...Next time I will purchase something thats lists exactly what it is!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for all those stadium and recreational places where they check purses and bags.  No need to fumble in the entranceways.</li>
            <li> I work in a prison. We are required to carry all personal items in a clear bag. This is the perfect size, is see through, durable and zips closed.</li>
            <li> The bag is just the right size for our needs. Bag seems durable, zipper enclosures are good so that items will not fall out of bag.Excellent choice for the money spent!!</li>
            <li> Not as durable as I thought or hoped it would be. Plastic cracking slightly after only a month.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t appear to be the bag that was shipped to me, it wouldn&#x27;t fit a magazine e let alone my shoes and one outfit...</li>
            <li> This is a nice bag, but not for what I wanted to use it for. I needed something a little bigger and maybe more &amp;#34;sturdy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I brought this to a Football game hoping it would pass the new clear bag rules and it didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m disappointed I can&#x27;t use it for Football games but will use it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The tote was purchased for work.  This tote fits the criteria required for where I work and the fact that it is clear makes it even more desirable.</li>
            <li> it is made great, quality, works great. Have to have a see through bag to go through what I call check point charlie, i love the zipper part keeps me  from losing items. Will order again,,</li>
            <li> This bag works perfectly.  Just the right size I needed for work</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom and she loves it. The packing was not that great. Due to that, the bag was very wrinkled. But after some use, it got better.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister. She works in a place where the bags must be clear. The zipped enclosure is a great place for her to store her cell phone. She loved it and said it was just what she needed. Great service from the vendor. I&#x27;d order from this person again.</li>
            <li> I really like this one</li>
            <li> This bag was perfect for me!  The price was good and it was exactly what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Government buildings, and some other places, require you to place your purse and other materials on scanners.  When it comes to my food, water, and vitamins, I don&#x27;t want it radiated any more than it has already been.  If I place these items in this bag, the guards can see it is food products and do not need to radiate it.  This bag was a good size and structed good enough to carry my large bottle of Fiji water as well as vitamins and lunch.  A winner for me!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like the same bag that is pictured. Too large. Width is wider than the length. In the picture, length is longer than the width. I need a smaller bag for work.</li>
            <li> It looked a little bit bigger in the picture.  But it will do. I will be using this for the beach.</li>
            <li> I only use this tote for work so my employer can see exactly what is in my bag, instead of having to open my bag at the end of my shift for inspection. GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I use for work and have had less than 6 months and is already falling apart.  Need something stronger I guess</li>
            <li> Nice bag. Has all the features I was looking for. Just wish it was made from a heavier grade of clear plastic.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for work, and holding up very well. Big enough to hold all personal items plus lunch!</li>
            <li> To small. Picture deceiving. I think maybe you could put a had towel in it. Bought larger bag and like that.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this tote. Item was as described and fast ship. Looks nice and durable. The will have many uses beyond pool and beach. Ladies, with security getting more vigilant a many venues, the is the bag for you to put in you collection.</li>
            <li> I needed a clear bag for the location where I do volunteer work.  I like the size and style of this bag, but the zipper came apart soon after I started using it.</li>
            <li> Large enough...I work for a retail store who requires  a bag like this and it works well....nice cloth straps and zipper works well plus a small pocket inside for keys!</li>
            <li> Good basic tote. I bought got work and it meets that need.  Seems durable enough.  Good value for price. Thanks</li>
            <li> Works well for my needs at a correctional facility. I like the little zipper compartment. Nice medium size. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> This tote bag is okay.  It is a little small for what I wanted to use it for but it will be okay.  The plastic is not bad and does not have the plastic odor.  This bag is nothing to write home about.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Durable, the size is just right. I love the inside pocket, I use my bag for work don&#x27;t need to remove my work badge to get past security because they can see it. Two of my co-workers want to buy one for themselves.</li>
            <li> perfect for what i needed it for.</li>
            <li> I WANTED THIS BAG, AND NORMALLY WHEN YOU BUY ONLINE THE PRODUCT, IT ARRIVES AND IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE ONLINE. THIS PRODUCT IS ACTUALLY WHAT I WANTED.</li>
            <li> I already have a pink one that  I love  dearly. I would highly recommend  because they are very durable. And I don&#x27;t have to dig so deep to find what I am looking for</li>
            <li> I love it! It&#x27;s the perfect size! I needed a clear bag for work! It also allows me to roll up my jacket and keep it in there rather than going to the Locker Room!</li>
            <li> Needed this for work. Just the right size and quality for the price.if you are in retail, this will work for you.</li>
            <li> I brought it for work everyone love it and want to order one not to big just the right size</li>
            <li> got this for work,&lt;br /&gt;good material and perfect smaller size just what i needed! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t carry a bag like this normally, but the new NFL rule requires it.&lt;br /&gt;Since everyone else also had a clear bag-- I was right in style.</li>
            <li> Great bag, is exactly what  I wanted deliver when promised. Love the zipper closure and the pocket that also zips.</li>
            <li> Good bag good price . Fits plenty of stuff and it&#x27;s not stiff . I recommend to others . Good bag</li>
            <li> I use it for my travel toiletries so I wish the bottom of the bag was more rigid, but other than that it&#x27;s a good bag!</li>
            <li> This is a good size tote. I am pleased with the quality of it.  The only problem I found with it is that the handles are sewn so they don&#x27;t go together well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that mine is just a fluke but my plastic blew apart (the only way i can describe it) within 2 months.  I&#x27;ve duct taped it and am still using it but will be going elsewhere next time.</li>
            <li> Got this bag for work just the perfect size for all my amenities. Thank you. I might get another for the football games.</li>
            <li> I work in a secure facility and this is perfect.  The size is great, not too big and the long handle makes it comfortable to carry!</li>
            <li> Great bag, it&#x27;s the 2nd i got!</li>
            <li> Excellent Bag, great for work when required to use see through bags. Roomy enough to carry water, glasses etc.</li>
            <li> The bag is wel-made, and the inner zip pocket is a huge plus. Alas, I will be sending it back, because it is too small to hold all my pool gear. I measured a bag I currently use, and this one&#x27;s measurements are about the same, but it is too small. I have ordered the larger bag.</li>
            <li> After not receiving my tote in the mail (waited for two weeks), I called Customer Service and the representative (Amazon)graciously ate the charges to overnight a new tote to me.  I needed this because of the new NFL regulations requiring a clear bag taken into the stadiums.  Worked like a charm!</li>
            <li> I like the bag. Sturdy construction lite great size. Perfect to what I need it fo r. Work sport bag.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I bought this seller&#x27;s product and realized it was so inferior for the price. It did not even last me up to 6 months and the thread started coming off. Cheap item.  Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This clear plastic bag was excellent!!!  I was very pleased &amp; it held everything I needed to carry. I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a sturdy all around bag especially for places that require see through bags for security purposes</li>
            <li> Good size, needed it for work. Fits all my things nicely. Wouldn&#x27;t use for a night out on the town</li>
            <li> I bought this as I work in a prison and we need to carry clear bags. I have had this about 10 months now, and it is really starting to go to crap. I was impressed with it when I first bought it, but the vinyl is breaking away from the stitching at the top. And out of the 10 months I&#x27;ve had &amp; used this, three  of those months were at home on maternity leave and the bag was in a closet not being used. I am not sure I would buy this product again. I may look for something different as I need to carry a clear bag at work.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a leather tote bag that was too heavy when it was empty. So when I added the usual--lunch, extra shoes, folding umbrella, etc my old tote was too heavy which I carried in addition to a handbag that carries a woman&#x27;s essentials. I also ordered the next size up which is so large that I can carry my hangbag in it along with the extra stuff. Also, I work for the Federal government and our bags have to be screened which makes it easier to see what is in it.</li>
            <li> This bag is very nicely made with lots of storage room.  It will easily hold a 10\\&quot; tablet and several magazines. The zippered pocket is generous and would easily hold a lipstick, compact, lotion, perfume as well as change and bills.  It is large enough to use for an overnight bag if so desired.  The quality is evident from the thick clear vinyl to the well stitched handles and seams.  For the price this certainly appears a great value.</li>
            <li> Excellent, the perfect bag for work.  I&#x27;m also able to put notebooks in the bag.  It&#x27;s the perfect size .</li>
            <li> I use this bag everyday in costmetology school and it is stuffed. Out of my class of 7 people, my bad is the only one to last out of the first 5 months. Still in excellent shape. (I keep both books + my paperwork in this bag)</li>
            <li> Perfect for a day at the pool.  I use it for my magazines and my kindle and a few other small things.  It folds up easily so I can take it when I travel.</li>
            <li> Love this bag. Very sturdy with plenty of room inside and the clear zipper pocket attached inside was an excellent place to put my name badge for work to keep it protected without having to remove it each time I entered work</li>
            <li> When I first saw it I thought that it was too small. After I put everything that I will be putting inside it and it fit perfectly, I was amazed how it all fit well. The interior pocket comes in handy too. Nice summer bag!</li>
            <li> I USE BAG TO CARRY LUNCH AND READING MATERIAL TO WORK. SO FAR SO GOOD. I&#x27;M HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE.</li>
            <li> Makes perfect purse easy for the purpose of a see through purse when going into a job that is high security.</li>
            <li> I actually like this clear plastic bag. I am not worried about tearing it or exposed to abused. It is a little soft or flexible plastic which is perfect. The size is perfect for putting flashlights, phones, wallets, keys when you are out in a dinghy. It zips up with no problem.</li>
            <li> This item was exactly what I needed for work. It is truly a medium sized bag but it will carry quite a bit of stuff.</li>
            <li> very well made,great for my purpose,good size and quality,had other people at work want to purchase.like very much,my friend is buying one.</li>
            <li> This bag is wonderful &amp; holds up pretty good great sturdy straps I will consider buying more ,1 request that barcode sticker that u put on the bag was hard 2 get off especially the sticky residue consider putting the sticker on the package.Thanks</li>
            <li> Love this bag got one for my boss also</li>
            <li> I love it. I use it everyday. I put photos of my children and grandchildren around the inside for everyone to see.</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my girlfriend who works in retail and is required to use a clear bags when working. They were inexpensive and look to be be very durable. She is very happy with them</li>
            <li> I would have like just a little bigger, cut it is working well.  It seems to be reinforced well where my last one tore apart.  It was larger.  Maybe I loaded it up too much, but we must have clear and this works.</li>
            <li> i needed the bag for work but I was expecting it to be a little bigger. Good construction. I hope it last.</li>
            <li> A little smaller than I thought it would be, but it works for what I need it for.</li>
            <li> Requirement for my job; nice size. Fairly durable though I do see a crack forming on one seam.</li>
            <li> The bag is ok but the plastic is starting to rip and I have not had the bag long.  I am a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very nice work bag with plenty of room.Would recommend this bag to anyone looking a small clear bag for what ever use.</li>
            <li> My company requires us to use clear bags. I was given a clear fanny pack, but I needed to carry a book so during my break I had something to read. This bag was clear and perfect enough to handle with I needed.</li>
            <li> Love it :-) being able to see my makeup makes it so much easier. It&#x27;s easy to carry from here to there to...looks cute</li>
            <li> The size and shape .good  value just the right size  for me for my work great  investment  Since i need got every day</li>
            <li> Great bag. It is made very well. I like the fact that it has cloth trim. It is. A little smaller than I expected, but I made it work. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I needed for work. It works well enough for my needs. I only need to carry a single folder, a wallet, a pair of sunglasses, a make-up bag, and a small umbrella. I carry my keys and pepper spray in the small inside pocket. I do not carry a purse to work. This bag is not very heavy. It does NOT zip close, it has no zip and I did not need it to do so.</li>
            <li> Perfect for daycare.  Not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li> I love this bag.  It&#x27;s well made.  I use it in my car for my coupons and stuff.  Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Most employers have a clear bag policy, this is perfect for work. I can put a wallet, thermos of coffee, my lunch and a small makeup bag inside for my workday.</li>
            <li> I love the size - I bought another tote and it works but I wanted something smaller so this is why I purchased it</li>
            <li> Needed a clear tote bag to carry my preferred hair care products to my hair dresser.  I can see everything that is in the bag without searching.</li>
            <li> I work retail and this is the best clear bag that I have found so far. The fabric bottom makes it more durable than most. I love it. It is the perfect size. The plactic zip pocket on the inside is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> I accidentally ordered 2 and was gonna return one but I just opened it today and took it to work with nothing in it just my lotion and pens and the material the handle is on is already torn it&#x27;s about to come off so I have to use the second one I purchased while I look for a better quality bag</li>
            <li> has a zipper and a inside pocket ! I work at a prison and this works great ! fast shipping</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this purchase. Low quality plastic and very small compared to how it looks on display.Not Recommended. Would like to return.</li>
            <li> Love the size not to small straps are comfortable to carry and can see what I&amp;#34;m carrying in the see through bag</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my roomate who works at a high security facility.  VERY strong, holds a ton of her junk she totes in it.  has zipping pouch on inside for id&#x27;s or whatever.</li>
            <li> Opened my new clear bag today. LOVE IT. Perfect size, sturdy handles, nice zipper, no plastic smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike others, who may need it since they work in retail and need to carry their personal items in a clear bag, I bought it&lt;br /&gt;for the inclement weather here in TX!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep the tote in my car, when it pours, I just take my wallet, phone and keys with me so my nice purse doesn&#x27;t get wet!</li>
            <li> Was disappointed how fast this bag broke. I NEED a clear bag for work and this lasted less than a month. Would not recommend</li>
            <li> Ordered this bag because we have to have a clear bag that security can see what we are binging in and out of the building.  The handles don&#x27;t seem to stand up to the weight over a long period of time.  Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li> A little cheaper made than I had hoped for, but ya get what ya pay for, I guess.</li>
            <li> My wife purchased this for her retail job and she loves it.  The price was reasonable and she loves the size.  It&#x27;s big enough to hold a magazine and all her other items.  There is a small pocket inside for the little items and the straps are just big enough to sling over her shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  This product ripped after about 5 weeks of use so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just this one or if it is just a weak product.  I&#x27;m taking a star off for that but maybe should have taken two.</li>
            <li> We have to have clear bags for work... I didn&#x27;t even have it a month and it was already tearing at the seams. Can&#x27;t complain too much since it hasn&#x27;t totally fallen apart on me and I do use it 5 days a week. Plus its not like its a pricey purchase.</li>
            <li> The size of this bag is comfortable for me to carry .  There is enough room for my papers, tools.</li>
            <li> Great bag...the straps are sturdy, but I wish the bag was larger. Perfect for retail, where you must carry a see-through bag. I can  fit a 23 oz. bottle of water, two baseball caps, a wallet, phone, several small ziploc bags for snacks. The interior pocket holds lots of travel-size bottles (hand lotion, mouth wash, pain reliever, chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this bag!</li>
            <li> Perfect size for my Sunday bag. Handy pocket.  Sturdy and has a strong zipper closure.</li>
            <li> has worked great over the last year, even in cold weather it has not cracked or anything</li>
            <li> perfect size for work and very well constructed.  It holds everything I need for work and more and can hold several pounds of weight.</li>
            <li> I needed a clear bag for work.  This looked satisfactory.  I bought it in august of 2012, and despite heavy use (I tend to overstuff my bags, including 1-2 hardcover books), it&#x27;s only JUST developed a hole in the vinyl (and that&#x27;s courtesy of my cat making biscuits with his sharp claws).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pocket, where I dump all of my loose change (amongst other items) has also held up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the seams has split anywhere on the bag.</li>
            <li> We have bag checks at work and this bag simplifies the process.  It&#x27;s also nice because I don&#x27;t lose track of things as I sometimes do in a regular tote.  Would never have bought these bags if not necessary for work, now they are all I use.</li>
            <li> I received my purse quickly and it was just like it was shown. I&#x27;m very happy with the purchase and how quick it came.</li>
            <li> When this bag arrived I was a little surprised with the size being small but it actually works out perfectly. I know if I go bigger I will just throw more stuff in in! All together it&#x27;s a great value and good quality.</li>
            <li> Great construction and durability.  Got it to help husband get his car organized and it may be a lost cause, but it is a nice bag.  I may take it for my car :)</li>
            <li> Iuse a clear bag for work, so this bag really came in handy. there is room for lotion and magazine and also you have inside pocket for change.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS BAG AND SO DOES THE OTHER PEOPLE I PURCHASED THEM FOR AFTER THEY SAW MINE, WE HAVE TO HAVE THE CLEAR BAGS BECAUSE WE WORK IN A VERY SECURED AREA.</li>
            <li> Bought this for work had it only 3 months, handles are coming off. The bag is $13.99 but the shipping is very expensive for poor quality. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> This tote is the perfect size for me, I am 5&#x27; tall and all the others I found were tooo big!!!  And the zipper closure is an added attraction!!!</li>
            <li> Made great! Perfect for work. My job requires a clear bag.</li>
            <li> Okay for the price. Came all folded up, but smoothed out. Not super strong, but you get what you pay for. Useful for my needs.</li>
            <li> My first impression was good. It seemed well constructed and large enough to hold everything I&#x27;d need. I have noticed, though, that after 5 months of use, it&#x27;s wearing more than anticipated. On both sides of the clear plastic, about an inch below the black binding at the top, the plastic has cracked open. I&#x27;ll probably &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; it with electrical tape to prevent the holes from getting bigger. And, I will stop recommending it to others at work. It&#x27;s certainly NOT worth the price I paid for it. I will not replace it from this company.</li>
            <li> I needed this for work and could not find it in a local store. Perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Lots of coworkers liked it too.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good size bag to carry to work, work in retail.  I love the size of this one.  I can fit a water bottle plus snacks if needed along with everything else a female normally carries.  This way I don&#x27;t have to change bags when I go somewhere unless I feel the need when running around town.</li>
            <li> Not impressed with this tote at all. It is to small and I can&#x27;t get enough items in it.  The picture appears to give it a larger appearance but it is not.  This will be my first return to Amazon.Com</li>
