            <li>Good price, works well.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my Infiniti Pro rollers.</li>
            <li>Im very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>I rarely ever give 5 stars, so consider me very happy with these puppies!  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, the case is nice and is probably good for traveling.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re attractive, heat up quickly, and work great.</li>
            <li>I LOVE these curlers!  </li>
            <li>and they are amazing Pia doyle</li>
            <li>Rollers themselves are nice.</li>
            <li>$20/pair) - the T3 are superior rollers and MUCH better for travel.</li>
            <li>The rollers produce a nice size curl.</li>
            <li>Also I should have ordered the 1-1/2 &amp;#34; instead of 2&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
            <li>Who has that kind of time?</li>
            <li>You get height that is so nice at the scalp.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it had on/off switch instead of having to unplug.</li>
            <li>, the quality is quite nice and these do heat evenly and</li>
            <li>and I would have liked and on and off switch on the unit rather than unplugging..</li>
            <li>Might be nice if they stayed in.</li>
            <li>These heat up nicely</li>
            <li>It does take a bit of practice to sets these correctly and to get the rollers to stay in place, but honestly, I do like them better.  </li>
            <li>I wanted lots of body, but not tight curls, for my shoulder length hair and these work perfectly.</li>
            <li>The rollers are good, and heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li>They work fine - nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li>I just love my hair curlers.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li>They could be my favorite purchase ever.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still working on technique, but these curlers are fabulous!</li>
            <li>I end up using 7 of them (3 on top, 2 on each side)</li>
            <li>-The clips will not hold the rollers on top of your head as one might do with Velcro rollers to add volume.  </li>
            <li>Wish the clips were designed better</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t show crimping on top layer of hair.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;m glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li>use all eight, four on top and four on the bottom.  </li>
            <li>This would be 5 star if the clips worked or if it came with the metal pins most curler sets do.</li>
            <li>I needed to buy this one because my hair uses more than 8 rollers.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>I purchased what I thought were better clips and they didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li>I love the rollers.</li>
            <li>They smooth my hair just liked</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>They more than lived up to my expectations and I have recommended them to my clients.</li>
            <li>I want more curl to my style.</li>
            <li>These are ok...</li>
            <li>I love these jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I picked this  product.  </li>
            <li>There are a lot of options but this one was reasonably priced and works great.</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with this,I wanted something that would give a bit of lift and smoothing but not too much curl,this works great</li>
            <li>I love these to just add smoothness and volume to my shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>They heat up fast and the clips work great for me.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>It takes me more time trying to keep the rollers in my hair than if I would have curled my hair with an iron.</li>
            <li>I love these rollers.  </li>
            <li>Instead, they are designed to add body/volume and (most importantly!)</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy!</li>
            <li>The clips were kind of flimsy and not as well-made is the original Conair clips of many years ago.</li>
            <li>she would recommend them to everyone, very worth the money!</li>
            <li>Also, the clips that come with the hot rollers did not do a good job at holding the rollers in place.</li>
            <li>These are perfect if you have the long layers like I do.  </li>
            <li>I wanted just a nice wave...not a tight curl, and these are perfect!  </li>
            <li>Perfect for my long hair!</li>
            <li>This is like magic -- it stayed straight and looking good.  </li>
            <li>They would be fine if the clips were designed better.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ll bet they&#x27;d be great for normal to fine hair.</li>
            <li>Very good quality, and they create a nice full, smooth look with just enough turn-under at the ends of the hair.</li>
            <li>WORKS GREAT HEATS FAST AND GIVES FULL RELAXED CURLS</li>
            <li>The rollers are good if u want straight hair with body.</li>
            <li>I put them in, do something else for 5-10 minutes, take them out and let the curls cool while I put on make up then comb the curls out - done!  </li>
            <li>By the time they&#x27;re all in you have a head full of rollers hanging off your head!</li>
            <li>Great product - heats up quickly and leaves hair smooth and gently curled.</li>
            <li>The rollers warm up quickly, have a soft velet covering to protect your hair and set beautiful large curls.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is fine and straighter, I would imagine that these would do nothing for you.  </li>
            <li>Mine work just fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine, medium thickness hair that is about 5 inches below my shoulders and</li>
            <li>Suppose it works fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair just to my collarbones.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I use the flimsy clips on the sides of the Conair Super Clips for securing the rollers a bit more.</li>
            <li>The rollers nice and large and the unit is compact.  </li>
            <li>great for big body...no curl.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I think these are a fantastic value.</li>
            <li>Before buying I read the reviews about how the cheap clips that are included don&#x27;t hold the rollers</li>
            <li>but dint fit these huge rollers.</li>
            <li>Why couldn&#x27;t Conair use something like that instead of cheap plastic that doesn&#x27;t work?  </li>
            <li>And for what it&#x27;s worth I don&#x27;t get why so many reviewers complain about the clips not working.</li>
            <li>the clips do NOT stay in very well and it is kind of a pain that there is nowhere to keep them.  </li>
            <li>The light just comes on when you plug them in and stays on.  </li>
            <li>Also the plastic container they come in is huge and barely fit on my bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li>These rollers would work well if the clips worked but the clips dont begin to secure the rollers into place so the rollers flop around and fall out.  </li>
            <li>If the clips worked, this would be a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>smooth frizz.  </li>
            <li>The rollers do a fabulous job at all of those ... NOT curling, adding body and smoothing frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can also spend more time fussing with these and get a very va-va-voom effect that&#x27;s appropriate for going out.  </li>
            <li>But I found I can manage just fine with the original clips.</li>
            <li>These are great, perfect size for my long, fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl, clips need to be a little tighter though.</li>
            <li>So easy to use, heats up quickly and leaves my hair smooth and shiny in the matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li>But usually I&#x27;m just so happy to see big voluminous hair especially on TOP of my head that I don&#x27;t miss curls.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So happy that I finally found a full set of 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li>But overall it does a great job and heats up really quickly.</li>
            <li>But that was exactly what I was looking for :)</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier, exactly what I wanted, a bit more body than what the curling iron gave me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They work great for straightening out my long, curly, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an expert on hot rollers as this was my first set, but i can say that these are actually pretty good.</li>
            <li>-Cheap price for a full set of super jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li>this roller set is so easy to use and the price was right.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy these specifically for special occasions, I just wanted to look groomed/professional and not like I was about to attend a wedding.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time I would end up using my large barrel curling iron to get a softer curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I went to an electrical store and purchased a Remington set on special for $20</li>
            <li>These work fine without any issues whatsoever with the right price.</li>
            <li>Just ordered the full clam clips</li>
            <li>Her hair is much longer and thicker and needed more support.</li>
            <li>These are a lot more gentle.</li>
            <li>Not bad in all but no space for clips.</li>
            <li>Does not get warm enough clips fall out easily.  </li>
            <li>Heats fast and rollers are a nice large size for a softer curl.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These heat up quickly</li>
            <li>I can quickly throw these in, do my makeup, and take them out before I head out the door.  </li>
            <li>These are my 6th set of hot rollers and I LOVE these hot rollers.</li>
            <li>These rollers heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li>Conair SPC10X Super Clips, 10 Count and</li>
            <li>Heat up pretty quickly, too!</li>
            <li>sets heats up quickly ...</li>
            <li>Item was received quickly and what the sellers stated the item would be.</li>
            <li>Also, the edges of the curlers get very hot.  </li>
            <li>There is a reason you cannot easily find 2 inch jumbo rollers - they are too large for any CLIP to hold.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love these hot rollers but they just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these!!!</li>
            <li>The super clips have allowed me to use me these rollers more frequently.</li>
            <li>Conair products are pretty great and the rollers are what I was looking for, but like other reviewers, I agree they will not stay in your hair because of the clips.  </li>
            <li>The container is surprisingly large but light.  </li>
            <li>and I get perfect results, soft waves, in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I want to throw rollers in my hair and have them straighten and smooth it while I run around getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>They provide my hair with smooth volume and body without too much curl.</li>
            <li>I like the old wire type pins better.</li>
            <li>The curls I get are soft, more like waves.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice to have a couple of extra clips.</li>
            <li>Nice big rollers.</li>
            <li>purchased for my wife, who has long hair, she loves them and says they&#x27;re the best for long hair.  </li>
            <li>I like my hair to look more natural</li>
            <li>They produce nice BIG curls.</li>
            <li>And as I read a lot of the reviews the big wire pins that used to hold these kind of rollers in place are nowhere to be found.what</li>
            <li>I also bought the super clips for my daughter which she likes very much.</li>
            <li>My main goal was to got more volume on top of my head/crown area since I have fine/thin/Southeast Asian hair.</li>
            <li>I think these rollers have a potential to be great, they heat up fast and they kept the volume in my hair pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>I have a set of  hot rollers that are 30 years old and the clips are simple U shaped metal and they work great</li>
            <li>Gives me the right amount of volume without the curl.  </li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>Straight/fine hair would probably slip right off of these rollers.  </li>
            <li>They allow the rollers to loosen and then create a kink right by the crown in the form of the clip.</li>
            <li>and I like them, but they&#x27;re very large</li>
            <li>Things I love: If timed right with unplugging the machine, the rollers don&#x27;t get too hot, the ends are cool enough to hold.</li>
            <li>Super large rollers create body and sleekness if you know how to use them.</li>
            <li>By the time I&#x27;m finished, I take the curlers out and have large waves!</li>
            <li>Large, heat up fast, comfortable on hands even when hot.</li>
            <li>I have had four different sets of electric rollers in my life and this is the best ever for someone with shoulder length to long hair who is looking for soft curls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this kind in the past and they don&#x27;t hold the top rollers in very well.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used it, my hair came out just as I want it, straight</li>
            <li>Like it very much.</li>
            <li>I like them very much.</li>
            <li>The rollers are very large and are just right for my very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I looked to see if larger rollers existed.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it doesn&#x27;t have an on/off switch.  </li>
            <li>Hot rollers &#x3D;</li>
            <li>A+ Clips provided with Hot rollers &#x3D;</li>
            <li>I used BIGSEXY hair spray prior to rolling, but yes I get volume on top of my hair and throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t watch the time, the machine will keep warming up the rollers and they can get hot.</li>
            <li>I looked and looked for hot rollers that were 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>But my hair is long, thick and kind of wavy (not in a nice way!).</li>
            <li>They are the biggest rollers I have every seen in hot rollers.</li>
            <li>First of all the clips did not keep the hot rollers in place at all.</li>
            <li>Just tried them for the first time</li>
            <li>No burning fingers on the edges of the rollers, no dreadful smell of human head on fire,</li>
            <li>I have not been able to use these rollers because the power plug is not compatable with Australian Power points.  </li>
            <li>so i don&#x27;t like to use hot tools a lot.</li>
            <li>You need to figure out how to roll your hair properly first.</li>
            <li>On my first time, my hair fell within 10 minutes after i took these out</li>
            <li>Only giving it 4 stars for two reasons: I wish they came with roller pins so that they held the roller in my hair better.</li>
            <li>The clips broke after first use.</li>
            <li>If your hair is shorter, I think a smaller roller would work better.</li>
            <li>I so wanted to love these rollers, and having said that, it&#x27;s not the actual rollers I have a problem</li>
            <li>Good product, but as many others have said, the clips are totally useless.  </li>
            <li>Though I liked the volume it gave me, it didn&#x27;t do anything else that it said it would, like heat up quickly, keep the volume a long time, make my hair shiny and not dry it out, and the clips did not hold the rollers, so they were always moving around my head.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased many sets (AND I MEAN MANY) of rollers over the years</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t get as hot as I prefer, but they do heat up fast.  </li>
            <li>Love the size of the curls made for my very long hair but have no clips to hold them in my hair.</li>
            <li>and since they are such large rollers, they can handle all of my hair easily.</li>
            <li>This Conair set is way too large to travel.</li>
            <li>I am in search of the large metal clips.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find any this large.</li>
            <li>but with a certain volume, shape, and curled under at the ends.  </li>
            <li>volume and style without the classic hot roller children&#x27;s pageant queen look.  </li>
            <li>I like this, but if you want to actually have curly hair, you would be better off buying a set with some smaller rollers intermixed with the super jumbos.</li>
            <li>I use it frequently and my hair stays soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This roller set and a whole bunch of clips are now under my bathroom sink--don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever use them.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s very time efficient.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I can wear it curly or straight.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t work very well either.</li>
            <li>The rollers flip flop around so you cant really move your head much or the rollers may fall off your head.</li>
            <li>and she really appreciated the gift.</li>
            <li>I really like these rollers</li>
            <li>these curlers don&#x27;t do much of anything for my hair.</li>
            <li>Second the instructions that come with the rollers say that there is an indicator light that comes on when the rollers are ready for use, no such light ever came on when I used them.</li>
            <li>It took forever to do my whole head...</li>
            <li>These rollers heat up fast and hold the temperature well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit too much for me, i don&#x27;t like to look &#x27;&#x27;fancy&#x27;&#x27;.</li>
            <li>These curlers don&#x27;t really do much.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s also no indicator way to let you know the curlers are ready.  </li>
            <li>Overall they just feel &#x27;cheap&#x27;.</li>
            <li>Clips don&#x27;t hold very well.  </li>
            <li>I  don&#x27;t have to spend as much time straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>Just a gentle curve in my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>I really would not recommend buying these at all.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am now addicted to these 2 inch rollers because my hair looks definitely more voluminous!!!!</li>
            <li>I love the Conair products overall but these hot rollers are the perfect size for longer, thick hair and really provides long lasting curls.</li>
            <li>Finally ... a FULL set of real jumbo 2&amp;#34; rollers!  </li>
            <li>I have to thank reviewers for this rollerset who gave me the idea to buy additional Conair Hot roller Super Clips (actually purchased from Amazon).</li>
            <li>Also I may get an occasional large curl here and there, but these rollers make the rest of my hair very loosely full and wavy, not curly.</li>
            <li>glad someone FINALLY made a hot roller this big!  </li>
            <li>I am going to have to find some other clips that work better.</li>
            <li>I purchased other clips so I&#x27;m hoping they will work much better.</li>
            <li>I think these are better for your hair than other heating tools.</li>
            <li>For the record I didn&#x27;t experience the problems with the clips that many other reviewers did, for me it was just a matter of positioning them correctly.  </li>
            <li>This was my very first set of hot curlers - I have a lot of very long (mid-low back) fine hair.</li>
            <li>The only thing I am not crazy about are the clips which can leave dents/creases in your hair, especially if you have baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li>They heat up super fast and the clips actually work!</li>
            <li>set feels cheap and the heating system is positively strange.  </li>
            <li>Now that I have seen the full potential of these rollers...</li>
            <li>I only keep them in my hair for about 5 minutes and then allow the waves to cool before I brush my hair.  </li>
            <li>They are a little loose and easily can fall out, otherwise I love them.</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t have the feature where the rollers light up when ready, and it probably won&#x27;t work on wet hair.  </li>
            <li>If you put the clip in with the longer prongs on the outside of the curler/shorter prongs next to your scalp and make sure the part you grasp is closest to your head they will stay in snugly even with movement.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very chic and everyday appropriate.  </li>
            <li>You will have to either let them hang on the ends of your hair, with results similar to curling the ends with a jumbo curling iron, or possibly buy better clips.  </li>
            <li>love hot rollers for the ease of them, but until I found this set, they have always been too small for me.  </li>
            <li>They should design them like the older clips, which have a lot of contact surface and don&#x27;t leave &amp;#34;marks&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I also think they should give you metal clips, in addition to the plastic, and more than eight, since there is no way of ordering extras and they are so light weight they can be easily be broken.</li>
            <li>I have an older but faster</li>
            <li>Major disappointment because these rollers would otherwise provide the perfect smooth, voluminous bounce to my flat hair!</li>
            <li>The set comes with its own plastic clips; they usually hold pretty well, although occasionally I end up having to re-roll certain sections to make it so the clips will keep the roller in my hair.</li>
            <li>I really liked the hot rollers but because the rollers are big and heavy, the clips cannot keep hair in place.</li>
            <li>The clip allows the roller to slide so the curls on top aren&#x27;t tight.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I only need warm rollers to get volume, not hot.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally curly--too curly because I was it to be straight.  </li>
            <li>I have had these for a few months now and love them.</li>
            <li>you roll each one and by the time you get to the last one, you&#x27;re ready to take off the first one.  </li>
            <li>Next, use the clips provided with these rollers which have four really long teeth on the top of the roller and besides grasping the roller you&#x27;re clipping onto the bottom clip as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the clips, but they do work for most of the rolls.  </li>
            <li>when i purchashed them i had hair down back 10inches past my shoulders and they worked great!</li>
            <li>(my guess is not so well because it took the full 10 minutes to get it &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; when the air was dry).  </li>
            <li>but all this really does is smooth out your hair and give it a little texture.</li>
            <li>I have longish hair and have used the 11/2 inch rollers forever and thought I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
            <li>First, I put hair gel on and let it dry straight without using a air dryer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Conair hot rollers before, just a smaller size, so I knew what I was getting.</li>
            <li>Through the years, every time I saw hot rollers with a bit bigger roller, I would buy them.  </li>
            <li>(if that is a possible grade) I bought this hot roller set from Ulta.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is because it&#x27;s jumbo or if it is that it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, but even when I set my hair for 45 minutes it didn&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li>Unless you have super, super thick hair, these do not hold the roller in your hair.</li>
            <li>which is usually is about 5-7 minutes, and the rollers are warm enough to use.</li>
            <li>The rollers do have the slit in the middle, which I usually don&#x27;t like (but honestly did not have an issue with on this set).  </li>
            <li>May be good for someone with thick, long hair.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for large curls/waves, and these rollers are just way too big to set my hair.</li>
            <li>Once broken or lost there is nothing which will fit this huge size, and you are left with no ability to use the set.</li>
            <li>(People think that sounds heavenly, but it can be a curse with humidity, especially when I want it straight.)  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used them three times so far.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for my long and sometimes frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>Wish these had the old fashioned metal pins..</li>
            <li>I applaud the company for trying to make plastic clips that don&#x27;t leave a mark, but you really need to go back to the metal pins...</li>
            <li>and they left my hair very shiny with zero frizz.</li>
            <li>the only thing is, the clips don&#x27;t hold very well.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and the style lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>I returned these 2 inchers and bought smaller ones at ULTA that I am much happier with.</li>
            <li>Actually, she could use 2 sets because she has so much</li>
            <li>I have yet to find a clip that will work seamlessly with this size roller.</li>
            <li>My hair came out fuller when it was 100% dry first.  </li>
            <li>I have long normal to fine hair which typically takes well to heat, and these did nothing.</li>
            <li>Since my hair curls really easily, I end up with too tight of curls with smaller rollers, even the 1 1/4&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they get hot enough for my almost coarse hair.</li>
            <li>Be aware that the curls/waves produced are VERY loose and proceed accordingly with your purchase.</li>
            <li>Girlfriend with thick hair loves these large curlers, can only enhance her significant beauty.</li>
            <li>I try new hair products and tools constantly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give this a few more tries and leave them in a lot longer, etc.</li>
            <li>-The rollers don&#x27;t get quite as hot as other sets I have owned unless you let it sit for a while.</li>
            <li>Also I am not very good at roller placement, so I do tend to get a crimp or line if I get messy with placing the SUPER clips onto rolled hair, but most of the time it&#x27;s not very visible</li>
            <li>The rollers are VERY big, and so they work really well with long hair.  </li>
            <li>They gave you big bouncy body and your hair was shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>I wanted extra large rollers for loose waves and volume.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my hair curling time in half with hot rollers</li>
            <li>A little hard to get used to using to make the clamps stay in well - curlers are nice though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick, but only b/c I have lots of fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The rollers do not get as hot as the ones with 4 big rollers, and 8 smaller ones - resulting in a less firm curl that releases fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>This would be frustrating to anyone who wanted to use these the same way most people generally use those enormous Velcro rollers.</li>
            <li>This particular one would work well for long hair only - and only for smoothing effect, not curl.</li>
            <li>know some folks have complained about the clips, but I actually love these as the other type of clips sometimes crimp my hair if I do not place them correctly.</li>
            <li>I have soft waves and my hair that is medium long.</li>
            <li>Other Conairs &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; rollers in other machines only measure 1.5 or 1.75 so these were the only rollers that I saw on the shelf at Ulta that measured 2 full inches.</li>
            <li>Big soft curves on long hair.  </li>
            <li>but they are just a little to large.  </li>
            <li>why wouldn&#x27;t conair make normal xlarge metal pins like other curlers?  </li>
            <li>I know they are jumbo, but my hair goes down the middle of my back and comes out straight when I wear them.  </li>
            <li>After I use them my hair looks straight with a little curve at the bottom.</li>

            <li> Im very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> I rarely ever give 5 stars, so consider me very happy with these puppies!  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, the case is nice and is probably good for traveling.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re attractive, heat up quickly, and work great.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these curlers!  </li>
            <li> and they are amazing Pia doyle</li>
            <li> Rollers themselves are nice.</li>
            <li> $20/pair) - the T3 are superior rollers and MUCH better for travel.</li>
            <li> The rollers produce a nice size curl.</li>
            <li> Also I should have ordered the 1-1/2 &amp;#34; instead of 2&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s my own fault.</li>
            <li> Who has that kind of time?</li>
            <li> You get height that is so nice at the scalp.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if it had on/off switch instead of having to unplug.</li>
            <li> , the quality is quite nice and these do heat evenly and</li>
            <li> and I would have liked and on and off switch on the unit rather than unplugging..</li>
            <li> Might be nice if they stayed in.</li>
            <li> These heat up nicely</li>
            <li> It does take a bit of practice to sets these correctly and to get the rollers to stay in place, but honestly, I do like them better.  </li>
            <li> I wanted lots of body, but not tight curls, for my shoulder length hair and these work perfectly.</li>
            <li> The rollers are good, and heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li> They work fine - nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> I just love my hair curlers.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THEM.</li>
            <li> They could be my favorite purchase ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working on technique, but these curlers are fabulous!</li>
            <li> I end up using 7 of them (3 on top, 2 on each side)</li>
            <li> -The clips will not hold the rollers on top of your head as one might do with Velcro rollers to add volume.  </li>
            <li> Wish the clips were designed better</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t show crimping on top layer of hair.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I&#x27;m glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li> use all eight, four on top and four on the bottom.  </li>
            <li> This would be 5 star if the clips worked or if it came with the metal pins most curler sets do.</li>
            <li> I needed to buy this one because my hair uses more than 8 rollers.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I purchased what I thought were better clips and they didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> I love the rollers.</li>
            <li> They smooth my hair just liked</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> They more than lived up to my expectations and I have recommended them to my clients.</li>
            <li> I want more curl to my style.</li>
            <li> These are ok...</li>
            <li> I love these jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I picked this  product.  </li>
            <li> There are a lot of options but this one was reasonably priced and works great.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this,I wanted something that would give a bit of lift and smoothing but not too much curl,this works great</li>
            <li> I love these to just add smoothness and volume to my shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> They heat up fast and the clips work great for me.  </li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> It takes me more time trying to keep the rollers in my hair than if I would have curled my hair with an iron.</li>
            <li> I love these rollers.  </li>
            <li> Instead, they are designed to add body/volume and (most importantly!)</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy!</li>
            <li> The clips were kind of flimsy and not as well-made is the original Conair clips of many years ago.</li>
            <li> she would recommend them to everyone, very worth the money!</li>
            <li> Also, the clips that come with the hot rollers did not do a good job at holding the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> These are perfect if you have the long layers like I do.  </li>
            <li> I wanted just a nice wave...not a tight curl, and these are perfect!  </li>
            <li> Perfect for my long hair!</li>
            <li> This is like magic -- it stayed straight and looking good.  </li>
            <li> They would be fine if the clips were designed better.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ll bet they&#x27;d be great for normal to fine hair.</li>
            <li> Very good quality, and they create a nice full, smooth look with just enough turn-under at the ends of the hair.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT HEATS FAST AND GIVES FULL RELAXED CURLS</li>
            <li> The rollers are good if u want straight hair with body.</li>
            <li> I put them in, do something else for 5-10 minutes, take them out and let the curls cool while I put on make up then comb the curls out - done!  </li>
            <li> By the time they&#x27;re all in you have a head full of rollers hanging off your head!</li>
            <li> Great product - heats up quickly and leaves hair smooth and gently curled.</li>
            <li> The rollers warm up quickly, have a soft velet covering to protect your hair and set beautiful large curls.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is fine and straighter, I would imagine that these would do nothing for you.  </li>
            <li> Mine work just fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine, medium thickness hair that is about 5 inches below my shoulders and</li>
            <li> Suppose it works fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair just to my collarbones.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes I use the flimsy clips on the sides of the Conair Super Clips for securing the rollers a bit more.</li>
            <li> The rollers nice and large and the unit is compact.  </li>
            <li> great for big body...no curl.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I think these are a fantastic value.</li>
            <li> Before buying I read the reviews about how the cheap clips that are included don&#x27;t hold the rollers</li>
            <li> but dint fit these huge rollers.</li>
            <li> Why couldn&#x27;t Conair use something like that instead of cheap plastic that doesn&#x27;t work?  </li>
            <li> And for what it&#x27;s worth I don&#x27;t get why so many reviewers complain about the clips not working.</li>
            <li> the clips do NOT stay in very well and it is kind of a pain that there is nowhere to keep them.  </li>
            <li> The light just comes on when you plug them in and stays on.  </li>
            <li> Also the plastic container they come in is huge and barely fit on my bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> These rollers would work well if the clips worked but the clips dont begin to secure the rollers into place so the rollers flop around and fall out.  </li>
            <li> If the clips worked, this would be a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> smooth frizz.  </li>
            <li> The rollers do a fabulous job at all of those ... NOT curling, adding body and smoothing frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can also spend more time fussing with these and get a very va-va-voom effect that&#x27;s appropriate for going out.  </li>
            <li> But I found I can manage just fine with the original clips.</li>
            <li> These are great, perfect size for my long, fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl, clips need to be a little tighter though.</li>
            <li> So easy to use, heats up quickly and leaves my hair smooth and shiny in the matter of minutes.  </li>
            <li> But usually I&#x27;m just so happy to see big voluminous hair especially on TOP of my head that I don&#x27;t miss curls.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So happy that I finally found a full set of 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li> But overall it does a great job and heats up really quickly.</li>
            <li> But that was exactly what I was looking for :)</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier, exactly what I wanted, a bit more body than what the curling iron gave me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work great for straightening out my long, curly, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert on hot rollers as this was my first set, but i can say that these are actually pretty good.</li>
            <li> -Cheap price for a full set of super jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li> this roller set is so easy to use and the price was right.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy these specifically for special occasions, I just wanted to look groomed/professional and not like I was about to attend a wedding.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time I would end up using my large barrel curling iron to get a softer curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I went to an electrical store and purchased a Remington set on special for $20</li>
            <li> These work fine without any issues whatsoever with the right price.</li>
            <li> Just ordered the full clam clips</li>
            <li> Her hair is much longer and thicker and needed more support.</li>
            <li> These are a lot more gentle.</li>
            <li> Not bad in all but no space for clips.</li>
            <li> Does not get warm enough clips fall out easily.  </li>
            <li> Heats fast and rollers are a nice large size for a softer curl.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These heat up quickly</li>
            <li> I can quickly throw these in, do my makeup, and take them out before I head out the door.  </li>
            <li> These are my 6th set of hot rollers and I LOVE these hot rollers.</li>
            <li> These rollers heat up quickly.  </li>
            <li> Conair SPC10X Super Clips, 10 Count and</li>
            <li> Heat up pretty quickly, too!</li>
            <li> sets heats up quickly ...</li>
            <li> Item was received quickly and what the sellers stated the item would be.</li>
            <li> Also, the edges of the curlers get very hot.  </li>
            <li> There is a reason you cannot easily find 2 inch jumbo rollers - they are too large for any CLIP to hold.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love these hot rollers but they just didn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these!!!</li>
            <li> The super clips have allowed me to use me these rollers more frequently.</li>
            <li> Conair products are pretty great and the rollers are what I was looking for, but like other reviewers, I agree they will not stay in your hair because of the clips.  </li>
            <li> The container is surprisingly large but light.  </li>
            <li> and I get perfect results, soft waves, in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I want to throw rollers in my hair and have them straighten and smooth it while I run around getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> They provide my hair with smooth volume and body without too much curl.</li>
            <li> I like the old wire type pins better.</li>
            <li> The curls I get are soft, more like waves.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice to have a couple of extra clips.</li>
            <li> Nice big rollers.</li>
            <li> purchased for my wife, who has long hair, she loves them and says they&#x27;re the best for long hair.  </li>
            <li> I like my hair to look more natural</li>
            <li> They produce nice BIG curls.</li>
            <li> And as I read a lot of the reviews the big wire pins that used to hold these kind of rollers in place are nowhere to be found.what</li>
            <li> I also bought the super clips for my daughter which she likes very much.</li>
            <li> My main goal was to got more volume on top of my head/crown area since I have fine/thin/Southeast Asian hair.</li>
            <li> I think these rollers have a potential to be great, they heat up fast and they kept the volume in my hair pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> I have a set of  hot rollers that are 30 years old and the clips are simple U shaped metal and they work great</li>
            <li> Gives me the right amount of volume without the curl.  </li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> Straight/fine hair would probably slip right off of these rollers.  </li>
            <li> They allow the rollers to loosen and then create a kink right by the crown in the form of the clip.</li>
            <li> and I like them, but they&#x27;re very large</li>
            <li> Things I love: If timed right with unplugging the machine, the rollers don&#x27;t get too hot, the ends are cool enough to hold.</li>
            <li> Super large rollers create body and sleekness if you know how to use them.</li>
            <li> By the time I&#x27;m finished, I take the curlers out and have large waves!</li>
            <li> Large, heat up fast, comfortable on hands even when hot.</li>
            <li> I have had four different sets of electric rollers in my life and this is the best ever for someone with shoulder length to long hair who is looking for soft curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this kind in the past and they don&#x27;t hold the top rollers in very well.</li>
            <li> The very first time I used it, my hair came out just as I want it, straight</li>
            <li> Like it very much.</li>
            <li> I like them very much.</li>
            <li> The rollers are very large and are just right for my very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I looked to see if larger rollers existed.  </li>
            <li> First of all, it doesn&#x27;t have an on/off switch.  </li>
            <li> Hot rollers &#x3D;</li>
            <li> A+ Clips provided with Hot rollers &#x3D;</li>
            <li> I used BIGSEXY hair spray prior to rolling, but yes I get volume on top of my hair and throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t watch the time, the machine will keep warming up the rollers and they can get hot.</li>
            <li> I looked and looked for hot rollers that were 2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> But my hair is long, thick and kind of wavy (not in a nice way!).</li>
            <li> They are the biggest rollers I have every seen in hot rollers.</li>
            <li> First of all the clips did not keep the hot rollers in place at all.</li>
            <li> Just tried them for the first time</li>
            <li> No burning fingers on the edges of the rollers, no dreadful smell of human head on fire,</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use these rollers because the power plug is not compatable with Australian Power points.  </li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t like to use hot tools a lot.</li>
            <li> You need to figure out how to roll your hair properly first.</li>
            <li> On my first time, my hair fell within 10 minutes after i took these out</li>
            <li> Only giving it 4 stars for two reasons: I wish they came with roller pins so that they held the roller in my hair better.</li>
            <li> The clips broke after first use.</li>
            <li> If your hair is shorter, I think a smaller roller would work better.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to love these rollers, and having said that, it&#x27;s not the actual rollers I have a problem</li>
            <li> Good product, but as many others have said, the clips are totally useless.  </li>
            <li> Though I liked the volume it gave me, it didn&#x27;t do anything else that it said it would, like heat up quickly, keep the volume a long time, make my hair shiny and not dry it out, and the clips did not hold the rollers, so they were always moving around my head.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased many sets (AND I MEAN MANY) of rollers over the years</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get as hot as I prefer, but they do heat up fast.  </li>
            <li> Love the size of the curls made for my very long hair but have no clips to hold them in my hair.</li>
            <li> and since they are such large rollers, they can handle all of my hair easily.</li>
            <li> This Conair set is way too large to travel.</li>
            <li> I am in search of the large metal clips.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find any this large.</li>
            <li> but with a certain volume, shape, and curled under at the ends.  </li>
            <li> volume and style without the classic hot roller children&#x27;s pageant queen look.  </li>
            <li> I like this, but if you want to actually have curly hair, you would be better off buying a set with some smaller rollers intermixed with the super jumbos.</li>
            <li> I use it frequently and my hair stays soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This roller set and a whole bunch of clips are now under my bathroom sink--don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever use them.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s very time efficient.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I can wear it curly or straight.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work very well either.</li>
            <li> The rollers flip flop around so you cant really move your head much or the rollers may fall off your head.</li>
            <li> and she really appreciated the gift.</li>
            <li> I really like these rollers</li>
            <li> these curlers don&#x27;t do much of anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> Second the instructions that come with the rollers say that there is an indicator light that comes on when the rollers are ready for use, no such light ever came on when I used them.</li>
            <li> It took forever to do my whole head...</li>
            <li> These rollers heat up fast and hold the temperature well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit too much for me, i don&#x27;t like to look &#x27;&#x27;fancy&#x27;&#x27;.</li>
            <li> These curlers don&#x27;t really do much.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s also no indicator way to let you know the curlers are ready.  </li>
            <li> Overall they just feel &#x27;cheap&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Clips don&#x27;t hold very well.  </li>
            <li> I  don&#x27;t have to spend as much time straightening my hair.</li>
            <li> Just a gentle curve in my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> I really would not recommend buying these at all.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am now addicted to these 2 inch rollers because my hair looks definitely more voluminous!!!!</li>
            <li> I love the Conair products overall but these hot rollers are the perfect size for longer, thick hair and really provides long lasting curls.</li>
            <li> Finally ... a FULL set of real jumbo 2&amp;#34; rollers!  </li>
            <li> I have to thank reviewers for this rollerset who gave me the idea to buy additional Conair Hot roller Super Clips (actually purchased from Amazon).</li>
            <li> Also I may get an occasional large curl here and there, but these rollers make the rest of my hair very loosely full and wavy, not curly.</li>
            <li> glad someone FINALLY made a hot roller this big!  </li>
            <li> I am going to have to find some other clips that work better.</li>
            <li> I purchased other clips so I&#x27;m hoping they will work much better.</li>
            <li> I think these are better for your hair than other heating tools.</li>
            <li> For the record I didn&#x27;t experience the problems with the clips that many other reviewers did, for me it was just a matter of positioning them correctly.  </li>
            <li> This was my very first set of hot curlers - I have a lot of very long (mid-low back) fine hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing I am not crazy about are the clips which can leave dents/creases in your hair, especially if you have baby fine hair.  </li>
            <li> They heat up super fast and the clips actually work!</li>
            <li> set feels cheap and the heating system is positively strange.  </li>
            <li> Now that I have seen the full potential of these rollers...</li>
            <li> I only keep them in my hair for about 5 minutes and then allow the waves to cool before I brush my hair.  </li>
            <li> They are a little loose and easily can fall out, otherwise I love them.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t have the feature where the rollers light up when ready, and it probably won&#x27;t work on wet hair.  </li>
            <li> If you put the clip in with the longer prongs on the outside of the curler/shorter prongs next to your scalp and make sure the part you grasp is closest to your head they will stay in snugly even with movement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very chic and everyday appropriate.  </li>
            <li> You will have to either let them hang on the ends of your hair, with results similar to curling the ends with a jumbo curling iron, or possibly buy better clips.  </li>
            <li> love hot rollers for the ease of them, but until I found this set, they have always been too small for me.  </li>
            <li> They should design them like the older clips, which have a lot of contact surface and don&#x27;t leave &amp;#34;marks&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I also think they should give you metal clips, in addition to the plastic, and more than eight, since there is no way of ordering extras and they are so light weight they can be easily be broken.</li>
            <li> I have an older but faster</li>
            <li> Major disappointment because these rollers would otherwise provide the perfect smooth, voluminous bounce to my flat hair!</li>
            <li> The set comes with its own plastic clips; they usually hold pretty well, although occasionally I end up having to re-roll certain sections to make it so the clips will keep the roller in my hair.</li>
            <li> I really liked the hot rollers but because the rollers are big and heavy, the clips cannot keep hair in place.</li>
            <li> The clip allows the roller to slide so the curls on top aren&#x27;t tight.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I only need warm rollers to get volume, not hot.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally curly--too curly because I was it to be straight.  </li>
            <li> I have had these for a few months now and love them.</li>
            <li> you roll each one and by the time you get to the last one, you&#x27;re ready to take off the first one.  </li>
            <li> Next, use the clips provided with these rollers which have four really long teeth on the top of the roller and besides grasping the roller you&#x27;re clipping onto the bottom clip as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the clips, but they do work for most of the rolls.  </li>
            <li> when i purchashed them i had hair down back 10inches past my shoulders and they worked great!</li>
            <li> (my guess is not so well because it took the full 10 minutes to get it &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; when the air was dry).  </li>
            <li> but all this really does is smooth out your hair and give it a little texture.</li>
            <li> I have longish hair and have used the 11/2 inch rollers forever and thought I&#x27;d try something new.</li>
            <li> First, I put hair gel on and let it dry straight without using a air dryer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Conair hot rollers before, just a smaller size, so I knew what I was getting.</li>
            <li> Through the years, every time I saw hot rollers with a bit bigger roller, I would buy them.  </li>
            <li> (if that is a possible grade) I bought this hot roller set from Ulta.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is because it&#x27;s jumbo or if it is that it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, but even when I set my hair for 45 minutes it didn&#x27;t hold.</li>
            <li> Unless you have super, super thick hair, these do not hold the roller in your hair.</li>
            <li> which is usually is about 5-7 minutes, and the rollers are warm enough to use.</li>
            <li> The rollers do have the slit in the middle, which I usually don&#x27;t like (but honestly did not have an issue with on this set).  </li>
            <li> May be good for someone with thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for large curls/waves, and these rollers are just way too big to set my hair.</li>
            <li> Once broken or lost there is nothing which will fit this huge size, and you are left with no ability to use the set.</li>
            <li> (People think that sounds heavenly, but it can be a curse with humidity, especially when I want it straight.)  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used them three times so far.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for my long and sometimes frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Wish these had the old fashioned metal pins..</li>
            <li> I applaud the company for trying to make plastic clips that don&#x27;t leave a mark, but you really need to go back to the metal pins...</li>
            <li> and they left my hair very shiny with zero frizz.</li>
            <li> the only thing is, the clips don&#x27;t hold very well.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and the style lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> I returned these 2 inchers and bought smaller ones at ULTA that I am much happier with.</li>
            <li> Actually, she could use 2 sets because she has so much</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a clip that will work seamlessly with this size roller.</li>
            <li> My hair came out fuller when it was 100% dry first.  </li>
            <li> I have long normal to fine hair which typically takes well to heat, and these did nothing.</li>
            <li> Since my hair curls really easily, I end up with too tight of curls with smaller rollers, even the 1 1/4&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they get hot enough for my almost coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Be aware that the curls/waves produced are VERY loose and proceed accordingly with your purchase.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend with thick hair loves these large curlers, can only enhance her significant beauty.</li>
            <li> I try new hair products and tools constantly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give this a few more tries and leave them in a lot longer, etc.</li>
            <li> -The rollers don&#x27;t get quite as hot as other sets I have owned unless you let it sit for a while.</li>
            <li> Also I am not very good at roller placement, so I do tend to get a crimp or line if I get messy with placing the SUPER clips onto rolled hair, but most of the time it&#x27;s not very visible</li>
            <li> The rollers are VERY big, and so they work really well with long hair.  </li>
            <li> They gave you big bouncy body and your hair was shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> I wanted extra large rollers for loose waves and volume.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my hair curling time in half with hot rollers</li>
            <li> A little hard to get used to using to make the clamps stay in well - curlers are nice though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick, but only b/c I have lots of fine hair.  </li>
            <li> The rollers do not get as hot as the ones with 4 big rollers, and 8 smaller ones - resulting in a less firm curl that releases fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> This would be frustrating to anyone who wanted to use these the same way most people generally use those enormous Velcro rollers.</li>
            <li> This particular one would work well for long hair only - and only for smoothing effect, not curl.</li>
            <li> know some folks have complained about the clips, but I actually love these as the other type of clips sometimes crimp my hair if I do not place them correctly.</li>
            <li> I have soft waves and my hair that is medium long.</li>
            <li> Other Conairs &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; rollers in other machines only measure 1.5 or 1.75 so these were the only rollers that I saw on the shelf at Ulta that measured 2 full inches.</li>
            <li> Big soft curves on long hair.  </li>
            <li> but they are just a little to large.  </li>
            <li> why wouldn&#x27;t conair make normal xlarge metal pins like other curlers?  </li>
            <li> I know they are jumbo, but my hair goes down the middle of my back and comes out straight when I wear them.  </li>
            <li> After I use them my hair looks straight with a little curve at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different ways of rolling the hair and different ways of clipping, and I still get crimps, which I have to get out with a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m back to a flat iron and giant Velcro curlers.</li>
            <li> At first, i thought these were useless but after sticking with it and giving it a few more tries, i figured out how to use it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair, and I found that eight hot rollers were not enough to get my hair the way I envisioned.</li>
            <li> I tried the rollers and they wouldn&#x27;t stay in my 12&amp;#34; long below thew shoulder hair with the clips and the extra clam style holders.</li>
            <li> or I have to use a flat iron tool to press out the crimp afterwards.</li>
            <li> They are about the same size as the giant dry rollers I used as a teenager back in the 70&#x27;s when I had hair down to the middle of my back in length.  </li>
            <li> I attempted holding them with a hair net which worked only partially.</li>
            <li> I got the jumbo because I wanted big, loose curls...</li>
            <li> But my biggest complaint is the flimsey plastic clips that do not hold the rollers in well and make unatractive large marks in my hair that do not come out all day.  </li>
            <li> My long hair looks curled</li>
            <li> -Takes a long time to fully heat up.</li>
            <li> She tried to use it on my 8 inch long hair and the curlers would not stay in.  </li>
            <li> Once the hair is rolled around the roller, the rollers are held in place with long claw clips.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter who has very long luscious locks</li>
            <li> Every inch of my frizzy hair must be heat treated after I blow dry</li>
            <li> but if you have crazy hair like mine that you would like to smooth and straighten look no further.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to blow it dry as I like it, but then it becomes unkempt and frizzy when I am in the wind or the rain.  </li>
            <li> This was too loose a curl for me.</li>
            <li> even though I left them in for half an hour.  </li>
            <li> They are super flimsy and difficult to use and don&#x27;t hold the curlers in place well at all.</li>
            <li> I read the bad reviews about not being able to keep them in your hair with the clips</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the clips are too flimsy and don&#x27;t provide enough &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; for the rollers.</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t know how it will work with wet hair</li>
            <li> LOVE the big curlers but HATE the clips.</li>
            <li> Rather than the normal roller well with a metal piece that protrudes up into the roller to heat them individually, there is a big piece of raw metal awkwardly set in the middle that passes through all of the rollers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but 8, 2 inch rollers just isn&#x27;t enough for a normal persons hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind a little less curl with those and do that one last.  </li>
            <li> Once with slightly damp hair and the other two times on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, the rollers are very heavy and the clips just don&#x27;t make enough contact with the rollers to prevent the rollers from  continually slipping  out of my hair  which is shoulder length, and need rerolling.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair and only want the jumbo rollers.</li>
            <li> I bought two other kinds of clips, but those, too did not work.  </li>
            <li> the clips from my other roller set,</li>
            <li> Any other roller gives me curls</li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers -</li>
            <li> Should have listened to all of the other reviews about it.</li>
            <li> They give me the result i couldn&#x27;t even describe due to never having it before.</li>
            <li> I notice other people share this issue.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, past my shoulder blades, with slight layering and long bangs.  </li>
            <li> ,my only gripe is the clips,it is hard to get them positioned in a way to keep the rollers in place..</li>
            <li> Not worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian and have thick, coarse, frizzy, below-shoulders length hair.</li>
            <li> After a few tries you can roll your hair in no time and then jerk them out and brush and go.</li>
            <li> I still couldn&#x27;t  move my head around wihtout them coming off;  the rollers roled off before they cooled down.</li>
            <li> The pins the should keep them in place kept falling down out of the curl they were positioned in.</li>
            <li> Not so bad for long hair that cover this up, but it was too hot for my &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> Everything the others claimed to do for less than half the price.  </li>
            <li> rolling less hair in them will increase the lieklyhood they stay in place.</li>
            <li> Not worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and layered and thick and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair and these rollers</li>
            <li> These are not useful at all; the clips do NOT hold the rollers, and once you manage to get the clip in and the roller to stay in place (no easy feat)</li>
            <li> I use a little bit of aniti-frizz gel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how they will work in other types of hair</li>
            <li> If you have very thick hair, you might need a larger set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t dried out my hair.  </li>
            <li> the clip doesn&#x27;t hold it in place, so I hold it there for a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> However, the rollers were so heavy they just fell out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> What sold me on these is one reviewer saying that this is the closest thing to a round brush</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The rollers a re heavy and</li>
            <li> I think they would work well if one can find a way to keep them in place firmly.</li>
            <li> Rollers were too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I was getting so tired of using my big 2 inch curling iron on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I will have to buy another set of heavy duty clips to keep the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> They are too heavy.</li>
            <li> curlers too heavy to stay in hair.  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of $50.</li>
            <li> in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> , I got a lot of compliments on my first use of these rollers with the disastrous clips that came with the rollers.</li>
            <li> In the summer I let it air dry, but usually have to dry and curl it in the winter and when it&#x27;s chilly outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have hair just past my shoulders</li>
            <li> /&gt;As usual with Conair products</li>
            <li> Conair set, no foam, but the rollers are too small (largest 1.5 inches).  </li>
            <li> (The really expensive brand has smaller rollers--read the small print.)</li>
            <li> My hair is past my sholder 3 inches.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a bit hard to keep the rollers in my hair with the included plastic clips.  </li>
            <li> How hard would it have been to put a switch on this?  </li>
            <li> It is really hard to find an 8 roller set that is all 2&amp;#34; in diameter.  </li>
            <li> They have dropped the price with all the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> But I have thick hair, and the included clips did not hold the rollers in my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> I rolled my thick hair up in the roller, clipped it with the clips that come with it, and then take a ponytail holder (elastic, whatever) and wrapped it around the end of the curler on part of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Yes I have quite thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I mean nothing.  </li>
            <li> They are next to impossible to keep them in your hair with those clips.</li>
            <li> No really, to get the rollers to stay on your head with these clips is nearly impossible, unless you jam them into the front of the roller, where your hair is being rolled away from your head.</li>
            <li> This item arrived with a broken lid.  </li>
            <li> Annoyed.</li>
            <li> I should have returned them but the postage is too expensive.</li>
            <li> This makes it really difficult to get them set on your head.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair tends to get dry at the ends and curlers&amp;straighteners are just horrible with that.</li>
            <li> I agree that having to unplug the kit rather than having a switch cheapens the set and is inconvenient for the owner.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Impossible to keep rollers in your hair.</li>
            <li> Or just travel with Velcro rollers and use a hotel room blow-dryer and leave these rollers at home :-(</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in these rollers.  </li>
            <li> Was very disappointing save</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the clips; they&#x27;re worthless.</li>
            <li> But these clips are very bad.  </li>
            <li> Had to return to Amazon, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> so annoying!</li>
            <li> Also the clips are horrible.</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
            <li> and it was insanely frizzy for some reason.</li>
            <li> the roller clamps, however, are awful and don&#x27;t keep the curlers in your hair.  </li>
            <li> and these are the worst.</li>
            <li> Also, the clips it comes with are terrible.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Terrible hair setter!  </li>
            <li> your money product is awful.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This item arrived with a broken lid.  I tried the rollers and they wouldn&#x27;t stay in my 12&amp;#34; long below thew shoulder hair with the clips and the extra clam style holders.Returned them for a refund.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get as hot as I prefer, but they do heat up fast.  The clips do NOT hold rollers in.</li>
            <li> I just love my hair curlers.  The clips that hold them in do not leave any creases in my hair.  They are a little loose and easily can fall out, otherwise I love them.</li>
            <li> great for big body...no curl.  But that was exactly what I was looking for :)</li>
            <li> I have medium length wavy bob ... they are almost too big, but they do create shape instead of curl and I like that!</li>
            <li> The rollers are good, and heat up quickly.  But I have thick hair, and the included clips did not hold the rollers in my hair at all.  I bought two other kinds of clips, but those, too did not work.  This roller set and a whole bunch of clips are now under my bathroom sink--don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever use them.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my long hair!</li>
            <li> PERFECT SIZE. AND PRICE. WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO FIND ROLLERS THAT WERE 2.5&amp;#34; IN DIAMETER THAT WERE AT A GOOD PRICE. THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> I got a waver from another company paying twice this price.  Though I liked the volume it gave me, it didn&#x27;t do anything else that it said it would, like heat up quickly, keep the volume a long time, make my hair shiny and not dry it out, and the clips did not hold the rollers, so they were always moving around my head.  So I sent them back.  Still wanted the volume without the curl, so searched for something else. I found these and figured why not.  LOVE THEM. Heats up quickly.  Gives me the right amount of volume without the curl.  Haven&#x27;t dried out my hair.  Everything the others claimed to do for less than half the price.  I only have two complaints.  Wish there were 12 instead of just 8 and there is no place to store the clips.  I clip them on the cord.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Conair hot rollers before, just a smaller size, so I knew what I was getting. Rollers themselves are nice. Large, heat up fast, comfortable on hands even when hot. The clips that are included are just a joke. Unless you have super, super thick hair, these do not hold the roller in your hair. Just ordered the full clam clips so I&#x27;m out another $10 for that.</li>
            <li> I have had these for a few months now and love them. They could be my favorite purchase ever. I put them in, do something else for 5-10 minutes, take them out and let the curls cool while I put on make up then comb the curls out - done!  I noticed a lot of complaints about the clips but I did not have a problem with them.  If you put the clip in with the longer prongs on the outside of the curler/shorter prongs next to your scalp and make sure the part you grasp is closest to your head they will stay in snugly even with movement.</li>
            <li> This set works wonders for me.  My long hair looks curled just right I&#x27;m so glad I looked to see if larger rollers existed.  Great item.  Very happy.</li>
            <li> These are good.  They do not curl my hair, but give it waves and volume.  I recommend buying an extra set of clips and securing both sides of rollers.  That&#x27;s the only way these will stay in my hair.</li>
            <li> This was my very first set of hot curlers - I have a lot of very long (mid-low back) fine hair. I only wash my hair 2-3 times a week, so I wanted a way to set a lot of volume in my hair and have it last. I&#x27;m still working on technique, but these curlers are fabulous! I end up using 7 of them (3 on top, 2 on each side) and since they are such large rollers, they can handle all of my hair easily. If you have very thick hair, you might need a larger set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These heat up quickly (although there is no on/off switch; you must unplug from the wall, which I don&#x27;t mind) and I leave them in for about 20 minutes while I get dressed and do my makeup. By the time I&#x27;m finished, I take the curlers out and have large waves! The set comes with its own plastic clips; they usually hold pretty well, although occasionally I end up having to re-roll certain sections to make it so the clips will keep the roller in my hair. If you have any metal clips, save them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think these are a fantastic value. They&#x27;re attractive, heat up quickly, and work great.</li>
            <li> Pros: -Cheap price for a full set of super jumbo rollers. -Adds volume and style without the classic hot roller children&#x27;s pageant queen look.  It&#x27;s very chic and everyday appropriate.  The effect is very similar to when I straighten my hair and then use a jumbo curling iron on the ends to give them a tiny bit of movement. -Saves time over curling irons in the morning.  I didn&#x27;t buy these specifically for special occasions, I just wanted to look groomed/professional and not like I was about to attend a wedding.  I can quickly throw these in, do my makeup, and take them out before I head out the door.  I get a passably kept up effect that&#x27;s very time efficient.  You can also spend more time fussing with these and get a very va-va-voom effect that&#x27;s appropriate for going out.  Cons: -The set feels cheap and the heating system is positively strange.  Rather than the normal roller well with a metal piece that protrudes up into the roller to heat them individually, there is a big piece of raw metal awkwardly set in the middle that passes through all of the rollers. -Takes a long time to fully heat up. -The rollers don&#x27;t get quite as hot as other sets I have owned unless you let it sit for a while. -These don&#x27;t really &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34;.  They sort of straighten with a bit of a wave and some volume on the ends.  I like this, but if you want to actually have curly hair, you would be better off buying a set with some smaller rollers intermixed with the super jumbos. -The clips will not hold the rollers on top of your head as one might do with Velcro rollers to add volume.  You will have to either let them hang on the ends of your hair, with results similar to curling the ends with a jumbo curling iron, or possibly buy better clips.  This would be frustrating to anyone who wanted to use these the same way most people generally use those enormous Velcro rollers.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian and have thick, coarse, frizzy, below-shoulders length hair. I try new hair products and tools constantly. I have used Conair hot rollers in the past. This particular one would work well for long hair only - and only for smoothing effect, not curl. I prefer the T3 rollers ($99 on Amazon) and buy 2-4 extra rollers to have on hand ($20/pair) - the T3 are superior rollers and MUCH better for travel. This Conair set is way too large to travel.</li>
            <li> The rollers nice and large and the unit is compact.  However, it&#x27;s a bit hard to keep the rollers in my hair with the included plastic clips.  I like the old wire type pins better.</li>
            <li> Super large rollers create body and sleekness if you know how to use them. Wish the clips were designed better so they don&#x27;t show crimping on top layer of hair. Otherwise, I&#x27;m glad I purchased them.</li>
            <li> These rollers are perfect for me.  I have long hair, past my shoulder blades, with slight layering and long bangs.  My hair is curly, but not kinky and it gets frizzy/poofy with humidity.  It&#x27;s thick, but only b/c I have lots of fine hair.  I can wear it curly or straight.  (People think that sounds heavenly, but it can be a curse with humidity, especially when I want it straight.)  In the summer I let it air dry, but usually have to dry and curl it in the winter and when it&#x27;s chilly outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love hot rollers for the ease of them, but until I found this set, they have always been too small for me.  Since my hair curls really easily, I end up with too tight of curls with smaller rollers, even the 1 1/4&amp;#34; rollers that some would consider big.  Through the years, every time I saw hot rollers with a bit bigger roller, I would buy them.  Most of the time I would end up using my large barrel curling iron to get a softer curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m am so happy with these.  I just got them and I&#x27;ve used them three times so far.  Once with slightly damp hair and the other two times on dry hair.  My hair came out fuller when it was 100% dry first.  The curls I get are soft, more like waves.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier, exactly what I wanted, a bit more body than what the curling iron gave me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for curly hair with these, then get a different set with smaller rollers.  If your hair is fine and straighter, I would imagine that these would do nothing for you.  Straight/fine hair would probably slip right off of these rollers.  If you&#x27;re looking to soften your curl like I was, then get these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use all eight, four on top and four on the bottom.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the clips, but they do work for most of the rolls.  The last roller closer to my forehead, flips forward b/c the clip doesn&#x27;t hold it in place, so I hold it there for a few seconds.  That is for my bangs, so I don&#x27;t mind a little less curl with those and do that one last.  Itried the clips from my other roller set, but they didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cut my hair curling time in half with hot rollers b/c you roll each one and by the time you get to the last one, you&#x27;re ready to take off the first one.  Not like a curling iron b/c you have to hold it on each spot before you move to the next.  I use a little bit of aniti-frizz gel and I have body all day with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad someone FINALLY made a hot roller this big!  Yay!</li>
            <li> So easy to use, heats up quickly and leaves my hair smooth and shiny in the matter of minutes.  Exactly what I was looking for my long and sometimes frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  May need to buy the 1 1/2 inch rollers too</li>
            <li> My guess is that if this product and its clips had been tested and reviewed by women across the country before production, this wouldn&#x27;t have gone into production.  First of all, it doesn&#x27;t have an on/off switch.  How hard would it have been to put a switch on this?  The rollers are VERY big, and so they work really well with long hair.  You need to roll from the bottom up. But these clips are very bad.  A woman wouldn&#x27;t have designed these.  If you grab the clips into the hair, you can get the rollers to stay in, but then you will have a crimp in your hair. I&#x27;ve tried different ways of rolling the hair and different ways of clipping, and I still get crimps, which I have to get out with a flat iron.  Otherwise, the case is nice and is probably good for traveling.  But these clips have got to go.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how big around 2 inches are</li>
            <li> LOVE the big curlers but HATE the clips. DO not hold the rollers in place! This would be 5 star if the clips worked or if it came with the metal pins most curler sets do. Conair need to rework the clips and offer them for sale separately or offer the metal pins for rollers this size.</li>
            <li> They heat up super fast and the clips actually work! I am Supper happy with these, when i purchashed them i had hair down back 10inches past my shoulders and they worked great! Now my hair is to my shoulders and they still work wonderful!</li>
            <li> would not stay in your hair... loved the size...</li>
            <li> It does a great job but the curlers don&#x27;t stay in well.  It would be nice to have a couple of extra clips.</li>
            <li> The rollers produce a nice size curl. The clips do not stay in my hair!!! Constantly re-clipping....so annoying! Wish these had the old fashioned metal pins.. Come on, Conair...test your products!</li>
            <li> Before buying I read the reviews about how the cheap clips that are included don&#x27;t hold the rollers so I purchased separately the Conair clips for all size rollers. They don&#x27;t work very well either. The rollers flip flop around so you cant really move your head much or the rollers may fall off your head. I have a set of  hot rollers that are 30 years old and the clips are simple U shaped metal and they work great but dint fit these huge rollers. Why couldn&#x27;t Conair use something like that instead of cheap plastic that doesn&#x27;t work?  Also I should have ordered the 1-1/2 &amp;#34; instead of 2&amp;#34; but that&#x27;s my own fault. I should have returned them but the postage is too expensive. I don&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair, and I found that eight hot rollers were not enough to get my hair the way I envisioned. Also, the clips that come with the hot rollers did not do a good job at holding the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my Infiniti Pro rollers. I have hair just past my shoulders and I get perfect results, soft waves, in just a few minutes. I ordered another set  for my daughter and she really appreciated the gift. I also bought the super clips for my daughter which she likes very much. Her hair is much longer and thicker and needed more support. But I found I can manage just fine with the original clips. My sister is getting a set for her birthday today. She will also get the clips because her hair is shorter and frizzy. I have had four different sets of electric rollers in my life and this is the best ever for someone with shoulder length to long hair who is looking for soft curls.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for large curls/waves, and these rollers are just way too big to set my hair. I have long normal to fine hair which typically takes well to heat, and these did nothing. Further, the clips provided do not hold the rollers in place. The rollers are so big that even with the clips in they don&#x27;t stay in place and are just flopping around. This makes it really difficult to get them set on your head. Not worth the money for me.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a larger roller, because often the 1 1/2&amp;#34; rollers make my hair too wavy. This was too loose a curl for me. I am going to try the set with 1 3/4&amp;#34; and 1 1/2 combined. This size doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; the curl as well. I agree that having to unplug the kit rather than having a switch cheapens the set and is inconvenient for the owner. But my biggest complaint is the flimsey plastic clips that do not hold the rollers in well and make unatractive large marks in my hair that do not come out all day.  Also, the rollers are very heavy and the clips just don&#x27;t make enough contact with the rollers to prevent the rollers from  continually slipping  out of my hair  which is shoulder length, and need rerolling. They should design them like the older clips, which have a lot of contact surface and don&#x27;t leave &amp;#34;marks&amp;#34;.  I also think they should give you metal clips, in addition to the plastic, and more than eight, since there is no way of ordering extras and they are so light weight they can be easily be broken. Once broken or lost there is nothing which will fit this huge size, and you are left with no ability to use the set.</li>
            <li> Hot rollers &#x3D; A+ Clips provided with Hot rollers &#x3D; F- (if that is a possible grade) I bought this hot roller set from Ulta. I have only used Velcro rollers with a blow dryer until now. My main goal was to got more volume on top of my head/crown area since I have fine/thin/Southeast Asian hair. I couldn&#x27;t decide what size rollers to buy, so the sales-lady asked me if I wanted Volume or &amp;#34;YAY-big&amp;#34; volume, and I said I wanted YAY-BIG hair. So I bought this set especially since the rollers are 2 inches. Other Conairs &amp;#34;jumbo&amp;#34; rollers in other machines only measure 1.5 or 1.75 so these were the only rollers that I saw on the shelf at Ulta that measured 2 full inches. Things I love: If timed right with unplugging the machine, the rollers don&#x27;t get too hot, the ends are cool enough to hold. And yes, I did get BIG hair. I used BIGSEXY hair spray prior to rolling, but yes I get volume on top of my hair and throughout my hair. Things I don&#x27;t mind: There is no on/off switch so I have to be mindful when I have to unplug the machine, which is usually is about 5-7 minutes, and the rollers are warm enough to use. If I don&#x27;t watch the time, the machine will keep warming up the rollers and they can get hot. I only need warm rollers to get volume, not hot. Also I may get an occasional large curl here and there, but these rollers make the rest of my hair very loosely full and wavy, not curly. I have to bring out my curling iron if I want curls in specific areas. But usually I&#x27;m just so happy to see big voluminous hair especially on TOP of my head that I don&#x27;t miss curls. Also I am not very good at roller placement, so I do tend to get a crimp or line if I get messy with placing the SUPER clips onto rolled hair, but most of the time it&#x27;s not very visible or I have to use a flat iron tool to press out the crimp afterwards. Things I don&#x27;t like at all: The clips with the rollers to set the rollers are just an embarrassment to Conair, or should be. I have to thank reviewers for this rollerset who gave me the idea to buy additional Conair Hot roller Super Clips (actually purchased from Amazon). The super clips have allowed me to use me these rollers more frequently. If I hadn&#x27;t bought the clips, this roller set was halfway back to being returned to Ulta. But I have to admit, I got a lot of compliments on my first use of these rollers with the disastrous clips that came with the rollers. Sometimes I use the flimsy clips on the sides of the Conair Super Clips for securing the rollers a bit more. Also I don&#x27;t like the weight of the machine. I can&#x27;t imagine these being in my carry-on bag..I would definitely have to check that bag in. Or just travel with Velcro rollers and use a hotel room blow-dryer and leave these rollers at home :-( Now that I have seen the full potential of these rollers...I don&#x27;t want to leave them home. Overall, I am now addicted to these 2 inch rollers because my hair looks definitely more voluminous!!!!</li>
            <li> Good product, but as many others have said, the clips are totally useless.  If you manage not to move your head at all, it works.  Who has that kind of time?</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great product as I like Conair hair products.  However, the rollers were so heavy they just fell out of my hair.  I looked and looked for hot rollers that were 2&amp;#34; diameter and thought these would do the trick.  Not so.  Sent them back.</li>
            <li> But my hair is long, thick and kind of wavy (not in a nice way!). What sold me on these is one reviewer saying that this is the closest thing to a round brush blow out you can get outside of a salon. They don&#x27;t work that well for me. I don&#x27;t think they get hot enough for my almost coarse hair. But I&#x27;ll bet they&#x27;d be great for normal to fine hair. And for what it&#x27;s worth I don&#x27;t get why so many reviewers complain about the clips not working. Mine work just fine. I&#x27;m going to give this a few more tries and leave them in a lot longer, etc. But for now I&#x27;m going to say &amp;#34;Not for thick/heavy hair.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I really like these rollers but they are just a little to large.  I have layered hair, so I can only use them for the bottom layers.  They are the biggest rollers I have every seen in hot rollers. They are about the same size as the giant dry rollers I used as a teenager back in the 70&#x27;s when I had hair down to the middle of my back in length.  Very good quality, and they create a nice full, smooth look with just enough turn-under at the ends of the hair.</li>
            <li> These rollers are the perfect size to add bounce and fullness to my bra length hair. My only complaint is that the clips are too flimsy and don&#x27;t provide enough &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; for the rollers. They allow the rollers to loosen and then create a kink right by the crown in the form of the clip. I am going to have to find some other clips that work better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but 8, 2 inch rollers just isn&#x27;t enough for a normal persons hair and I can&#x27;t find replacements anywhere.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money. Be aware that the curls/waves produced are VERY loose and proceed accordingly with your purchase.</li>
            <li> These are not useful at all; the clips do NOT hold the rollers, and once you manage to get the clip in and the roller to stay in place (no easy feat) the curl falls out in no time. I have longish hair and have used the 11/2 inch rollers forever and thought I&#x27;d try something new. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The clips do not hold the rollers in place, no matter what you to try to keep them on. The rollers a re heavy and the clips flimsy. Eight rollers are not enough for a head so you need to do it in 2 steps or purchase 2 sets, especially since rolling less hair in them will increase the lieklyhood they stay in place. I have soft waves and my hair that is medium long. I attempted holding them with a hair net which worked only partially. I still couldn&#x27;t  move my head around wihtout them coming off;  the rollers roled off before they cooled down. However, I still saw the effects on my hair, that lost its frizz and became smoother (no curls or waves, though). I think they would work well if one can find a way to keep them in place firmly.</li>
            <li> They were too big and when I tried to send back to USA it was going to cost me $60 au so keeping them and hopefully someone in the family can use them. Then I went to an electrical store and purchased a Remington set on special for $20 and they are amazing Pia doyle I will never get caught again in buying anything from the U.S.</li>
            <li> Great my wife loves them</li>
            <li> I have fine, medium thickness hair that is about 5 inches below my shoulders and these curlers don&#x27;t do much of anything for my hair. After I use them my hair looks straight with a little curve at the bottom. Also the clips are horrible. They are super flimsy and difficult to use and don&#x27;t hold the curlers in place well at all.</li>
            <li> Never quite figured out how to use these, but it might just be me.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love these hot rollers but they just didn&#x27;t do it for me. First of all the clips did not keep the hot rollers in place at all. Second the instructions that come with the rollers say that there is an indicator light that comes on when the rollers are ready for use, no such light ever came on when I used them. I think these rollers have a potential to be great, they heat up fast and they kept the volume in my hair pretty much all day. I purchased other clips so I&#x27;m hoping they will work much better.</li>
            <li> this roller set is so easy to use and the price was right. I use it frequently and my hair stays soft and smooth. I needed to buy this one because my hair uses more than 8 rollers. This one is the best.</li>
            <li> Rollers were too heavy.  The pins the should keep them in place kept falling down out of the curl they were positioned in.</li>
            <li> I LOVE these curlers!  I wanted just a nice wave...not a tight curl, and these are perfect!  I was getting so tired of using my big 2 inch curling iron on my hair.  It took forever to do my whole head...standing there waiting for each bunch to curl.  Now, I roll these 8 curlers through my hair, go finish up my makeup and getting dressed, take the curlers out and I&#x27;m done!  These are perfect if you have the long layers like I do.  I highly recommend these!!!</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed in these rollers.  I tried everything to keep them from falling out.  Not worth the trouble. May be good for someone with thick, long hair.</li>
            <li> Heats fast and rollers are a nice large size for a softer curl. I think these are better for your hair than other heating tools.</li>
            <li> I applaud the company for trying to make plastic clips that don&#x27;t leave a mark, but you really need to go back to the metal pins...and these don;t heat up all that well.</li>
            <li> I love the Conair products overall but these hot rollers are the perfect size for longer, thick hair and really provides long lasting curls.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. WORKS GREAT HEATS FAST AND GIVES FULL RELAXED CURLS</li>
            <li> Very happy with product (in fact, I purchased a second one so I could have extra rollers)</li>
            <li> Like it very much. Nice big rollers.</li>
            <li> I really liked the hot rollers but because the rollers are big and heavy, the clips cannot keep hair in place. I will have to buy another set of heavy duty clips to keep the rollers in place.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand how anyone can use these rollers? The clips do not hold them in place at all. You put the roller in with the clip and it falls to the side! I purchased what I thought were better clips and they didn&#x27;t work either. I even tried not moving at all to disturb them...still rolled off to the side. By the time they&#x27;re all in you have a head full of rollers hanging off your head! Awful!</li>
            <li> I love the rollers. They smooth my hair just liked I hoped. HOWEVER! ... They are next to impossible to keep them in your hair with those clips. I have to hold perfectly still and they still fall out. I even have to just hold them in with my hands out of desperation. Might have to return them.</li>
            <li> These rollers have changed my life. My hair is long and layered and thick and frizzy. Any other roller gives me curls and I don&#x27;t want curls. I want to throw rollers in my hair and have them straighten and smooth it while I run around getting ready in the morning. Every inch of my frizzy hair must be heat treated after I blow dry and I don&#x27;t have time to stand and use a straightening iron on every stand of hair on my head. These are perfect. I read the bad reviews about not being able to keep them in your hair with the clips but I decided that if I had to wrap each roller in aluminum foil to get them to stay in my hair I would do that. Nothing was stopping me from using these rollers! Here&#x27;s the trick I came up with to keep them in. Roll them up to your scalp, of course, then use one of the white Conair roller clips (sold separately) with 30 teeth each on the bottom of the roller. Next, use the clips provided with these rollers which have four really long teeth on the top of the roller and besides grasping the roller you&#x27;re clipping onto the bottom clip as well. Voila! It stays. After a few tries you can roll your hair in no time and then jerk them out and brush and go. You get height that is so nice at the scalp. I took one roller out and replaced it with a smaller jumbo roller from another set to use in the crown for added height. Then I just straighten the end of that one curl. I&#x27;m not sure how they will work in other types of hair but if you have crazy hair like mine that you would like to smooth and straighten look no further.</li>
            <li> I wanted lots of body, but not tight curls, for my shoulder length hair and these work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Just tried them for the first time and I&#x27;m really pleased with the results.  For the record I didn&#x27;t experience the problems with the clips that many other reviewers did, for me it was just a matter of positioning them correctly.  No burning fingers on the edges of the rollers, no dreadful smell of human head on fire, and they left my hair very shiny with zero frizz.</li>
            <li> purchased for my wife, who has long hair, she loves them and says they&#x27;re the best for long hair.  the only thing is, the clips don&#x27;t hold very well.  she would recommend them to everyone, very worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have not been able to use these rollers because the power plug is not compatable with Australian Power points.  Annoyed.</li>
            <li> These rollers heat up fast and hold the temperature well. Im very pleased with them. They provide my hair with smooth volume and body without too much curl. I highly recommend them. I am a hair stylist. They more than lived up to my expectations and I have recommended them to my clients. I plan to order the jumbo set as well for the times I want more curl to my style.</li>
            <li> These are ok... I agree with other reviewers - the clips do NOT stay in very well and it is kind of a pain that there is nowhere to keep them.  Mine are in a gallon sized zip lock bag.  They work fine - nothing spectacular.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time for body and straightening. Does not curl hair  out is meant to make waves.</li>
            <li> Could use them as they are American..... Had to return to Amazon, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Impossible to keep rollers in your hair. Should have listened to all of the other reviews about it. They are too heavy. They leave imprints on your hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an expert on hot rollers as this was my first set, but i can say that these are actually pretty good. They give me the result i couldn&#x27;t even describe due to never having it before. The voluminous, well groomed looking hair without the &#x27;&#x27;i just got out of the salon&#x27;&#x27; look. I like my hair to look more natural so i don&#x27;t like to use hot tools a lot. It&#x27;s a bit too much for me, i don&#x27;t like to look &#x27;&#x27;fancy&#x27;&#x27;. Also, my hair tends to get dry at the ends and curlers&amp;straighteners are just horrible with that. They break my hair after each use. These are a lot more gentle. At first, i thought these were useless but after sticking with it and giving it a few more tries, i figured out how to use it. So if you&#x27;re a roller newbie, don&#x27;t return this immediately. You need to figure out how to roll your hair properly first. On my first time, my hair fell within 10 minutes after i took these out and it was insanely frizzy for some reason. But i learned to use it and now it is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> These are my 6th set of hot rollers and I LOVE these hot rollers. They produce nice BIG curls. The biggest I&#x27;ve ever had. Only giving it 4 stars for two reasons: I wish they came with roller pins so that they held the roller in my hair better. I wish it had an on/off switch so I wouldn&#x27;t have to plug and unplug it. I did purchase a power strip to fix the problem.</li>
            <li> Hair clip doesn&#x27;t stay with hair....I will return it</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift. Suppose it works fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair just to my collarbones.  I wanted extra large rollers for loose waves and volume.  These rollers heat up quickly.  I only keep them in my hair for about 5 minutes and then allow the waves to cool before I brush my hair.  I no longer have to spend a lot of time trying to style my hair with hair brushes.  My hair feels soft and the style lasts longer.  I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because the clips feel flimsy.</li>
            <li> The clips broke after first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m updating my review because after a couple years of looking for an answer to the clip situation I&#x27;ve finally figured out something that works.  I rolled my thick hair up in the roller, clipped it with the clips that come with it, and then take a ponytail holder (elastic, whatever) and wrapped it around the end of the curler on part of my hair.  And it STAYS!</li>
            <li> A little hard to get used to using to make the clamps stay in well - curlers are nice though.</li>
            <li> These curlers don&#x27;t really do much.  I know they are jumbo, but my hair goes down the middle of my back and comes out straight when I wear them.  There&#x27;s also no indicator way to let you know the curlers are ready.  The light just comes on when you plug them in and stays on.  Overall they just feel &#x27;cheap&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have very long, thick hair and only want the jumbo rollers. The only drawback are the combs that hold the rollers in. I&#x27;ve had this kind in the past and they don&#x27;t hold the top rollers in very well. These were no exception. The clip allows the roller to slide so the curls on top aren&#x27;t tight. I am in search of the large metal clips. If I find them these will be perfect!!!</li>
            <li> the rollers are great.  the roller clamps, however, are awful and don&#x27;t keep the curlers in your hair.  why wouldn&#x27;t conair make normal xlarge metal pins like other curlers?  I can&#x27;t find any this large. If someone can tell me where to find 2in metal pins, please advise!</li>
            <li> Big soft curves on long hair.  Would not work on short hair.  Was short 2 clips when received. Clips don&#x27;t hold very well.  Would be nice if it had on/off switch instead of having to unplug.</li>
            <li> I love these jumbo rollers. I  don&#x27;t have to spend as much time straightening my hair. Just a gentle curve in my shoulder length hair. If your hair is shorter, I think a smaller roller would work better. The clips work great. I can always trust Conair to make a good product.</li>
            <li> The rollers are good if u want straight hair with body. In my hair they are too big to add curl. I do not like the clips. They do not hold the roller stable. Also, once you opened the package of clips there wasn&#x27;t anything included to contain them.</li>
            <li> Great curlers.  Would be helpful to have different clips than the ones that came with the box.</li>
            <li> curlers too heavy to stay in hair.  Sent back</li>
            <li> I rarely ever give 5 stars, so consider me very happy with these puppies!  The best thing is that there are 8 curlers. The sets of 5 are not quite enough and I always find myself needing 1 or 2 extra, so this set is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As usual with Conair products, the quality is quite nice and these do heat evenly and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know some folks have complained about the clips, but I actually love these as the other type of clips sometimes crimp my hair if I do not place them correctly. It does take a bit of practice to sets these correctly and to get the rollers to stay in place, but honestly, I do like them better.  However, for those of you how don&#x27;t like them or have problems, just grab yourself a set of these guys: Conair SPC10X Super Clips, 10 Count and you&#x27;ll be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loving these curlers and using them ALL the time! Great product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know  how well these rollers work.  The clips that come with them would not hold the rollers in your hair.</li>
            <li> Love the size of the curls made for my very long hair but have no clips to hold them in my hair.</li>
            <li> There is a reason you cannot easily find 2 inch jumbo rollers - they are too large for any CLIP to hold. These rollers fell out of my hair immediately even with different clips purchased separately. Also the plastic container they come in is huge and barely fit on my bathroom vanity. I returned these 2 inchers and bought smaller ones at ULTA that I am much happier with. I can only give this product 1 star because the rollers didn&#x27;t stay in my hair to achieve any result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that I picked this  product.  The rollers are very large and are just right for my very curly hair.  The very first time I used it, my hair came out just as I want it, straight but with a certain volume, shape, and curled under at the ends.  First, I put hair gel on and let it dry straight without using a air dryer.  So I don&#x27;t know how it will work with wet hair (my guess is not so well because it took the full 10 minutes to get it &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; when the air was dry).  The container is surprisingly large but light.  (It has to be big because the curlers are.)  The foam protects your hair and the clips work well--going from the under side of the curl works best.  I have an older but faster Conair set, no foam, but the rollers are too small (largest 1.5 inches).  My hair is naturally curly--too curly because I was it to be straight.  It takes forever to blow it dry as I like it, but then it becomes unkempt and frizzy when I am in the wind or the rain.  This is like magic -- it stayed straight and looking good.  My only complaints--it does take 10 minutes, it doesn&#x27;t have the feature where the rollers light up when ready, and it probably won&#x27;t work on wet hair.  There are a lot of options but this one was reasonably priced and works great. (The really expensive brand has smaller rollers--read the small print.)</li>
            <li> I like them very much.</li>
            <li> Great product - heats up quickly and leaves hair smooth and gently curled.</li>
            <li> Not bad in all but no space for clips.</li>
            <li> These work fine without any issues whatsoever with the right price.</li>
            <li> I truly WANTED this to work...  I read all the posts and I decided the only thing this curling set lacked was the clips. So I bought some. What a disappointment. The clips were kind of flimsy and not as well-made is the original Conair clips of many years ago. And as I read a lot of the reviews the big wire pins that used to hold these kind of rollers in place are nowhere to be found.what a shame! 30 years ago I had a set of steam curlers made by Clairol. They were the best. They gave you big bouncy body and your hair was shiny and soft. I was hoping that these would do the same.The only reason I gave the set three stars instead of one star was because others had somehow made it work. I simply could not. I was balancing curlers and they were flopping out of my hair- I just started laughing and put it all back away and sent it back to Amazon. Best of luck to anyone else that can make it work. I&#x27;m back to a flat iron and giant Velcro curlers. 😄</li>
            <li> They would be fine if the clips were designed better. It does not hold the roller in place at all.</li>
            <li> These are really BIG!  They work great for straightening out my long, curly, frizzy hair.  Heat up pretty quickly, too!</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this,I wanted something that would give a bit of lift and smoothing but not too much curl,this works great,my only gripe is the clips,it is hard to get them positioned in a way to keep the rollers in place..and I would have liked and on and off switch on the unit rather than unplugging..But overall it does a great job and heats up really quickly.</li>
            <li> Conair products are pretty great and the rollers are what I was looking for, but like other reviewers, I agree they will not stay in your hair because of the clips.  Sent this back.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter who has very long luscious locks and she loves it.  Actually, she could use 2 sets because she has so much hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARNING:  She tried to use it on my 8 inch long hair and the curlers would not stay in.  Also, the edges of the curlers get very hot.  Not so bad for long hair that cover this up, but it was too hot for my &amp;#34;short&amp;#34; hair.</li>
            <li> These rollers would work well if the clips worked but the clips dont begin to secure the rollers into place so the rollers flop around and fall out.  If the clips worked, this would be a fantastic product.  I sent an email to Customer Service and they responded by telling me to call Customer Service.  I called Customer Service and the person I spoke to basically told me there is nothing she could suggest that would correct the problem.  I notice other people share this issue.  Kind of disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love these to just add smoothness and volume to my shoulder length hair.  They heat up fast and the clips work great for me.  I ordered because they have 8 curlers and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Might be nice if they stayed in.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many sets (AND I MEAN MANY) of rollers over the years and these are the worst. The clips do not work and the rollers will not stay in your hair. It takes me more time trying to keep the rollers in my hair than if I would have curled my hair with an iron. I really would not recommend buying these at all. It was a waste of $50. They have dropped the price with all the negative reviews. Shame on you Conair!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got the jumbo because I wanted big, loose curls... but all this really does is smooth out your hair and give it a little texture. I don&#x27;t know if it is because it&#x27;s jumbo or if it is that it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, but even when I set my hair for 45 minutes it didn&#x27;t hold. Also, the clips it comes with are terrible. TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> Finally ... a FULL set of real jumbo 2&amp;#34; rollers!  I love these rollers.  It is really hard to find an 8 roller set that is all 2&amp;#34; in diameter.  At 2&amp;#34; diameter, the rollers are not designed to curl hair.  Instead, they are designed to add body/volume and (most importantly!) smooth frizz.  The rollers do a fabulous job at all of those ... NOT curling, adding body and smoothing frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sets heats up quickly ... in a few minutes.  The rollers do have the slit in the middle, which I usually don&#x27;t like (but honestly did not have an issue with on this set).  Once the hair is rolled around the roller, the rollers are held in place with long claw clips.  The key with getting the clip to hold the roller in place is to catch some hair underneath the roller in the clip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy that I finally found a full set of 2&amp;#34; rollers!!</li>
            <li> Terrible hair setter!  The clips for the rollers don&#x27;t work well at all.  I have long, thick hair and these rollers did&lt;br /&gt;nothing even though I left them in for half an hour.  These are going back to Target asap.</li>
            <li> These are great, perfect size for my long, fine hair that doesn&#x27;t hold curl, clips need to be a little tighter though. Overall, very happy!</li>
            <li> These heat up nicely and I like them, but they&#x27;re very large - so my shoulder length hair will have to grow a bit for them to work correctly. They don&#x27;t stay in as is.</li>
            <li> Total dissappointment</li>
            <li> These work great for curling or putting body to  my hair during the week and they are the perfect size for me.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend with thick hair loves these large curlers, can only enhance her significant beauty.</li>
            <li> Works great. I have shoulder length hair and it smooths my hair while giving it volume.</li>
            <li> The rollers do not get as hot as the ones with 4 big rollers, and 8 smaller ones - resulting in a less firm curl that releases fairly quickly. Unless you use a ton of hairspray, your curls probably won&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Does not stay in hair with clips provided</li>
            <li> My hair is past my sholder 3 inches.  Rolled all of hair for 45 minutes.  Did nothing I mean nothing.  Does not get warm enough clips fall out easily.  Yes I have quite thick hair.  Used lots of hairspray.  Was very disappointing save your money product is awful.  Would give 0 stars if I could.</li>
            <li> I so wanted to love these rollers, and having said that, it&#x27;s not the actual rollers I have a problem with- it&#x27;s the clips; they&#x27;re worthless. No really, to get the rollers to stay on your head with these clips is nearly impossible, unless you jam them into the front of the roller, where your hair is being rolled away from your head. This, in turn, leaves a giant indented bump in your hair after the rollers are removed.    I have yet to find a clip that will work seamlessly with this size roller. Major disappointment because these rollers would otherwise provide the perfect smooth, voluminous bounce to my flat hair!</li>
            <li> Good price, works well. no issues. Would buy another.</li>
            <li> If I had longer hair, I would probably give it 5 stars.  The rollers warm up quickly, have a soft velet covering to protect your hair and set beautiful large curls.  The only thing I am not crazy about are the clips which can leave dents/creases in your hair, especially if you have baby fine hair.  Item was received quickly and what the sellers stated the item would be.</li>
