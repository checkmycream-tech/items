            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but what I got was great.</li>

            <li>This is a nice comb, made from flexible plastic</li>
            <li>Its a nice brush comb but a bit over priced</li>
            <li>i ordered this because I liked the look</li>
            <li>very fine toothed.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this week, and it did a great job, of shaping/styling.</li>
            <li>Why do I need eight more words?</li>
            <li>They are cheap but they are handy.</li>
            <li>Just for contacting me and asking me to help their rating better.</li>
            <li>; glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a daily soldiers medicine case.</li>
            <li>and it is very easy to clean</li>
            <li>As a side note, the printed description is more accurate.</li>

            <li>While I&#x27;m not all that enthusiastic about the way the handle fits in my hand with that upward curve, the comb itself is just the right size and gets the job done well.</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and use too</li>
            <li>the teeth were too fine and kept pulling out my moustache hairs.</li>
            <li>You buy cheap, you get cheap.</li>
            <li>I think I paid $4 plus shipping for a cheap plastic comb you could get out of a gumball machine.</li>
            <li>Upon looking for a stache comb I came across this cheap comb.</li>
            <li>I will say I am glad I purchased as the handle does VERY well for a scrape of wax and a quick comb.</li>
            <li>Works great on eyebrows too, pulls the deep follicles fast.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>Could be somewhat useful</li>
            <li>I was a little underwhelmed when I received this comb, but after using it for some time I&#x27;m actually pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li>The size is just right, and the handle is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great, small and combs my moustache well.</li>
            <li>Small, fine-toothed, and very handy</li>
            <li>Nice fine toothed comb and a short enough handle designed just for those of us, regardless of gender, that grow a moustache or a beard.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll do the job but the tweezerman comb is higher quality.</li>
            <li>Although they are pretty sturdy I have managed to break a couple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good everyday comb for your whiskers.</li>
            <li>I love this little comb- son who is 16 has full on beard and mustache-</li>
            <li>This comb looks like more than just a small, cheap piece of plastic.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;wood</li>
            <li>I am rating the product, not so much the seller.</li>
            <li>It did it&#x27;s job really well, until one of my dogs found it.  </li>
            <li>This is a very reliable comb for your mustache.</li>
            <li>I like that they fit in the back pocket of my pants.</li>
            <li>Really well.</li>
            <li>without &amp;#34;outlining&amp;#34; the comb, not that it is all that important to those of us with facial hair.</li>
            <li>Just how high should I rate a $5 cheap comb that probably only cost pennies to manufacture?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dinky and cheap, and feels strange going through the hair.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>he likes looking older</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it to anybody looking for a moustache comb.</li>
            <li>If you are using mustache and beard wax this little comg will rake it right thru your beard and style it quickly.</li>
            <li>If other consumers need to know about the quality of the product, they expect the reviews to be accurate.</li>
            <li>Has a great quality, stiff enough so the teeth wont break and soft enough</li>
            <li>Keeps the stash roller coaster open and ready for whoever wants a ride.</li>
            <li>If you have a moustache, a goatee, or just very little hair on top, this is the pocket comb for you.  </li>
            <li>many mustache combs are just too small to be practical - this one isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because it is a little pricey, but it works as advertised and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>It has some fairly tight teeth which is important for getting a beard/mustache</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find these little combs in stores anymore, so I was quite happy to see them being sold here.</li>
            <li>OLD REVIEW (1 Star)  </li>
            <li>No major complaints really.</li>
            <li>It says mini moustache comb, but it&#x27;s large enough for a moustache of any size, sturdy to take the use of combing the wax out of my moustache and then the inevitable cleaning.</li>
            <li>Not a bad comb but not worth over $1 in total.</li>
            <li>(It sure is tough being non-sexist and PC nowadays</li>
            <li>Equally important, it&#x27;s small enough to slip into my pocket so that I can carry it with me when I go to work.</li>
            <li>I had a very hard time finding one of these locally, thank god for Amazon where there were many options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I had a very hard time finding one of these locally, thank god for Amazon where there were many options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The plastic is a little softer than a normal comb.</li>
            <li> Small size 4&amp;#34; X 1/2&amp;#34; will slip down an open sink drain so be certain of your grip.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly long \\&quot;biker\\&quot; Fu Manchu, and after I take off my helmet, I use the Colonel&#x27;s comb to help make me somewhat presentable again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first I thought the flimsy, bendy-ness was a bad thing, but turns out that the teeth hold up pretty well to usage and abuse and haven&#x27;t broken where other cheap combs may have.       </li>
            <li> Very low quality plastic was used, the comb&#x27;s teeth were mis-shaped from a bad injection molding, then the thing melted under very light hair dryer heat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seems well made, I don&#x27;t anticipate having to replace it until I loose it</li>
            <li> I buy 5 or 6 at a time because I tend to loose them</li>
            <li> I do also find the design lends itself to aid in styling and will purchase another if I cannot find the same style in a little heavier comb.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and rough teeth, it hurts to use it.</li>
            <li> I will average this at a 2.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little flimsy feeling in the hand.</li>
            <li> A little overpriced.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these little combs for years.</li>
            <li> If you got a &#x27;stache that you like a little unruly</li>
            <li> Not sure about carrying it with me all the time because I&#x27;m worried about tooth breakage.</li>
            <li> Probably too small for a &amp;#34;Duck Dynasty&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The worst part is some of the pins in the middle have some extra plastic on the tips from the mold.</li>
            <li> And that would be bad for the stash, and therefore, bad for the ladies.</li>
            <li> You want be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product, it is also overpriced.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;This is probably the worst purchase I&#x27;ve made this year.   </li>

            <li> If you have a moustache, a goatee, or just very little hair on top, this is the pocket comb for you.  Small, fine-toothed, and very handy, I keep mine with me all the time.  I have a fairly long \\&quot;biker\\&quot; Fu Manchu, and after I take off my helmet, I use the Colonel&#x27;s comb to help make me somewhat presentable again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have facial hair in adundance, Colonel Ichabod Conk&#x27;s mini-Moustache Comb is just what you need for on-the-spot grooming repairs.</li>
            <li> Good product, well made,sturdy. Still looking for a smaller, mustache only, comb. Why do I need eight more words? Really?</li>
            <li> UPDATE: 01/16/2014  I was brought back to this review when notified that someone found it helpful. The picture that is there now is of the proper comb. I can further say I&#x27;ve been using these combs for 2.5 years now and have never had a problem with them. They work great on my mustache. I&#x27;ll be upping my rating from 3 to 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Former review left for posterity:&lt;br /&gt;The product is NOT as pictured. The combs I received (set of 3) more closely resemble a cheap knock off of the Tweezerman comb. They&#x27;ll do the job but the tweezerman comb is higher quality. As a side note, the printed description is more accurate. But they need to update the picture.</li>
            <li> good was very pleased with the product was a gift and it was received well.  Thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;wood purchase again.</li>
            <li> Keeps the stash roller coaster open and ready for whoever wants a ride. Great size. very fine toothed. Not sure about carrying it with me all the time because I&#x27;m worried about tooth breakage. And that would be bad for the stash, and therefore, bad for the ladies. ~~~~A+++ Would comb again!~~~</li>
            <li> This comb looks like more than just a small, cheap piece of plastic.  Great quality.  It is definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> I love this little comb- son who is 16 has full on beard and mustache- looks 26- he likes looking older</li>
            <li> So I ordered 3 of these for myself set in a review of 3 stars initially. They are cheap but they are handy. Then the seller contacted me and asked me to reconsider changing their rating to a 4. (Claiming that all they do is resell the product). Well, I don&#x27;t like this approach. I am rating the product, not so much the seller. If other consumers need to know about the quality of the product, they expect the reviews to be accurate. So I am still giving the product a 3...but the seller a 1 star rating. Just for contacting me and asking me to help their rating better. I will average this at a 2. If I am contacted again, I will drop it to a 1 star as it can go no lower. Just how high should I rate a $5 cheap comb that probably only cost pennies to manufacture? It is what it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good everyday comb for your whiskers. It&#x27;s a little flimsy feeling in the hand. The plastic is a little softer than a normal comb. No major complaints really. A little overpriced. Should be something that the 99¢ store has... for 50¢.</li>
            <li> Awesome comb for the price, very strong for the size. Great for carrying in your pocket or using at home.</li>
            <li> It works great, small and combs my moustache well. Would highly recommend it to anybody looking for a moustache comb.</li>
            <li> this is one of the very best mustache comb fits the hand well and it is very easy to clean</li>
            <li> I would stay away from this one... around $6.00 after shipping for what probably cost a penny to make. Very low quality plastic was used, the comb&#x27;s teeth were mis-shaped from a bad injection molding, then the thing melted under very light hair dryer heat.</li>
            <li> This is a nice comb, made from flexible plastic so it won&#x27;t break in your pocket.  I gave it four stars because it is a little pricey, but it works as advertised and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and rough teeth, it hurts to use it. I am very disappointed in this product, it is also overpriced.</li>
            <li> The size is just right, and the handle is convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too many mustache combs are just too small to be practical - this one isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems well made, I don&#x27;t anticipate having to replace it until I loose it (hopefully I don&#x27;t...).</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this week, and it did a great job, of shaping/styling. Easy to hold and use too; glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> work well and quality made</li>
            <li> The teeth are too close together, could barley get a grip on the hairs on my stache. You buy cheap, you get cheap.</li>
            <li> When I bought the moustache comb I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, but what I got was great. It says mini moustache comb, but it&#x27;s large enough for a moustache of any size, sturdy to take the use of combing the wax out of my moustache and then the inevitable cleaning. Equally important, it&#x27;s small enough to slip into my pocket so that I can carry it with me when I go to work.</li>
            <li> I think I paid $4 plus shipping for a cheap plastic comb you could get out of a gumball machine. the teeth were too fine and kept pulling out my moustache hairs. might work for some but I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
            <li> Update:   I was a little underwhelmed when I received this comb, but after using it for some time I&#x27;m actually pretty happy with it.  At first I thought the flimsy, bendy-ness was a bad thing, but turns out that the teeth hold up pretty well to usage and abuse and haven&#x27;t broken where other cheap combs may have.       I&#x27;m upping my review.    OLD REVIEW (1 Star)  \\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;This is probably the worst purchase I&#x27;ve made this year.   The comb is the thinnest flimsiest piece of plastic imaginable.   If you&#x27;re into minimalism, this is your comb.  If you expect something quality for the $5 you&#x27;re spending, look much, much further.       I got better combs for free during school picture day.\\&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Go with the grain and add this to your bathroom shelf or your coat pocket. Has a great quality, stiff enough so the teeth wont break and soft enough so it wont scratch your face. Works great on eyebrows too, pulls the deep follicles fast. Perfect for a daily soldiers medicine case. My second one. Small size 4&amp;#34; X 1/2&amp;#34; will slip down an open sink drain so be certain of your grip. Great gifts.9</li>
            <li> I had a very hard time finding one of these locally, thank god for Amazon where there were many options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comb was affordable, seems durable, and well suited to its purpose. It has some fairly tight teeth which is important for getting a beard/mustache well groomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this comb.</li>
            <li> Its a nice brush comb but a bit over priced</li>
            <li> It did it&#x27;s job really well, until one of my dogs found it.  (They&#x27;re not labeled as dog proof, nor are they dog proof.)  It&#x27;s hard to find these little combs in stores anymore, so I was quite happy to see them being sold here.</li>
            <li> I bought this comb to train my mustache and goatee. It fits perfectly in my wallet and seems to be good quality (for plastic).</li>
            <li> Well made. Fits in a wallet. Could be somewhat useful but I never had a need to comb my beard or stash while out.  At home I use a regular comb.</li>
            <li> Had several of these combs. They are perfect for grooming your mustash or beard. I war mine daily! Can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Works great with mustache and light beard. Probably too small for a &amp;#34;Duck Dynasty&amp;#34; beard. Flexible enough to not break in your pocket. I plan to buy another as a spare.</li>
            <li> This is a very reliable comb for your mustache. It works just as you would expect. You want be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying these little combs for years. I like that they fit in the back pocket of my pants. Although they are pretty sturdy I have managed to break a couple. I buy 5 or 6 at a time because I tend to loose them - glad they aren&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> Upon looking for a stache comb I came across this cheap comb. I will say I am glad I purchased as the handle does VERY well for a scrape of wax and a quick comb. I do also find the design lends itself to aid in styling and will purchase another if I cannot find the same style in a little heavier comb.</li>
            <li> i ordered this because I liked the look and I wanted a spare comb to keep with me. It&#x27;s dinky and cheap, and feels strange going through the hair. The worst part is some of the pins in the middle have some extra plastic on the tips from the mold.</li>
            <li> Not a bad comb but not worth over $1 in total. Find something in a dollar bin at your local drugstore.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not all that enthusiastic about the way the handle fits in my hand with that upward curve, the comb itself is just the right size and gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s meant to comb your &#x27;stach and beard and it does. Really well. If you are using mustache and beard wax this little comg will rake it right thru your beard and style it quickly. It cleaans up well and appears to be fairly well made. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> If you got a &#x27;stache that you like a little unruly then you GOT to have a &#x27;stache comb and this one is good. Fits the pocket (or purse?) without &amp;#34;outlining&amp;#34; the comb, not that it is all that important to those of us with facial hair. Nice fine toothed comb and a short enough handle designed just for those of us, regardless of gender, that grow a moustache or a beard. Besides with a name like &amp;#34;Colonel Ichabod Conk Mini Moustache Comb&amp;#34; what self-respecting hairy faced gender-neutral individual would not want one? (It sure is tough being non-sexist and PC nowadays so I have done my best here.)</li>
