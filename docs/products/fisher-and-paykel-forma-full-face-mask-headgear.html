            <li>Best I can tell.</li>
            <li>Good people, GREAT FOOD!</li>
            <li>buy my CPAP supplies on Amazon even though I have Great health insurance.</li>
            <li>GOOD REPLACEMENT</li>
            <li>Good pricing.</li>
            <li>Easily adjustable Velcro tabs to ensure the perfect fit.</li>
            <li>this product was a perfect replacement for my original headgear, not something I would recommend trying to go cheap on.</li>
            <li>It fits the forma mask as well, and is better quality.</li>
            <li>made better than original</li>
            <li>This replacement seems to be more heavy durable yet just as comfortable for a great price!</li>
            <li>No one appears to carry the Original quick-release designed mask.  </li>
            <li>Original manufacturer replacement.</li>
            <li>The quick release clip mechanism has been changed.  </li>
            <li>I probably save several hundred dollars a year by purchasing the equipment on my own.</li>
            <li>This works just fine and fits some older masks that I have.  </li>
            <li>Made my mask fit like new!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>What I received was one of those cheap throwaway complete mask setups they give you in the hospital.</li>
            <li>Obviously looking at feedback on Am^zon is just as important as it is on Eb^y.</li>
            <li>I really like this headgear.</li>
            <li>I ordered Fisher and Paykel Forma Headgear and the picture and description clearly shows the right product.</li>
            <li>product makes the best of a bad situation.</li>
            <li>It is not the quality of my old headgear.</li>
            <li>their profits must not be high enough....</li>
            <li>I consider the headstrap to be at least as important as the mask.</li>
            <li>This strap is high quality and from past experience it lasts far longer than you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good idea, bad design.  </li>

            <li> cannot and will not completely seat in the mask base causing air to leak right into the eyes.  </li>
            <li> It is though they designed the base for a different foam cushion and vinyl cover and changed their minds.</li>

            <li> This works just fine and fits some older masks that I have.  No issues at all.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!  Product works perfect!</li>
            <li> This is the thing I needed, and I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> The quick release clip mechanism has been changed.  I could Not find mention of this in the description.  Would not work with my F&amp;P 431 Mask.  No one appears to carry the Original quick-release designed mask.  Why would F&amp;P change the design??  To force us to buy another mask I guess... their profits must not be high enough....</li>
            <li> made better than original</li>
            <li> Made my mask fit like new! Easily adjustable Velcro tabs to ensure the perfect fit.</li>
            <li> this product was a perfect replacement for my original headgear, not something I would recommend trying to go cheap on.</li>
            <li> heavier than my last one, it should last longer.</li>
            <li> AS ADVERTISED. GOOD REPLACEMENT</li>
            <li> Original manufacturer replacement. Best I can tell. Enough said.</li>
            <li> Thank you as described.</li>
            <li> Good people, GREAT FOOD!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like using a CPAP machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product makes the best of a bad situation. I like the emergency release. This strap is high quality and from past experience it lasts far longer than you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy my CPAP supplies on Amazon even though I have Great health insurance. Why?? I pay less for them there than I would using my insurance which has a deductible. With my insurance they require me to replace the mask and straps every 3 months. Miss one time and you are expected to go through the entire testing procedure again. I probably save several hundred dollars a year by purchasing the equipment on my own.</li>
            <li> I ordered Fisher and Paykel Forma Headgear and the picture and description clearly shows the right product. What I received was one of those cheap throwaway complete mask setups they give you in the hospital. I am sure it is illegal for &amp;#34;Meditech systems&amp;#34; to even send it out like that since that is considered a prescription device. Obviously looking at feedback on Am^zon is just as important as it is on Eb^y.</li>
            <li> This replacement seems to be more heavy durable yet just as comfortable for a great price!</li>
            <li> Good idea, bad design.  There is simply no way to prevent air from blowing up into your eyes as the silicon seal and foam cushion  cannot and will not completely seat in the mask base causing air to leak right into the eyes.  The only way around this is to strap it on so tight that the foam cushion is compressed against the small plastic ridge right about the eye line where the nose begins so it feels like your head is in a vise.  It is though they designed the base for a different foam cushion and vinyl cover and changed their minds.</li>
            <li> I really like this headgear. It fits the forma mask as well, and is better quality. Good pricing. Thank you</li>
            <li> My insurance pays for a CPAP mask each month, but not the headstrap. I consider the headstrap to be at least as important as the mask. So I&#x27;ve started purchasing enough headstraps to use one per month.</li>
            <li> Only problem was it said comes without headgear, so I ordered a separate headgear and had to return it when this one came with headgear.</li>
            <li> It is not the quality of my old headgear.</li>
