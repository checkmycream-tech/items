            <li> they sent me a new one (of course I had to get a temporary one because it took a while to get it back) and now it only works on low, the high is broken..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to spend my vacation taking extra time to dry my hair!</li>
            <li> I never liked the non ION dryers I used while traveling because I was used to the fast drying and shine</li>
            <li> I never blow dry my hair until it is completely dry but instead until its damp, and then let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even though it is less heat than my other blow dryer, it blows your hair dry fast and probably with less damage due to the ions.</li>

            <li> I read reviews, chose carefully, and was sorry I bought it.  </li>

            <li> After all, they are not that expensive).</li>
            <li> hair is shy because the anti-static ion.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed!!</li>
            <li> It sounds and blows like a hotel hair dryer, which is annoying and not a time saver.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Bedt blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> 3 months after buying this hair dryer the normal setting won&#x27;t work. Once I plug it in &amp; hit the reset button &amp; try to turn on the reset button on the plug pops out &amp; the dryer won&#x27;t turn on.  Waste of Money!</li>
            <li> Same weight as my home dryer-good power for a little dryer&amp;like the cold shot but not worth thw weight.</li>
            <li> Love it. Great for traveling. Drys my hair very fast</li>
            <li> The size was great but after a week it stopped, glowed bright orange and never worked again.  It could have just been a lemon so I exchanged for a new one.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful hairdryer and I already own one but wanted another.  I got it ver quickly and it great!</li>
            <li> I bought this in April, 2009 and it only lasted until December. In November, it started sputtering and revving. In December the heating element burned itself out. Not a very long-lived product.</li>
            <li> Works well. I get a good blowdry, and my hair is quite thick. In any case, its tons better than the awful hotel hairdryers (I havent figured out why hotels dont invest a little bit more to get a better hairdryer. After all, they are not that expensive). It is failry light and compact, however the plug-in lead is not retractable which is cumbersome.</li>
            <li> High powered, hand-held, super-compactable blow dryer! This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased because I have tons of hair and use it every day. Last one was about 7 years ago. For the price, I think it&#x27;s a great value- dries my hair very quickly. For very thick hair just below my shoulders it only takes about 10 minutes, maybe 15 if I&#x27;m using a round brush. Great value. Folds up easily. Only wish there was a retractable cord.</li>
            <li> This product is exactly as advertised. No hassels with any process to receive order. Dryer works perfectly, is light  and folds easily for travel..</li>
            <li> I already have a larger ION hair dryer that I&#x27;ve used at home for years, and love. I never liked the non ION dryers I used while traveling because I was used to the fast drying and shine I got from my ION, so bought this one to keep in my carry-on. It works as well as my more expensive dryer with the added convenience of being smaller, and ability to fold up making it even more compact. If I didn&#x27;t already have my larger home dryer the size and price of this would make it perfect for every day use.</li>
            <li> I really like this product because it&#x27;s lightweight, it has 3 different temp. settings, and really generates a lot of heat.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review while I&#x27;m on my vacation in Germany.  Let me tell you that the hairdryer is working so well in Germany.  What I need was the European adapter since this is a dual voltage one. &lt;br /&gt;My hair is shy because the anti-static ion.  I only use the low speed in Germany since the voltage here is 220V (in the US I tried it at high speed). &lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have two of these for travel. One stays in the trunk of my Harley! Perfect size for travel. I use the larger version at home, but this has the same power.</li>
            <li> Great little dryer but the high speed blows my hair everywhere.  I have thin hair but if you hair is thick you will love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite hairdryer, have been using for many years.</li>
            <li> Needed a portable but reliable hairdryer.  Have the &amp;#34;Hot Tools Professional Curling Iron with Multi-Heat Control &#x3D; 1.5&amp;#34; and loved the curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros &#x3D; powerful for size&lt;br /&gt;Cons &#x3D; lint guard not removable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall &#x3D; 4</li>
            <li> This hair dryer does not do its job at all.  It has no power to it at all.  I do not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is my second one of these hair dryers. I love the travel size and the last one lasted for 8 or 9 years! Hot Tools makes pretty good products.</li>
            <li> I bought this hairdryer just to use at home although it being a travel hair dryer is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a person who blow dries my hair every day. I usually blow dry my hair after I wash my hair for about 5 minutes. I never blow dry my hair until it is completely dry but instead until its damp, and then let it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, the blow dryer is really good - it is very power and left my hair feeling very soft. I noticed that my hair didn&#x27;t look as frizzy as compared to my older hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I think the price is amazing and the fact that it folds and is so compact is an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an ON/OFF switch for the ion technology.&lt;br /&gt;A button on the back for cool air.&lt;br /&gt;And speeds, LOW/HIGH.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Super hot blow dryer! Super thick hair and this dries my hair very quickly! Really like this better than any I&#x27;ve ever had before!</li>
            <li> I have long-ish, very fine hair, so you would think this wattage would be perfect for a travel hair dryer. I read reviews, chose carefully, and was sorry I bought it.  Great size, weight, etc., it&#x27;s just that there&#x27;s hardly any power.  It sounds and blows like a hotel hair dryer, which is annoying and not a time saver. I don&#x27;t want to spend my vacation taking extra time to dry my hair! :)  So I&#x27;ve sent it back, and will try again.  I&#x27;m sure it works great for some, just not my cup of tea.  I will probably just spend more money and get a more substantial dryer for travel. :/</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Light weight and works great.</li>
            <li> I have not tested it for traveling yet.  I purchased it, because I needed one that would be compact for traveling.  It is bigger than I thought it would be, but the fold up handle is nice.  It is very durable feeling.  I do not like that it is sooo loud.  It was suppose to be less noise.  I do like the ions feature. It does seem to make my hair shiny and give it more body. Even though it is less heat than my other blow dryer, it blows your hair dry fast and probably with less damage due to the ions.</li>
            <li> It works and seems to do quicker/better job than regular dryer. It&#x27;s not as good as my more expensive full-size, but it gets the job done and is more convenient being smaller/folding handle. It&#x27;s NOT quiet though!</li>
            <li> I like this hairdryer.. when it works! It has broken twice on me.. the first time it starting spitting out sparks so I sent it back.. they sent me a new one (of course I had to get a temporary one because it took a while to get it back) and now it only works on low, the high is broken.. I am going to throw it out and get a different brand.. Not impressed!!</li>
            <li> Great travel dryer.  I did not find another one this powerful that&#x27;s smaller.  There are smaller ones out there but not ionic or this strong.</li>
            <li> When I travel, I am picky about my blowdryer.  This one blow dries my thick hair in no time and gives it body and style.  It&#x27;s not as compact as other travel blowdryers, but it&#x27;s worth traveling with.</li>
            <li> The hot tools professional 1039 blowdrier is indeed a surprise... Very quiet, efficient, lightweight and easy to use. Give thumbs up to this product.</li>
            <li> Product seems to work fine but looked banged up...not sure if it was new</li>
