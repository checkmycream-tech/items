            <li>this is the perfect product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The best I have found.</li>
            <li>Best product to shape my hair.</li>
            <li>This product is very good for the look that makes it seem like u have nothing in your hair.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t seem to find if this product will be sufficient on its own or if I need Boost powder or a mousse...</li>
            <li>kind of look</li>
            <li>works great for my fair type which is straight and closely cropped.</li>
            <li>Easy to use,smells great and worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love the convenience and price buying on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Good hold, gives texture to my fine hair, doesn&#x27;t leave too much residue or flake.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great Product overall.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair gel for a dry look.  </li>
            <li>The hold is about right, maybe just a touch on the light side.</li>
            <li>American crew assortment of products that are pretty good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really exciting as a hairstylist that guys are being introduced to the hair dryer again...</li>
            <li>I love that American Crew created essentially a matte styling gel that performs best when blown dry.</li>
            <li>works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Left my hair more frizzy than anything.  </li>
            <li>Gives texture with a light-medium hold, very matte finish, natural feel (not a crunchy at all), a little goes a long way, smells good but a strong scent.</li>
            <li>super quick. weighs down and takes away volme out of you hair.  </li>
            <li>There are other products out there (e.g. Loreal melting gel) that provide a good hold, provide a soft feeling and are actually cheaper.</li>
            <li>if you have short hear, it would be better off using American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Pretty much the same as using any gel.</li>
            <li>It is barely strong enough to get the front of my hair in the air and the back feels as if there is no product in it at all.</li>
            <li>The hold is very light compared to other American Crew medium hold products.</li>
            <li>You either have to have patience for the hair to dray naturally, then run your fingers through it, or use a hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps if you blow dry your hair first it might be.  </li>
            <li>While it is not cheap for a small bottle, the product is good, held long hair, 6\\&quot;, in place after I ran fingers thought to activate the matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> My hair felt and looked flat.</li>
            <li> Strange stuff in the product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I do get a solid hold, little-to-no shine (I don&#x27;t care for the wet look), and no flakes (which was my problem with a lot of cream and gel-based products).</li>
            <li> Can become crunchy or wet looking if not applied properly, and does flake on occasions.</li>
            <li> I waited until it was dry and brushed once, which does \\&quot;activate\\&quot; the matte look, but it seems to cut the hold in half.</li>
            <li> It hold his hair where he styles it without looking wet and sticky.</li>
            <li> Used on wet hair</li>
            <li> Minus one star for price.</li>
            <li> I applied to damp hair as stated and that gives it a wet look where hair clumps together.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it compares to other wax/silica-based products.</li>
            <li> It can be a little shiny if it&#x27;s put in wet hair, but it should be put in when hair is on the drier side.</li>
            <li> If there is some shine, patting the hair down seems to fix it.</li>
            <li> I tried to cancel the order less than 24 hours after I placed the order and was told the product had already shipped.</li>
            <li> You have to mess it up to get the shine out of it</li>
            <li> and even then the hair is still stiff.</li>
            <li> product claims to have \\&quot;no flakes\\&quot; which is false when you follow the products directions, which state to \\&quot;brush through once dry to activate matte finish\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The description is not accurate whatsoever, or at least in my case it was not:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Poor quality.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sorry</li>
            <li> , I hate this product and will never use it again.</li>
            <li> this terrible to work with.  </li>

            <li> This is the only styling product my son will use.  I love the convenience and price buying on Amazon.  It hold his hair where he styles it without looking wet and sticky.</li>
            <li> This product is very good for the look that makes it seem like u have nothing in your hair. It feels and looks like the wind just blew your hair up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sorry but I can&#x27;t seem to find if this product will be sufficient on its own or if I need Boost powder or a mousse...I need some help please!</li>
            <li> Poor quality.  Strange stuff in the product.  Didn&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> I tried this after feeling like the American Crew Fiber product made my hair a bit curly. There&#x27;s no comparison between the two. This goes on greasy and dries crunchy. You have to mess it up to get the shine out of it and even then the hair is still stiff. It just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This gel leaves your hair with that heard “crunchy” feeling. There are other products out there (e.g. Loreal melting gel) that provide a good hold, provide a soft feeling and are actually cheaper. if you have short hear, it would be better off using American Crew Fiber.</li>
            <li> I love that American Crew created essentially a matte styling gel that performs best when blown dry. It&#x27;s really exciting as a hairstylist that guys are being introduced to the hair dryer again... this is the perfect product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but I do get a solid hold, little-to-no shine (I don&#x27;t care for the wet look), and no flakes (which was my problem with a lot of cream and gel-based products). So I&#x27;m sticking with this for a while! I don&#x27;t know how it compares to other wax/silica-based products.</li>
            <li> This works well for me. The hold is about right, maybe just a touch on the light side. It can be a little shiny if it&#x27;s put in wet hair, but it should be put in when hair is on the drier side. If there is some shine, patting the hair down seems to fix it.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t find this stuff anywhere except online. works great for my fair type which is straight and closely cropped. works exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I read about this product in Men&#x27;s Health magazine.It was described as a hair gel that would both condition and add body to thinning hair.Sourced it on Amazon.com.Shipment arrived in 3 days and it has been everything that was promised.Easy to use,smells great and worth the price.Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Gives texture with a light-medium hold, very matte finish, natural feel (not a crunchy at all), a little goes a long way, smells good but a strong scent. Great Product overall. American Crew delivered on this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: The product does share some characteristics with gels. Can become crunchy or wet looking if not applied properly, and does flake on occasions.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider this product to be matte.  Perhaps if you blow dry your hair first it might be.  Used on wet hair the outcome is shiny and crunchy.  Pretty much the same as using any gel.</li>
            <li> Good hold, gives texture to my fine hair, doesn&#x27;t leave too much residue or flake.&lt;br /&gt;The best I have found.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair gel for a dry look.  You either have to have patience for the hair to dray naturally, then run your fingers through it, or use a hair dryer.  Minus one star for price.</li>
            <li> While I am usually a fan of the American Crew products, I find this one to be pretty unimpressive. The description is not accurate whatsoever, or at least in my case it was not:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product claims to \\&quot;thicken hair\\&quot; and \\&quot;enhance hair&#x27;s body\\&quot; and I did not experience either of these. My hair felt and looked flat. Zero body, volume, or thickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product claims to offer \\&quot;medium hold\\&quot; and \\&quot;long-lasting results\\&quot;. The hold is very light compared to other American Crew medium hold products. It is barely strong enough to get the front of my hair in the air and the back feels as if there is no product in it at all. By the end of the work day it looks worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product claims to have \\&quot;no flakes\\&quot; which is false when you follow the products directions, which state to \\&quot;brush through once dry to activate matte finish\\&quot;. Once you run the brush through, you get flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of the directions...I could never get this product to work correctly. I applied to damp hair as stated and that gives it a wet look where hair clumps together. I waited until it was dry and brushed once, which does \\&quot;activate\\&quot; the matte look, but it seems to cut the hold in half. It causes the hair to become poofy, almost as if it were blow dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I hate this product and will never use it again. It does not do at all what it says and the results look nothing like the product video on the American Crew site.</li>
            <li> Best product to shape my hair. No shine at all, I can do whatever I was with my hair and look like I have nothing on.</li>
            <li> this terrible to work with.  once you put it in your hair it locks up super quick. weighs down and takes away volme out of you hair.  tried it several times and no luck.  just a hat head kind of look</li>
            <li> While it is not cheap for a small bottle, the product is good, held long hair, 6\\&quot;, in place after I ran fingers thought to activate the matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shipper is the WORST I have ever seen. I tried to cancel the order less than 24 hours after I placed the order and was told the product had already shipped. I used Prime Shipping, ordered on 4/26 today is 5/5 and I still do not have my product. I will never by from this shipper again.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t create the effect I was going for.  Left my hair more frizzy than anything.  This product wasn&#x27;t for me I prefer wax.  American crew assortment of products that are pretty good</li>
