            <li>This is as good or better than all others tried.</li>
            <li>Nice coverage and color.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use the included puff though, use a nice kabuki brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nicely textures so the brush picks it up and applies it easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice, light powder with good color and light and airy coverage...</li>
            <li>Very good price and fast delivery.  </li>

            <li>Im in love, never change this</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a excellent product, the only thing is that i bought It too lighter.</li>
            <li>Was able to get in a medium color.</li>
            <li>âœ” Adds more coverage to existing foundation&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li>Works better than any cover powder I have used.</li>
            <li>i love this powder, it never makes my skin shiny.</li>
            <li>It feels more like a translucent powder with a hint of color</li>
            <li>Medium coverage but overall great product!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a great everyday powder at a good price!</li>
            <li>It reduces the look of pours and leaves skin with a nice clean look.</li>
            <li>It just gives me a good excuse to buy more stuff :-p</li>
            <li>Top shelf, shipped fast, very pleased</li>
            <li>shine free most of the day.</li>
            <li>âœ” Easy to apply&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product, it is very light and has much product!</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I mix this with a honey color powder that has a little glitter in it and it makes for the perfect combination for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Great light powder, gives natural look, reduces shine, economical.</li>
            <li>It comes with an applicator, but I personally am a huge fan of brushes</li>
            <li>Such a  great deal for the quality too.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>âœ” Refract light in photographs&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I hope it is always available</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and neutral and, as advertised, shine free.  </li>
            <li>This powder is my #1 go to year round; I love that it is available in many color choices, has a very light fragrance, applies easily, blends nicely, and doesn&#x27;t leave your face looking cakey in any way.  </li>
            <li>but this is not a bad buy.</li>
            <li>I use it as a basic power before applying my final touch powder and it serves perfectly this purpose.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s worth the price</li>
            <li>I used a big full face brush instead of the applicator that came with the product for better coverage.</li>
            <li>Maybelline shine free Loose Powder really leaves a nice finish on your skin.</li>
            <li>Though, this product works well when the correct amount is used, do NOT use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;ðŸš« Only available in 3 colors; light, medium, dark&lt;br /&gt;ðŸš« Includes subpar application puff</li>
            <li>like it very much.</li>
            <li>Does exact purpose was purchased for.  </li>
            <li>me excellent appart from all these expensive brands i tried and tried and got fed up</li>
            <li>Literally blends in my skin, i cant tell the difference or find where i put the first coat.</li>
            <li>I first purchase the powder, I remove the inner top portion of the container (the one with the holes in it).</li>
            <li>I like to just tap some product into the blue cap and dip my brush that way as I have more control over the amount being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite shine control products, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I use it after applying foundation and concealer and dab it on my T-zone, where I am most likely to shine.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, so the worry is that a oil control powder will make my dry spots more visible.</li>
            <li>I love this loose powder.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t attempt to smear the fallout!)&lt;br /&gt;ðŸš« Applying too much will make your look appear cakey.</li>
            <li>It really does control oil!&lt;br</li>
            <li>really gets rid of shine-</li>
            <li>An empty screw top travel cosmetics jar works well for this problem though.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really move it</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been an absolute gem.</li>
            <li>A little darker than expected, although it should be good for the summer!</li>
            <li>VERY glad that I can find it here, as it is the only loose powder I like</li>
            <li>good morning , I write because I do not get the full goods , I wanted to know if it is on its way or has happened , because that money was discounted but I fail ,</li>
            <li>it is a decent quality mattifying loose powder seems better than my bare minerals shine control !!</li>
            <li>this can double as a bronzer if you&#x27;re looking for that summer glow, but make sure to only use a makeup brush, and to dip the brush and then shake it out before applying.  </li>
            <li>Especially know, in a very hot summer.</li>
            <li>I have been using Maybelline powders for years and prefer them over high priced products/brands.</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a better concealer and still controlled oil as well :/</li>
            <li>I put on an extra layer halfway through the day if it&#x27;s particularly hot or</li>
            <li>Although this is a translucent powder, if you use this product over a foundation, you will notice that it amps up your level of coverage, while still looking natural.</li>
            <li>Either i received an old worn out, defective piece</li>
            <li>Makes a really natural looking finish, doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s caked on and</li>
            <li>Saves me a bit of money and I like the natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first loose powder &amp; I</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily and this doesn&#x27;t keep the oiliness at bay for long.</li>
            <li>It is free oil, but it doesn&#x27;t control oil in my face, and the difuser tends to make a mess when i open it.</li>
            <li>I have tried using Mary Kay absorbing sheets, but they only remove current shine spots and do nothing but prevention.</li>
            <li>Broke my face out and it&#x27;s super messy.</li>
            <li>I barely touch my bare minerals anymore.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;v also used the Bare Minerals Mineral Veil, but found it accentuated skin imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mean powder Maybelline New York Shine Free Oil Control Loose Powder , Medium, 0.7 Ounce.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of the old Cornsilk loose powder....</li>
            <li>Too bad they stop manufacturing all the good cosmetic products like this one...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> There are a lot of higher-priced similar products out there, but I seem to always fall back to Maybelline. This is as good or better than all others tried. I use a brush, but it comes with a puff.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price</li>
            <li> Does exact purpose was purchased for.  I used a big full face brush instead of the applicator that came with the product for better coverage.</li>
            <li> Did cover up my oily face but it faded away after a while</li>
            <li> Broke my face out and it&#x27;s super messy.</li>
            <li> Too bad they stop manufacturing all the good cosmetic products like this one...Very nice, light powder with good color and light and airy coverage...It reminds me of the old Cornsilk loose powder....</li>
            <li> i am yellow undertoned and this translucent medium works perfect trust me excellent appart from all these expensive brands i tried and tried and got fed up this is the best try it you wouldnt regret it sets your foundation so well...</li>
            <li> nice &amp; light face powder.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup. Ive had problems with stuff being too oily for my skin, but with this it doesnt feel like im wearing any makeup at all.</li>
            <li> Literally blends in my skin, i cant tell the difference or find where i put the first coat. This is my holy grail product. I barely touch my bare minerals anymore. What a waste of money that was.</li>
            <li> Yay!!!! Just maybelline. Im in love, never change this</li>
            <li> I think this powder does a very good job controlling the shine on the face, I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a excellent product, the only thing is that i bought It too lighter.</li>
            <li> not bad, controls my shiny face-need to reapply, but after reapplying face doesn&#x27;t look bad</li>
            <li> Maybelline shine free Loose Powder really leaves a nice finish on your skin. I use it over their makeup. It reduces the look of pours and leaves skin with a nice clean look. Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first loose powder &amp; I like it very much. It perfects my make up. Especially know, in a very hot summer.</li>
            <li> I love this loose powder. It matches my skin perfectly, and can easily be applied with a powder brush. Such a  great deal for the quality too.</li>
            <li> Not good for long time wear. My face becomes oily after 5 hours or less. But the colour is nice and the cover is lovely ( medium cover )</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I mix this with a honey color powder that has a little glitter in it and it makes for the perfect combination for my skin tone. Great price, very pleased!</li>
            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t feel or look caked on and my skin can breathe. Not normally a huge fan of maybelline products but this is not a bad buy.</li>
            <li> I use it as a basic power before applying my final touch powder and it serves perfectly this purpose. I have been using it for a while and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Always use a loose powder.  Very good price and fast delivery.  Was able to get in a medium color.</li>
            <li> The product that I keep in my makeup bag. I consider it one of my essentials for everyday wear, if I&#x27;m wearing makeup at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well and it&#x27;s cheap. Although this is a translucent powder, if you use this product over a foundation, you will notice that it amps up your level of coverage, while still looking natural. While some foundations containing SPF will have you looking ghostly in photographs, this will put an end to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you look closely, you can see very faint sparkles on your skin while wearing it, which refract light from you in photographs instead of drawing it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guaranteed a flawless finish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally do not like the included puff, so I use a powder brush which works 100 times better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first purchase the powder, I remove the inner top portion of the container (the one with the holes in it). I like to just tap some product into the blue cap and dip my brush that way as I have more control over the amount being used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;âœ” Cost effective&lt;br /&gt;âœ” Flawless finish&lt;br /&gt;âœ” Refract light in photographs&lt;br /&gt;âœ” Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;âœ” Compliments your look, even if worn alone&lt;br /&gt;âœ” Adds more coverage to existing foundation&lt;br /&gt;âœ” Extends the duration of wear, lasts all day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;ðŸš« Application can be somewhat messy (during application, wear a shirt you will not be wearing out because there will be some product fallout. Don&#x27;t attempt to smear the fallout!)&lt;br /&gt;ðŸš« Applying too much will make your look appear cakey. Though, this product works well when the correct amount is used, do NOT use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;ðŸš« Only available in 3 colors; light, medium, dark&lt;br /&gt;ðŸš« Includes subpar application puff</li>
            <li> really good, I like it!!</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, I&#x27;m really happy with it</li>
            <li> This lasts all day.  I love the color and does not look to cakey as some powders do! works well with my foundation.</li>
            <li> this can double as a bronzer if you&#x27;re looking for that summer glow, but make sure to only use a makeup brush, and to dip the brush and then shake it out before applying.  Makeup pads for powder are a terrible idea in general, and with loose powder you don&#x27;t want to overapply and look like a monster in photographs when your face has a completely different color than the rest of you, so use just enough to get rid of the shine, and get it on your ears and your throat/jaw line.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s worth the price and I use this on film all the time.</li>
            <li> It really does control oil!&lt;br /&gt;However, it does not conceal well so I find myself piling on makeup which is what I was trying to do. I wish it was a better concealer and still controlled oil as well :/</li>
            <li> Either i received an old worn out, defective piece or it doesnt do what it claims. It cudnt even hold the oil for an hour for me. Also i broke out in two places. Not pleased at all.</li>
            <li> Top shelf, shipped fast, very pleased</li>
            <li> Color medium was a perfect match for my Tannish Olive skin. Takes away any oil from the face and never broke me out. It will not provide any type of coverage however if that is what you are looking for. It&#x27;s only to cancel out shine. This can work great as a setting powder too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok... A little darker than expected, although it should be good for the summer! My skin is very oily and this doesn&#x27;t keep the oiliness at bay for long.</li>
            <li> It is free oil, but it doesn&#x27;t control oil in my face, and the difuser tends to make a mess when i open it.</li>
            <li> amazing! really gets rid of shine- so perfect for oily skin!</li>
            <li> This powder is my #1 go to year round; I love that it is available in many color choices, has a very light fragrance, applies easily, blends nicely, and doesn&#x27;t leave your face looking cakey in any way.  I have been using Maybelline powders for years and prefer them over high priced products/brands.</li>
            <li> works well to control the oil on my face, doesnt make me feel like I have alot of makeup on.</li>
            <li> Ideal para piel tendencia grasa.</li>
            <li> It works for me.  Gotta be careful you don&#x27;t get to heavy with it or it can make your face look powdery.  I don&#x27;t like any oily shine and I just brush a little of this on and it takes away the shine.</li>
            <li> Nice coverage and color.  It makes me break out though.</li>
            <li> This powder ended up replacing a brand of much more expensive pressed powder that wasn&#x27;t working for me at all but I am very happy with this one.  Makes a really natural looking finish, doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s caked on and most importantly seems to stay put fairly well when I sweat.  The only thing that I would wish for with this powder is a screw on cap.  I would never take this packaging in my cosmetics bag or purse because it would make a gigantic mess if I did.  This packaging definitely has to stay home in the bathroom.  An empty screw top travel cosmetics jar works well for this problem though.</li>
            <li> My favorite! It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find. I hope it is always available here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and this keeps me shine free most of the day. About 2/3 of the way through the day I reapply and/or dab with a paper napkin and I&#x27;m good until bedtime.</li>
            <li> Great deal on a good product it is a decent quality mattifying loose powder seems better than my bare minerals shine control !! It&#x27;s a must buy!!</li>
            <li> I cut with cornstarch and it&#x27;s the perfect setting powder.</li>
            <li> I like this product.. it&#x27;s a great everyday powder at a good price!</li>
            <li> Works better than any cover powder I have used.</li>
            <li> Great light powder, gives natural look, reduces shine, economical.</li>
            <li> While I like the powder, the puff or applicator fell apart at the seams! What&#x27;s up with that,made in China?</li>
            <li> This is a great deal!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit darker than it looks but works well enough for the price.</li>
            <li> good morning , I write because I do not get the full goods , I wanted to know if it is on its way or has happened , because that money was discounted but I fail , I mean powder Maybelline New York Shine Free Oil Control Loose Powder , Medium, 0.7 Ounce.</li>
            <li> excellent seller, item as described</li>
            <li> i love this powder, it never makes my skin shiny. its the perfect color for my skin tone. and i will buy again and again</li>
            <li> I love this product, it is very light and has much product! I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> This is a great powder and it&#x27;s so inexpensive! I wouldn&#x27;t use the included puff though, use a nice kabuki brush. I haven&#x27;t used it in an &amp;#34;all day&amp;#34; situation yet so it&#x27;s hard to say if it lasts that long but it works as well as any other powder I&#x27;ve used such as Lancome, Clinique, etc. I am fair to lighter medium and took a chance on the medium shade and the color doesn&#x27;t seem to &amp;#34;show up&amp;#34; which is great. It feels more like a translucent powder with a hint of color so it doesn&#x27;t leave that white-cast look and it&#x27;s not too dark. I think I paid about $4.19 and it&#x27;s an add-on item so you do have to add it to another purchase but that&#x27;s fine. It just gives me a good excuse to buy more stuff :-p</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to apply because the powder gets everywhere (on the lid, on the sides). Usually, a bunch spills when I open the lid, and the puff inside is covered with the powder. I don&#x27;t really move it (it stays in a drawer), so kinda disappointed that it spills so much when opening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a number of years.  It&#x27;s light and neutral and, as advertised, shine free.  Price and delivery were good and I&#x27;ll continue to order as needed.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite shine control products, especially for the price. I have combination skin, so the worry is that a oil control powder will make my dry spots more visible. I have tried using Mary Kay absorbing sheets, but they only remove current shine spots and do nothing but prevention. I&#x27;v also used the Bare Minerals Mineral Veil, but found it accentuated skin imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months (summer-winter) and it&#x27;s been an absolute gem. I use it after applying foundation and concealer and dab it on my T-zone, where I am most likely to shine. I put on an extra layer halfway through the day if it&#x27;s particularly hot or balmy.&lt;br /&gt; It comes with an applicator, but I personally am a huge fan of brushes so I use the ELF Studio Kabuki. It&#x27;s nicely textures so the brush picks it up and applies it easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that it is tinted! Because I usually apply to the T-zone, I substitute it for bronzer. Saves me a bit of money and I like the natural look.&lt;br /&gt;I bought two containers of this 6 months ago, and am only halfway through the second container!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: The best in drugstore shine control!</li>
            <li> Medium coverage but overall great product!</li>
            <li> I live in Canada and was having a hard time finding this product, then was told it has been discontinued. VERY glad that I can find it here, as it is the only loose powder I like</li>
