            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>This item was good for a month or so</li>
            <li>Nice and compact.  </li>
            <li>nice item at nice price</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Its great for the money but does not reach a professional touch when cleaning a customer.</li>
            <li>a longer handle might work better for me since I have large hands.</li>
            <li>Well it didn&#x27;t look as good as it looked in the pictures above.</li>
            <li>Thanks I like it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>but it can&#x27;t hold a lot of powder and will easily brake from the bass of the brush handle.  </li>
            <li>I like that the nylon (I&#x27;m not sure what to call the material) bristles are shorter than most of the other barber dusters available here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It is small and can do its JOB but do not expect to get a smooth touch.</li>
            <li>Exactly what you expected</li>
            <li>Low quality not recommended for professional stylist</li>
            <li>I received mine broken from the top.</li>
            <li>Very small and cheaply made.</li>
