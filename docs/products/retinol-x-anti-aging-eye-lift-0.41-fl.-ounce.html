            <li>No cream is perfect, of course.</li>
            <li>This is truly one of the best non surgical alternative!</li>
            <li>This product is great!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive!!</li>
            <li>This is a very good product for the money.</li>
            <li>, I am very pleased to say!</li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>Used in combination with Retinol-X moisturizer, this works great.</li>
            <li>works great, have ought may times</li>
            <li>The ingredients are great and it shows results IMO.</li>
            <li>Great product for the price.</li>
            <li>Feels great on Skin...</li>
            <li>I bought this item about a week ago and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>so I think I can speak to \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; products better than the 30 or 40 somethings!  </li>
            <li>Guess the search for an effective replacement will continue.</li>
            <li>I purchased this &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; product to replace a stellar retinol eye cream I&#x27;d been using for years, which was an inexpensive and very effective lightweight gel-creme formula.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using it for a while and was pleased with results and</li>
            <li>I then had to do without for two weeks while I waited for more to ship since I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores.  </li>
            <li>or I&#x27;d prefer better packaging</li>
            <li>I like the way it distributes the serum, and am pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>And most help...</li>
            <li>I love it and will order it again when I run out....</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m even more bereft that Avon&#x27;s Solutions Plus eye cream has been continued.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product.</li>
            <li>and I was so pleased with the reduction of lines, puffiness and</li>
            <li>but, I ordered more of this</li>
            <li>Good product and reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I tried the Retinol-X anti-aging eye cream and by the end of the week, there was a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I now enjoy putting on my make-up each day and achieving the look that I want.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, first tried it when I found it at TGMAXx of all places, then went to amazon, to buy found the face cream also,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Very light texture and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>but did arrive quickly</li>
            <li>It is non greasy, very mild and does a good job of keeping away dark circles and laugh lines.</li>
            <li>so far it seems to smooth out the fine lines without causing my eyes to swell by the morning.</li>
            <li>During that time, my right eyelid started to droop again...</li>
            <li>It is nice to finally find one that really works.</li>
            <li>For years I thought I was miraculously evading the more obvious effects of normal aging, but I now realize that it was just down to a great eye cream.</li>
            <li>I noticed improvement under my eyes upon the first application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products.</li>
            <li>Would prefer being able to find it in local stores...</li>
            <li>this one I actually saw the difference in the wrinkles around and under my eyes within a couple of days, and it&#x27;s gotten better with continued use.  </li>
            <li>However, after a week of using the Retinol-X product, the skin under my eyes started looking crepey for the first time in my life.</li>
            <li>Maybe it is a good product for eye wrinkles and puffiness, but the reviews are ALL rated as helpful by 9 out of 10 people or 5 out of 5 people (usually it&#x27;s 100%)</li>
            <li>I do have very puffy eyes</li>
            <li>However, half the time the dispenser doesn&#x27;t work and I end up not being able to use the product.</li>
            <li>Love It This eye cream glides on easy and doesn&#x27;t weigh your eye down like some other products</li>
            <li>used high dollar products before</li>
            <li>Will give it a few more weeks</li>
            <li>Then I realized that it was the new eye cream.</li>
            <li>, with newly crepey under-eye skin and cloudy vision, I decided to chuck this product.</li>
            <li>Though it&#x27;s a very lightweight formula and seems to absorb quickly, somehow it managed to &amp;#34;migrate&amp;#34; into my eyes after a few hours of wearing it, clouding my vision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will continue till the bottle is finished, but so far nothing to call mom about....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 69 years old</li>
            <li>I noticed my circles instantly disappeared and the puff majorly reduced!!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many other products from the most expensive to over the counter.  </li>
            <li>And I was about to go to an ophthalmologist because I noticed my vision was getting cloudy by early afternoon for several days in a row.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Skin Eye Cream (another lightweight formula with retinol), but it, too fails at making under-eye skin look smooth and firm.</li>
            <li>Plus I don&#x27;t pay as much if purchasing other from dept store.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this everyday around my right eye and my regular eye cream on my left for a couple of weeks so far see no difference.</li>

            <li> Have not used it long enough to see a difference, but will keep trying!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it too long</li>
            <li> Is actually keeping the lines down around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It works as hard as the most expensive creams.</li>
            <li> It was empty.  </li>
            <li> Did not really do much for me-</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to find it had been discontinued, but I thought the Retinol-X product might be a good replacement.</li>
            <li> I can see a little difference in the lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It seems to lift a little but who knows?  </li>
            <li> yes, even the dark circles have lightened (bonus!)</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned that being a Retinol product it will be drying on my eyes.</li>
            <li> then one morning I was doing my usual routine, dispensed the usual amount and ...</li>
            <li> At my age, I.m not sure any product will reverse my aging eyes.</li>
            <li> Since I am not able to have an eye-lift with plastic surgery this product has made my lower lids lifted in record time.  </li>
            <li> and It&#x27;s a small bottle thats why I took off a star.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little slow on the uptake since I&#x27;m awfully late to the game, but I am just beginning to understand these kinds of products and why they work so well.</li>
            <li> At 51 now, I began caring for my skin rather late in life at the age of 49.</li>
            <li> Doubtful it has improved my appearance around eyes but didn&#x27;t really expect it to help.  </li>
            <li> Feel a little silly</li>
            <li> But I can tell that these reviews are fake.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed, this product was not for me, saw no difference around my eyes, will need to try something else.</li>
            <li> hate the look of it.  </li>
            <li> so annoying.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a very good product for the money. It is non greasy, very mild and does a good job of keeping away dark circles and laugh lines.It works as hard as the most expensive creams.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried and the price is reasonable. I can see a little difference in the lines around my eyes. No cream is perfect, of course.</li>
            <li> I bought this item about a week ago and am very pleased. It didn&#x27;t start immediately, but the affects took place after I used it for about 2 days. Great price.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. I noticed improvement under my eyes upon the first application. My eyes look radiant and younger.  I do have very puffy eyes and I have notice some improvement.  The puffiness has not quite disappeared but I am hoping it will with continuous use.</li>
            <li> Used in combination with Retinol-X moisturizer, this works great. Within two weeks I could visibly see the difference with the reduction of wrinkles around my eyes. I&#x27;ve tried so many different products. It is nice to finally find one that really works.</li>
            <li> Is actually keeping the lines down around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49.  My upper lids have been getting saggy, especially my right eye...driving me crazy...hate the look of it.  I have oily skin.  I tried the Retinol-X anti-aging eye cream and by the end of the week, there was a huge difference.  The dispenser is &amp;#34;efficient&amp;#34; I guess I would say.  I&#x27;d been using it for a while and was pleased with results and then one morning I was doing my usual routine, dispensed the usual amount and ... that was it.  It was empty.  There was no way for me to know when I was getting close to the bottom.  I then had to do without for two weeks while I waited for more to ship since I couldn&#x27;t find it in any stores.  During that time, my right eyelid started to droop again...so annoying.  I don&#x27;t have under eye circles, so I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s effectiveness for that.  Would prefer being able to find it in local stores...either that, or I&#x27;d prefer better packaging so I could get a heads-up when I&#x27;m getting close to the end.</li>
            <li> I like the way it distributes the serum, and am pleased with the product.  At my age, I.m not sure any product will reverse my aging eyes.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed, this product was not for me, saw no difference around my eyes, will need to try something else.</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday around my right eye and my regular eye cream on my left for a couple of weeks so far see no difference. Will continue till the bottle is finished, but so far nothing to call mom about....</li>
            <li> i use it for lifting my eyes, i think it works....</li>
            <li> It seems to lift a little but who knows?  I will continue using it though just to see if it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 69 years old so I think I can speak to \\&quot;anti-aging\\&quot; products better than the 30 or 40 somethings!  I&#x27;m also told all the time that I look like I&#x27;m 10-15 years younger, and yes...I&#x27;ve tried almost every product that \\&quot;promises\\&quot; reduced wrinkles blah, blah!  And most help...to a degree, but this one I actually saw the difference in the wrinkles around and under my eyes within a couple of days, and it&#x27;s gotten better with continued use.  I love it and will order it again when I run out....probably before I run out as I don&#x27;t want to find out one morning that it&#x27;s all gone and I&#x27;m going to have wait for another one to arrive!</li>
            <li> JUST STarted this product but so far it seems to smooth out the fine lines without causing my eyes to swell by the morning.</li>
            <li> I purchased this &amp;#34;anti-aging&amp;#34; product to replace a stellar retinol eye cream I&#x27;d been using for years, which was an inexpensive and very effective lightweight gel-creme formula. I was very disappointed to find it had been discontinued, but I thought the Retinol-X product might be a good replacement. However, after a week of using the Retinol-X product, the skin under my eyes started looking crepey for the first time in my life. And I was about to go to an ophthalmologist because I noticed my vision was getting cloudy by early afternoon for several days in a row. Then I realized that it was the new eye cream. Though it&#x27;s a very lightweight formula and seems to absorb quickly, somehow it managed to &amp;#34;migrate&amp;#34; into my eyes after a few hours of wearing it, clouding my vision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, with newly crepey under-eye skin and cloudy vision, I decided to chuck this product. I&#x27;ve since tried Neutrogena&#x27;s Healthy Skin Eye Cream (another lightweight formula with retinol), but it, too fails at making under-eye skin look smooth and firm. So I&#x27;m even more bereft that Avon&#x27;s Solutions Plus eye cream has been continued. For years I thought I was miraculously evading the more obvious effects of normal aging, but I now realize that it was just down to a great eye cream. Guess the search for an effective replacement will continue. The alternative is to simply embrace incipient middle-age with grace and an avoidance of mirrors!</li>
            <li> Love it... I&#x27;ve used many other products from the most expensive to over the counter.  This is truly one of the best non surgical alternative! Mrs. Dennis...</li>
            <li> This product is great!  It goes to work immediately.  Since I am not able to have an eye-lift with plastic surgery this product has made my lower lids lifted in record time.  I now enjoy putting on my make-up each day and achieving the look that I want.  I don&#x27;t ever intend to be without it.</li>
            <li> Love this product, first tried it when I found it at TGMAXx of all places, then went to amazon, to buy found the face cream also,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used high dollar products before but this matches up.  Plus I don&#x27;t pay as much if purchasing other from dept store.  The only problem is the container don&#x27;t come any bigger and I have to order quite frequent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the product, Luv It!</li>
            <li> Did not really do much for me- but did arrive quickly</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product.  But I can tell that these reviews are fake.  Maybe it is a good product for eye wrinkles and puffiness, but the reviews are ALL rated as helpful by 9 out of 10 people or 5 out of 5 people (usually it&#x27;s 100%) and they keep repeating the same phrases, and referring to price.  Check for yourself and you&#x27;ll see.  Just a warning.</li>
            <li> Have not used it long enough to see a difference, but will keep trying! Will give it a few more weeks</li>
            <li> works great, have ought may times</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it too long and It&#x27;s a small bottle thats why I took off a star. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of products for puffy eyes. Even in the $150+ range and haven&#x27;t found one thing that actually removed puffiness. I noticed my circles instantly disappeared and the puff majorly reduced!!!!! Yay and it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive!! I&#x27;m 32 and have only had bags since I had my kid 2 yrs ago and even with sleep they didn&#x27;t reduce. I&#x27;m a total skincare junkie and I&#x27;m amazed with this product. The ingredients are great and it shows results IMO. This review is legit!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. At 51 now, I began caring for my skin rather late in life at the age of 49. That said, I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 wks and I was so pleased with the reduction of lines, puffiness and yes, even the dark circles have lightened (bonus!), I used it on my spider veins, just to see if...and they are almost gone. Feel a little silly but, I ordered more of this so I could continue to use it on my face and then discovered the rest of the line. I&#x27;m a little slow on the uptake since I&#x27;m awfully late to the game, but I am just beginning to understand these kinds of products and why they work so well. I&#x27;ve always assumed the creams that work well are cost prohibitive, but that is simply not the case, I am very pleased to say!</li>
            <li> Doubtful it has improved my appearance around eyes but didn&#x27;t really expect it to help.  I use it and an eye cream daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this a number of times because I like the product.  However, half the time the dispenser doesn&#x27;t work and I end up not being able to use the product.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Very light texture and absorbs fast. I was a little concerned that being a Retinol product it will be drying on my eyes. Glad that I was wrong. Good product and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Feels great on Skin...</li>
            <li> Love It This eye cream glides on easy and doesn&#x27;t weigh your eye down like some other products&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched for a food eye cream for puffiness ad bags and finally found it! No greasiness at all. I&#x27;m 35 and started getting tires looking eyes and this product definitely helped!</li>
            <li> As an African American male, it did nothing for my eye bags/</li>
