            <li>It arrived very quickly and it impeccable condition.</li>
            <li>aprox 280 Lbs of mostly muscle (him, not me) and a sneer on his face that would make a lion want to eat his own bootyhole for breakfast.</li>
            <li>or does this cologne smell like aqua gio, its not as strong smells real good, but its real close to aqua gio</li>
            <li>bottle is very nice and the sent is loved by my wife and other women lol</li>
            <li>ive tried this is the best , I liked guess suede is similar to that</li>
            <li>My first experience with it was great.</li>
            <li>and I like it but not as good as the True Religion Drifter.</li>
            <li>I was have true religion from macy and was good and cost 70$</li>
            <li>I smelled this is in the true religion store and loved it.</li>

            <li>I bought it recently and very happy with it.</li>
            <li>AND it was a fantastic price!</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the packaging.</li>
            <li>I was worried about buying cologne online at such a discounted price, but it turned out to be a great experience!  </li>
            <li>I love this cologne.</li>
            <li>It smells so delicious and the bottle is equally manly.</li>
            <li>Smells like the stuff I bought at the store, but for a much better price.</li>
            <li>.. WILL BE BUYING MORE..</li>
            <li>I LOVE THE WAY THE BOTTLE LOOKS..</li>
            <li>This has got to be in my top 5 colognes</li>

            <li>I absolutely love this cologne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought it for my fiance before and it is my favorite scent out of all the ones he wears.</li>
            <li>Great summertime scent; light and crisp.</li>
            <li>First of all I am not rating this product as a 5 star like it the greatest item ever, I am rating this product as follows, would it have been the same product if I bought this at the retail store, was it worth the money saved to buy it online, and am I happy with the product I got in the mail.</li>
            <li>I was excited to have found this!</li>
            <li>Compared to most places this is extremley cheap.  </li>
            <li>good Price and fast service</li>
            <li>Excellent price for this product compared to other stores.</li>
            <li>A woman of desire made a comment about how I smelled good enough to eat and rested her hand upon my arm, she smiled at me and I smiled back thinking about what a great choice it was to wear my True Religion on this particular</li>
            <li>i keep buying it because it is such a great scent.  </li>
            <li>Actually the fragrance itself is great...</li>
            <li>Smells awesome for half the price compared to buying it at a store!</li>
            <li>my dad now wants me to buy this for him every year!!!</li>
            <li>I have been so happy with the product, I re-upped and even tried a different True Religion scent.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly how to run a good business, and keep the customers coming back for more.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who likes True religion cologne.</li>
            <li>Maybe somebody more discerning could tell the difference if there even is one, but it seems like the real deal.</li>
            <li>love the spicy ,fresh aroma of this cologne, different than others that make u feel special, very good cologne for the price, i wish it would aroma would last longer , but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li>Light and clean, yet has a depth of a woodsy, warm spice in the back.</li>
            <li>Very manly, strong, unique smell.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>It came quickly.</li>
            <li>The cologne was shipped and delivered quickly and was well packaged-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never smelled it before I might have opened it to get a quick sniff</li>
            <li>just love it been using it since high school always getting compliments</li>
            <li>I just went to Macy&#x27;s to check the sent and then fell in love right away, haha.</li>
            <li>she rarely detects the True Religion when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li>But this is exactly the product!</li>
            <li>have gotten many a compliment on this here cologne and decided to wear it one fine evening whilst visting a local pub.</li>
            <li>I will edit this after I wear it out on a first date, see if just the smell leaves an impression after the first hug :) can be smelled up to 12 hours after spray up close and personal, I dont like over powering sprays as they should be enjoyed by the one you want to smell it not the whole room, buy this scent!!</li>
            <li>I get nothing but great compliments on the way my Cologne smells everyday.</li>
            <li>Delivering was early :)</li>
            <li>I had just gone 400 rounds with Mike Tyson, but what was even worse was that my wonderful scent had worn off by this point</li>
            <li>But wanted to find a better deal then what the  store offers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quality for the money, but it wears off pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>and i knew there would be risk involved and boy was i right</li>
            <li>He was less than pleased to see his woman touching and sniffing me as any man would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money ;)</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I ordered no fake wannabe,  Worth the money, get what you ordered.  </li>
            <li>Almost instantly, i recieved many compliments.</li>
            <li>Thanks !</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>I have this cologne as a present for my boyfriend and he love it.</li>
            <li>However, I bought my first bottle in Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t last more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>First picked up this product in TJ Maxx and have since purchased majority from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Service and Product are both First Rate.</li>
            <li>Pretty box</li>
            <li>got exactly what I wanted when I was pro used to receive it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and it&#x27;s exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and it was exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li>Good stuff plain and simple.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Other than that, amazing.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want to smell like everyone else and actually have a distinct personality to your scent and confidence, True Religion is your go-to.</li>
            <li>reviews saying it didn&#x27;t smell like the real thing , because it does.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s gone really fast.</li>
            <li>This is so much cheaper than what you would pay at Macy&#x27;s or Nordstrom&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I will also be updating the reviews as I see fit if I decover something in the future.</li>
            <li>From the first spray I was hooked and already have all the ladies at work liking the new smell.</li>
            <li>However, to by it at the True Religion store (a mistake i only made once) is 5x the cost.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, and it was cheaper than the smaller bottle in the local stores.</li>
            <li>I bought this cologne for my boyfriend from Macy&#x27;s a few years ago for Christmas, and both of us really enjoyed the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I wear cologne 6 out of 7 days a week, and normally use 3 sprays.  </li>
            <li>, I saw it on Amazon and jumped right on it hoping it was the same deal, turns out it was.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the smell of this cologne, a nice sweet slightly slightly musky scent, but like other reviewers have said the scent does not last very long at all.  </li>
            <li>I think I found my new cat call...</li>
            <li>Wife originally purchased this for me for a birthday/Christmas gift several years back.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion:  The first 4oz bottle lasted several years.  </li>
            <li>Once he used it up, I wanted to replace it for him at Christmas but didn&#x27;t want to pay the full price because i wanted to have room for other gifts as well - not just a repeat gift.  </li>
            <li>would have given this only one star, but after all was said and done Raul was rather gentle.</li>
            <li>So far out of the fragrance</li>
            <li>It is the same as the last bottle that was purchased full price at the store, does not smell any different.</li>
            <li>but a more subtle note .&lt;br</li>
            <li>All other positive reviews were spot on.</li>
            <li>it really doesnt last long...</li>
            <li>Smell really doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>Not as much of a fan of the other one I picked up, and prefer this</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t need it to last all day for such purposes...nor would you normally want it to (if testing numerous fragrances).</li>
            <li>really surprised smell like more expensive cologne</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and it wasn&#x27;t a watered down product or tampered with.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;re better off finding a cologne that will last you at least half a day</li>
    </ol>

            <li> ive tried this is the best , I liked guess suede is similar to that</li>
            <li> My first experience with it was great.</li>
            <li> and I like it but not as good as the True Religion Drifter.</li>
            <li> I was have true religion from macy and was good and cost 70$</li>
            <li> I smelled this is in the true religion store and loved it.</li>

            <li> Great summertime scent; light and crisp.</li>
            <li> First of all I am not rating this product as a 5 star like it the greatest item ever, I am rating this product as follows, would it have been the same product if I bought this at the retail store, was it worth the money saved to buy it online, and am I happy with the product I got in the mail.</li>
            <li> I was excited to have found this!</li>
            <li> Compared to most places this is extremley cheap.  </li>
            <li> good Price and fast service</li>
            <li> Excellent price for this product compared to other stores.</li>
            <li> A woman of desire made a comment about how I smelled good enough to eat and rested her hand upon my arm, she smiled at me and I smiled back thinking about what a great choice it was to wear my True Religion on this particular</li>
            <li> i keep buying it because it is such a great scent.  </li>
            <li> Actually the fragrance itself is great...</li>
            <li> Smells awesome for half the price compared to buying it at a store!</li>
            <li> my dad now wants me to buy this for him every year!!!</li>
            <li> I have been so happy with the product, I re-upped and even tried a different True Religion scent.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly how to run a good business, and keep the customers coming back for more.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who likes True religion cologne.</li>
            <li> Maybe somebody more discerning could tell the difference if there even is one, but it seems like the real deal.</li>
            <li> love the spicy ,fresh aroma of this cologne, different than others that make u feel special, very good cologne for the price, i wish it would aroma would last longer , but it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> Light and clean, yet has a depth of a woodsy, warm spice in the back.</li>
            <li> Very manly, strong, unique smell.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery</li>
            <li> It came quickly.</li>
            <li> The cologne was shipped and delivered quickly and was well packaged-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never smelled it before I might have opened it to get a quick sniff</li>
            <li> just love it been using it since high school always getting compliments</li>
            <li> I just went to Macy&#x27;s to check the sent and then fell in love right away, haha.</li>
            <li> she rarely detects the True Religion when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> But this is exactly the product!</li>
            <li> have gotten many a compliment on this here cologne and decided to wear it one fine evening whilst visting a local pub.</li>
            <li> I will edit this after I wear it out on a first date, see if just the smell leaves an impression after the first hug :) can be smelled up to 12 hours after spray up close and personal, I dont like over powering sprays as they should be enjoyed by the one you want to smell it not the whole room, buy this scent!!</li>
            <li> I get nothing but great compliments on the way my Cologne smells everyday.</li>
            <li> Delivering was early :)</li>
            <li> I had just gone 400 rounds with Mike Tyson, but what was even worse was that my wonderful scent had worn off by this point</li>
            <li> But wanted to find a better deal then what the  store offers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quality for the money, but it wears off pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> and i knew there would be risk involved and boy was i right</li>
            <li> He was less than pleased to see his woman touching and sniffing me as any man would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money ;)</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I ordered no fake wannabe,  Worth the money, get what you ordered.  </li>
            <li> Almost instantly, i recieved many compliments.</li>
            <li> Thanks !</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I have this cologne as a present for my boyfriend and he love it.</li>
            <li> However, I bought my first bottle in Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last more than 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> First picked up this product in TJ Maxx and have since purchased majority from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Service and Product are both First Rate.</li>
            <li> Pretty box</li>
            <li> got exactly what I wanted when I was pro used to receive it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and it&#x27;s exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and it was exactly what he wanted.</li>
            <li> Good stuff plain and simple.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Other than that, amazing.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to smell like everyone else and actually have a distinct personality to your scent and confidence, True Religion is your go-to.</li>
            <li> reviews saying it didn&#x27;t smell like the real thing , because it does.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s gone really fast.</li>
            <li> This is so much cheaper than what you would pay at Macy&#x27;s or Nordstrom&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I will also be updating the reviews as I see fit if I decover something in the future.</li>
            <li> From the first spray I was hooked and already have all the ladies at work liking the new smell.</li>
            <li> However, to by it at the True Religion store (a mistake i only made once) is 5x the cost.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, and it was cheaper than the smaller bottle in the local stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend from Macy&#x27;s a few years ago for Christmas, and both of us really enjoyed the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I wear cologne 6 out of 7 days a week, and normally use 3 sprays.  </li>
            <li> , I saw it on Amazon and jumped right on it hoping it was the same deal, turns out it was.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell of this cologne, a nice sweet slightly slightly musky scent, but like other reviewers have said the scent does not last very long at all.  </li>
            <li> I think I found my new cat call...</li>
            <li> Wife originally purchased this for me for a birthday/Christmas gift several years back.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion:  The first 4oz bottle lasted several years.  </li>
            <li> Once he used it up, I wanted to replace it for him at Christmas but didn&#x27;t want to pay the full price because i wanted to have room for other gifts as well - not just a repeat gift.  </li>
            <li> would have given this only one star, but after all was said and done Raul was rather gentle.</li>
            <li> So far out of the fragrance</li>
            <li> It is the same as the last bottle that was purchased full price at the store, does not smell any different.</li>
            <li> but a more subtle note .&lt;br</li>
            <li> All other positive reviews were spot on.</li>
            <li> it really doesnt last long...</li>
            <li> Smell really doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Not as much of a fan of the other one I picked up, and prefer this</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t need it to last all day for such purposes...nor would you normally want it to (if testing numerous fragrances).</li>
            <li> really surprised smell like more expensive cologne</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and it wasn&#x27;t a watered down product or tampered with.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;re better off finding a cologne that will last you at least half a day</li>
            <li> My everyday fragrance, but of course I wear True Religion jeans or shirt everyday as well</li>
            <li> Smells great.....for about 30 minutes..definitely not authentic, as much as I like this fragrance</li>
            <li> ONLY COLOGNE ILL BUY! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> he has talked about this product for a long time</li>
            <li> my only complaint is the smell does not last very long</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly and was just as expected.</li>
            <li> It is the same thing found in alot of stores for half the price!  </li>
            <li> this one is original its smell only 1 hour and its not nice like from store smell so sad</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I like wearing it as an everyday cologne since its not a very strong and its smells like a  daily spray.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really care if it was for myself, but this was for a gift and now it&#x27;s going to look weird</li>
            <li> Only bad thing I can say about this scent is: It doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Its too extreme for a scent that is usually gone by lunch time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like the usual true religion..kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually spray it a few times a day if I&#x27;m out.</li>
            <li> i usually wear in the morning ..</li>
            <li> I ordered the Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4-Ounce, but got 2 small 1.7 Ounce instead.</li>
            <li> Not satisfied, doesn&#x27;t reflect well on the seller.</li>
            <li> Not sure if buying online had something to do with it</li>
            <li> i like the scent of this cologne and have received compliments...but 1 complaint...</li>
            <li> Nowhere does it say the 3.4 oz bottle will come in the form of two 1.7 oz bottles - absolutely ridiculous.</li>
            <li> , i now have a 3.4 oz bottle of something that is undoubtably not TR cologne but a pretty poor attempt at a knockoff, the guys in times square wouldn&#x27;t even sell this... awful</li>
            <li> HATED THE SMELL AND DO NOT BUY SMELL LIKE OLD MAN &amp;^%$</li>
            <li> Use for casual wear and it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> or I just got a bad batch?</li>
            <li> WE HATED THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> I love the scent, and it was cheaper than the smaller bottle in the local stores.</li>
            <li> This cologne came a week sooner than it was supposed to. As soon as i took it out of the box, i could already smell it. Almost instantly, i recieved many compliments. The smell lasts all day unless yov are running around. With this bargain price, i recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> The Girls love the smell.. And best of all it lasts for a a good  6-8 hours :)</li>

            <li> Excellent fragrance for the price.Greatlly satisfied with purchase</li>
            <li> I ordered this my mistake but it still has a very good smell and I like it but not as good as the True Religion Drifter.</li>
            <li> Not please at all, the cap pop off and can not be replace back on toilette spray.Do not package the cap separate from toilette.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service from perfumespot.com! Now I&#x27;m just waiting for my boyfriend to be as happy as I am when he sees this!</li>
            <li> The smell gets the attention of many of my friends, but after time you forget that you are wearing it. This may be a knock-off. Beware.</li>
            <li> It is not the best one, but one should have it in his collection. I bought it recently and very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my boyfriend for his birthday but it was more like a gift to me! I love the smell!!! AND it was a fantastic price! Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Love the way this smells!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great. It came quickly. I was pleased with the packaging. I would recommend this product to anyone who likes True religion cologne.</li>
            <li> i like the scent of this cologne and have received compliments...but 1 complaint...it really doesnt last long...i usually wear in the morning ..by noon..i can&#x27;t smell myself anymore..</li>
            <li> My everyday fragrance, but of course I wear True Religion jeans or shirt everyday as well so it makes sense</li>
            <li> Always a worry to order fragrances online ! But this is exactly the product! Thanks ! Smells fancy... Lol.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my boyfriend from Macy&#x27;s a few years ago for Christmas, and both of us really enjoyed the fragrance.  Once he used it up, I wanted to replace it for him at Christmas but didn&#x27;t want to pay the full price because i wanted to have room for other gifts as well - not just a repeat gift.  I was worried about buying cologne online at such a discounted price, but it turned out to be a great experience!  The cologne was shipped and delivered quickly and was well packaged- cellophane wrapped box intact.  I thought maybe there&#x27;d be something off with the actual scent but it smells just like the bottle from Macy&#x27;s. Perfect!</li>
            <li> Keeping it short and simple. Fast service, good product, good price, and excellent communication. This is exactly how to run a good business, and keep the customers coming back for more. Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. It smells so delicious and the bottle is equally manly. My fiance loves it too so always a plus. I just went to Macy&#x27;s to check the sent and then fell in love right away, haha.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this!!!</li>
            <li> Smell really doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell of this cologne, a nice sweet slightly slightly musky scent, but like other reviewers have said the scent does not last very long at all.  This is a good price for the bottle here on Amazon but you&#x27;re better off finding a cologne that will last you at least half a day otherwise you&#x27;ll be retouching your scent all day with this one.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4-Ounce, but got 2 small 1.7 Ounce instead. Not satisfied, doesn&#x27;t reflect well on the seller.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend for Christmas this year. It only took 3 days to get delivered he has talked about this product for a long time so I figured I&#x27;d get it for him. I&#x27;ve never smelled it before I might have opened it to get a quick sniff and I LOVVVEEEE IT. Totally worth the money ;)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like the usual true religion..kind of disappointed. Would like my money back need advice on how to do it</li>
            <li> Was a gift for my father....great price!!</li>
            <li> this cologne is so good! i keep buying it because it is such a great scent.  I cant find it in stores but i always know i can find it at my one stop store online.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne! my only complaint is the smell does not last very long</li>
            <li> good Price and fast service</li>
            <li> Really good cologne. I like wearing it as an everyday cologne since its not a very strong and its smells like a  daily spray. I&#x27;ve used the body wash collection and really liked them and decided to buy the cologne. I recommend it. Delivering was early :)</li>
            <li> So why only two stars you ask, well give me a second of your time and I will tell you why only two stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten many a compliment on this here cologne and decided to wear it one fine evening whilst visting a local pub. A woman of desire made a comment about how I smelled good enough to eat and rested her hand upon my arm, she smiled at me and I smiled back thinking about what a great choice it was to wear my True Religion on this particular evening.&lt;br /&gt;I allowed her to purchase me one drink and then another all the while chatting away with her and planning out the rest of our evening together, this is when her boyfriend came back from wherever it was he had been. 6&#x27;5 aprox 280 Lbs of mostly muscle (him, not me) and a sneer on his face that would make a lion want to eat his own bootyhole for breakfast. He was less than pleased to see his woman touching and sniffing me as any man would be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A scuffle ensued and police were called, when all was said and done we were both locked up with me looking like I had just gone 400 rounds with Mike Tyson, but what was even worse was that my wonderful scent had worn off by this point and I didn&#x27;t have my bottle to refresh my shine.&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t matter to my cellmate though as he wasn&#x27;t into me based on my smell, by the time the weekend was over and I was released I was no longer a virgin and no longer wanted this cologne in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got home I promptly threw out this bottle so as to never have to go through this trauma again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given this only one star, but after all was said and done Raul was rather gentle.</li>
            <li> Smells like the stuff I bought at the store, but for a much better price. Maybe somebody more discerning could tell the difference if there even is one, but it seems like the real deal.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy cologne from anywhere but here from now own!</li>
            <li> great gift for son !!</li>
            <li> My husband wears this parfume, it smells Awesome. Very manly, strong, unique smell. Yet comfortable, not overpowering, great smell for a good man.</li>
            <li> I get nothing but great compliments on the way my Cologne smells everyday. I think I found my new cat call...</li>
            <li> Great  love the smell! !</li>
            <li> my dad now wants me to buy this for him every year!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quality for the money, but it wears off pretty quickly.  Other than that, it is a good cologne and you can&#x27;t beat the price compared to in store.</li>
            <li> Awesome choice.  Smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Great price on a great cologne</li>
            <li> I was have true religion from macy and was good and cost 70$ i order is here on amazon and i dont thing this one is original its smell only 1 hour and its not nice like from store smell so sad</li>
            <li> love the spicy ,fresh aroma of this cologne, different than others that make u feel special, very good cologne for the price, i wish it would aroma would last longer , but it&#x27;s good enough. still like a lot.</li>
            <li> Brought this for my cousin and he loved it!!!!</li>
            <li> Good value for the money.  This was a Christmas gift for my grandson.  He was very pleased with it and likes the fragrance.</li>
            <li> bought for my boyfriend for christmas stocking stuffer! he loved it! this cologne smells so good! one of my favorites! it came packaged nicely and on time! definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I recommend it. True Religion smells wonderful on my boyfriend and he loved receiving it as a gift. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Light and clean, yet has a depth of a woodsy, warm spice in the back. This is now my signature scent with Drifter for nighttime wear (and I have over 10 colognes in the drawer!). If you don&#x27;t want to smell like everyone else and actually have a distinct personality to your scent and confidence, True Religion is your go-to.</li>
            <li> i have been wearing this cologne for about 2 years now, i know that TR no longer carries this scent in stores or online and i knew there would be risk involved and boy was i right, i now have a 3.4 oz bottle of something that is undoubtably not TR cologne but a pretty poor attempt at a knockoff, the guys in times square wouldn&#x27;t even sell this... awful</li>
            <li> ANOTHER GREAT BUY!!! MY WIFE LOVES THE WAY IT SMELL.. WILL BE BUYING MORE.. I LOVE THE WAY THE BOTTLE LOOKS..</li>
            <li> or does this cologne smell like aqua gio, its not as strong smells real good, but its real close to aqua gio</li>
            <li> Nice product and service!</li>
            <li> This has got to be in my top 5 colognes just love it been using it since high school always getting compliments love the price too</li>
            <li> Smells awesome for half the price compared to buying it at a store! I will always get it for my boyfriend here!</li>
            <li> This product was delivered on time and it smells awesome. I have this cologne as a present for my boyfriend and he love it. I recommend it</li>
            <li> Great package  &amp; smell!</li>
            <li> The smell last maybe for a hour</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this TRUE RELIGION , it smells so good another product I brought for my husband and was happy that I didn&#x27;t listen to some of them reviews saying it didn&#x27;t smell like the real thing , because it does. I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> very nice purchase fits great.</li>
            <li> This is one of my grandsons favorites, it was one of many things on his Christmas &amp;#34;wish list&amp;#34;! He got everthing!</li>
            <li> Only bad thing I can say about this scent is: It doesn&#x27;t last long. I usually spray it a few times a day if I&#x27;m out. Other than that, amazing.</li>
            <li> Actually the fragrance itself is great...but it&#x27;s gone really fast. It arrives as a &#x27;tester&#x27; and I know most say there is no difference..but I wonder if some samples are just for the purpose of testing. You wouldn&#x27;t need it to last all day for such purposes...nor would you normally want it to (if testing numerous fragrances). I will say I tested Geir at the Epcot Norway section and I could still detect it laying in bed that night. My wife stated the same thing..she rarely detects the True Religion when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
            <li> good smells here folks if you fart in the car like i do, spray this on like i do in the rickey booby dodge, covers up beer and mexican food too!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I bought this cologne. My first experience with it was great. It smells great and the scent lasted longer than most of the reviews on here said it did. However, I bought my first bottle in Macy&#x27;s. This second time around I ordered it online and it is completely different. The scent doesn&#x27;t last more than 30 minutes. Very disappointed. Not sure if buying online had something to do with it or I just got a bad batch?</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband or Christmas. He loves it, and I love it so what else is there to say! :) Great product!</li>
            <li> The perfect gift for Christmas. My son loves the spray. Excellent price for this product compared to other stores. I will re-order.</li>
            <li> I smelled this is in the true religion store and loved it. I bought it as a Valentine gift and glad I did. Love to scent and the price was way under the same bottle at the store.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne before, and I will definitely buy it again. Great summertime scent; light and crisp.</li>
            <li> So far out of the fragrance ive tried this is the best , I liked guess suede is similar to that but a more subtle note .&lt;br /&gt;the bottle is very nice and the sent is loved by my wife and other women lol</li>
            <li> Purchased this as a gift for my son and he loved it. Smells really good but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Smells great pkg was good</li>
            <li> Great Service and item</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cologne. However, to by it at the True Religion store (a mistake i only made once) is 5x the cost. Its too extreme for a scent that is usually gone by lunch time.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my hubby. It was an excellent bargain and is OUR favorite men&#x27;s cologne. We definitely recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Preface:  Wife originally purchased this for me for a birthday/Christmas gift several years back.  I had finally run out, and re-upped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1)  Affordable&lt;br /&gt;2)  Great Scent (although that is subjective)&lt;br /&gt;3)  A little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;1)  None that I can think of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  The first 4oz bottle lasted several years.  I wear cologne 6 out of 7 days a week, and normally use 3 sprays.  I have been so happy with the product, I re-upped and even tried a different True Religion scent.  Not as much of a fan of the other one I picked up, and prefer this original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Box and packaging were legitimate.  Quick shipping, great service!  A++</li>
            <li> First picked up this product in TJ Maxx and have since purchased majority from Amazon. Love the scent and wife loves the scent. Service and Product are both First Rate.</li>
            <li> Great price. Wonderful scent. Pretty box</li>
            <li> Smells great.....for about 30 minutes..definitely not authentic, as much as I like this fragrance I&#x27;ll just stick to buying them in department stores</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I ordered no fake wannabe,  Worth the money, get what you ordered.  Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it again.  By the way girls love it.</li>
            <li> Good smell, but it does not hold at all. Use for casual wear and it gets the job done. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Good stuff plain and simple.&lt;br /&gt;I got exactly what I wanted when I was pro used to receive it. God Job</li>
            <li> This is so much cheaper than what you would pay at Macy&#x27;s or Nordstrom&#x27;s.  I will be buying this from amazon from here on out.  It smells phenominally--a sweeter smelling cologne for men.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and it&#x27;s exactly what we wanted. The shipping was fast and it wasn&#x27;t a watered down product or tampered with.</li>
            <li> Great price and shipped quick! All other positive reviews were spot on.</li>
            <li> First of all I am not rating this product as a 5 star like it the greatest item ever, I am rating this product as follows, would it have been the same product if I bought this at the retail store, was it worth the money saved to buy it online, and am I happy with the product I got in the mail. If all those are a yes for me then I will give it 5 stars. I am not just rating it 5 stars cause its the best product of its class, that is for each person to decide. I will also be updating the reviews as I see fit if I decover something in the future. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smelled it at the store but didnt want to pay $79.00 for it, I saw it on Amazon and jumped right on it hoping it was the same deal, turns out it was. From the first spray I was hooked and already have all the ladies at work liking the new smell. I will edit this after I wear it out on a first date, see if just the smell leaves an impression after the first hug :) can be smelled up to 12 hours after spray up close and personal, I dont like over powering sprays as they should be enjoyed by the one you want to smell it not the whole room, buy this scent!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cologne. I&#x27;ve bought it for my fiance before and it is my favorite scent out of all the ones he wears. It arrived very quickly and it impeccable condition. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for his birthday and it was exactly what he wanted. Great price for the quanity.</li>
            <li> I ordered the 3.4 oz bottle and instead I received two 1.7 oz bottles.  I wouldn&#x27;t really care if it was for myself, but this was for a gift and now it&#x27;s going to look weird - why would anyone buy someone two 1.7 oz bottles of cologne?!  Nowhere does it say the 3.4 oz bottle will come in the form of two 1.7 oz bottles - absolutely ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Not the best of fragrances,  I did keep it but wouldn&#x27;t order a refill.</li>
            <li> Everything was on time and product was perfect!!</li>
            <li> Amazing smell! Arrived promptly and was just as expected.</li>
            <li> I love this scent! But wanted to find a better deal then what the  store offers. I was excited to have found this! It is the same as the last bottle that was purchased full price at the store, does not smell any different. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> WE HATED THIS PRODUCT I WISH I COULD GET A REFUND MY BOYFRIEND HATED THE SMELL AND DO NOT BUY SMELL LIKE OLD MAN &amp;^%$</li>
