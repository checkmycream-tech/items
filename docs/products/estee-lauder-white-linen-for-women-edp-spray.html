            <li>/&gt;This is one those scents I rarely wear</li>
            <li>I first drawn to it for its fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I used to buy many different brands but now only use White Linen it is the best by far.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing White Linen for more than 20 years.</li>

            <li>but I don&#x27;t like it now as much as I did like it in store.</li>
            <li>Price was reasonable as perfume goes.  </li>
            <li>She really REALLY has been wanting some</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I have worn this fragrance for several years and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Tried to return and returns were not accepted so straight to the trash it went.</li>
            <li>This aroma was not the same on me as the original.  </li>
            <li>It was nice to see it on Amazon for $20 cheaper than I usually pay.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and I know it will never let me down.</li>
            <li>Still my hands down favorite for her</li>
            <li>I love Estee fragrances because they last a long time.  </li>
            <li>The item descriptions are to the tee, new or used.</li>
            <li>Has used it before so nothing new for her.  </li>
            <li>It smelled very old.</li>
            <li>These perfumes are highly rated by the professional perfume reviewers.</li>
            <li>While this was shipped quickly it was not packed quite as well as I would have liked but other than a slightly dented inner box, all was well.</li>
            <li>I have worn this fragrance in the past many times.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly the Same as I remember.</li>
            <li>White linen is such a clean scent</li>
            <li>The new perfume is Pure White Linen.  </li>
            <li>Is this old perfume?</li>
            <li>it smells old or like it has been in the sun-</li>
            <li>B001BQXTQO Loves Baby Soft By Mem For Women.</li>
            <li>I have been buying this perfume for my wife for nearly 30 years.</li>
            <li>It feels somewhat heavy and wouldn&#x27;t last for more than 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>This is also a true hidden treasure.</li>
            <li>It is not a sexy, vampish perfume but more a girl next door/mom scent.  </li>
            <li>I have used white linen for a long time, and it has a lasting fragrance that always makes you feel special.</li>
            <li>If this is White Linen by Estee Lauder, then it is VERY old.  </li>
            <li>No 5 Women, 3.4oz / 100ml EDP, SPRAY, NEW &amp; SEALED]] in the winter, but haven&#x27;t left White Linen</li>
            <li>and I love it because I hate strong florals.</li>
            <li>Now, since I am on Social Security; I can&#x27;t just buy it when I want.  </li>
            <li>The flowers are not bold, just gentle.  </li>

            <li> I have used this fragrance for years and it became my signature fragrance. It has a light, clean smell.  It was nice to see it on Amazon for $20 cheaper than I usually pay.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, just as described</li>
            <li> I have used white linen for a long time, and it has a lasting fragrance that always makes you feel special. I love the smell, and I know it will never let me down.</li>
            <li> I love Estee fragrances because they last a long time.  If I didn&#x27;t know better, I would swear this was a fake.  Completely different than previous purchases of this product.</li>
            <li> i bought for my moms valentine day present. this is her fav. fragrance wish it was a little cheaper though..</li>
            <li> My favorite scent!  The price was less than at Nordstrom&#x27;s or Macy&#x27;s too!</li>
            <li> I have bought white linen before and loved it.This one the scent doesn&#x27;t last. Is this old perfume?</li>
            <li> Found this on line and ordered it.. Arrived on time as said..Was a perfect Birthday present for my mom..Would order again.</li>
            <li> This a perfume that I have been wearing for 20 years.  I recently tried another Estee Lauder but went back to this one.  By the way, the service from Amazon was excellent.</li>
            <li> Great deal ! Prompt service!! :) Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m rating this purchase 5 stars because it was a great price on my favorite perfume and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the delivery time. I recommend shopping with Amazon for so many reasons but I&#x27;d have to say the number one reason is that what you see is what you get. The item descriptions are to the tee, new or used. Thanks again Amazon for coming through for me.</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance in the past many times.  This time the smell is totally different.  Not sure if my body chemistry has changed or if the spray is old and or outdated.  Will have to compare with Macy&#x27;s fragrance counter.</li>
            <li> I tried this product in store but it was way too expensive so I decided to get it from Amazon. There were so many positive reviews so I got it but I don&#x27;t like it now as much as I did like it in store. It feels somewhat heavy and wouldn&#x27;t last for more than 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li> While this was shipped quickly it was not packed quite as well as I would have liked but other than a slightly dented inner box, all was well. Price was reasonable as perfume goes.  Wife still likes the fragrance and that works for me.</li>
            <li> I love Estee Lauder perfumes, just not this one...Beautiful  and Pleasures  r  2 of my favorites  would try  her other ones</li>
            <li> Mom liked it for her birthday.  She has been wearing it for decades.</li>
            <li> this was a gift to my wife , She loves it.</li>
            <li> It is delightful. I receive many compliments on the aroma</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a sophisticated yet light fragrance for sometime. I wanted a perfume that would smell fresh and clean without announcing my prescence before I entered the room. I believe I have found it! This has a lasting scent. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> it smells old or like it has been in the sun- i know what damaged perfume smells like having had enough of it!</li>
            <li> Makes a fine Anniversary Gift.  Good Price.</li>
            <li> This fragrance smelt like a bush bug and it is very strong. I actually bought it for my mom who loves it but i cannot take the scent and i love loud perfumes.</li>
            <li> I have used White Linen for 30 years and it is absolutely timeless and lovely. So glad I looked on Amazon to make a smart, money saving indulgence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always lovef this scent. Hadn&#x27;t worn it in years. It&#x27;s exactly the Same as I remember. I still love it!</li>
            <li> I L.O.V.E. this stuff!</li>
            <li> My very favorite scent!</li>
            <li> Great Price, product and quick shipping</li>
            <li> This is such a light happy scent and a very fair price compared to other companies!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my mom. She really REALLY has been wanting some so it was a great b-day present. The problem is that it has no stem. So, to get the perfume out or put a stem you would have to literally break the seal on top that seems to be welded on. The other issue is that Amazon doesn&#x27;t allow returns on things like this. Don&#x27;t buy from this company. What a joke.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing White Linen for more than 20 years. It and [[ASIN:B000C214HE Joy By Jean Patou For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 2.5 Ounces]] were the first \\&quot;grown up\\&quot; perfumes I wore. As a teen (in the 80s!) I wore the ubiquitous [[ASIN:B001BQXTQO Loves Baby Soft By Mem For Women. Cologne Spray 1.75-Ounce]] and [[ASIN:B00CQ1BTMY Love&#x27;s Fresh Lemon by Dana for Women 1.5 oz Body Mist]]. (Hmmm...that&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve thought about them for years. They would make a nice gift for my nieces and any young teens you know!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; \\&quot;Grown up\\&quot; perfumes (like my mom&#x27; signature scent, [[ASIN:B000C1VWIQ Youth Dew by Estee Lauder for Women - 2.2 Ounce EDP Spray]]) felt too heavy for me at that time. Since then, I do wear Youth Dew and also [[ASIN:B00BOJFWWC Chanel No 5 Women, 3.4oz / 100ml EDP, SPRAY, NEW &amp; SEALED]] in the winter, but haven&#x27;t left White Linen behind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White Linen is a blend of fresh florals including jasmine, rose, berry, moss and amber. I first drawn to it for its fresh scent. It reminds me of some unnamed scented soap. Just so clean and fresh and breezy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s a better scent for the warm weather months.</li>
            <li> If this is White Linen by Estee Lauder, then it is VERY old.  It STINKS like cheap Kmart perfume.  Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne since it first came out.  It&#x27;s just so great that I could bathe in it!  Nothing else I have found comes close to how great it is for me.  All cologne smells different on each person, but if subtle scents with a hint of citrus works for you this may be the one!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance!  It is my signature fragrance so I buy it often.  The price at Amazon is far better than thedeparzmet store.</li>
            <li> This a great value. This is one of those scents that is real classic and never goes out of style.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m not terribly adventurous when it comes to perfume as I find so many fragrances too heavy.  I have used White Linen for years and years!!  I HAVE tried others but always come back to White Linen.  It&#x27;s light and fresh and I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents</li>
            <li> Very pleased. Shipping was fast. I love this scent!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years. I have so many people tell me you smell so good. I used to buy many different brands but now only use White Linen it is the best by far.</li>
            <li> love it love it  my grandchildren know me by my smell</li>
            <li> As always...one of my favorites through the years. Great staying power.</li>
            <li> I have been buying this perfume for my wife for nearly 30 years. Still my hands down favorite for her and she loves it as well.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this for years and years and years.  Nothing else will do.  Now, since I am on Social Security; I can&#x27;t just buy it when I want.  The kids had been giving this to me for Christmas and birthdays; but not the two last years.  I was so happy to see that Amazon carried it and the price that was charged.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!!</li>
            <li> I have always loved this perfume.</li>
            <li> This was for my wife she likes it.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. This size bottle gives you more bang for your buck.</li>
            <li> I have worn this fragrance for several years and really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift. Mother in law loved it</li>
            <li> I Purchased this perfume for my mother-in-law and she absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> This has been my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume for over 30 years. This is a good value and makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> For  over 20 years, White Linen has always been my favorite fragrance.  The company changed the name, some time ago, and was very hard to find the original.  The new perfume is Pure White Linen.  This aroma was not the same on me as the original.  Was so happy to be able to find my favorite at Amazon.</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM ARRIVED BEFORE THE HOLIDAY, AT A PRICE THAT WAS EASY TO PAY.  YOU CAN&#x27;T GO WRONG WITH PERFUME FOR THE LADY IN YOUR LIFE.</li>
            <li> Always have been buying this for years. The best.</li>
            <li> same as the powder...using it for centuries...LOL</li>
            <li> This is one of those oldie but goodie Estee Lauder fragrances (created in 1978).  Yes, it smells a bit dated today but it is still good.  It truly does have that clean-clothes-hanging-in-the-sunshine scent.  It is not a sexy, vampish perfume but more a girl next door/mom scent.  Nothing dirty or carnal here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has that bright aldehyde scent that lingers with a bit of lemony/flowery scent which gives it that clean linen note.  The flowers are not bold, just gentle.  I smell a bit of rose, hyacinth, lily of the valley and jasmine.  Honey, cedar &amp; sandalwood give it some depth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one those scents I rarely wear but sometimes I just want familiarity &amp; easy &amp; this one works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you buy from a reputable seller; there are many fakes out there.  I always look for &amp;#34;Ships From &amp; Sold By Amazon&amp;#34; when buying here.</li>
            <li> A gift for my mother. She loves the stuff.</li>
            <li> I cannot find this in the store anymore.  But my mom kept telling me how she loves White Linen.  I found this to be the best price.  It was delivered quickly and in great shape.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing Whitle Linen for over 10 years.  This perfume has endured because it has such an attractive scent--so clean and fresh!  People who are familiar with it always seem to comment  &amp;#34;Oh, you&#x27;re wearing While Linen, I just love the way it smells&amp;#34;.  What better endorsement can you get?  Yeah, it&#x27;s an oldie but a really GREAT oldie!!</li>
            <li> Product smelled nothing like the fragrance should. It smelled very old. Tried to return and returns were not accepted so straight to the trash it went.</li>
            <li> great smell, love it.</li>
            <li> i have used white linen for years.  I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Birthday gift for my wife who loves this product. Great price and easy to order. Received product very quickly and in good shape.</li>
            <li> Great value I love this product,</li>
            <li> Wife loves it.  Has used it before so nothing new for her.  Smells good highly recommended product.  Probably priced quivalent for what it is.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic perfume. It reminds me the crispiness of Chanel 22 minus an astronomical price tag. This is also a true hidden treasure. While doing a research of Estee Lauder perfumes, I found out that the company does not spend a ton of money on advertising, leaving many of their wonderful creations from public eye. These perfumes are highly rated by the professional perfume reviewers. Since the prices are affordable, there is no issue with knock-offs as well. Estee Lauder has also not reformulated the original formula of White Linen, a common practice elsewhere that usually bring sub-quality results. This is a truly remarkable perfume worthy of admiration.</li>
