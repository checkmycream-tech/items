            <li>After spending time this summer in the Gulf of Mexico I was looking for something to replicate that perfect beachy hair.</li>

            <li>Love this product - introduced by my exceptional stylist!</li>
            <li>This product is awesome and really makes beautiful beach waves and adds a nice shine.</li>
            <li>Smells great and is perfect to help create soft waves in my hair without adding a lot of weight or making my hair crunchy!</li>
            <li>I just spray it on my hair after the shower when it is still damp, scrunch with my fingers and my hair looks beach sexy all day!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li>and I had to have more!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love how this makes my hair look!  </li>
            <li>You need to use exactly as instructed for best results.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>LOVE it!</li>
            <li>People commented on how shiny my hair was after I started using it and as processed as my hair is that is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>I like this product, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do much for my hair, but I don&#x27;t have awesome beachy waves</li>
            <li>and it comes out with nice beach waves.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and helps put some curl into straight hair.</li>
            <li>I already knew I liked it.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and is definitely nice &amp; light, but I still need to use a curling iron to get the beach waves look</li>
            <li>I really like this product and was very happy to find it online.</li>
            <li>Very nice light scent.</li>
            <li>Fabulous seller, amazing product, 10,000+ stars!</li>
            <li>If I had the kind of gorgeous, wavy hair that looks awesome after a day at the beach, I think this product would be essential.</li>
            <li>and I love touching my hair!</li>
            <li>Best product for bringing out a natural wave in your hair.</li>
            <li>Perfect for the summer to make your hair look naturally tousled.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li>This is a very light spray that doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue.</li>
            <li>great lightweight natural looking waves, so pleased!</li>
            <li>but this product makes my hair look great and really brings out waves and dare I say some curls as well.  </li>
            <li>And the shampoo and intensive conditioner in this same Awapuhi line are GREAT!!</li>
            <li>this is amazing, very lightweight and good hold.</li>
            <li>love the scent.</li>
            <li>I love this sea salt spray.</li>
            <li>Love they way this spray smells.  </li>
            <li>I would not want anyone touching my hair with this on it.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell.</li>
            <li>I love this product for adding volume.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>When I read these reviews it confirmed I had to have some!  </li>
            <li>and now I love my hair.  </li>
            <li>As an added bonus, I love that my hair smells like ginger all day.  </li>
            <li>This is just a guess, however, and would probably occur more often if you have your hands in your hair a lot.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again, because I&#x27;m convinced I can find something better, but I won&#x27;t be looking for something better until I finish this bottle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love</li>
            <li>I love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I love ginger, but if you dont you may not like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it makes me hair look tacky-for lack of anything better.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t as blown away as others are by it, but it does smell great and does about as good of a job with root lifting/volume as any other quality volumizing spray I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>It is not too strong, so it does not overpower my perfume when I wear it or bother my scent-sensitive co-worker, but if I sniff it I like the scent.</li>
            <li>My hair is slightly wavy at best</li>
            <li>Disregard the poorer reviews, I have extremely fine hair and wish I had this 30 years ago.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, but a ton of it, and this product did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>fine, wavy, color treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pros: I have fine, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>You need to understand that I have never before loved my seemingly lifeless baby-fine super straight hair.  </li>
            <li>So the price is justified.</li>
            <li>wild ginger scent is delightful, and the spray not only controls my frizz, but it keeps my curls and waves looking more uniform and defined.  </li>
            <li>I use: I spray ~10 sprays on damp hair and try to lightly mist all areas of my hair.  </li>
            <li>Feels light.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t perfect for creating waves but it works really well to add texture and is now an essential step before I create an updo.</li>
            <li>Absolutely 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li>This stuff does exactly what it says it will!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is good (but strong - you definitely smell the ginger).  </li>
            <li>Thanks! :)</li>
            <li>Super easy- great for when you&#x27;re in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to blow dry and style.</li>
            <li>i also own the \\&quot;big sexy hair\\&quot; texturizing powder..</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much for the look I was trying to achieve, which is more of a tousled look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good emergency item if I don&#x27;t feel like straightening my hair or doing big curls with my wand.</li>
            <li>I use this after I use my Redken Body Full products.  </li>
            <li>Sea Spray arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to this product, and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gives my post menopause slightly frizzy hair a lovely scent and nice beachy waves.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair, meaning its not thick, but there is a lot of it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair silky smooth, but neither does real sea spray.</li>
            <li>Even though I think its costly, its worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Paul Mitchell did not disappoint with this product--of course Paul Mitchell rarely disappoints me.</li>
            <li>Eager to now try more of the Awapuhi Wild Ginger line.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll use this spray to freshen up my hair and try to restore the curl and sometimes also after a fresh wash to help control my curls.  </li>
            <li>Many people have asked me if I have naturally wavy hair, which I do not.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It also still feels soft and silky, but it looks thicker and has more movement.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my hair look wild,sexy and yet so natural.</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair, I love to air dry my hair and this spray gives it volume and thickness</li>
            <li>I had beautiful waves, and my hair is actually softer and shinier when I use this product regularly.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product that is hard to get where I live.</li>
            <li>Once to see just how much wave could be had from my fine stick straight hair................</li>
            <li>I have a few favorite sea spray hair products, but this has moved to my number one favorite.</li>
            <li>This way you will avoid emptying the bottle too quickly as well as not having too much build up on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells great and didn&#x27;t make my hair stiff or sticky!</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have used much better beach sprays for about a third of the price of this one.</li>
            <li>but personally.. i didnt find the smell that appealing.</li>
            <li>i would say the feeling is somewhat similar but the powder provides a more tacky grip.</li>
            <li>use this in conjunction with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s clipless wand (hot iron).</li>
            <li>I know a lot of people use this first straightening their hair, but I have curly hair.</li>
            <li>Most &amp;#34;beach&amp;#34; sprays make your hair feel like you&#x27;ve actually soaked your hair for hours IN the ocean!</li>
            <li>I have NEVER been able to do any sort of beach waves in my hair before without having to use almost an entire bottle of hairspray.</li>
            <li>I totally get the authentic beachy look.</li>
            <li>This is my first</li>
            <li>This works well as a salt spray, smells wonderful, but only 3 stars as it makes hair so dull, and I prefer shiny hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay for a day I really don&#x27;t have a chance to do anything with my hair, but won&#x27;t be used as a daily product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved how my hair looked when we went to the beach, but was never able to replicate it even with Houston&#x27;s humidity.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, with my kind of straight hair, that isn&#x27;t the kind of look I can achieve.</li>
            <li>Hair looks so natural and full.</li>
            <li>i have fine pin straight hair, and i love the beach waves look but its so hard to get without having crispy or sticky hair.</li>
            <li>I much prefer the Paul Mitchell blow out spray for my fine blonde hair.  </li>
            <li>I have straight, fine hair and this product left my hair feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>It just made me look like my hair was kind of straight but limp looking, and it didn&#x27;t take out any of the frizz.</li>
            <li>The products in all the Awapuhi line are very overpriced.  </li>
            <li>(I have straight hair too.)</li>
            <li>perhaps its because i dont have any waves in my hair so thats why this product didnt really work for me.</li>
            <li>Really gives my hair much needed texture.</li>
            <li>I have to hide mine because everyone who comes over wants to use it.</li>
            <li>Gentle hold.</li>
            <li>and i did not care for the smell too much.</li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder lenght, completely straight and color treated.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would be the spray on, walk away, go out product I&#x27;ve been searching for.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t use too much though....</li>
            <li>I got this the other day (not through Amazon, but ordered another texturizing sea spray from Amazon and like this one better)-</li>
            <li>My hair dresser said it can be used with my other Paul Mitchell products to thicken even more</li>
            <li>This product may work better for other hair types.</li>
            <li>I have fine and dry hair that is wavy by nature.</li>
            <li>: Kind of pricey for a small bottle-</li>
            <li>This stuff really brings out my waves in my hair &amp; if you don&#x27;t use too much my hair is not stiff.</li>
            <li>It had only been in the last year two that I&#x27;ve been able to wear it curly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used several surf/sea sprays in the past (Bumble &amp; Bumble, KMS, Blow, etc) and Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Awapuhi Wild Ginger Texturizing Sea Spray is hands down the best out there right now.</li>
            <li>I purchased it after reading the hype about it in a beauty magazine, with high hopes for it.  </li>
            <li>Then the next day I skip the shampoo, put a shower cap on while bathing, then afterward I brush my hair through and then spray in some more of this stuff, scrunch, possibly use either a wave iron or crimping tool, and/or tease up a few of the roots, and voila- my hair looks (and smells) better than it ever has before in my life.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is very moisturizing, and so far it has worked well on my color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally really wavy and somewhat curly hair that goes completely berserk in the humidity, the wind, at the beach, and at the pool.  </li>
            <li>but I use awapuhi conditioning treatment as my normal conditioner, so hydrated.</li>
            <li>They have better shampoo and conditioner by other companies instead of Paul Mitchell but no other sea spray.</li>
            <li>I am on my third bottle right now.</li>
            <li>Love it, on time, little more than I usually pay.</li>
            <li>No other product has ever given my hair so much body.</li>
            <li>I tried this product multiple times thinking I put too much on the first time, so the second time I used VERY sparingly and my hair looked greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not usually a Paul Mitchell user myself, but this product puts its competitors to shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s better to spray in a small amount and use your fingers or a brush to disperse the product through your hair instead of just spraying like a maniac.  </li>
            <li>This stuff can be costly (mostly in store though, Amazon is a lot less!!)</li>
            <li>Since these are not only the main places and conditions that give me frizzy or uncontrollable hair, but also my favorite places to be, I buy a lot of hair products in an effort to keep my hair from looking like a complete mess.  </li>
            <li>but then again I&#x27;ve NEVER found a product that completely controls my wild hair!</li>
            <li>Introduced by my hairdresser and love it highly recommeded for finehair you only need a small amount for each using.</li>
            <li>This product is versatile enough to put in your hair when its wet and forget about it, lightly mist over your hair after you&#x27;ve curled it, or refresh your hair throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>as far as the feel, it kinda dries out your hair.</li>
            <li>It really gives my hair extra curl.  </li>
            <li>I started using the complete treatment</li>
            <li>Hair looks and feels natural, not plastered on as some hair spray does.  </li>
            <li>It works very well, even stays in the next day after sleeping on my hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t necessarily want to change what my hair looks like naturally, so I purchased this Awapuhi Wild Ginger spray and it REALLY helps me to look</li>
            <li>It also makes it soft.  </li>
            <li>(there&#x27;s an old one for you)  </li>
            <li>If I apply it on my hair straight from the shower it has a different look.</li>
            <li>needless to say i&#x27;m always in search of good hair voluminizing products.</li>
            <li>It has a little bit of a stronger scent than some of my other products but, overall, it works and does a good job.</li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t do much for combatting greasy hair (which I&#x27;ve used other texturizing sprays for), and doesn&#x27;t provide a whole lot of texture.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it MAY be slightly drying and make your hair more prone to breakage if used daily.</li>
            <li>it did provide a small amount of texture to my hair.. but not nearly enough to keep it puffed up for more than an hour.</li>
            <li>As far as a sea spray this is the one,their is no other to compair to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a texturizing spray that doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and sticky and</li>
            <li>I usually mist my hair lightly with water</li>
            <li>i have fine, limp, asian hair.</li>
            <li>The main issue I&#x27;ve found with other sea/surf sprays is that the high salt content strips the moisture from your hair, which I can&#x27;t help but feel is counterproductive.</li>
            <li>I just bought the product at a salon, and at first after spraying it through my hair it made my hair look OKAY, but after it dried my hair looked dull and waxy.  </li>
            <li>It also smells fantastic and doesn&#x27;t feel stiff or gross when it&#x27;s in.</li>
            <li>Now I feel like I have twice as much hair, and have found that it actually has a tiny bit of natural wave, especially if I \\&quot;scrunch\\&quot;</li>
            <li>but wow... the feel on your hair is gross.  </li>
            <li>I am a big fan of the awapuhi and wild ginger line from Paul mitchell.  </li>
            <li>My hair looked incredibly healthy, but thin.  </li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this stuff about a year and a half ago.</li>
            <li>This product is also very light weight which can be difficult to find in a curl or even some texturizing</li>
            <li>I have extremely fine, thin hair, and not a lot of it.  </li>
            <li>I seriously feel like I&#x27;ve been given a whole new head of hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is finally looking good after a while of bad hair days.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> It has a great scent, which is an added bonus.  </li>
            <li> This is also a great item for the summer because I spend a lot of time outdoors and by the pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Love this product - introduced by my exceptional stylist!</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and really makes beautiful beach waves and adds a nice shine.</li>
            <li> Smells great and is perfect to help create soft waves in my hair without adding a lot of weight or making my hair crunchy!</li>
            <li> I just spray it on my hair after the shower when it is still damp, scrunch with my fingers and my hair looks beach sexy all day!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> and I had to have more!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my hair look!  </li>
            <li> You need to use exactly as instructed for best results.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product!</li>
            <li> LOVE it!</li>
            <li> People commented on how shiny my hair was after I started using it and as processed as my hair is that is amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s amazing.  </li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do much for my hair, but I don&#x27;t have awesome beachy waves</li>
            <li> and it comes out with nice beach waves.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and helps put some curl into straight hair.</li>
            <li> I already knew I liked it.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and is definitely nice &amp; light, but I still need to use a curling iron to get the beach waves look</li>
            <li> I really like this product and was very happy to find it online.</li>
            <li> Very nice light scent.</li>
            <li> Fabulous seller, amazing product, 10,000+ stars!</li>
            <li> If I had the kind of gorgeous, wavy hair that looks awesome after a day at the beach, I think this product would be essential.</li>
            <li> and I love touching my hair!</li>
            <li> Best product for bringing out a natural wave in your hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the summer to make your hair look naturally tousled.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> This is a very light spray that doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue.</li>
            <li> great lightweight natural looking waves, so pleased!</li>
            <li> but this product makes my hair look great and really brings out waves and dare I say some curls as well.  </li>
            <li> And the shampoo and intensive conditioner in this same Awapuhi line are GREAT!!</li>
            <li> this is amazing, very lightweight and good hold.</li>
            <li> love the scent.</li>
            <li> I love this sea salt spray.</li>
            <li> Love they way this spray smells.  </li>
            <li> I would not want anyone touching my hair with this on it.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell.</li>
            <li> I love this product for adding volume.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li> When I read these reviews it confirmed I had to have some!  </li>
            <li> and now I love my hair.  </li>
            <li> As an added bonus, I love that my hair smells like ginger all day.  </li>
            <li> This is just a guess, however, and would probably occur more often if you have your hands in your hair a lot.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again, because I&#x27;m convinced I can find something better, but I won&#x27;t be looking for something better until I finish this bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love</li>
            <li> I love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I love ginger, but if you dont you may not like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it makes me hair look tacky-for lack of anything better.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t as blown away as others are by it, but it does smell great and does about as good of a job with root lifting/volume as any other quality volumizing spray I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> It is not too strong, so it does not overpower my perfume when I wear it or bother my scent-sensitive co-worker, but if I sniff it I like the scent.</li>
            <li> My hair is slightly wavy at best</li>
            <li> Disregard the poorer reviews, I have extremely fine hair and wish I had this 30 years ago.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, but a ton of it, and this product did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> fine, wavy, color treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pros: I have fine, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> You need to understand that I have never before loved my seemingly lifeless baby-fine super straight hair.  </li>
            <li> So the price is justified.</li>
            <li> wild ginger scent is delightful, and the spray not only controls my frizz, but it keeps my curls and waves looking more uniform and defined.  </li>
            <li> I use: I spray ~10 sprays on damp hair and try to lightly mist all areas of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Feels light.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t perfect for creating waves but it works really well to add texture and is now an essential step before I create an updo.</li>
            <li> Absolutely 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff does exactly what it says it will!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is good (but strong - you definitely smell the ginger).  </li>
            <li> Thanks! :)</li>
            <li> Super easy- great for when you&#x27;re in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to blow dry and style.</li>
            <li> i also own the \\&quot;big sexy hair\\&quot; texturizing powder..</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much for the look I was trying to achieve, which is more of a tousled look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good emergency item if I don&#x27;t feel like straightening my hair or doing big curls with my wand.</li>
            <li> I use this after I use my Redken Body Full products.  </li>
            <li> Sea Spray arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to this product, and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gives my post menopause slightly frizzy hair a lovely scent and nice beachy waves.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine hair, meaning its not thick, but there is a lot of it!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair silky smooth, but neither does real sea spray.</li>
            <li> Even though I think its costly, its worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell did not disappoint with this product--of course Paul Mitchell rarely disappoints me.</li>
            <li> Eager to now try more of the Awapuhi Wild Ginger line.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll use this spray to freshen up my hair and try to restore the curl and sometimes also after a fresh wash to help control my curls.  </li>
            <li> Many people have asked me if I have naturally wavy hair, which I do not.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It also still feels soft and silky, but it looks thicker and has more movement.  </li>
            <li> and I love the way it makes my hair look wild,sexy and yet so natural.</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair, I love to air dry my hair and this spray gives it volume and thickness</li>
            <li> I had beautiful waves, and my hair is actually softer and shinier when I use this product regularly.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product that is hard to get where I live.</li>
            <li> Once to see just how much wave could be had from my fine stick straight hair................</li>
            <li> I have a few favorite sea spray hair products, but this has moved to my number one favorite.</li>
            <li> This way you will avoid emptying the bottle too quickly as well as not having too much build up on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells great and didn&#x27;t make my hair stiff or sticky!</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have used much better beach sprays for about a third of the price of this one.</li>
            <li> but personally.. i didnt find the smell that appealing.</li>
            <li> i would say the feeling is somewhat similar but the powder provides a more tacky grip.</li>
            <li> use this in conjunction with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s clipless wand (hot iron).</li>
            <li> I know a lot of people use this first straightening their hair, but I have curly hair.</li>
            <li> Most &amp;#34;beach&amp;#34; sprays make your hair feel like you&#x27;ve actually soaked your hair for hours IN the ocean!</li>
            <li> I have NEVER been able to do any sort of beach waves in my hair before without having to use almost an entire bottle of hairspray.</li>
            <li> I totally get the authentic beachy look.</li>
            <li> This is my first</li>
            <li> This works well as a salt spray, smells wonderful, but only 3 stars as it makes hair so dull, and I prefer shiny hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay for a day I really don&#x27;t have a chance to do anything with my hair, but won&#x27;t be used as a daily product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved how my hair looked when we went to the beach, but was never able to replicate it even with Houston&#x27;s humidity.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, with my kind of straight hair, that isn&#x27;t the kind of look I can achieve.</li>
            <li> Hair looks so natural and full.</li>
            <li> i have fine pin straight hair, and i love the beach waves look but its so hard to get without having crispy or sticky hair.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Paul Mitchell blow out spray for my fine blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> I have straight, fine hair and this product left my hair feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> It just made me look like my hair was kind of straight but limp looking, and it didn&#x27;t take out any of the frizz.</li>
            <li> The products in all the Awapuhi line are very overpriced.  </li>
            <li> (I have straight hair too.)</li>
            <li> perhaps its because i dont have any waves in my hair so thats why this product didnt really work for me.</li>
            <li> Really gives my hair much needed texture.</li>
            <li> I have to hide mine because everyone who comes over wants to use it.</li>
            <li> Gentle hold.</li>
            <li> and i did not care for the smell too much.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder lenght, completely straight and color treated.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would be the spray on, walk away, go out product I&#x27;ve been searching for.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use too much though....</li>
            <li> I got this the other day (not through Amazon, but ordered another texturizing sea spray from Amazon and like this one better)-</li>
            <li> My hair dresser said it can be used with my other Paul Mitchell products to thicken even more</li>
            <li> This product may work better for other hair types.</li>
            <li> I have fine and dry hair that is wavy by nature.</li>
            <li> : Kind of pricey for a small bottle-</li>
            <li> This stuff really brings out my waves in my hair &amp; if you don&#x27;t use too much my hair is not stiff.</li>
            <li> It had only been in the last year two that I&#x27;ve been able to wear it curly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several surf/sea sprays in the past (Bumble &amp; Bumble, KMS, Blow, etc) and Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Awapuhi Wild Ginger Texturizing Sea Spray is hands down the best out there right now.</li>
            <li> I purchased it after reading the hype about it in a beauty magazine, with high hopes for it.  </li>
            <li> Then the next day I skip the shampoo, put a shower cap on while bathing, then afterward I brush my hair through and then spray in some more of this stuff, scrunch, possibly use either a wave iron or crimping tool, and/or tease up a few of the roots, and voila- my hair looks (and smells) better than it ever has before in my life.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is very moisturizing, and so far it has worked well on my color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally really wavy and somewhat curly hair that goes completely berserk in the humidity, the wind, at the beach, and at the pool.  </li>
            <li> but I use awapuhi conditioning treatment as my normal conditioner, so hydrated.</li>
            <li> They have better shampoo and conditioner by other companies instead of Paul Mitchell but no other sea spray.</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle right now.</li>
            <li> Love it, on time, little more than I usually pay.</li>
            <li> No other product has ever given my hair so much body.</li>
            <li> I tried this product multiple times thinking I put too much on the first time, so the second time I used VERY sparingly and my hair looked greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not usually a Paul Mitchell user myself, but this product puts its competitors to shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s better to spray in a small amount and use your fingers or a brush to disperse the product through your hair instead of just spraying like a maniac.  </li>
            <li> This stuff can be costly (mostly in store though, Amazon is a lot less!!)</li>
            <li> Since these are not only the main places and conditions that give me frizzy or uncontrollable hair, but also my favorite places to be, I buy a lot of hair products in an effort to keep my hair from looking like a complete mess.  </li>
            <li> but then again I&#x27;ve NEVER found a product that completely controls my wild hair!</li>
            <li> Introduced by my hairdresser and love it highly recommeded for finehair you only need a small amount for each using.</li>
            <li> This product is versatile enough to put in your hair when its wet and forget about it, lightly mist over your hair after you&#x27;ve curled it, or refresh your hair throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> as far as the feel, it kinda dries out your hair.</li>
            <li> It really gives my hair extra curl.  </li>
            <li> I started using the complete treatment</li>
            <li> Hair looks and feels natural, not plastered on as some hair spray does.  </li>
            <li> It works very well, even stays in the next day after sleeping on my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily want to change what my hair looks like naturally, so I purchased this Awapuhi Wild Ginger spray and it REALLY helps me to look</li>
            <li> It also makes it soft.  </li>
            <li> (there&#x27;s an old one for you)  </li>
            <li> If I apply it on my hair straight from the shower it has a different look.</li>
            <li> needless to say i&#x27;m always in search of good hair voluminizing products.</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of a stronger scent than some of my other products but, overall, it works and does a good job.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t do much for combatting greasy hair (which I&#x27;ve used other texturizing sprays for), and doesn&#x27;t provide a whole lot of texture.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it MAY be slightly drying and make your hair more prone to breakage if used daily.</li>
            <li> it did provide a small amount of texture to my hair.. but not nearly enough to keep it puffed up for more than an hour.</li>
            <li> As far as a sea spray this is the one,their is no other to compair to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a texturizing spray that doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and sticky and</li>
            <li> I usually mist my hair lightly with water</li>
            <li> i have fine, limp, asian hair.</li>
            <li> The main issue I&#x27;ve found with other sea/surf sprays is that the high salt content strips the moisture from your hair, which I can&#x27;t help but feel is counterproductive.</li>
            <li> I just bought the product at a salon, and at first after spraying it through my hair it made my hair look OKAY, but after it dried my hair looked dull and waxy.  </li>
            <li> It also smells fantastic and doesn&#x27;t feel stiff or gross when it&#x27;s in.</li>
            <li> Now I feel like I have twice as much hair, and have found that it actually has a tiny bit of natural wave, especially if I \\&quot;scrunch\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but wow... the feel on your hair is gross.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the awapuhi and wild ginger line from Paul mitchell.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked incredibly healthy, but thin.  </li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this stuff about a year and a half ago.</li>
            <li> This product is also very light weight which can be difficult to find in a curl or even some texturizing</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine, thin hair, and not a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> I seriously feel like I&#x27;ve been given a whole new head of hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is finally looking good after a while of bad hair days.</li>
            <li> and it only takes me minutes to flat iron my hair now!</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how long it lasted throughout the day, as well as how it does not have the greasy, flattening effect of some other hair oils and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not too long ago i dropped a fat stack and bought the entire line of awapuhi products..</li>
            <li> My hair felt quite soft and weighed down.  </li>
            <li> As was mentioned before, only air dry or use a defuser.  </li>
            <li> Also, when I add it to my dry hair it gives extra volume.</li>
            <li> Not sure it is worth the money, though, for the slight difference.  </li>
            <li> I have wavy hair, straightens easily, curls easily, and this product has enough hold to keep waves but won&#x27;t make your hair feel dry, crunchy, or disgusting.</li>
            <li> I use the moisturizing shampoo from the same product line, apply the Awapuhi Sea Spray liberally after towel drying my hair, comb it through with a wide toothed comb, and then scrunch it periodically while it is air drying.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time for curly, below shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Not greasy but just strange.</li>
            <li> It gives you a very subtle, mild beach hair look.</li>
            <li> I actually use my hairdryer on low because I don&#x27;t have time to let my hair completely air dry because it is so thick.</li>
            <li> i use my marrakesh oil along with some paul mitchell thickening spray and this, put my hair in wave clips and either let it air dry or hit it with the blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Dry,</li>
            <li> Spray it on damp hair and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use this on my hair when it is dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricier than any drugstore root/volume spray, which would be my main complaint.  </li>
            <li> If you have curly or wavy hair, you can spray it in when your hair is wet and let it dry.</li>
            <li> It perks up what little wave I have and gives extra body to my hair.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other salt sprays, this one won&#x27;t dry your head and scalp.</li>
            <li> It did give some hold to my waves but not much body or shine.  </li>
            <li> I spray this on my hair when it is wet</li>
            <li> like I spent 3 days in the salty sea.</li>
            <li> I spray it on when my hair is wet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not.  </li>
            <li> Like I&#x27;ve spent the day at the beach.</li>
            <li> not much.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t end up with the beachy waves I was hoping for, my hair just looked tangled and after a few hours fell flat and looked oily.</li>
            <li> Some products weigh my hair down which minimizes my waves while other products for wavy hair dry my hair out if I use them continuously.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, with me, anyway.</li>
            <li> As long as I keep running my fingers into the roots and messing it around it still lifts a little bit.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t something i found extremely pleasurable to smell.</li>
            <li> and thankfully it blends well with other contrasting products (i.e. Morrocan Oil).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly giving me beachy waves - just a bit of texture to make a bobby pin stay.</li>
            <li> I have never tried any other beach hair spray products before.</li>
            <li> use this sometimes when my hair is a little damp and other times when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
            <li> The hairspray in this line is also not recommended as it gives very minimal hold.  </li>
            <li> I use Aveda Be Curly when my hair is still very wet.</li>
            <li> with the sea spray i spritzed it around my roots, and tried to rough it up with my fingers and blow drying it up a little.</li>
            <li> Though it makes my hair look a little trashy, like I spent the night somewhere else</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is not amazing and initially, I didn&#x27;t know I felt about it.</li>
            <li> I have unusually thick coarse curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky or weigh hair down like the creams I used to use.</li>
            <li> so I do not need something weighing my hair down anymore.  </li>
            <li> slowly my hair would just become a flat mass.</li>
            <li> This seemed to make my hair sticky and weight it down after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Once it dries a bit and has started to curl, I spray this on my hair to add a little texture and define the curls a bit.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and sprayed my hair then dried it using a diffuser.  </li>
            <li> Have used this for a few years &amp; like how it works on my hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel gummy or heavy at all.</li>
            <li> and then I spray a few pumps of this product and scrunch my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair alaways felt stiff and brittle after the color.  </li>
            <li> I have curly/wavy, thin, long hair.</li>
            <li> have thick hair and it works well.</li>
            <li> I should mention I have thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> Smell is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> It was not a great smell.</li>
            <li> It also saved my hair from totally falling out after a very bad high-light job.  </li>
            <li> hair will feel dirty....</li>
            <li> I bought this and have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Even though I think its costly, its worth every penny. I just spray it on my hair after the shower when it is still damp, scrunch with my fingers and my hair looks beach sexy all day!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  Gives your hair volume without stickiness or stiffness.  You can still style the next day without a wash inbetween.</li>
            <li> I use this occasionally.  It has a little bit of a stronger scent than some of my other products but, overall, it works and does a good job.</li>
            <li> My hair is slightly wavy at best but this product makes my hair look great and really brings out waves and dare I say some curls as well.  I&#x27;ve always loved how my hair looked when we went to the beach, but was never able to replicate it even with Houston&#x27;s humidity.  I bought this and have not been disappointed. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair silky smooth, but neither does real sea spray. As was mentioned before, only air dry or use a defuser.  I actually use my hairdryer on low because I don&#x27;t have time to let my hair completely air dry because it is so thick. My hair is finally looking good after a while of bad hair days. My hair looks good on day two as well. And the shampoo and intensive conditioner in this same Awapuhi line are GREAT!! People commented on how shiny my hair was after I started using it and as processed as my hair is that is amazing.  It also saved my hair from totally falling out after a very bad high-light job.  I kid you not....I only have hair on my head today because of the shampoo and conditioner.  Try the sea spray.  I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Best smelling and most effective spray I&#x27;ve found. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! Disregard the poorer reviews, I have extremely fine hair and wish I had this 30 years ago. It smells good, it gives the hair great texture and I love touching my hair!</li>
            <li> i have fine pin straight hair, and i love the beach waves look but its so hard to get without having crispy or sticky hair. this is amazing, very lightweight and good hold. i use my marrakesh oil along with some paul mitchell thickening spray and this, put my hair in wave clips and either let it air dry or hit it with the blow dryer. great lightweight natural looking waves, so pleased! best part is i dont have to use alot so my bottle should last a while!</li>
            <li> I bought this after hearing several rave reviews from others about this product.  I wasn&#x27;t as blown away as others are by it, but it does smell great and does about as good of a job with root lifting/volume as any other quality volumizing spray I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s pricier than any drugstore root/volume spray, which would be my main complaint.  I have stick-straight hair, and I am using this product strictly for lift and texture. If I had the kind of gorgeous, wavy hair that looks awesome after a day at the beach, I think this product would be essential. If you have curly or wavy hair, you can spray it in when your hair is wet and let it dry. Gives a great \\&quot;beach-y\\&quot; texture/feel. Unfortunately, with my kind of straight hair, that isn&#x27;t the kind of look I can achieve.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this product.  I purchased it after reading the hype about it in a beauty magazine, with high hopes for it.  I have naturally wavy, fine hair.  It did give some hold to my waves but not much body or shine.  My hair felt quite soft and weighed down.  I am quite dissatisfied and will not be purchasing again.  The hairspray in this line is also not recommended as it gives very minimal hold.  The products in all the Awapuhi line are very overpriced.  I have used much better beach sprays for about a third of the price of this one.</li>
            <li> Paul Mitchell did not disappoint with this product--of course Paul Mitchell rarely disappoints me. The spray has a wonderful smell, sprays well, &amp; helps to make my hair wavy. I have a few favorite sea spray hair products, but this has moved to my number one favorite. Why? Because this gives my hair body and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair with any crunch. (I have straight hair too.) Eager to now try more of the Awapuhi Wild Ginger line.</li>
            <li> i have fine, limp, asian hair. when i compare my strand to one of my friends, it looks about 1/10 their size. needless to say i&#x27;m always in search of good hair voluminizing products. not too long ago i dropped a fat stack and bought the entire line of awapuhi products.. everything from the shampoo, conditioner, sea spray, hair spray, oil stuff.. and some deep conditioner. everyone raved about the smell in the reviews.. but personally.. i didnt find the smell that appealing. it does smell like ginger but it wasn&#x27;t something i found extremely pleasurable to smell. with the sea spray i spritzed it around my roots, and tried to rough it up with my fingers and blow drying it up a little. it did provide a small amount of texture to my hair.. but not nearly enough to keep it puffed up for more than an hour. slowly my hair would just become a flat mass. as far as the feel, it kinda dries out your hair. perhaps its because i dont have any waves in my hair so thats why this product didnt really work for me. i also own the \\&quot;big sexy hair\\&quot; texturizing powder.. i would say the feeling is somewhat similar but the powder provides a more tacky grip.</li>
            <li> Unlike other salt sprays, this one won&#x27;t dry your head and scalp. (It doesn&#x27;t actually have salt in it.) But it doesn&#x27;t give you the level of texture a salt spray will give you.</li>
            <li> After spending time this summer in the Gulf of Mexico I was looking for something to replicate that perfect beachy hair. This isn&#x27;t perfect for creating waves but it works really well to add texture and is now an essential step before I create an updo. This will be a beauty staple for me.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best salt sprays I have used.  Really gives my hair much needed texture.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products on the market for your hair. As far as a sea spray this is the one,their is no other to compair to it. They have better shampoo and conditioner by other companies instead of Paul Mitchell but no other sea spray.I have to hide mine because everyone who comes over wants to use it.</li>
            <li> I spray this on my hair when it is wet and it works great.  My mom gave me a sample she got at her sytlist and I had to have more!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do beachy curls without this anymore! Absolutely 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> love the scent. not sticky at all</li>
            <li> I love this sea salt spray. This product may be the best texturizer I&#x27;ve ever used and the smell is divine. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> By the reviews on this, you would think this transformed your hair from blah to AH-ha. It&#x27;s ight. Not that impressed, but not hating it. Doesn&#x27;t really do much for my hair, but I don&#x27;t have awesome beachy waves so go figure.</li>
            <li> This really is a great product! I&#x27;m not usually a Paul Mitchell user myself, but this product puts its competitors to shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several surf/sea sprays in the past (Bumble &amp; Bumble, KMS, Blow, etc) and Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Awapuhi Wild Ginger Texturizing Sea Spray is hands down the best out there right now. The main issue I&#x27;ve found with other sea/surf sprays is that the high salt content strips the moisture from your hair, which I can&#x27;t help but feel is counterproductive. I want my hair to LOOK like I came from the beach, not FEEL like I spent 3 days in the salty sea. I have wavy hair, straightens easily, curls easily, and this product has enough hold to keep waves but won&#x27;t make your hair feel dry, crunchy, or disgusting. I have a lot of fine hair, meaning its not thick, but there is a lot of it! This product is also very light weight which can be difficult to find in a curl or even some texturizing products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in conjunction with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s clipless wand (hot iron). This product is versatile enough to put in your hair when its wet and forget about it, lightly mist over your hair after you&#x27;ve curled it, or refresh your hair throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not amazing and initially, I didn&#x27;t know I felt about it. I&#x27;ve since grown to like it and thankfully it blends well with other contrasting products (i.e. Morrocan Oil).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found the spray to be very effective for my hair. It definitely doesn&#x27;t mimic the look after I get out of the ocean. The best use I found for it was as a refresh on non wash days. I did like the smell.</li>
            <li> this spray works awesome. I know a lot of people use this first straightening their hair, but I have curly hair. I use it to keep my hair from being frizzy and to help my curls bounce.</li>
            <li> Very nice light scent. Gentle hold.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> Love they way this spray smells.  I have unusually thick coarse curly hair.  I try not to wash my hair too often so I need some help in between with my curls.  I&#x27;ll use this spray to freshen up my hair and try to restore the curl and sometimes also after a fresh wash to help control my curls.  Not sure it always does exactly what I&#x27;d like it to but then again I&#x27;ve NEVER found a product that completely controls my wild hair!</li>
            <li> I like the look this product gives you but wow... the feel on your hair is gross.  I would not want anyone touching my hair with this on it. Don&#x27;t give the look I was going for though.</li>
            <li> I like this but daily use will damage your hair.</li>
            <li> Great styling oul with added shine</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair crunchier than I would like for what it costs. I will probably try a different product next time.</li>
            <li> If you have fine hair this is the best product I have ever used.  It works.  You get body.  I will never buy anything else but this.</li>
            <li> Was not too impressed. It did what it was suppose to but it left my hair extra sticky and i did not care for the smell too much. It was not a great smell. Seller packed and shipped it well but the product itself was not the best</li>
            <li> Hair type: Curly/wavy. Dry, but I use awapuhi conditioning treatment as my normal conditioner, so hydrated. I also always use the awapuhi hydrocream mousse after/with this.&lt;br /&gt;Shampoo: 1-2x /week&lt;br /&gt;How I use: after shampoo/conditioning with hair still damp. Spritz throughout hair, especially between layers (Picking some up hair and spritzing bulk of hair that roots between ears and crown). I have a lot of hair, so I&#x27;ll use 10-15 spritz total. Use fingers to separate any tangles  and &amp;#34;fluff out&amp;#34; hair. I follow with using the hydrocream mousse to encourage the beachy waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it. It smells great, and gives really good texture and &amp;#34;piecing&amp;#34; out my hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this product multiple times thinking I put too much on the first time, so the second time I used VERY sparingly and my hair looked greasy. I have fine hair, but a ton of it, and this product did nothing for me. It just made me look like my hair was kind of straight but limp looking, and it didn&#x27;t take out any of the frizz. Don&#x27;t be fooled by promises of beachy looking waves, or any sort of waves for that matter.</li>
            <li> This is very moisturizing, and so far it has worked well on my color-treated hair. I also like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great. I spray it on when my hair is wet and it comes out with nice beach waves. Also, when I add it to my dry hair it gives extra volume.</li>
            <li> This product is really good.  It really gives my hair extra curl.  Smells wonderful. I am on my third bottle right now.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Paul Mitchell blow out spray for my fine blonde hair.  This seemed to make my hair sticky and weight it down after a few hours.  It smells great.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that is hard to get where I live. This supplier is priced the same as Locally. Sea Spray arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used it a couple of times since my stylist recomended it to me.  I color my hair every 2-3 months, religiously.  My hair alaways felt stiff and brittle after the color.  I started using the complete treatment and I can tell the diffrence.  Its a great product line and I would recommend it to anyone.  If you dont have the money to buy it then dont.  Its just like the motto says.. You Pay For What You Get! Its fabolous on your hair and it only takes me minutes to flat iron my hair now! &amp;lt;3 it!</li>
            <li> This stuff does exactly what it says it will!!</li>
            <li> If your hair is thinning this product will help. Smells wonderful and helps put some curl into straight hair. Winner!</li>
            <li> Love it, on time, little more than I usually pay.</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine hair and this product left my hair feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> I read some great reviews so I decide to buy it. It gives you a very subtle, mild beach hair look. Compared to the Bumble/Bumble spray, I prefer BB. This, however, has a really great smell. I love the smell. It didn&#x27;t do much for the look I was trying to achieve, which is more of a tousled look.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the awapuhi and wild ginger line from Paul mitchell.  I tried this to use as a volumizer and I wasn&#x27;t all that impressed.  My hair is shoulder lenght, completely straight and color treated.  I followed the directions and sprayed my hair then dried it using a diffuser.  I didn&#x27;t end up with the beachy waves I was hoping for, my hair just looked tangled and after a few hours fell flat and looked oily.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It makes my hair awesome curly, I can put it on, throw my hair in my bike helmet and still have it look good. It also smells fantastic and doesn&#x27;t feel stiff or gross when it&#x27;s in.</li>
            <li> I love this product for adding volume.  It has a great scent, which is an added bonus.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This works well as a salt spray, smells wonderful, but only 3 stars as it makes hair so dull, and I prefer shiny hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It leaves no residue on the hair.  It perks up what little wave I have and gives extra body to my hair.  Many people have asked me if I have naturally wavy hair, which I do not.  Hair looks and feels natural, not plastered on as some hair spray does.  It is a must for me.  Sue</li>
            <li> Best product for bringing out a natural wave in your hair. Spray it on damp hair and let it air dry. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky or weigh hair down like the creams I used to use.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this stuff about a year and a half ago. A friend of mine suggested it and let me borrow some a couple of times when I was over. I was HOOKED. This stuff can be costly (mostly in store though, Amazon is a lot less!!) but it&#x27;s worth it. Trust me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this sometimes when my hair is a little damp and other times when it&#x27;s dry. It&#x27;s a good emergency item if I don&#x27;t feel like straightening my hair or doing big curls with my wand. This is also a great item for the summer because I spend a lot of time outdoors and by the pool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hair and it works well.</li>
            <li> My neighbor had this and I tried some, so I already knew I liked it. When I read these reviews it confirmed I had to have some!  Works great- just like it says!!</li>
            <li> This stuff really brings out my waves in my hair &amp; if you don&#x27;t use too much my hair is not stiff. I just spray a couple of sprays on my palms &amp; then scrunch the roots &amp; it is just enough after blow drying. It also smells like the rest of the line good.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and really makes beautiful beach waves and adds a nice shine. Perfect for the summer to make your hair look naturally tousled.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair is different and reacts to products differently. My hair is relatively curly and has always been a hassle. It had only been in the last year two that I&#x27;ve been able to wear it curly. I&#x27;m new to this product, and love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It adds texture in a different way from hairspray. I use Aveda Be Curly when my hair is still very wet. Once it dries a bit and has started to curl, I spray this on my hair to add a little texture and define the curls a bit. A little goes a long way, with me, anyway. So the price is justified. My curls last almost all day as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells GREAT too</li>
            <li> Introduced by my hairdresser and love it highly recommeded for finehair you only need a small amount for each using.</li>
            <li> This spray smells great.  I have curly/wavy, thin, long hair. I was really hoping this would be the spray on, walk away, go out product I&#x27;ve been searching for.  It&#x27;s really not.  It smells great, and is definitely nice &amp; light, but I still need to use a curling iron to get the beach waves look I desire.  It&#x27;s okay for a day I really don&#x27;t have a chance to do anything with my hair, but won&#x27;t be used as a daily product.</li>
            <li> I got this the other day (not through Amazon, but ordered another texturizing sea spray from Amazon and like this one better)- and now I love my hair.  You need to understand that I have never before loved my seemingly lifeless baby-fine super straight hair.  Now I feel like I have twice as much hair, and have found that it actually has a tiny bit of natural wave, especially if I \\&quot;scrunch\\&quot; it while it is drying.  I use the moisturizing shampoo from the same product line, apply the Awapuhi Sea Spray liberally after towel drying my hair, comb it through with a wide toothed comb, and then scrunch it periodically while it is air drying.  It looks and feels great. Then the next day I skip the shampoo, put a shower cap on while bathing, then afterward I brush my hair through and then spray in some more of this stuff, scrunch, possibly use either a wave iron or crimping tool, and/or tease up a few of the roots, and voila- my hair looks (and smells) better than it ever has before in my life.  It also still feels soft and silky, but it looks thicker and has more movement.  No other product has ever given my hair so much body. I seriously feel like I&#x27;ve been given a whole new head of hair.As an added bonus, I love that my hair smells like ginger all day.  It is not too strong, so it does not overpower my perfume when I wear it or bother my scent-sensitive co-worker, but if I sniff it I like the scent.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  Smells great and is perfect to help create soft waves in my hair without adding a lot of weight or making my hair crunchy!</li>
            <li> Most &amp;#34;beach&amp;#34; sprays make your hair feel like you&#x27;ve actually soaked your hair for hours IN the ocean! This is a very light spray that doesn&#x27;t leave a lot of residue. It smells great and gives me the texture I want. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it MAY be slightly drying and make your hair more prone to breakage if used daily. This is just a guess, however, and would probably occur more often if you have your hands in your hair a lot. Overall, great product!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have NEVER been able to do any sort of beach waves in my hair before without having to use almost an entire bottle of hairspray. It works very well, even stays in the next day after sleeping on my hair. I totally recommend this product!! It smells delicious too!</li>
            <li> I have naturally really wavy and somewhat curly hair that goes completely berserk in the humidity, the wind, at the beach, and at the pool.  Since these are not only the main places and conditions that give me frizzy or uncontrollable hair, but also my favorite places to be, I buy a lot of hair products in an effort to keep my hair from looking like a complete mess.  I don&#x27;t necessarily want to change what my hair looks like naturally, so I purchased this Awapuhi Wild Ginger spray and it REALLY helps me to look my best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wild ginger scent is delightful, and the spray not only controls my frizz, but it keeps my curls and waves looking more uniform and defined.  I was surprised at how long it lasted throughout the day, as well as how it does not have the greasy, flattening effect of some other hair oils and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a word of caution, it&#x27;s better to spray in a small amount and use your fingers or a brush to disperse the product through your hair instead of just spraying like a maniac.  This way you will avoid emptying the bottle too quickly as well as not having too much build up on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff on my fine hair. I spray it on after blow-drying. It&#x27;s not drying.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the item I ordered.  I ordered the texturizing sea spray and  what I received was shine spray!  Someone made a mistake and I want the correct product.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry and frizzy. I should have read up on the product before purchasing. Not for me. I didn&#x27;t think about the salt in it.</li>
            <li> Love how this makes my hair look!  Like I&#x27;ve spent the day at the beach.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s amazing.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again, because I&#x27;m convinced I can find something better, but I won&#x27;t be looking for something better until I finish this bottle.  Make sense?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is good (but strong - you definitely smell the ginger).  It provides a bit of texture.  But it doesn&#x27;t do much for combatting greasy hair (which I&#x27;ve used other texturizing sprays for), and doesn&#x27;t provide a whole lot of texture.  It&#x27;s not exactly giving me beachy waves - just a bit of texture to make a bobby pin stay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  Smell is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I use this after I use my Redken Body Full products.  Works great.  Get wonderful compliments on my &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; look!!! Can&#x27;t use too much though....hair will feel dirty....just 5 or 6 sprays.</li>
            <li> If you want the beachy, carefree look...this product is for you. I have curly hair and I love the way it makes my hair look wild,sexy and yet so natural.</li>
            <li> Same as with the finishing spray. I really like this product and was very happy to find it online. I can buy it in Florida now but will order online when I return back home.</li>
            <li> Hair type: fine, wavy, color treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best salt spray I&#x27;ve ever used! Hair looks so natural and full. Doesn&#x27;t look like I have any product in it at all.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair bounce with beauty.  You need to use exactly as instructed for best results. It also makes it soft.  Not like spray net.</li>
            <li> Have used this for a few years &amp; like how it works on my hair. Lasts a long time for curly, below shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product - introduced by my exceptional stylist!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a texturizing spray that doesn&#x27;t make my hair crunchy and sticky and this is it! I&#x27;m in love and I definitely know where to go if i run out! Seller is wonderful! Shipped out within 2 hours of me ordering it, received within 2 days, AWESOME communication! Fabulous seller, amazing product, 10,000+ stars! Thanks! :)</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product for adding body to your hair. LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Pros: I have fine, wavy hair.  Some products weigh my hair down which minimizes my waves while other products for wavy hair dry my hair out if I use them continuously.  This product solved both of those issues!  I had beautiful waves, and my hair is actually softer and shinier when I use this product regularly.  Bonus: I love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Kind of pricey for a small bottle- but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again when I run out.  I love ginger, but if you dont you may not like the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use: I spray ~10 sprays on damp hair and try to lightly mist all areas of my hair.  Then I scrunch it with a towel and go!  Super easy- great for when you&#x27;re in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to blow dry and style.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I have fine hair, I love to air dry my hair and this spray gives it volume and thickness and it is perfect for summer! I totally get the authentic beachy look. This is going to be a staple product for me now!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it now twice.  Once to see just how much wave could be had from my fine stick straight hair................not much. I doubt this is the products fault after all ya can&#x27;t make a silk purse out of a sows ear..(there&#x27;s an old one for you)  Today I tried it for volume before blow drying.  Just 2-3 sprays in damp hair did the trick.  Doesn&#x27;t feel gummy or heavy at all.</li>
            <li> Gives my post menopause slightly frizzy hair a lovely scent and nice beachy waves. Not sticky.  Feels light.</li>
            <li> I have extremely fine, thin hair, and not a lot of it.  My hair stylist used to put the Paul Mitchell root lifter and thicken up on my hair, but this time she just used the Awapuhi styling treatment oil on my hair after my cut and color.  My hair looked incredibly healthy, but thin.  I bought this at the salon and sprayed it in my hair when I got home.  Though it makes my hair look a little trashy, like I spent the night somewhere else last night, it thickened my hair up somewhat.  As long as I keep running my fingers into the roots and messing it around it still lifts a little bit.  Not sure it is worth the money, though, for the slight difference.  My hair dresser said it can be used with my other Paul Mitchell products to thicken even more so I&#x27;ll have to try that on my next wash.</li>
            <li> I have never tried any other beach hair spray products before. This is my first and I chose this one because of the reputation of the company. I have fine and dry hair that is wavy by nature. I prefer to use this on my hair when it is dry. I usually mist my hair lightly with water so it is not soaked-like when getting out of the bath. I mist my hair and then I spray a few pumps of this product and scrunch my hair. And it looks like I have been at the beach all day. If I apply it on my hair straight from the shower it has a different look. Not greasy but just strange. it makes me hair look tacky-for lack of anything better. I would by this again and found how it works best for my hair. Good value.</li>
            <li> Thxs.for the availablity of this product...great price too.Dont change a thing.Will need some in at a future date.Thank You</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bomb. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Smells great and didn&#x27;t make my hair stiff or sticky!</li>
            <li> I just bought the product at a salon, and at first after spraying it through my hair it made my hair look OKAY, but after it dried my hair looked dull and waxy.  I should mention I have thick wavy hair so I do not need something weighing my hair down anymore.  This product may work better for other hair types.</li>
