            <li> Little high in price</li>
            <li> Wear it year round - good for summer sun &amp; winter cold weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it before, when they used to sell it in the ABC stores in Hawaii, where I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time.  </li>
            <li> not exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> The lip balm was not smooth either.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t carry it anymore (?), and it&#x27;s hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for a family member as its impossible to find it locally.  </li>
            <li> I always carry lip balm to apply for protection from sun and wind and also because chapped lips are uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I  am disappointed.</li>

            <li> Goes on smoothly without a waxy feel.  Love that it has a 45 SPF.  Also, great price.</li>

            <li> I think this product tasted nothing like the flavor advertised. It tasted like sunscreen. The lip balm was not smooth either. I  am disappointed. I had one of the sports lip balms (orange labeling), I was pleased with that product. I hoped this would be as good if not better. I wished I had ordered the citrus sports version in orange packaging.</li>
            <li> LOVE this lip balm.  Smooth, non-irritating, yummy coconut flavor.  Hard to find at drug store, glad to find on Amazon, and price is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Worked great no chapped sunburn lips and spent a week in Hawaii. Where midday has the &amp;#34;super sun&amp;#34;. Def buy again</li>
            <li> Sunscreen works excellent!!  And has a great taste!  It is my favorite, hard to find so I bought it in bulk here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I like the price for a 6-pack, especially since I lose lip balm like Bobby pins; however there is a chemically aftertaste. I&#x27;ll keep using what I have since I&#x27;m still getting SPF protection, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a family member as its impossible to find it locally.  She gets huge sun blisters without wearing protection.  This product is the only one that works 100% of the time for her.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!  NEVER go without it. Wear it year round - good for summer sun &amp; winter cold weather.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm for three reasons.  First, it doesn&#x27;t feel waxy or greasy going on.  Second, it has a good amount of sunscreen to provide protection.  Third, it tastes good and smells great.  I always carry lip balm to apply for protection from sun and wind and also because chapped lips are uncomfortable.  This is my go to.  I&#x27;ve tried many others and either don&#x27;t like the feeling going on or while applied or they don&#x27;t have much, if any, sunscreen.  This solves the problem!</li>
            <li> This is great lip balm and hard to find locally. When I do, it costs a lot more. I&#x27;ll be buying regularly</li>
            <li> GREAT  FOR  SUNNY DAYS  ALSO FEEPS LIPS MOIST  LILA</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip balm ever. So happy to find it here!</li>

Thanks to Amazon, I&#x27;ve got a supply again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only lip balm I have found with 45 sunscreen that I like. Awesome. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> not exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> What can you say about lip balm?</li>
