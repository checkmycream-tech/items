            <li>Kuumba, you really do make the best scented roll on oils that I have ever found, this egyptian musk is quite unique</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>as many others have mentioned, it starts off smelling identical to Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess, which I LOVE.  </li>
            <li>I truly love this oil.  </li>
            <li>but I am more satisfied with this one than the others I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing Egyptian Musk (Kuumba) for about 15 years and get so many compliments about the scent.  </li>
            <li>grandchildren breathe it it and say they love the way grandma smells.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried &amp; used many roller egyptian musks.  </li>
            <li>many times the roller doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a lovely fragrance</li>
            <li>but it does have a lovely scent that turns heads and gets the complements from strangers in the grocery and</li>
            <li>Love this scent.</li>
            <li>My go to for oils has always been my favorite Egytpian Oil  </li>
            <li>Kuuba is totally authentic.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.</li>
            <li>will order again :)</li>
            <li>and I have enjoyed its fragrance over the years.</li>
            <li>yet it&#x27;s a clean kind of musk.</li>
            <li>I wish the bottle was amber to keep the light out, but it&#x27;s OK.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil, it&#x27;s one of the nicer ones available.</li>
            <li>U read the reviews thinking it&#x27;s this nice rare scent.</li>
            <li>sincerely hope that I can find the original Egyptian musk scent again.  </li>
            <li>I saw many times that reviewers were recommended they turn to KUUMBA MADE EGYPTIAN MUSK as a replacement because it strongly resembles the original Auric Blends</li>
            <li>it just doesn&#x27;t come out of the bottle easy.</li>
            <li>Lovely fresh and clean aroma!</li>
            <li>i consider this a light day wear fragrance.  </li>
            <li>just leave me smelling like a combination of plastic and a light scent of Egyptian musk.</li>
            <li>This stuff is so light in sent</li>
            <li>I really thought I liked this.  </li>
            <li>Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>Its a light smell.</li>
            <li>I prefer the texture of Kuumba Made over Auric Blends, because this one is light and seems to absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li>The smell is also not crazy strong, which I like.  </li>
            <li>though I was doing something special by ordering from amazon.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet, cloying, yet spicy, overpowering scent that kind of reminds me of old lady perfume.</li>
            <li>Smells so good and you only need the smallest amount.</li>
            <li>I have a girlfriend who introduced me to this stuff over the summer and absolutely loved the scent, but when I ordered it from a vendor from Amazon, Tom&#x27;s Incense I believe, is wasn&#x27;t the same.</li>
            <li>It arrived on time is the only good thing I have to say.</li>
            <li>Still trying to find a true Egyptian Musk Oil.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to find another perfume oil that I would love as much as Rain Musk by Aires.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a horrible scent, but it&#x27;s much too overpowering for my taste.  </li>
            <li>Soft, warm, and earthy.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and just as described.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a mild but provocatively scented oil.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you know what you&#x27;re buying, but otherwise decent product.</li>
            <li>love its soft gentle smell and so many people compliment me while wearing</li>
            <li>I first came across this lovely fragrant oil at a whole foods market.  </li>
            <li>very soft enjoyable smell</li>
            <li>You think im going to put poison on my skin to be absorbed into my body???</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift from a relative&#x27;s Wish List, and she was apparently thrilled with it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not someone who tolerates strong scents, particularly musk.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps when I mixed it with Kuumba Made Persian Garden it had a lovely sort of fresh clean spring/laundry scent.  </li>
            <li>Came right on time.</li>
            <li>Other reviewer is right - I too came to the conclusion that this smells more like plastic than egyptian musk -- burning plastic to be precise.</li>
            <li>I have total strangers ask me what I&#x27;m wearing, it smells fantastic and is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I really like the quality of Kuumba oils!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll probably just smear a bit more on for my daily cologne.</li>
            <li>When it was warmed up, the scent was pretty musky indeed</li>
            <li>And &amp;#34;ummm...not my first choice&amp;#34; were some of the responses.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be sure to get every last drop and not spill any.</li>
            <li>recommend this to any woman who likes a soft, clean smell...</li>
            <li>I felt I could passionately rave about like so many others</li>
            <li>Usually this oil smells good but</li>
            <li>The oil is not sticky, lasts long and roller on container works great (unlike other lines I have purchased)</li>
            <li>This SMELLS like the real thing.</li>
            <li>The Egyptian musk is soft and fresh, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t even touch the Auric Blends one after a week of trying to really like it.</li>
            <li>I wanted natural essential oil scents that are safe.</li>
            <li>Unlike other musks, it&#x27;s very light and not pungent.  </li>
            <li>While I enjoy how thick the oil is (it can also serve as a kind of lotion oil), it can sometimes not allow the roll on ball to work properly.  </li>
            <li>day I was in the car sweating with the windows down and the sunroof opened when I got a whiff of a lovely fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The scent smells right at first, but quickly turns into something a little too musky for me.</li>
            <li>I actually wear this one daily because it is that much more pleasurable.</li>
            <li>This is my second time purchasing this oil and it smells pretty although not as strong or long lasting as I wish it was but for the price it is not a bad deal</li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;blended&amp;#34; oil reminds  me of that unfortunately unforgettable scent of a cheap car air freshener tainting the cool night air on that miserable first date that you got yourself talked into with your cousins friend from tenth grade who showed up in his dads work car...</li>
            <li>This appears to be a high quality product.</li>
            <li>For the price you would expect something a little bit better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same one they sell at Whole Foods, which was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything in particular-not musky or sweet enough but very strongâ€¦just personal preference.</li>
            <li>I can go to my local beauty store and get the exact same watered down version in a bottle 3 times the size as this one for exactly $2.12 tax included as it smell better than this.</li>
            <li>I will definitely have to start buying this product from local organic super markets like Whole Foods or Sprouts to get the quality that I want.</li>
            <li>The scent is the same, not too light and definitely not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>and wow!</li>
            <li>Maybe it is better in Whole Foods - but the one ordered from Tom&#x27;s Incense was just no good.</li>
            <li>The last one lasted me many months, so I imagine this will last nearly as long.</li>
            <li>Seems watered down compared to my original I bought in store</li>
            <li>I love musk from the 60&#x27;s - 70&#x27;s, it was the only fragrance that worked with my body chemistry, a little dab lasted throughout the day into the evening.</li>
            <li>also bought several natural perfumes that day, but none get more attention than this little bottle of musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s musky, clean, and on me, slightly sweet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If anyone can direct me</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>As a frequent purchaser of this, I will say that the scent is a bit weaker in early 2015.</li>
            <li>and he exclaimed, \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>Stays in clothes even after they are washed ( I use a natural detergent)</li>
            <li>I bought this particular brand several years ago and decided to order it online.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hugged a male friend at the turn of the new year</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s thick and strong...</li>
            <li>little power house is worth the money--it&#x27;s a head turner.  </li>
            <li>would not order from this company again due to the above.&lt;br /&gt;The positive point</li>
            <li>I do like this in general...</li>
            <li>Not a heavy scent, but very different.</li>
            <li>I can barely smell it.</li>
            <li>you can barely smell it even if you continously roll the stuff on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if essential oils can expire, but the stuff that I got didn&#x27;t smell as clean as hers.</li>
            <li>saying I have received a watered down version that no longer resembles the original scent that so many raved about and Auric Blends is cutting costs and cheapening their product.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything in particular-not musky or sweet enough but very strongâ€¦just personal preference.</li>
            <li> I can go to my local beauty store and get the exact same watered down version in a bottle 3 times the size as this one for exactly $2.12 tax included as it smell better than this.</li>
            <li> I will definitely have to start buying this product from local organic super markets like Whole Foods or Sprouts to get the quality that I want.</li>
            <li> The scent is the same, not too light and definitely not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> and wow!</li>
            <li> Maybe it is better in Whole Foods - but the one ordered from Tom&#x27;s Incense was just no good.</li>
            <li> The last one lasted me many months, so I imagine this will last nearly as long.</li>
            <li> Seems watered down compared to my original I bought in store</li>
            <li> I love musk from the 60&#x27;s - 70&#x27;s, it was the only fragrance that worked with my body chemistry, a little dab lasted throughout the day into the evening.</li>
            <li> also bought several natural perfumes that day, but none get more attention than this little bottle of musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s musky, clean, and on me, slightly sweet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If anyone can direct me</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> As a frequent purchaser of this, I will say that the scent is a bit weaker in early 2015.</li>
            <li> and he exclaimed, \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li> Stays in clothes even after they are washed ( I use a natural detergent)</li>
            <li> I bought this particular brand several years ago and decided to order it online.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hugged a male friend at the turn of the new year</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and strong...</li>
            <li> little power house is worth the money--it&#x27;s a head turner.  </li>
            <li> would not order from this company again due to the above.&lt;br /&gt;The positive point</li>
            <li> I do like this in general...</li>
            <li> Not a heavy scent, but very different.</li>
            <li> I can barely smell it.</li>
            <li> you can barely smell it even if you continously roll the stuff on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if essential oils can expire, but the stuff that I got didn&#x27;t smell as clean as hers.</li>
            <li> saying I have received a watered down version that no longer resembles the original scent that so many raved about and Auric Blends is cutting costs and cheapening their product.</li>
            <li> People will say to you as you walk past, &amp;#34;You smell really good!&amp;#34; And you will giggle and blush.</li>
            <li> Long lasting scent</li>
            <li> I feel like this seller is bottling up some type of oil with a very faint, light and almost non existent of the main ingredient.</li>
            <li> When I put it on me, it strangely gains a cinnamon-like scent (my chemistry?)</li>
            <li> The fragrance did NOT live up to previous Egyptian Musk ( same company) purchased at a local health food</li>
            <li> In other words they don&#x27;t want it back.</li>
            <li> I have tried 5 other egyptian musks of different brands and this one is a no-no.</li>
            <li> Therefore it is simply chemical perfume like any other.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way, this bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> This is not Egyptian musk, and a total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Why is it so hard to find the real thing ?</li>
            <li> does not last long and a little too greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> It does have a very mild egyptian musk smell which is quite disappointing -</li>
            <li> My main complaint is with the dry down...</li>
            <li> OIL IS YUMMY; however, what this seller sent to me was larger bottle of an imitation that smelled slightly of gasoline.</li>
            <li> I will order it again within the next few months.</li>
            <li> No thanks.</li>
            <li> The added benefit is that a little goes a long way--so you get a lot of bank for your buck.</li>
            <li> But... on it&#x27;s own it smells like cigarette smoke musk which is a very unpleasant scent to me.</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I put it on I forget I&#x27;m wearing it, but other people notice.</li>
            <li> I have prime and have been told by amazon that this item is to small to send back.</li>
            <li> I can detect the woody musk scent but it is buried under the other scents in this oil.</li>
            <li> I ordered this one and one other brand.</li>
            <li> I got 15 years ago in other places.  </li>
            <li> , I keep having to push down so hard to barely get the oil out of</li>
            <li> I asked half a dozen other people to try this stuff just in case</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to sit in a dark place anyways.  </li>
            <li> the two bottles I just received do not smell like Egyptian musk at all...not even a little.</li>
            <li> Not very appealing.</li>
            <li> I will not purchase again do to the following reasons:too subtle, too small.</li>
            <li> A little expensive for a tiny bottle</li>
            <li> cant seem to find a brand that has the strength I&#x27;ve had in the past.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long this oil has been bottled, but the fragrance is very weak.  </li>
            <li> but of course is making me give it at least one star.</li>
            <li> The effect is quite subtle and intoxicating.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to the smell of this little gem!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The delivery of this product was crazy FAST.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> To mak matters worse</li>
            <li> Was not happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with what I just got.</li>
            <li> very weak scent.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not impressed with the packaging.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;You will not be sorry at all....</li>
            <li> Quite disappointing for me.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed upon receiving it.  </li>
            <li> I was so disappointed because I ordered this product to wear for my birthday.</li>
            <li> This seller should be banned for selling this crap oil.</li>
            <li> This is horrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smells nasty.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Basically, its awful...</li>
            <li> This one is awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the scent. Came right on time.</li>
            <li> I do like this in general... as many others have mentioned, it starts off smelling identical to Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess, which I LOVE.  I prefer the texture of Kuumba Made over Auric Blends, because this one is light and seems to absorb quickly.  My main complaint is with the dry down... it turns musty on me... almost metallic.  Just something that clashes with my chemistry, I guess.</li>
            <li> I truly love this oil.  I will order it again within the next few months. Thank Amazon for being here.</li>
            <li> Smells so good and you only need the smallest amount. Long lasting scent</li>
            <li> Smells great but I feel like the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> This SMELLS like the real thing. The oil is not sticky, lasts long and roller on container works great (unlike other lines I have purchased) This brands oils are great.</li>
            <li> OIL IS YUMMY; however, what this seller sent to me was larger bottle of an imitation that smelled slightly of gasoline. Hmmmmm. You think im going to put poison on my skin to be absorbed into my body??? No thanks. I threw out the bottles.</li>
            <li> This is not Egyptian musk, and a total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Why is it so hard to find the real thing ?</li>
            <li> Prompt arrival and package well.  I love musk from the 60&#x27;s - 70&#x27;s, it was the only fragrance that worked with my body chemistry, a little dab lasted throughout the day into the evening. i consider this a light day wear fragrance.  Not exactly what I was looking for but I am more satisfied with this one than the others I have purchased.</li>
            <li> Everyone will ask you what are you wearing you smell amazing!</li>
            <li> Yummm. People will say to you as you walk past, &amp;#34;You smell really good!&amp;#34; And you will giggle and blush. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> The Egyptian musk is soft and fresh, just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered two vials of Egyptian musk because the local shop where I purchase it has been out of it forever.  I was extremely disappointed upon receiving it.  It had no scent at all!  I have been wearing Egyptian Musk (Kuumba) for about 15 years and get so many compliments about the scent.  Strangers in line at the deli, bank tellers, etc, as me,  &amp;#34;What is that scent you&#x27;re wearing?  It&#x27;s fabulous!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My grandchildren breathe it it and say they love the way grandma smells.  I have to rub some on their blanks when we&#x27;re apart so they can &amp;#34;smell grandma&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sincerely hope that I can find the original Egyptian musk scent again.  I have tried three places and struck out in all of them.  It smells like nothing.&lt;br /&gt;If the company has changed the formula, they have made a marketing mistake.</li>
            <li> I have a girlfriend who introduced me to this stuff over the summer and absolutely loved the scent, but when I ordered it from a vendor from Amazon, Tom&#x27;s Incense I believe, is wasn&#x27;t the same. I&#x27;m not sure if essential oils can expire, but the stuff that I got didn&#x27;t smell as clean as hers. The roller ball on the product also wasn&#x27;t working as well, I keep having to push down so hard to barely get the oil out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame because I had order two bottles from Tom&#x27;s and bottle just leave me smelling like a combination of plastic and a light scent of Egyptian musk. I would return it if I didn&#x27;t open both bottles already. I will definitely have to start buying this product from local organic super markets like Whole Foods or Sprouts to get the quality that I want.</li>
            <li> Not a heavy scent, but very different. This scent captures people&#x27;s attention on a daily basis. Sometimes when I put it on I forget I&#x27;m wearing it, but other people notice.</li>
            <li> very weak scent. cant seem to find a brand that has the strength I&#x27;ve had in the past. If anyone can direct me I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it. mlangshaw67@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing this oil and it smells pretty although not as strong or long lasting as I wish it was but for the price it is not a bad deal and it arrived on time in good condition.</li>
            <li> This is horrible. I was so disappointed because I ordered this product to wear for my birthday. It arrived on time is the only good thing I have to say. I can go to my local beauty store and get the exact same watered down version in a bottle 3 times the size as this one for exactly $2.12 tax included as it smell better than this. I though I was doing something special by ordering from amazon. Boy was I wrong. Please do not waste your money. This stuff is so light in sent I can barely smell it. To mak matters worse I have prime and have been told by amazon that this item is to small to send back. In other words they don&#x27;t want it back. I will still be on the hunt for a good Egyptian Musk Oil. I feel like this seller is bottling up some type of oil with a very faint, light and almost non existent of the main ingredient. This seller should be banned for selling this crap oil. I give it no star&#x27;s but of course is making me give it at least one star.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I get a lot of compliments.</li>
            <li> Horrible smell. Smells like baby powder. U read the reviews thinking it&#x27;s this nice rare scent. Yeah no. It&#x27;s smells nasty.</li>
            <li> I really thought I liked this.  Perhaps when I mixed it with Kuumba Made Persian Garden it had a lovely sort of fresh clean spring/laundry scent.  But... on it&#x27;s own it smells like cigarette smoke musk which is a very unpleasant scent to me.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried &amp; used many roller egyptian musks.  many times the roller doesn&#x27;t work.  this one does.  also-- this one is beautifully scented.  i especially like it before going to bed.  it&#x27;s a lovely fragrance</li>
            <li> I put it on in the morning &amp; forget I have it on until I get a comment like the one from a gentleman yesterday that said, &amp;#34;hey good lookin&#x27; you smell wonderful.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and just as described.  Second time purchasing...I really like the quality of Kuumba oils!</li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;blended&amp;#34; oil reminds  me of that unfortunately unforgettable scent of a cheap car air freshener tainting the cool night air on that miserable first date that you got yourself talked into with your cousins friend from tenth grade who showed up in his dads work car...&lt;br /&gt;Basically, its awful...</li>
            <li> I use to use Auric blends Egyptian Goddess body oil until they changed it and it had no smell ( I&#x27;m not the only one who noticed that) I decided to try Kuumba and it is wonderful !!! A little expensive for a tiny bottle but it does have a lovely scent that turns heads and gets the complements from strangers in the grocery and everywhere else I go. You will love it ! :)</li>
            <li> As a frequent purchaser of this, I will say that the scent is a bit weaker in early 2015. It still smells wonderful so I&#x27;ll probably just smear a bit more on for my daily cologne. The last one lasted me many months, so I imagine this will last nearly as long.</li>
            <li> Was not happy with this purchase.  The oil does not come out of the roll on as it should.</li>
            <li> Love this scent. It&#x27;s the same one they sell at Whole Foods, which was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Just need larger bottles.</li>
            <li> My go to for oils has always been my favorite Egytpian Oil  Kuuba is totally authentic.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift from a relative&#x27;s Wish List, and she was apparently thrilled with it (lots of !!!!s in her &amp;#34;thank you&amp;#34; text, so I&#x27;m assuming it was a hit).  Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li> Other reviewer is right - I too came to the conclusion that this smells more like plastic than egyptian musk -- burning plastic to be precise. Not very appealing. It does have a very mild egyptian musk smell which is quite disappointing - you can barely smell it even if you continously roll the stuff on. I have tried 5 other egyptian musks of different brands and this one is a no-no. For the price you would expect something a little bit better. Maybe it is better in Whole Foods - but the one ordered from Tom&#x27;s Incense was just no good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to the smell of this little gem!!!!&lt;br /&gt;The delivery of this product was crazy FAST.&lt;br /&gt;I will always order from them.</li>
            <li> The oil smells good but I&#x27;m not impressed with the packaging.  The roller gets stuck.  I would probably buy another brand next time.</li>
            <li> This some of the best smelling stuff EVER!</li>
            <li> I literally bought a bottle of oil. It doesn&#x27;t smell at all. Still trying to find a true Egyptian Musk Oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not someone who tolerates strong scents, particularly musk.  However, Egyptian Musk is the exception to the rule.  Unlike other musks, it&#x27;s very light and not pungent.  The effect is quite subtle and intoxicating.  The added benefit is that a little goes a long way--so you get a lot of bank for your buck.</li>
            <li> I bought the Egyptian Musk because the Rain Musk by Aires is no longer made.  I was hoping to find another perfume oil that I would love as much as Rain Musk by Aires.  Kuumba Egyptian Musk is not close to the Rain Musk at all. It&#x27;s not a horrible scent, but it&#x27;s much too overpowering for my taste.  It has a sweet, cloying, yet spicy, overpowering scent that kind of reminds me of old lady perfume. I can detect the woody musk scent but it is buried under the other scents in this oil. I only dabbed a minute amount on my wrist and I got an instant headache from it.</li>
            <li> I first came across this lovely fragrant oil at a whole foods market.  It was a bit pricey ($10) for a 1.3 mL bottle, but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a mild but provocatively scented oil.  Whenever I wear it I get, \\&quot;What smells so good.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hugged a male friend at the turn of the new year and he exclaimed, \\&quot;Wow you smell good\\&quot; and then he wooped it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some time, you may become too accustomed to the fragrance, but every one else can smell the aroma.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I was in the car sweating with the windows down and the sunroof opened when I got a whiff of a lovely fragrance.  I couldn&#x27;t figure it out--it was me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also bought several natural perfumes that day, but none get more attention than this little bottle of musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little power house is worth the money--it&#x27;s a head turner.  It also doesn&#x27;t interfere with my asthma and it won&#x27;t run people away in a crowd.</li>
            <li> Seems watered down compared to my original I bought in store</li>
            <li> Last year, I bought the famed Egyptian Musk from Auric Blends expecting all kinds of bliss as the reviews constantly painted. I did not know what to expect, but I got a bottle that had no scent from the bottle but required being warmed up by your body. When it was warmed up, the scent was pretty musky indeed and I suppose I did like it, but it wasn&#x27;t a scent I felt I could passionately rave about like so many others could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, I discovered I got a couple of comments on that review saying I have received a watered down version that no longer resembles the original scent that so many raved about and Auric Blends is cutting costs and cheapening their product. A lot of the reviews during and after the time of my review had those same sentiments as the comments. I saw many times that reviewers were recommended they turn to KUUMBA MADE EGYPTIAN MUSK as a replacement because it strongly resembles the original Auric Blends scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So out of curiosity I ordered this! Finally I received it and sniffed it from the bottle and wow! What a pleasant scent! It&#x27;s musky yet it&#x27;s a clean kind of musk. Almost powdery. When I put it on me, it strangely gains a cinnamon-like scent (my chemistry?) and it&#x27;s really nice, I have to say! I actually wear this one daily because it is that much more pleasurable. It&#x27;s musky, clean, and on me, slightly sweet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even touch the Auric Blends one after a week of trying to really like it. Yet here I am wearing this one every day. I know what everyone&#x27;s raving about now. :D People who hug me can&#x27;t help but sniff me!</li>
            <li> I will not purchase again do to the following reasons:too subtle, too small. does not last long and a little too greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Not happy with what I just got. Usually this oil smells good but the two bottles I just received do not smell like Egyptian musk at all...not even a little.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long this oil has been bottled, but the fragrance is very weak.  Any fragrance disappears within an hour after application.  I think I am finally finished with purchasing any additional oil fragrances through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Kuumba, you really do make the best scented roll on oils that I have ever found, this egyptian musk is quite unique</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way, this bottle will last a long time.  smells wonderful. came in mail within several days. would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is not actually essential oil. On the label itself, it says &amp;#34;Fragrance oil&amp;#34;. Therefore it is simply chemical perfume like any other. I wanted natural essential oil scents that are safe. I use it sparingly only when needed. But it sure smells great!!!</li>
            <li> Great gift item for friend to celebrate our visit to Egypt - bring the pyramids to your home!!</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely amazing scent! I have total strangers ask me what I&#x27;m wearing, it smells fantastic and is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Only a hint of the fragrance. It doesn&#x27;t last either. Quite disappointing for me. I will be heading back to the OIl Bar for my Egyptian Musk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and strong... Stays in clothes even after they are washed ( I use a natural detergent) Love the scent!</li>
            <li> Lovely fresh and clean aroma! Wear it often and am refreshed without being overwhelmed. Lasts all day but is subtly present.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smell like anything in particular-not musky or sweet enough but very strongâ€¦just personal preference. Make sure you know what you&#x27;re buying, but otherwise decent product.</li>
            <li> The fragrance did NOT live up to previous Egyptian Musk ( same company) purchased at a local health food store.&lt;br /&gt;It came with a different color top.&lt;br /&gt; (Gold instead of Black)&lt;br /&gt;I would not order from this company again due to the above.&lt;br /&gt;The positive point is that it was delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Yuck! I have never tried Egyptian musk before. I ordered this one and one other brand. This one is awful. I asked half a dozen other people to try this stuff just in case I was mistaken. &amp;#34;Ewww!&amp;#34; And &amp;#34;ummm...not my first choice&amp;#34; were some of the responses. If this is what passes for purfume in Egypt, they need to have their sniffers checked.</li>
            <li> The scent smells right at first, but quickly turns into something a little too musky for me. Not the Egyptian musk oil I am use to.</li>
            <li> Smells just like the Egyptian musk I got 15 years ago in other places.  The smell is also not crazy strong, which I like.  I wish the bottle was amber to keep the light out, but it&#x27;s OK.  It&#x27;s going to sit in a dark place anyways.  This appears to be a high quality product.</li>
            <li> The Egyptian Musk is one of the cleanest fragrances and so pleasing to all...&lt;br /&gt;I love its soft gentle smell and so many people compliment me while wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to any woman who likes a soft, clean smell...&lt;br /&gt;You will not be sorry at all....&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> Love the scent. will order again :)</li>
            <li> This is the one I will go back to...it just doesn&#x27;t come out of the bottle easy.</li>
            <li> Kuumba made edyptian musk&lt;br /&gt;I have this in my drawer and I have enjoyed its fragrance over the years. It reminds me of a time when my teacher would take our reading group and read just to us.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, it&#x27;s one of the nicer ones available. I cant believe what some others call MUSK ? This one is good</li>
            <li> very soft enjoyable smell</li>
            <li> This is a scent that I have adored for years.  Soft, warm, and earthy.  While I enjoy how thick the oil is (it can also serve as a kind of lotion oil), it can sometimes not allow the roll on ball to work properly.  Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> Egyptian Musk has always been a staple scent for me.  I bought this particular brand several years ago and decided to order it online.  The scent is the same, not too light and definitely not overpowering.  One thing that the company has changed is the bottle.  It now has a roll-on mechanism in it.  You&#x27;ll be sure to get every last drop and not spill any.</li>
            <li> Great Egyptian Musk. Its a light smell.</li>
