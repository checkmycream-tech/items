            <li>I love it -</li>
            <li>/&gt;LOVE THIS PRODUCT! :)</li>
            <li>There have been a  lot of copy cats - but nothing can compare with the original - and I am so glad to have found it!</li>
            <li>Really love this powder.</li>
            <li>and I still love it.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected, product works great!!</li>
            <li>Best loose powder that you can buy.  </li>
            <li>I went by the reviews saying it was pretty good, but this powder is nothing like the original Sally Hansen Cornsilk.  </li>
            <li>Worth every cent!</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t make my face a funny color</li>
            <li>I still keep looking for the original Cornsilk</li>
            <li>I got to looking is this and is from the &#x27;original&#x27; manufacturer - CHATTUM  - out of London.  </li>
            <li>It came rather quickly.</li>
            <li>I love the orginal corn silk better but this is all that is left to buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many high end finishing powders as well as everything in between.</li>
            <li>If you can find the original blue Cornsilk even pressed it is much better than this.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this powder in spite of it not being the original formula.  </li>
            <li>It does ok, just too white looking for my taste.  </li>
            <li>This one is okay, I&#x27;m using it, but it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Corn Silk loose powder ever since it was introduced many years ago.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t found another product that I like as much.</li>
            <li>and it really corrects any oil in the skin.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere locally for several years</li>
            <li>This was a cult classic.</li>
            <li>Even when I was in high school.</li>
            <li>and I find myself pushing my high end powders aside for this time and again.</li>
            <li>I have used Corn Silk since I was in high school.  </li>
            <li>This is the same Corn Silk you used to buy right here in the U.S.  </li>
            <li>but, the scent, texture, coverage &amp; the powder puff applicator are all exactly the same.</li>
            <li>One of the first ingredients back then was ground Walnut Shell powder.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY product that really works for me!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this is the old Sally Hansen brand Corn Silk powder that I used in the &#x27;80&#x27;s &amp; &#x27;90&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I bought this because I used to use it back in the 70&amp;#34;s and wanted to see if it would work on my mature skin.  </li>
            <li>It is, by far, the longest lasting powder to hide my shiny t-zone.</li>
            <li>It felt almost the same as I remembered but it didn&#x27;t quite look the same as it wasn&#x27;t completely transparent and a bit darker than before.</li>
            <li>When I found this I was very skeptical but it is just as good as the Sally Hansen version.  </li>

            <li> When I found this I was very skeptical but it is just as good as the Sally Hansen version.  </li>
            <li> I use this daily and probably will as long as it is around.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for this for so long.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no other face powder that performs the same; it sets your make up  for the day, without looking heavy and dry.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands, but always come back to Corn Silk.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last the entire day, but at least until the afternoon/early evening, unless I touch it up a little, but that&#x27;s also because I have oily skin as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey as compared to other oil control powders but one container lasts me 6 months</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding Corn Silk and actually thought it was out of production.  </li>
            <li> I finally saw that Sally Hansen had the product, but have found it hard to find in Phoenix.</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen then bought it out and the ground walnut shells moved down in the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> :) Then, the worst possible thing happened to my holy grail of holy grails of powder-</li>
            <li> The powder was heavy and the coverage was spotty and odd looking on my complexion.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t change color throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Since Chattem was to sold to company in Britain, it is hard to find now.</li>
            <li> Not as crazy about this as I am the satin.</li>
            <li> but I guess it is truly gone forever.  :(  </li>
            <li> It was very disappointing when the Sally Hansen version was discontinued.  </li>

            <li> Love this powder, and have used it for years.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find this product again! I don&#x27;t know if this is the old Sally Hansen brand Corn Silk powder that I used in the &#x27;80&#x27;s &amp; &#x27;90&#x27;s (I can&#x27;t find that brand name on the box) but, the scent, texture, coverage &amp; the powder puff applicator are all exactly the same. I use a mineral makeup powder as my foundation &amp; my Corn Silk as my final step to &#x27;set&#x27; everything.  A bit pricey as compared to other oil control powders but one container lasts me 6 months &amp; I use it 5-6 days a week!  Worth every cent! There&#x27;s nothing else like it!</li>
            <li> This powder is wonderful. Its light but still leaves a nice look.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected, product works great!!</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding Corn Silk and actually thought it was out of production.  I finally saw that Sally Hansen had the product, but have found it hard to find in Phoenix. AZ.  I am so glad I found your mail order choice for I used this product exclusively for years.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for close to 40 years.  The only complaint is that it is not readily available when I need to purchase some more.  It should be in the stores where anyone can purchase it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Corn Silk loose powder ever since it was introduced many years ago.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it anywhere locally for several years and I haven&#x27;t found another product that I like as much.</li>
            <li> I have been using this powder for 40 years. None compare to it. I have tried other brands, but always come back to Corn Silk.</li>
            <li> Best powder I have ever usedf since highschool</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this for so long. I am happy I found it and was happy with the delivery speed.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I used to use it back in the 70&amp;#34;s and wanted to see if it would work on my mature skin.  It does ok, just too white looking for my taste.  Not as great as I remembered!  It&#x27;s ok though!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Corn Silk for 29 years- way back when it was still made by Coty. This was a cult classic. One of the first ingredients back then was ground Walnut Shell powder. It was truly amazing. Sally Hansen then bought it out and the ground walnut shells moved down in the ingredient list. It was still amazing- very fine, truly translucent and kept you oil free all day. Even when I was in high school. :) Then, the worst possible thing happened to my holy grail of holy grails of powder- they discontinued it. I was so pleased to find this here on Amazon, ordered it and eagerly waited its arrival. Would it be the same as I remembered? It came rather quickly. I opened it and it smelled almost the same as I remembered. It felt almost the same as I remembered but it didn&#x27;t quite look the same as it wasn&#x27;t completely transparent and a bit darker than before. I&#x27;ve tried many high end finishing powders as well as everything in between. This is still awesome and I find myself pushing my high end powders aside for this time and again. I&#x27;m 41 and the last thing I want is a shiny face so I love the matte finish. If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you must!</li>
            <li> This is the same Corn Silk you used to buy right here in the U.S.  There&#x27;s no other face powder that performs the same; it sets your make up  for the day, without looking heavy and dry.  Thank heavens I found a source for it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this powder in spite of it not being the original formula.  I went by the reviews saying it was pretty good, but this powder is nothing like the original Sally Hansen Cornsilk.  The powder was heavy and the coverage was spotty and odd looking on my complexion.  If you can find the original blue Cornsilk even pressed it is much better than this.</li>
            <li> I have used this for over 35 years.  So glad to still be able to purchase it.  Absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I used Cornsilk made by another company for years until I could no longer find it! This is awesome in comparison to the old. The walnut hull powder makes all the difference in this product. I had many many containers under my sink and none compare.I love that it doesn&#x27;t make my face a funny color and it really corrects any oil in the skin.</li>
            <li> I still keep looking for the original Cornsilk but I guess it is truly gone forever.  :(  This one is okay, I&#x27;m using it, but it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and this is an excellent product.  I would recommend this to anyone that has oily skin!</li>
            <li> Best loose powder that you can buy.  Since Chattem was to sold to company in Britain, it is hard to find now.</li>
            <li> love this product....makes my skin look like a dream.</li>
            <li> Same as what I used when I was a teenager!</li>
            <li> This product is no longer sold in stores, and I am very happy to have found several sources where I can still purchase my favorite powder.</li>
            <li> I love it - this is the best face  powder I have ever used! Wish it was easier to find</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY product that really works for me! (It absorbs the oil on complexion).&lt;br /&gt;Corn Silk has been  discontinued at stores in my area.&lt;br /&gt;It comes from an international seller.  I was impressed how fast it was shipped to me.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THIS PRODUCT! :)&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Good product, good value.</li>
            <li> VERY happy with this powder!!!!</li>
            <li> It was very disappointing when the Sally Hansen version was discontinued.  I have used Corn Silk since I was in high school.  It was the only product that helped set my makeup in the morning and could withstand oily skin.  When I found this I was very skeptical but it is just as good as the Sally Hansen version.  I love this, and was happy that it&#x27;s not insanely expensive.  I use this daily and probably will as long as it is around.  It doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on oily skin and it doesn&#x27;t change color throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I got to looking is this and is from the &#x27;original&#x27; manufacturer - CHATTUM  - out of London.  I was using this when Chattun had a plant here in the USA in the Southern states (I even have one box left of their translucent power) - then they sold the process to Sally Hansen and she took it off the market.  There have been a  lot of copy cats - but nothing can compare with the original - and I am so glad to have found it!</li>
            <li> Really love this powder. It is, by far, the longest lasting powder to hide my shiny t-zone. It doesn&#x27;t last the entire day, but at least until the afternoon/early evening, unless I touch it up a little, but that&#x27;s also because I have oily skin as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> Not as crazy about this as I am the satin.</li>
            <li> Years ago I used this powder exclusively....then it seemed to disappear.  I was happy to see it is now available and I still love it.</li>
            <li> I love the orginal corn silk better but this is all that is left to buy. Wish the company had not taken this product off the market.</li>
