    <ol>
            <li>However - I am VERY pleased with this product!!  </li>
            <li>Another one in this line of excellent items!!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great!</li>
            <li>and this product does an awesome job at making my hair appear as though I just washed it.</li>
            <li>I applied this product as directed, to the best of my ability.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t have a mirror in the shower all I could do was give it my best effort.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was magnificent!</li>
            <li>My hair hadn&#x27;t looked that good in twenty years!</li>
            <li>Give it a try, I think you’ll be happy too.</li>
            <li>It’s a great find</li>
            <li>Great result in just one use.</li>
            <li>These two products together give her great hair days</li>
            <li>This stuff worked great.</li>
            <li>However the &amp;#34;fit and finish&amp;#34; of my hair wasn&#x27;t very nice during my trial of this product.  </li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the best or most</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the best or most</li>
            <li>I was thrilled with the results!</li>
            <li>I found it to be pleasant</li>
            <li>My hair feels thicker, is more manageable and has incredible shine.  </li>
            <li>for the effect itself, I thought this was a good product, though I wouldn&#x27;t use it all the time--just for \\&quot;occasions\\&quot;--since</li>
            <li>The good:  it does give a bit of volume.  </li>
            <li>My results have been good.</li>
            <li>and it did not feel good -- in fact it made my hair a bit frizzy and it felt damaged for some time after.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s as good as the sample.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results</li>
            <li>but I have to say that &amp;#34;we&amp;#34; love it!  </li>
            <li>* Safe for color treated hair !</li>
            <li>Kind of an amazing product.</li>
            <li>This product is beyond amazing...</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I would use this every week, since it might be good to give my hair a vacation every now and then, but I will use it and will purchase more when this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li>The John Frieda Luxurious Volume Boost is an effective way to boost thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now, and while I can say that it delivers what it promises - hair is thicker while using it - it also kind of kills style.</li>
            <li>I kind of like this.  </li>
            <li>It felt nice, but the shampoo and conditioner do that anyhow.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product, it does give wonderful volume and it does not leave a residue on my hair.  </li>
            <li>product is easy to apply and has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product worked and lasted as advertised and was very easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, my wife is happy with the results and not unhappy with the cost for the product.&lt;br /&gt;P-)</li>
            <li>I have lots of hair, but it is very fine.  </li>
            <li>My favorite husband loved it, and I felt pretty darned gorgeous that day.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t heard any complaints so it must be working out for her :)</li>
            <li>As this isn&#x27;t the product itself, I won&#x27;t ding it for that but be aware it can be tricky to get the pump open.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, perhaps because my hair is so fine/thin, the first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>Love it.e mine</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s most impressive is that the product lasted through about 4 washes, meaning I only have to use it about once per week.  </li>
            <li>Love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>At the time of this review, there is no price on this product on Amazon’s page, but since it bears the John Frieda branding, I am sure it will be a bit pricier than something I can afford to use frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So maybe for shorter or virgin hair it might perform better?</li>
            <li>Superb volume, especially after repeated treatments.</li>
            <li>The result is, subjectively, softer hair that after drying does appear to have more volume and retain the volume throughout the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok I won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give this a try to see if it could better that</li>
            <li>PVP, Polyvinylpyrrolidone, is the ingredient that gives many hairsprays their holding effect.</li>
            <li>It’s also safe for color treated hair, so no worries there.  </li>
            <li>But I sure don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Even so, my hair looks fuller and with more body.  </li>
            <li>Her hair has more thickness and volume and is easier to style.  </li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>makes my hair look like there is more of it on the top.  </li>
            <li>The difference is more noticeable on shorter hair, but I -did- see more body and it lasted about 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you wash more often, it probably will need treating more often.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Both of us are gray and neither of us dyes our hair, so we have relatively healthy</li>
            <li>Maybe she will like it better than I have.k without making my hair needing to be washed sooner--it has zero effect.  </li>
            <li>Maybe she will like it better than I have.</li>
            <li>For me, it seemed more like a leave-in conditioner than a volumizer.</li>
            <li>My hair was more manageable, fuller, and even softer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It was better (no film)</li>
            <li>This product gives my hair a fuller,softer look and feel with more movement...</li>
            <li>Dare I say it has more bounce?</li>
            <li>Most of it is on the box for the user&#x27;s convenience.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll find a 4 ounce plastic bottle with a pump top.</li>
            <li>Make sure to lift hair at the roots to give more airflow for an even fuller look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice for longer, layered styles:</li>
            <li>product is safe for color treated</li>
            <li>/&gt;It appears from the reviews that some are having better results than others with this product.</li>
            <li>It appears from the reviews that some are having better results than others with this product.</li>
            <li>Yes, it made my hair a little fuller (wonderful), but my major joy was the fact that it wasn&#x27;t filled with static!!</li>
            <li>the countering agents here do a pretty good job</li>
            <li>Works well, as do all John Frieda products for fine hair, but I like the spray on better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never tried any volumizing products, but I have somewhat fine hair, so I thought it would be interesting to try out.</li>
            <li>The label calls it ‘semi-permanent’, but ‘temporary’ is a more accurate</li>
            <li>If my hair were long with fewer layers, I&#x27;d probably love it, but what it&#x27;s doing now mostly is fighting against a great cut.</li>
            <li>If my hair were long with fewer layers, I&#x27;d probably love it, but what it&#x27;s doing now mostly is fighting against a great cut.</li>
            <li>Luxurious Volume was easy to use and I have noticed an improvement.  </li>
            <li>and my hair was horribly full of static and &amp;#34;flying away&amp;#34; no matter what I used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of hair, but it is fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that needs a volume boost.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall - this product does work for me to transform and plump my fine hair for visible results.  </li>
            <li>buy this stuff if you have fine hair</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and with this product, my hair gets finer and cannot style at all without tons of hair spray.  </li>
            <li>My daughter-in-law uses this on her baby fine hair and loves it.  </li>
            <li>with fine, color-treated hair I&#x27;d be concerned about dryness.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure my results would be even better if I were to blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to stick with it although I do think that my Mom, who has fine hair, might like to try this out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have really fine hair to begin with.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have really fine hair to begin with.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m using it with the shampoo but skipping the conditioner bec my hair&#x27;s too fine for that.  </li>
            <li>It has great hold but is light enough for even the finest hair.  </li>
            <li>After I rinse it out, I take just the tiniest amount of sulfate free shampoo; just over the size of a pea.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t think this really did anything for my hair&#x27;s volume.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and not over-powering.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to cut off my hair, so making it look fuller was of primary importance.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Perhaps this would&#x27;ve worked better in more capable hands.</li>
            <li>It was best the first day, good the second, fine after washing on day 3, and starting to disappear on days 4 and 5</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li>My original thoughts as I began rinsing out the 1st application was that the product was going to do nothing</li>
            <li>Great first time, not so good on second wash 2 days later</li>
            <li>The potentially drying, coarsening effects of these are countered by softening and anti-static agents, like cetyl alcohol (one of the good ones) and Polyquaternium 37.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li>I received a sample and after one use I immediately ordered a full size bottle.  </li>
            <li>This John Frieda Luxurious Volume 7 Day Volume in-shower treatment is part of a full line of products geared towards amplifying hair thickness for up to 7 days.</li>
            <li>It lasts several days (not a week, but close to it), and gives me gorgeous, full hair that looks like mine looked years ago.</li>
            <li>It is fine and has always been very straight.</li>
            <li>Most women want their hair to have more volume, and I’m no different.</li>
            <li>Volume is great  for days just air dried, with light product for styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair definitely has more volume, with my waves coming out more, but I don&#x27;t care for the feel of my hair.</li>
            <li>, that can barely hold a style on its own</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and medium thickness, and in the dry northern winter static electricity makes it stand out like a halo.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Not unpleasant, maybe like</li>
            <li>Adds a ton of great volume, does not weigh hair down and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many hair products over the years, and have never  had a reaction like that before, so it must contain something new</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s really good for very long hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and does its job well and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>but I noticed later that my hair looked pretty good without doing ANYTHING to it.</li>
            <li>The product smells good and is a pretty blue color.  </li>
            <li>After I finished styling it, I definitely noticed more volume!</li>
            <li>I gave her a can of TIGI Catwalk Lightweight Mousse, which I love, and her curls stayed strong the entire day.  </li>
            <li>The FIRST DAY/ first blowout didn&#x27;t look any different to me but on the SECOND day when I washed it again, it was perfect.</li>
            <li>For someone who relies on volumizing products to achieve their current hairstyle, this will be effective.  </li>
            <li>If you shampoo more frequently, you can expect to use this twice a week or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing worth spending $$$</li>
            <li>This works better than anything I have used thus far.</li>
            <li>I liked several things about Luxurious Volume Treatment quite a bit.</li>
            <li>still would recommend this product as the volume it provides is better and softer than most products I have used and it really does last through another washing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall,this is a product worth trying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always fun to try something</li>
            <li>For my hair not the right thing</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t accurately judge how far it will go but the bottle still feels quite full after two</li>
            <li>My hair did look thicker and more full where this was applied but the hair also had a different feel to it</li>
            <li>It doesn’t last the full seven days, but that’s okay.  </li>
            <li>only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it very much is that it has a very strong scent.</li>
            <li>but now I can go 2 days without washing and still wake up the 2nd day with some volume to my VERY fine hair.</li>
            <li>package says it last through 2 or 3 shampoos, which is about 7 days worth for most people.</li>
            <li>In terms of what to expect from it, we&#x27;re not talking about an 80s hair band&#x27;s worth of lift, but definitely more volume, especially along the length.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In terms of what to expect from it, we&#x27;re not talking about an 80s hair band&#x27;s worth of lift, but definitely more volume, especially along the length.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes, it made my hair a tiny bit duller, but the trade-off with the static was well worth it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>The bottle of this John Frieda product says, &amp;#34;Visibly full, touchably soft.&amp;#34; I wanted to try this volume maximizer to give me more volume, but I have to say, my hair is not soft after using this product.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly, baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>However, I love my natural silver gray, so I stopped coloring, and was back to fine hair.</li>
            <li>First, I guess I got a dud package because the pump itself just would NOT unlock; you twist to pop it up for first use.</li>
            <li>Now, from the first blowout my hair is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, don&#x27;t give up on it if the first try doesn&#x27;t impress you</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, don&#x27;t give up on it if the first try doesn&#x27;t impress you</li>
            <li>It did give me volume, but it made my scalp very itchy!</li>
            <li>shampooed first, and used the product according to the directions.</li>
            <li>John Frieda&#x27;s Luxurious Volume was something I didn&#x27;t believe in at first, until I tried it.  </li>
            <li>It looks like she has twice as much hair!  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this product was the smell - I think it&#x27;s meant to be rather neutral/scentless, but it reminds me a lot of dog shampoo which discourages me a bit from using it too often.</li>
            <li>The first was that it</li>
            <li>First thing fix the pump.  </li>
            <li>The root area (virgin hair) didn&#x27;t seem to become quite as coarse and frizzy, so if you don&#x27;t have treated hair this might work better for you!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s reasonably priced !&lt;</li>
            <li>Trying again with only applying to the scalp helped a bit, but I&#x27;ve decided that I am better off without volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be sure to fully cover the entire length of the hair including under sections and root area.</li>
            <li>I have long, very fine hair that&#x27;s thinned out because of illness.</li>
            <li>and wow!!!!</li>
            <li>Normally, when she uses a curling iron, the curls fall out quickly.  </li>
            <li>It did give my curly hair a boost in volume, particularly on top where it tends to go flat after a day or two.  </li>
            <li>It is a really different and interesting new product, and I still think it&#x27;s worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li>hair is normally easy to blow dry and style and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>a positive note</li>
            <li>After using this the first time the difference was very noticeable</li>
            <li>Bottom line: if you absolutely need the volume &amp; are willing to put up with the flaws, go for it.  </li>
            <li>regularly use Aussie Mega Volumizing Gel and it works much better than this particular John Frieda product did at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Container should last me 3-4 months easily at 4 &#x27;pumps&#x27; per use, once a week.</li>
            <li>Container should last me 3-4 months easily at 4 &#x27;pumps&#x27; per use, once a week.</li>
            <li>(more dry than before).  </li>
            <li>so I’ve been using it to blow dry my hair keeping the dryer about six inches or more from my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my opinion it does so at the expense of shine, and it feels kind of odd.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine blonde hair that I have fought for 66 years</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until later I remembered the product and realized that the reason it looked good was exactly from increase in volume due to John Frieda.</li>
            <li>The volume is amazing and stays for a few days.</li>
            <li>I even have \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; hair before too much \\&quot;coffee\\&quot; in the morning .....</li>
            <li>this is really getting</li>
            <li>but it did look so much fuller.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it never made that much of a difference for me to spend that much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not styling so much as taming, and the end-result does not appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted to like this, tried it three times and followed the directions to the &amp;#34;T.&amp;#34; It did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>This is absolutely a must have if you have thin/fine hair.</li>
            <li>as much hair as I do.</li>
            <li>So I was very intrigued by this treatment and couldn&#x27;t wait to try</li>
            <li>I really like this product and would recommend.</li>
            <li>real test comes over time.  </li>
            <li>I have silver hair with darker streaks, and it is normally very shiny.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the dullness at all, and with my hair in the earliest stages of age-inspired thinning</li>
            <li>I ended up hating having my hair volumized, but this product worked really well, so I am giving it 4 stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know much about these ingredients</li>
            <li>Really like what it did for my hair.</li>
            <li>I also had a LOT of problems with static, especially if I used a natural bristle brush, when brushing it out each day before putting it up.  </li>

            <li>My hair is long, straight and fine</li>
            <li>I am a hair product hobbyist with long but fine hair (although it&#x27;s not thin - my hairdresser says I have a LOT of hair).  </li>
            <li>I style my short, piecey, layered hairstyle straight, but within an hour of drying it became super wavy (which I don&#x27;t want).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Longterm build-up has not been a huge issue, but I&#x27;ve not been using this long.</li>
            <li>but I used to have more hair than average which balanced out the limpness.</li>
            <li>My new go to must have!</li>
            <li>I certainly cannot guarantee that this will work as well for you, but it has worked miracles for my mother too, as well as other fine haired friends.</li>
            <li>As an aside she noted somewhat more retained control on days when we get a slight mist in the mornings than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use more or less depending on hair length and thickness.</li>
            <li>They recommend applying it to roots and midshaft for layered hair, but in spite of following these directions to the best of my ability, I wind up with an all-over pouf that is difficult to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair has gotten finer the older I have gotten.</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;m able to achieve extra volume with my regular product</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;m able to achieve extra volume with my regular product</li>
            <li>I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li>I just would have preferred that it had no scent or, at least, a far more mild one.</li>
            <li>I never thought too much about the volume of my hair, until I saw a photo of myself from the holidays, on a day that I thought my hair looked pretty presentable, and saw just how flat it really was.</li>
            <li>Overall this product worked as advertised and seems to be worth its relatively high price.</li>
            <li>, if you have long hair, concentrate the product at your roots to get the most lift; coating long hair won&#x27;t do much for the length.</li>
            <li>You leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing, and it is supposed to leave your hair with more volume.  </li>
            <li>like I normally do.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not a complaint, just an observation.</li>
            <li>After that, style as you normally</li>
            <li>and she&#x27;s since made these products part of her normal routine.  </li>
            <li>I understand that is normal for this type of product</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took three shampoos to return my hair to normal, so the 7 day label depends on how often you wash your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just washed my hair and conditioned like normal and then used this product.  </li>
            <li>ask me how I can stand the weight of all my hair, but it looks nice enough to gain complements, even when I wear my hair down.</li>
            <li>After using the product as directed, it left my hair with slightly more volume but very dry.</li>
            <li>The Frieda treatment really does last a full week, even through several shampoos.  </li>
            <li>The idea of a 7 day product appealed to me, so I looked forward to trying this new John Freida treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;After you shampoo and condition your hair, simply pump 3 or 4 squirts into your hand and work it well through your wet hair, just as you would conditioner, making sure to get it on the roots, ends, and everything in between.</li>
            <li>but really the only difference is it made my hair slightly more volumized, slightly.</li>
            <li>On the elderly user, there was some slight increase in volume, but not enough to get real excited about.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li>Hair is still soft!</li>
            <li>applied this as directed--washed and conditioned first, then used 3-4 pumps of the JF Treatment, left it on 3-5 minutes then rinsed out.</li>
            <li>(It also would run less risk of being drying for fine hair without the chemicals/</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there was a lasting effect after that first day, either.</li>
            <li>This is definitely more like a styling aid then a treatment for hair, in that I would only use this prior to a night out or something, not for regular use.</li>
            <li>tries to get the amount left on the hair just right, but when you do, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>tries to get the amount left on the hair just right, but when you do, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>your hair is dried you can easily tell the difference.</li>
            <li>Anyways, it also did not last for a full 7 or even 5 days but 2 days only.</li>
            <li>shampooed and conditioned my hair like normal and then squeezed as much water out as possible before applying the volume treatment.  </li>
            <li>I will probably keep a bottle on hand for nights out with friends, dates, or other special occasions.</li>
            <li>But now that I’m older and losing more hair I’ve noticed that it tends to look a little flat.</li>
            <li>My hair has always been somewhat limp and fine</li>
            <li>It also took me about six or seven pumps because of my hair length, but it leaves my hair soft and not stiff.  </li>
            <li>I have only within the past few years learned that a great stylist can create the illusion of volume with the clever use of layering, so these days my hair tricks people into thinking I have some texture.</li>
            <li>I could wear my hair down, without doing anything special to make it look fuller.  </li>
            <li>With this product, I have real body and volume that feels like it&#x27;s actually IN my hair, rather than &#x27;on&#x27; it.</li>
            <li>This John Frieda conditioner is practically a miracle worker as far as I’m concerned.</li>
            <li>and then, completely gone.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t completely gone after I rinsed, so that was a drawback for me, even though the scent isn&#x27;t offensive, I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>far as how it lasts through the week without making my hair needing to be washed sooner--it has zero effect.  </li>
            <li>I was unclear on whether that was regardless of how frequently you shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>hair is done with modest highlights/lowlights at the salon</li>
            <li>After use my hair feels soft and is shinier.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 43-year old woman.</li>
            <li>My regular routine is much like the advice given on the box.</li>
            <li>I have hair nearly to my waist</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>This product has the right goal but it didn&#x27;t deliver quite as I expected.  </li>
            <li>do only use this every fourth or fifth shampoo since my hair is too dry to wash daily, and I love the results.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical of this product but have blown tons more on lesser worthy products</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, and it apparently works very well for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note on the packaging:</li>
            <li>/&gt;Given how short it will last for me, this is something I won’t use all the time, but save for events when I want a little more volume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really the day after the wash that I appreciate this - whereas before, my hair would be rather limp &amp;#62;24 hours after washing, and after having slept on it, my hair looks a little more voluminous than it would otherwise be.</li>
            <li>This really works - just not as long as they say it does.  </li>
            <li>I have long (almost waist-length), straight, baby-fine hair.</li>
            <li>It does smell nice and gives a little boost of volume but just a little.</li>
            <li>When I washed my hair the first time I could tell there was product remaining by the texture and it did blow out as expected without additional products.  </li>
            <li>daughter is coming to visit soon, and I&#x27;ll try to talk her into trying it on her hair, as it is naturally thin, fine, and straight, as well as not gray.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is coming to visit soon, and I&#x27;ll try to talk her into trying it on her hair, as it is naturally thin, fine, and straight, as well as not gray.  </li>
            <li>hair was very heavy on the top and the sides fell flat.</li>
            <li>Also, this product kind of seals your hair follicle, meaning it takes a lot less of the other products you use, such as styling products, to achieve the same effect.  </li>
            <li>I typically blow dry it, and then style it with a hot roll brush type appliance to create gentle waves all over that swing when I move.</li>
            <li>I decided that I needed to buy this stuff, and searched local places high and low.</li>
            <li>near as I can tell by evaluating the ingredients (see the bottom of this post, as these are not at this writing listed on Amazon), this product relies on several hair-coating agents meant to give the appearance of volume.</li>
            <li>(I wear my long hair either in a knot or a braid normally.)    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather style my hair with a little less wave than have more waves and greasy hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and thick enough that it doesn&#x27;t glop out of your hands or onto the shower</li>
            <li>okay but not better than other products on the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li>VP/VA Copolymer inhibits hair from absorbing moisture and is found in mascaras and other volumizing hair products.</li>
            <li>The most noticeable effect is that when I wash my hair and finish with the conditioner, the slick, silky effect that the wet hair has disappears entirely when this product is applied.  </li>
            <li>The most noticeable effect is that when I wash my hair and finish with the conditioner, the slick, silky effect that the wet hair has disappears entirely when this product is applied.  </li>
            <li>This product will be great for someone who styles their hair and is used to using different products, but since I typically just brush mine and go, this just felt weird.  </li>
            <li>Because I am older (56) and my hair is dry, I only wash it 2-3 times a week</li>
            <li>The instructions very clearly said to blow dry your hair -- it was even underlined -- so I did.</li>
            <li>(Normally I air -dry only).</li>
            <li>But the product says to blow dry, so I dug out my mini-blow-dryer that’s probably thirty years old.  </li>
            <li>a half hour longer in the mirror drying it and fighting with the curling brush the whole time to get it to do what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair was thick and full when I was younger, but has become incredibly thin and fine now that I&#x27;m over 50.</li>
            <li>my hair was actually not flat but had ....</li>
            <li>I bought it for her when I was in Target and thought it may add some oomph to her thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Rogaine and this has left some fine and thin hair to cover the bald spot.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this treatment for anyone with thin, fine hair.  </li>

            <li> This stuff worked great.</li>
            <li> However the &amp;#34;fit and finish&amp;#34; of my hair wasn&#x27;t very nice during my trial of this product.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the best or most</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the best or most</li>
            <li> I was thrilled with the results!</li>
            <li> I found it to be pleasant</li>
            <li> My hair feels thicker, is more manageable and has incredible shine.  </li>
            <li> for the effect itself, I thought this was a good product, though I wouldn&#x27;t use it all the time--just for \\&quot;occasions\\&quot;--since</li>
            <li> The good:  it does give a bit of volume.  </li>
            <li> My results have been good.</li>
            <li> and it did not feel good -- in fact it made my hair a bit frizzy and it felt damaged for some time after.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s as good as the sample.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> but I have to say that &amp;#34;we&amp;#34; love it!  </li>
            <li> * Safe for color treated hair !</li>
            <li> Kind of an amazing product.</li>
            <li> This product is beyond amazing...</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I would use this every week, since it might be good to give my hair a vacation every now and then, but I will use it and will purchase more when this bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> The John Frieda Luxurious Volume Boost is an effective way to boost thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now, and while I can say that it delivers what it promises - hair is thicker while using it - it also kind of kills style.</li>
            <li> I kind of like this.  </li>
            <li> It felt nice, but the shampoo and conditioner do that anyhow.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product, it does give wonderful volume and it does not leave a residue on my hair.  </li>
            <li> product is easy to apply and has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product worked and lasted as advertised and was very easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, my wife is happy with the results and not unhappy with the cost for the product.&lt;br /&gt;P-)</li>
            <li> I have lots of hair, but it is very fine.  </li>
            <li> My favorite husband loved it, and I felt pretty darned gorgeous that day.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t heard any complaints so it must be working out for her :)</li>
            <li> As this isn&#x27;t the product itself, I won&#x27;t ding it for that but be aware it can be tricky to get the pump open.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, perhaps because my hair is so fine/thin, the first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> Love it.e mine</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s most impressive is that the product lasted through about 4 washes, meaning I only have to use it about once per week.  </li>
            <li> Love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> At the time of this review, there is no price on this product on Amazon’s page, but since it bears the John Frieda branding, I am sure it will be a bit pricier than something I can afford to use frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So maybe for shorter or virgin hair it might perform better?</li>
            <li> Superb volume, especially after repeated treatments.</li>
            <li> The result is, subjectively, softer hair that after drying does appear to have more volume and retain the volume throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I won&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this a try to see if it could better that</li>
            <li> PVP, Polyvinylpyrrolidone, is the ingredient that gives many hairsprays their holding effect.</li>
            <li> It’s also safe for color treated hair, so no worries there.  </li>
            <li> But I sure don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Even so, my hair looks fuller and with more body.  </li>
            <li> Her hair has more thickness and volume and is easier to style.  </li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> makes my hair look like there is more of it on the top.  </li>
            <li> The difference is more noticeable on shorter hair, but I -did- see more body and it lasted about 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you wash more often, it probably will need treating more often.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Both of us are gray and neither of us dyes our hair, so we have relatively healthy</li>
            <li> Maybe she will like it better than I have.k without making my hair needing to be washed sooner--it has zero effect.  </li>
            <li> Maybe she will like it better than I have.</li>
            <li> For me, it seemed more like a leave-in conditioner than a volumizer.</li>
            <li> My hair was more manageable, fuller, and even softer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was better (no film)</li>
            <li> This product gives my hair a fuller,softer look and feel with more movement...</li>
            <li> Dare I say it has more bounce?</li>
            <li> Most of it is on the box for the user&#x27;s convenience.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll find a 4 ounce plastic bottle with a pump top.</li>
            <li> Make sure to lift hair at the roots to give more airflow for an even fuller look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice for longer, layered styles:</li>
            <li> product is safe for color treated</li>
            <li> /&gt;It appears from the reviews that some are having better results than others with this product.</li>
            <li> It appears from the reviews that some are having better results than others with this product.</li>
            <li> Yes, it made my hair a little fuller (wonderful), but my major joy was the fact that it wasn&#x27;t filled with static!!</li>
            <li> the countering agents here do a pretty good job</li>
            <li> Works well, as do all John Frieda products for fine hair, but I like the spray on better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any volumizing products, but I have somewhat fine hair, so I thought it would be interesting to try out.</li>
            <li> The label calls it ‘semi-permanent’, but ‘temporary’ is a more accurate</li>
            <li> If my hair were long with fewer layers, I&#x27;d probably love it, but what it&#x27;s doing now mostly is fighting against a great cut.</li>

            <li> Luxurious Volume was easy to use and I have noticed an improvement.  </li>
            <li> and my hair was horribly full of static and &amp;#34;flying away&amp;#34; no matter what I used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of hair, but it is fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that needs a volume boost.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall - this product does work for me to transform and plump my fine hair for visible results.  </li>
            <li> buy this stuff if you have fine hair</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and with this product, my hair gets finer and cannot style at all without tons of hair spray.  </li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law uses this on her baby fine hair and loves it.  </li>
            <li> with fine, color-treated hair I&#x27;d be concerned about dryness.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure my results would be even better if I were to blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to stick with it although I do think that my Mom, who has fine hair, might like to try this out.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have really fine hair to begin with.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have really fine hair to begin with.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m using it with the shampoo but skipping the conditioner bec my hair&#x27;s too fine for that.  </li>
            <li> It has great hold but is light enough for even the finest hair.  </li>
            <li> After I rinse it out, I take just the tiniest amount of sulfate free shampoo; just over the size of a pea.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t think this really did anything for my hair&#x27;s volume.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and not over-powering.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to cut off my hair, so making it look fuller was of primary importance.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Perhaps this would&#x27;ve worked better in more capable hands.</li>
            <li> It was best the first day, good the second, fine after washing on day 3, and starting to disappear on days 4 and 5</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use.</li>
            <li> My original thoughts as I began rinsing out the 1st application was that the product was going to do nothing</li>
            <li> Great first time, not so good on second wash 2 days later</li>
            <li> The potentially drying, coarsening effects of these are countered by softening and anti-static agents, like cetyl alcohol (one of the good ones) and Polyquaternium 37.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li> I received a sample and after one use I immediately ordered a full size bottle.  </li>
            <li> This John Frieda Luxurious Volume 7 Day Volume in-shower treatment is part of a full line of products geared towards amplifying hair thickness for up to 7 days.</li>
            <li> It lasts several days (not a week, but close to it), and gives me gorgeous, full hair that looks like mine looked years ago.</li>
            <li> It is fine and has always been very straight.</li>
            <li> Most women want their hair to have more volume, and I’m no different.</li>
            <li> Volume is great  for days just air dried, with light product for styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair definitely has more volume, with my waves coming out more, but I don&#x27;t care for the feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> , that can barely hold a style on its own</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and medium thickness, and in the dry northern winter static electricity makes it stand out like a halo.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Not unpleasant, maybe like</li>
            <li> Adds a ton of great volume, does not weigh hair down and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many hair products over the years, and have never  had a reaction like that before, so it must contain something new</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s really good for very long hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and does its job well and is reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> but I noticed later that my hair looked pretty good without doing ANYTHING to it.</li>
            <li> The product smells good and is a pretty blue color.  </li>
            <li> After I finished styling it, I definitely noticed more volume!</li>
            <li> I gave her a can of TIGI Catwalk Lightweight Mousse, which I love, and her curls stayed strong the entire day.  </li>
            <li> The FIRST DAY/ first blowout didn&#x27;t look any different to me but on the SECOND day when I washed it again, it was perfect.</li>
            <li> For someone who relies on volumizing products to achieve their current hairstyle, this will be effective.  </li>
            <li> If you shampoo more frequently, you can expect to use this twice a week or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing worth spending $$$</li>
            <li> This works better than anything I have used thus far.</li>
            <li> I liked several things about Luxurious Volume Treatment quite a bit.</li>
            <li> still would recommend this product as the volume it provides is better and softer than most products I have used and it really does last through another washing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall,this is a product worth trying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always fun to try something</li>
            <li> For my hair not the right thing</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t accurately judge how far it will go but the bottle still feels quite full after two</li>
            <li> My hair did look thicker and more full where this was applied but the hair also had a different feel to it</li>
            <li> It doesn’t last the full seven days, but that’s okay.  </li>
            <li> only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it very much is that it has a very strong scent.</li>
            <li> but now I can go 2 days without washing and still wake up the 2nd day with some volume to my VERY fine hair.</li>
            <li> package says it last through 2 or 3 shampoos, which is about 7 days worth for most people.</li>
            <li> In terms of what to expect from it, we&#x27;re not talking about an 80s hair band&#x27;s worth of lift, but definitely more volume, especially along the length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In terms of what to expect from it, we&#x27;re not talking about an 80s hair band&#x27;s worth of lift, but definitely more volume, especially along the length.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes, it made my hair a tiny bit duller, but the trade-off with the static was well worth it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> The bottle of this John Frieda product says, &amp;#34;Visibly full, touchably soft.&amp;#34; I wanted to try this volume maximizer to give me more volume, but I have to say, my hair is not soft after using this product.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> However, I love my natural silver gray, so I stopped coloring, and was back to fine hair.</li>
            <li> First, I guess I got a dud package because the pump itself just would NOT unlock; you twist to pop it up for first use.</li>
            <li> Now, from the first blowout my hair is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, don&#x27;t give up on it if the first try doesn&#x27;t impress you</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, don&#x27;t give up on it if the first try doesn&#x27;t impress you</li>
            <li> It did give me volume, but it made my scalp very itchy!</li>
            <li> shampooed first, and used the product according to the directions.</li>
            <li> John Frieda&#x27;s Luxurious Volume was something I didn&#x27;t believe in at first, until I tried it.  </li>
            <li> It looks like she has twice as much hair!  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this product was the smell - I think it&#x27;s meant to be rather neutral/scentless, but it reminds me a lot of dog shampoo which discourages me a bit from using it too often.</li>
            <li> The first was that it</li>
            <li> First thing fix the pump.  </li>
            <li> The root area (virgin hair) didn&#x27;t seem to become quite as coarse and frizzy, so if you don&#x27;t have treated hair this might work better for you!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reasonably priced !&lt;</li>
            <li> Trying again with only applying to the scalp helped a bit, but I&#x27;ve decided that I am better off without volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be sure to fully cover the entire length of the hair including under sections and root area.</li>
            <li> I have long, very fine hair that&#x27;s thinned out because of illness.</li>
            <li> and wow!!!!</li>
            <li> Normally, when she uses a curling iron, the curls fall out quickly.  </li>
            <li> It did give my curly hair a boost in volume, particularly on top where it tends to go flat after a day or two.  </li>
            <li> It is a really different and interesting new product, and I still think it&#x27;s worth giving it a try.</li>
            <li> hair is normally easy to blow dry and style and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> a positive note</li>
            <li> After using this the first time the difference was very noticeable</li>
            <li> Bottom line: if you absolutely need the volume &amp; are willing to put up with the flaws, go for it.  </li>
            <li> regularly use Aussie Mega Volumizing Gel and it works much better than this particular John Frieda product did at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Container should last me 3-4 months easily at 4 &#x27;pumps&#x27; per use, once a week.</li>
            <li> Container should last me 3-4 months easily at 4 &#x27;pumps&#x27; per use, once a week.</li>
            <li> (more dry than before).  </li>
            <li> so I’ve been using it to blow dry my hair keeping the dryer about six inches or more from my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my opinion it does so at the expense of shine, and it feels kind of odd.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine blonde hair that I have fought for 66 years</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until later I remembered the product and realized that the reason it looked good was exactly from increase in volume due to John Frieda.</li>
            <li> The volume is amazing and stays for a few days.</li>
            <li> I even have \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; hair before too much \\&quot;coffee\\&quot; in the morning .....</li>
            <li> this is really getting</li>
            <li> but it did look so much fuller.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it never made that much of a difference for me to spend that much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not styling so much as taming, and the end-result does not appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted to like this, tried it three times and followed the directions to the &amp;#34;T.&amp;#34; It did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely a must have if you have thin/fine hair.</li>
            <li> as much hair as I do.</li>
            <li> So I was very intrigued by this treatment and couldn&#x27;t wait to try</li>
            <li> I really like this product and would recommend.</li>
            <li> real test comes over time.  </li>
            <li> I have silver hair with darker streaks, and it is normally very shiny.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the dullness at all, and with my hair in the earliest stages of age-inspired thinning</li>
            <li> I ended up hating having my hair volumized, but this product worked really well, so I am giving it 4 stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know much about these ingredients</li>
            <li> Really like what it did for my hair.</li>
            <li> I also had a LOT of problems with static, especially if I used a natural bristle brush, when brushing it out each day before putting it up.  </li>
            <li> I also had a LOT of problems with static, especially if I used a natural bristle brush, when brushing it out each day before putting it up.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long, straight and fine</li>
            <li> I am a hair product hobbyist with long but fine hair (although it&#x27;s not thin - my hairdresser says I have a LOT of hair).  </li>
            <li> I style my short, piecey, layered hairstyle straight, but within an hour of drying it became super wavy (which I don&#x27;t want).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Longterm build-up has not been a huge issue, but I&#x27;ve not been using this long.</li>
            <li> but I used to have more hair than average which balanced out the limpness.</li>
            <li> My new go to must have!</li>
            <li> I certainly cannot guarantee that this will work as well for you, but it has worked miracles for my mother too, as well as other fine haired friends.</li>
            <li> As an aside she noted somewhat more retained control on days when we get a slight mist in the mornings than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use more or less depending on hair length and thickness.</li>
            <li> They recommend applying it to roots and midshaft for layered hair, but in spite of following these directions to the best of my ability, I wind up with an all-over pouf that is difficult to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten finer the older I have gotten.</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;m able to achieve extra volume with my regular product</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;m able to achieve extra volume with my regular product</li>
            <li> I had high hopes.  </li>
            <li> I just would have preferred that it had no scent or, at least, a far more mild one.</li>
            <li> I never thought too much about the volume of my hair, until I saw a photo of myself from the holidays, on a day that I thought my hair looked pretty presentable, and saw just how flat it really was.</li>
            <li> Overall this product worked as advertised and seems to be worth its relatively high price.</li>
            <li> , if you have long hair, concentrate the product at your roots to get the most lift; coating long hair won&#x27;t do much for the length.</li>
            <li> You leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing, and it is supposed to leave your hair with more volume.  </li>
            <li> like I normally do.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not a complaint, just an observation.</li>
            <li> After that, style as you normally</li>
            <li> and she&#x27;s since made these products part of her normal routine.  </li>
            <li> I understand that is normal for this type of product</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took three shampoos to return my hair to normal, so the 7 day label depends on how often you wash your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just washed my hair and conditioned like normal and then used this product.  </li>
            <li> ask me how I can stand the weight of all my hair, but it looks nice enough to gain complements, even when I wear my hair down.</li>
            <li> After using the product as directed, it left my hair with slightly more volume but very dry.</li>
            <li> The Frieda treatment really does last a full week, even through several shampoos.  </li>
            <li> The idea of a 7 day product appealed to me, so I looked forward to trying this new John Freida treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;After you shampoo and condition your hair, simply pump 3 or 4 squirts into your hand and work it well through your wet hair, just as you would conditioner, making sure to get it on the roots, ends, and everything in between.</li>
            <li> but really the only difference is it made my hair slightly more volumized, slightly.</li>
            <li> On the elderly user, there was some slight increase in volume, but not enough to get real excited about.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> Hair is still soft!</li>
            <li> applied this as directed--washed and conditioned first, then used 3-4 pumps of the JF Treatment, left it on 3-5 minutes then rinsed out.</li>
            <li> (It also would run less risk of being drying for fine hair without the chemicals/</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there was a lasting effect after that first day, either.</li>
            <li> This is definitely more like a styling aid then a treatment for hair, in that I would only use this prior to a night out or something, not for regular use.</li>
            <li> tries to get the amount left on the hair just right, but when you do, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> tries to get the amount left on the hair just right, but when you do, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> your hair is dried you can easily tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Anyways, it also did not last for a full 7 or even 5 days but 2 days only.</li>
            <li> shampooed and conditioned my hair like normal and then squeezed as much water out as possible before applying the volume treatment.  </li>
            <li> I will probably keep a bottle on hand for nights out with friends, dates, or other special occasions.</li>
            <li> But now that I’m older and losing more hair I’ve noticed that it tends to look a little flat.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been somewhat limp and fine</li>
            <li> It also took me about six or seven pumps because of my hair length, but it leaves my hair soft and not stiff.  </li>
            <li> I have only within the past few years learned that a great stylist can create the illusion of volume with the clever use of layering, so these days my hair tricks people into thinking I have some texture.</li>
            <li> I could wear my hair down, without doing anything special to make it look fuller.  </li>
            <li> With this product, I have real body and volume that feels like it&#x27;s actually IN my hair, rather than &#x27;on&#x27; it.</li>
            <li> This John Frieda conditioner is practically a miracle worker as far as I’m concerned.</li>
            <li> and then, completely gone.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t completely gone after I rinsed, so that was a drawback for me, even though the scent isn&#x27;t offensive, I just don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> far as how it lasts through the week without making my hair needing to be washed sooner--it has zero effect.  </li>
            <li> I was unclear on whether that was regardless of how frequently you shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair is done with modest highlights/lowlights at the salon</li>
            <li> After use my hair feels soft and is shinier.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 43-year old woman.</li>
            <li> My regular routine is much like the advice given on the box.</li>
            <li> I have hair nearly to my waist</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> This product has the right goal but it didn&#x27;t deliver quite as I expected.  </li>
            <li> do only use this every fourth or fifth shampoo since my hair is too dry to wash daily, and I love the results.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product but have blown tons more on lesser worthy products</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, and it apparently works very well for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note on the packaging:</li>
            <li> /&gt;Given how short it will last for me, this is something I won’t use all the time, but save for events when I want a little more volume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really the day after the wash that I appreciate this - whereas before, my hair would be rather limp &amp;#62;24 hours after washing, and after having slept on it, my hair looks a little more voluminous than it would otherwise be.</li>
            <li> This really works - just not as long as they say it does.  </li>
            <li> I have long (almost waist-length), straight, baby-fine hair.</li>
            <li> It does smell nice and gives a little boost of volume but just a little.</li>
            <li> When I washed my hair the first time I could tell there was product remaining by the texture and it did blow out as expected without additional products.  </li>
            <li> daughter is coming to visit soon, and I&#x27;ll try to talk her into trying it on her hair, as it is naturally thin, fine, and straight, as well as not gray.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is coming to visit soon, and I&#x27;ll try to talk her into trying it on her hair, as it is naturally thin, fine, and straight, as well as not gray.  </li>
            <li> hair was very heavy on the top and the sides fell flat.</li>
            <li> Also, this product kind of seals your hair follicle, meaning it takes a lot less of the other products you use, such as styling products, to achieve the same effect.  </li>
            <li> I typically blow dry it, and then style it with a hot roll brush type appliance to create gentle waves all over that swing when I move.</li>
            <li> I decided that I needed to buy this stuff, and searched local places high and low.</li>
            <li> near as I can tell by evaluating the ingredients (see the bottom of this post, as these are not at this writing listed on Amazon), this product relies on several hair-coating agents meant to give the appearance of volume.</li>
            <li> (I wear my long hair either in a knot or a braid normally.)    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather style my hair with a little less wave than have more waves and greasy hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and thick enough that it doesn&#x27;t glop out of your hands or onto the shower</li>
            <li> okay but not better than other products on the market.&lt;br</li>
            <li> VP/VA Copolymer inhibits hair from absorbing moisture and is found in mascaras and other volumizing hair products.</li>
            <li> The most noticeable effect is that when I wash my hair and finish with the conditioner, the slick, silky effect that the wet hair has disappears entirely when this product is applied.  </li>
            <li> The most noticeable effect is that when I wash my hair and finish with the conditioner, the slick, silky effect that the wet hair has disappears entirely when this product is applied.  </li>
            <li> This product will be great for someone who styles their hair and is used to using different products, but since I typically just brush mine and go, this just felt weird.  </li>
            <li> Because I am older (56) and my hair is dry, I only wash it 2-3 times a week</li>
            <li> The instructions very clearly said to blow dry your hair -- it was even underlined -- so I did.</li>
            <li> (Normally I air -dry only).</li>
            <li> But the product says to blow dry, so I dug out my mini-blow-dryer that’s probably thirty years old.  </li>
            <li> a half hour longer in the mirror drying it and fighting with the curling brush the whole time to get it to do what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was thick and full when I was younger, but has become incredibly thin and fine now that I&#x27;m over 50.</li>
            <li> my hair was actually not flat but had ....</li>
            <li> I bought it for her when I was in Target and thought it may add some oomph to her thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Rogaine and this has left some fine and thin hair to cover the bald spot.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this treatment for anyone with thin, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> -did- add volume to my hair, which is fine and long, but also thick, so the weight makes it hard to get much \\&quot;oomph\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I had the sensation of more volume at the roots, where the weight of the hair usually keeps it pretty flat, but that may have been merely the suggestion caused by using the product and expecting some results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair has always been fine and thin and I wear it long, so it definitely needed some volume.  </li>
            <li> It does provide a little bit of volume, but nothing particularly noteworthy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t blow dry my hair as the instructions tell you to do, but I let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is rather small but it still contains a decent amount, especially if you only have to apply it weekly.</li>
            <li> far as my overall experience goes, I was less than impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just flat against my head.</li>
            <li> day\\&quot; with flat hair and no body.  </li>
            <li> I leave it in my hair for about five minutes before rinsing out, towel dry, and then blow dry with a large round brush.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;d say my ten whole hairs now feel like at least fifteen hairs, ha ha.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually after combing it out, I let my hair air dry because I didn’t want blow drying to cause additional problems later on.  </li>
            <li> No two ways about it - this stuff is fairly expensive, especially if you&#x27;re used to using cheap $0.99 bottles of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the middle aged one, and I have long hair, while the elderly one has cut hers short.  </li>
            <li> I wash my short hair about every other day so it didn&#x27;t last for even 4 days.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just a little &#x27;heavy&#x27; for me the first day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relaying comments from my wife, who has been using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the directions as printed, application is pretty simple, my wife uses about two pumps for hair a little past shoulder length, working it into the hair and letting it set for 5 minutes and rinsing.</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t be standing there soaking wet trying to get it open.</li>
            <li> It was a strange feeling, but not objectionable.</li>
            <li> Not soft to the touch at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But if you want thicker feeling hair and don&#x27;t mind spending twice as long drying it and your hair does not need to be styled....</li>
            <li> (I wear my long hair either in a knot or a braid normally.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have the typical male problem of having thinning hair on the back of my head creating a bald spot.  </li>
            <li> the heat is on for a long time (esp this year!)</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t think it lasts through 6 but might make the 7 day mark if you only wash it every other</li>
            <li> It is also on the bottle although I found that a little more difficult to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (part of how it achieves the volume), but I have very long hair</li>
            <li> The instructions specifically say to blow dry your hair, so I question whether it would be of any help if you air-dried,</li>
            <li> You can blow dry it, but I didn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> But my hair is *always* fuller when I blow dry it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice the tacky sensation when it was dry</li>
            <li> The directions state to blow dry and style as desired.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair as it makes my hair too brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Blow dry and style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Blow dry and style as desired.</li>
            <li> Try using the treatment from root to tip, then style with Luxurious Volume Mousse and blow dry with a vent brush.</li>
            <li> Both had thick hair as young women, but with age, the inevitable has happened--our hair has thinned.  </li>
            <li> - my hair feels generally soft, if not as silky as it usually does - it still feels to me like trying to brush through hair that has been sprayed.</li>
            <li> We tried this--one of us is elderly, the other middle aged.  </li>
            <li> It takes twice the time to dry and twice the time to get it to even do anything remotely like</li>
            <li> The next morning, my hair was much more tangled than usual and looked dirty.</li>
            <li> Long hair can be heavy and cause volume to fall flat.</li>
            <li> This stuff if meant to coat your hair and last about a week, coming off a little with each shampoo.</li>
            <li> Definitely need to follow directions (use a low dryer on low-medium to active the polymers even if yo don&#x27;t usually use a blow dryer).  </li>
            <li> I initially had a lot of trouble getting the dispenser to work.</li>
            <li> I expected it to feel creamy going on, like a conditioner, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> all you do is apply after your regular routine while showering and leave it in for a few minutes, then rinse.</li>
            <li> On my hair, there was really no visible difference.  </li>
            <li> While still in the shower, apply 3-4 pumps of the treatment to wet hair.</li>
            <li> thick, long, wavy hair usually hangs straight with no oomph.</li>
            <li> Also, the protein and keratin which are highlighted on the box are near the bottom of the list as you can see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes out of the pump as a fairly thick green/turquoise colored conditioner.</li>
            <li> I lazily blew dry my hair till it was almost dry then stopped, and as soon as it was totally dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, a little goes a long way with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Its length is currently a bit past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> just like every other hair mousse.  </li>
            <li> My hair is short, so I usually wash it twice a week, and the body lasted a week as claimed.</li>
            <li> Didnt use due to problems w shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
            <li> When I ordered this product I was NOT aware that it required or suggested blow drying.</li>
            <li> thing that I did note is that other John Friedavolumizing products are recommended along with this in the advice given on the box.</li>
            <li> That could be due to hair style and or texture.</li>
            <li> That could be due to hair style and or texture.</li>
            <li> Along with some Kaboki or similar hair powder (for those with pale scalps) to sprinkle a little filler in the part.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s limp and dry.</li>
            <li> Then, apply Luxurious Volume Root Booster at the crown area and blow dry with a large-barrel round brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair appears dull, and the silvery effect is gone entirely, making my hair just gray.  </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t have an issue with itchy scalp, but after applying this treatment, my scalp started itching like crazy and wouldn&#x27;t stop until I finally had to wash my hair a couple of times to get the product out of it.</li>
            <li> I have pale scalp and dark hair which accentuates the empty spots.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product and sadly didn&#x27;t have the results the other buyers have had.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I have a horrible time finding anything to volumize my fine, thin, limp hair which I wear above the shoulder.</li>
            <li> I finally got it to work by slowly twisting the pump just a slight bit then pressing down on the pump.</li>
            <li> I imagine that longer hair will weigh it down and this isn’t any fault of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> for volume, it did plump up my hair and give it some weight, but it decreased the shine of my hair at the same time and made my hair feel a little dry.</li>
            <li> With long hair, I usually only wash it once every 5-7 days unless I actually get very sweaty or dirty, but that last day is just about guaranteed to be a \\&quot;bad hair</li>
            <li> The John Frieda Boost was applied and it seemed that my Bald spot was even less visible than before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d call my hair normal, or perhaps on the thin side of it, a bit past shoulder-length and not color-treated.</li>
            <li> but hey it&#x27;s better than a boring white color.  </li>
            <li> After a blow- dry with my round brush (my usual routine)</li>
            <li> I kept doing that, turning it a little at a time and pressing, until the pump engaged.</li>
            <li> Volume enhancing shampoos do little to boost my hair&#x27;s volume.  </li>
            <li> (I had to use a little Static-Guard on my hairbrush).</li>
            <li> However, I have noticed that this product does affect the texture of my hair, leaving it not soft as it usually is, and it looks a little dull rather than shiny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; it might take you a few days/</li>
            <li> ; it might take you a few days/</li>
            <li> For a lazy hair person like me, it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
            <li> I rinsed my hair, then dried it and styled it as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hair felt like it had a coating on it as I dried and styled it.</li>
            <li> , AMP-ISOSTEAROYL HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, HYDROLYZED KERATIN, METHYLCHLOROISOTHIAZOLINONE, METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE, GREEN 3.g Cream, and it works for me -</li>
            <li> , AMP-ISOSTEAROYL HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, HYDROLYZED KERATIN, METHYLCHLOROISOTHIAZOLINONE, METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE, GREEN 3.</li>
            <li> a heavily perfumed hand soap would smell.</li>
            <li> after this was rinsed out and I had towel dried my hair.</li>
            <li> used the product as suggested on the box except I just towel dried my hair.</li>

            <li> If you suffer from thin limp hair, I would definitely give this a try.</li>
            <li> Products that coat your hair will usually eventually weigh it down - contravening the lift its meant to provide and making it look a bit greasy.</li>
            <li> neither of which weigh her hair down even the least little bit.  </li>
            <li> And when dry, my hair felt dirty &amp; almost gritty.  </li>
            <li> Me and my &amp;#34;ten whole hairs&amp;#34; were very skeptical about this product</li>
            <li> My hair is not fine, but it is not super thick either, and this shampoo does make it feel thicker, but as my husband also pointed out to me, it makes it feel a lot stiffer, too.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t mind-blowing, but it was there, and I didn&#x27;t have to pull out my usual arsenal of thickeners.</li>
            <li> is that the small number of people who they make this for?</li>
            <li> hair is just a touch past shoulder length at the moment.</li>
            <li> Blowdry and style as usual.  </li>
            <li> My hair ended up feeling stiff and hard to brush, so this is not something I will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bad: took twice as long to blow dry my hair, which felt greasy &amp; waxy.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d rather deal with that than dull, lifeless</li>
            <li> This product worked but hardly to the claims of the packaging.</li>
            <li> I will be using this product at least through winters.</li>
            <li> I found it difficult to feel it on my hair while it was wet.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d expect to do at least that</li>

            <li> anybody with thin or thinning hair, give it a try</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Purchased this at my wife&#x27;s request. Haven&#x27;t heard any complaints so it must be working out for her :)</li>
            <li> First of all, I have a horrible time finding anything to volumize my fine, thin, limp hair which I wear above the shoulder. Anything longer and it&#x27;s just flat against my head. I was skeptical of this product but have blown tons more on lesser worthy products so I gave it a shot. Wow! My new go to must have! With this product, I have real body and volume that feels like it&#x27;s actually IN my hair, rather than &#x27;on&#x27; it. My hair moves; it isn&#x27;t stuck in a helmet; it has bounce and when I curl it, it stays styled all day! In fact, the body keeps it off my scalp so well, I can actually wear my hair 2 days without washing; something I could NEVER do before as my hair always looked oily/greasy even though it wasn&#x27;t. With this, I can do it and 3 minutes once a week is nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Notes: Two things. First, I guess I got a dud package because the pump itself just would NOT unlock; you twist to pop it up for first use. I had to mangle the thing and finally get a pump from another container. As this isn&#x27;t the product itself, I won&#x27;t ding it for that but be aware it can be tricky to get the pump open.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, perhaps because my hair is so fine/thin, the first time I used it I wasn&#x27;t impressed. The FIRST DAY/ first blowout didn&#x27;t look any different to me but on the SECOND day when I washed it again, it was perfect. This stuff if meant to coat your hair and last about a week, coming off a little with each shampoo. After a few weeks, I&#x27;ve learned that it&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m using too much, it&#x27;s just a little &#x27;heavy&#x27; for me the first day. To avoid this, I figured out a trick. After I rinse it out, I take just the tiniest amount of sulfate free shampoo; just over the size of a pea. I work it into a lather in my palms and THEN I run my hands through my hair; like a &#x27;mini wash&#x27;. Now, from the first blowout my hair is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you have long hair, concentrate the product at your roots to get the most lift; coating long hair won&#x27;t do much for the length. For shorter hair like mine, I coat the entire length and I have swing/body/volume throughout my layers. If you have all one length hair, just use it on the roots and crown.&lt;br /&gt;So, don&#x27;t give up on it if the first try doesn&#x27;t impress you; it might take you a few days/tries to get the amount left on the hair just right, but when you do, it&#x27;s worth it. All for under $10! Container should last me 3-4 months easily at 4 &#x27;pumps&#x27; per use, once a week. Love it.e mine, I coat the entire length and I have swing/body/volume throughout my layers. If you have all one length hair, just use it on the roots and crown.&lt;br /&gt;So, don&#x27;t give up on it if the first try doesn&#x27;t impress you; it might take you a few days/tries to get the amount left on the hair just right, but when you do, it&#x27;s worth it. All for under $10! Container should last me 3-4 months easily at 4 &#x27;pumps&#x27; per use, once a week. Love it.</li>
            <li> It did give me volume, but it made my scalp very itchy! I normally don&#x27;t have an issue with itchy scalp, but after applying this treatment, my scalp started itching like crazy and wouldn&#x27;t stop until I finally had to wash my hair a couple of times to get the product out of it. I&#x27;ve used many hair products over the years, and have never  had a reaction like that before, so it must contain something new that my scalp just doesn&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for volume, it did plump up my hair and give it some weight, but it decreased the shine of my hair at the same time and made my hair feel a little dry. If it hadn&#x27;t given me an itchy scalp, I would have used this treatment once in a while, but it wouldn&#x27;t be something I would use every week. It is a really different and interesting new product, and I still think it&#x27;s worth giving it a try. Everyone&#x27;s hair is different, and it apparently works very well for some people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note on the packaging: I initially had a lot of trouble getting the dispenser to work. I stood in the shower for over 5 minutes trying to get it to pump. You might want to figure out how to open it before you get in the shower so you won&#x27;t be standing there soaking wet trying to get it open. I finally got it to work by slowly twisting the pump just a slight bit then pressing down on the pump. I kept doing that, turning it a little at a time and pressing, until the pump engaged.</li>
            <li> Me and my &amp;#34;ten whole hairs&amp;#34; were very skeptical about this product but I have to say that &amp;#34;we&amp;#34; love it!  This product will not give you a horse&#x27;s tail of hair if you were only born with a rat tail, so to speak.  However, I&#x27;d say my ten whole hairs now feel like at least fifteen hairs, ha ha.  What&#x27;s most impressive is that the product lasted through about 4 washes, meaning I only have to use it about once per week.  Also, this product kind of seals your hair follicle, meaning it takes a lot less of the other products you use, such as styling products, to achieve the same effect.  My hair feels thicker, is more manageable and has incredible shine.  I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This volume treatment works well, but was not a good choice for my situation.  After applying the product per instructions, I did notice a difference in volume, but did not like how it made my hair feel.  This product will be great for someone who styles their hair and is used to using different products, but since I typically just brush mine and go, this just felt weird.  My hair ended up feeling stiff and hard to brush, so this is not something I will continue to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is easy to apply and has a pleasant scent.  For someone who relies on volumizing products to achieve their current hairstyle, this will be effective.  For a lazy hair person like me, it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
            <li> Works well, as do all John Frieda products for fine hair, but I like the spray on better.</li>
            <li> This goes on after shampoo and conditioner -- and is the texture of conditioner.  You leave it on for a few minutes before rinsing, and it is supposed to leave your hair with more volume.  The instructions specifically say to blow dry your hair, so I question whether it would be of any help if you air-dried, like I normally do.  It did give my curly hair a boost in volume, particularly on top where it tends to go flat after a day or two.  And it has lasted through a shampoo.  Kind of an amazing product.</li>
            <li> My hair was thick and full when I was younger, but has become incredibly thin and fine now that I&#x27;m over 50. I have used a variety of products to add volume to my hair, but they must be reapplied every time I shampoo. The idea of a 7 day product appealed to me, so I looked forward to trying this new John Freida treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shampooed first, and used the product according to the directions. I expected it to feel creamy going on, like a conditioner, but it didn&#x27;t. Despite the thickness of the product, it felt like i was rubbing my hair with water. That&#x27;s not a complaint, just an observation. I rinsed my hair, then dried it and styled it as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair felt like it had a coating on it as I dried and styled it. It was a strange feeling, but not objectionable. After I finished styling it, I definitely noticed more volume! It wasn&#x27;t mind-blowing, but it was there, and I didn&#x27;t have to pull out my usual arsenal of thickeners. I shampooed twice during the week after the initial treatment, and still noticed volume. It faded after the third shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package says it last through 2 or 3 shampoos, which is about 7 days worth for most people. If you shampoo more frequently, you can expect to use this twice a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list of ingredients is mind boggling, and I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in there. I don&#x27;t know that I would use this every week, since it might be good to give my hair a vacation every now and then, but I will use it and will purchase more when this bottle is gone. I like it!</li>
            <li> Most women want their hair to have more volume, and I’m no different. I’ve used Pantene’s volumizing shampoo and conditioner for years and like it, but when I saw John Frieda Luxurious Volume 7 Day Volume In-Shower Treatment, I knew I wanted to try it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you shampoo and condition your hair, simply pump 3 or 4 squirts into your hand and work it well through your wet hair, just as you would conditioner, making sure to get it on the roots, ends, and everything in between. Leave it on for 3-5 minutes, and then rinse thoroughly. After that, style as you normally do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of hair, but it is fine. Its length is currently a bit past my shoulders. I typically blow dry it, and then style it with a hot roll brush type appliance to create gentle waves all over that swing when I move. I do believe the John Frieda treatment has improved my hair’s volume and the effect has lasted through 2 shampoos already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging suggests this is a 7-day treatment, but then also says that it will last 2-3 washes. If you are like me and you wash your hair every day, this treatment will not last 7 days. The label calls it ‘semi-permanent’, but ‘temporary’ is a more accurate description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given how short it will last for me, this is something I won’t use all the time, but save for events when I want a little more volume. At the time of this review, there is no price on this product on Amazon’s page, but since it bears the John Frieda branding, I am sure it will be a bit pricier than something I can afford to use frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I do like the effect it has, so I will probably keep a bottle on hand for nights out with friends, dates, or other special occasions.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that needs a volume boost.  Volume enhancing shampoos do little to boost my hair&#x27;s volume.  I found that this product added a visible boost to my hair&#x27;s volume.  Some products lead to flyaway hair but this one did not.  For me, the effect lasted about 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - this product does work for me to transform and plump my fine hair for visible results.  I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, straight and fine and I have the same issues as a lot of people from using this product. It does smell nice and gives a little boost of volume but just a little. My hair is processed with color too. So maybe for shorter or virgin hair it might perform better? Anyways, it also did not last for a full 7 or even 5 days but 2 days only. It made my hair feel over processed and it was not softer afterwards either. I tried air drying and blow drying but really the only difference is it made my hair slightly more volumized, slightly. I also lost my shine which I didn’t like at all but that’s just me.</li>
            <li> The pump is impossible to open!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irritating. Almost makes me want to throw the bottle in the trash. I had to (finally) just open the twist cap and put some of the product into the palm of my hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know the combination?</li>
            <li> Superb volume, especially after repeated treatments. Definitely need to follow directions (use a low dryer on low-medium to active the polymers even if yo don&#x27;t usually use a blow dryer).  Volume is great  for days just air dried, with light product for styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one&#x27;s a keeper for my babyfine Scandinavian hair, that can barely hold a style on its own</li>
            <li> I have baby fine blonde hair that I have fought for 66 years &amp; I&#x27;ve just tried Frieda&#x27;s 7 day volume. My original thoughts as I began rinsing out the 1st application was that the product was going to do nothing/nada as my hair felt way too \\&quot;silky soft\\&quot; for it to have any volume when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking I was in for another bad hair day [i.e. flat]. I continued my routine application of Frieda&#x27;s root lift and started blow drying my pixie cut. After about 15 seconds of drying [like I said hair is short!] I was astonished....my hair was actually not flat but had ....what&#x27;s this....fluff! And it felt silky to boot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may be dreaming all of this....and if so I may change this review if I wake up to \\&quot;flat\\&quot; hair. But for now, its been 3 days and I&#x27;m still \\&quot;running on\\&quot; the 1st application of 7 day volume. I even have \\&quot;fluffy\\&quot; hair before too much \\&quot;coffee\\&quot; in the morning .....this is really getting scary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up my thoughts....buy this stuff if you have fine hair it works!</li>
            <li> Does not work!  I have fine hair and with this product, my hair gets finer and cannot style at all without tons of hair spray.  Do not waste your money!</li>
            <li> The John Frieda Luxurious Volume Boost is an effective way to boost thinning hair.  I have the typical male problem of having thinning hair on the back of my head creating a bald spot.  I have been using Rogaine and this has left some fine and thin hair to cover the bald spot.  The John Frieda Boost was applied and it seemed that my Bald spot was even less visible than before. My hair did look thicker and more full where this was applied but the hair also had a different feel to it (more dry than before).  Overall this product worked as advertised and seems to be worth its relatively high price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m relaying comments from my wife, who has been using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the directions as printed, application is pretty simple, my wife uses about two pumps for hair a little past shoulder length, working it into the hair and letting it set for 5 minutes and rinsing. The result is, subjectively, softer hair that after drying does appear to have more volume and retain the volume throughout the day. Seven days may be a bit of a stretch for duration of effect, especially, given that she washes her hair daily (your mileage may vary depending on washing). As an aside she noted somewhat more retained control on days when we get a slight mist in the mornings than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my wife is happy with the results and not unhappy with the cost for the product.&lt;br /&gt;P-)</li>
            <li> This John Frieda conditioner is practically a miracle worker as far as I’m concerned. My hair has always been somewhat limp and fine but I used to have more hair than average which balanced out the limpness. But now that I’m older and losing more hair I’ve noticed that it tends to look a little flat. After using this the first time the difference was very noticeable and I had the desire to flip my hair back like they do on commercials. Too bad it’s too short to flip- but it did look so much fuller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to use it once a week- all you do is apply after your regular routine while showering and leave it in for a few minutes, then rinse. It did feel a little heavy while rinsing but not too annoying. But after styling the change was obvious and even feels fuller in hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do only use this every fourth or fifth shampoo since my hair is too dry to wash daily, and I love the results. Give it a try, I think you’ll be happy too.</li>
            <li> This product is beyond amazing...I&#x27;ve tried countless others on my curly/fine hair and this is the only one that delivers.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and have tried everything!  I had high hopes for this product and sadly didn&#x27;t have the results the other buyers have had.  I didn&#x27;t see any difference.  I recently started using Moroccon oil root pump and wow!!!!</li>
            <li> For my hair not the right thing</li>
            <li> Great first time, not so good on second wash 2 days later and then, completely gone. I wash my short hair about every other day so it didn&#x27;t last for even 4 days.  I can&#x27;t imagine going 7 days between washings - is that the small number of people who they make this for?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok I won&#x27;t buy again it never made that much of a difference for me to spend that much.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  I need to re-order so I don&#x27;t run out.  I use it once a week and it gives my hair a big poof.  I love this.</li>
            <li> Makes my thin hair appear​ normalish.  It doesn&#x27;t always last the week, usually only 2 washes, but I wouldn&#x27;t stop using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of weeks now, and while I can say that it delivers what it promises - hair is thicker while using it - it also kind of kills style. They recommend applying it to roots and midshaft for layered hair, but in spite of following these directions to the best of my ability, I wind up with an all-over pouf that is difficult to style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is just a touch past shoulder length at the moment. It is fine and has always been very straight. I have only within the past few years learned that a great stylist can create the illusion of volume with the clever use of layering, so these days my hair tricks people into thinking I have some texture. I thought I&#x27;d give this a try to see if it could better that effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As near as I can tell by evaluating the ingredients (see the bottom of this post, as these are not at this writing listed on Amazon), this product relies on several hair-coating agents meant to give the appearance of volume. PVP, Polyvinylpyrrolidone, is the ingredient that gives many hairsprays their holding effect. VP/VA Copolymer inhibits hair from absorbing moisture and is found in mascaras and other volumizing hair products. The potentially drying, coarsening effects of these are countered by softening and anti-static agents, like cetyl alcohol (one of the good ones) and Polyquaternium 37.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the countering agents here do a pretty good job - my hair feels generally soft, if not as silky as it usually does - it still feels to me like trying to brush through hair that has been sprayed. I&#x27;m not styling so much as taming, and the end-result does not appeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Longterm build-up has not been a huge issue, but I&#x27;ve not been using this long. Products that coat your hair will usually eventually weigh it down - contravening the lift its meant to provide and making it look a bit greasy. To avoid long-term build-up, I&#x27;d recommend a weekly wash with a clarifying shampoo. (I use Redken Cleansing Cream, and it works for me - but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the best or most economical.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this is not a product I will continue to use. If my hair were long with fewer layers, I&#x27;d probably love it, but what it&#x27;s doing now mostly is fighting against a great cut. In terms of what to expect from it, we&#x27;re not talking about an 80s hair band&#x27;s worth of lift, but definitely more volume, especially along the length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients are:&lt;br /&gt;WATER, ISODECYL NEOPENTANOATE, PVP, POLYQUATERNIUM-37, VP/VA COPOLYMER, CETYL ALCOHOL, POLYIMIDE-1, BENZYL ALCOHOL, HYDROXYPROPYL METHYLCELLULOSE, FRAGRANCE, SILICONE QUATERNIUM-18, TRIDECETH-6, MALIC ACID, TRIDECETH-12, GLYCINE, STEARTRIMONIUM CHLORIDE, GLYCERIN, HYDROLYZED VEGETABLE PROTEIN PG-PROPYL SILANETRIOL, ALCOHOL DENAT., AMP-ISOSTEAROYL HYDROLYZED WHEAT PROTEIN, HYDROLYZED KERATIN, METHYLCHLOROISOTHIAZOLINONE, METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE, GREEN 3.g Cream, and it works for me - but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the best or most economical.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this is not a product I will continue to use.

            <li> I like this product.  It’s a great find and I wanted to give it a try.  My hair has always been fine and thin and I wear it long, so it definitely needed some volume.  It doesn’t last the full seven days, but that’s okay.  I imagine that longer hair will weigh it down and this isn’t any fault of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shampooed and conditioned my hair like normal and then squeezed as much water out as possible before applying the volume treatment.  After the five minutes recommended, I rinsed my hair and towel dried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually after combing it out, I let my hair air dry because I didn’t want blow drying to cause additional problems later on.  But the product says to blow dry, so I dug out my mini-blow-dryer that’s probably thirty years old.  However, it still works so I’ve been using it to blow dry my hair keeping the dryer about six inches or more from my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does make my hair fuller.  My husband even noticed a difference.  I just wished it lasted longer.  It also took me about six or seven pumps because of my hair length, but it leaves my hair soft and not stiff.  It’s also safe for color treated hair, so no worries there.  If you suffer from thin limp hair, I would definitely give this a try.</li>
            <li> My hair is definately looking fuller after 3 applications of this product. I use it with the Frieda volume shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Worked as described.  I have lots of hair, but it is very fine.  This gave my shoulder length hair the volume I wanted.</li>
            <li> I suppose this product will work well for some people, but I just do not like it. My hair is not fine, but it is not super thick either, and this shampoo does make it feel thicker, but as my husband also pointed out to me, it makes it feel a lot stiffer, too. Not soft to the touch at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is normally easy to blow dry and style and dries quickly. Not with this stuff. It takes twice the time to dry and twice the time to get it to even do anything remotely like I want it to do. I also don&#x27;t like that it feels like you are working with wax while you are drying your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it every day......it does stick with you. I have used it about every three days just to see if anything different happens, but each time it is the same......a half hour longer in the mirror drying it and fighting with the curling brush the whole time to get it to do what I want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is expensive and to me just not worth the hassle. But if you want thicker feeling hair and don&#x27;t mind spending twice as long drying it and your hair does not need to be styled....you may like it. But I sure don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Nope. I wanted to like this, tried it three times and followed the directions to the &amp;#34;T.&amp;#34; It did absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff. Great result in just one use.</li>
            <li> John Frieda&#x27;s Luxurious Volume was something I didn&#x27;t believe in at first, until I tried it.  I have thin, limp blond hair.  Luxurious Volume was easy to use and I have noticed an improvement.  I washed and rinsed my hair in the shower and applied 4 pumps of the Volume substance.  I rubbed it throughout my head and waited 5 minutes.  I continued showering and before I was done I rinsed the Volume out of my hair.  Then I wrapped my head in a towel.  When I combed out my hair, it felt like a different texture.  My hair felt stronger and thicker.  I didn&#x27;t blow dry my hair as the instructions tell you to do, but I let it dry naturally.  Even so, my hair looks fuller and with more body.  I can recommend this Volume treatment to anyone with thin, limp hair as I have.  The effect has lasted even though I wash my hair every day.  My hair seems to get thicker every time I wash it.  Five stars.</li>
            <li> This really works - just not as long as they say it does.  However - I am VERY pleased with this product!!  Another one in this line of excellent items!!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely a must have if you have thin/fine hair. I received a sample and after one use I immediately ordered a full size bottle.  Adds a ton of great volume, does not weigh hair down and isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Do not like it. does not do what it claims to do.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law uses this on her baby fine hair and loves it.  I bought it for her when I was in Target and thought it may add some oomph to her thin, fine hair.  It definitely works well and I can tell a difference when she uses it.  Her hair has more thickness and volume and is easier to style.  Normally, when she uses a curling iron, the curls fall out quickly.  I gave her a can of TIGI Catwalk Lightweight Mousse, which I love, and her curls stayed strong the entire day.  It has great hold but is light enough for even the finest hair.  These two products together give her great hair days and she&#x27;s since made these products part of her normal routine.  The Frieda treatment really does last a full week, even through several shampoos.  She has an asymmetrical bob haircut and it looks like a million bucks with these products,  neither of which weigh her hair down even the least little bit.  It looks like she has twice as much hair!  I definitely recommend this treatment for anyone with thin, fine hair.  It&#x27;s easy to use and does its job well and is reasonably priced.  What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I have always had to wash my hair every morning but now I can go 2 days without washing and still wake up the 2nd day with some volume to my VERY fine hair.</li>
            <li> just like every other hair mousse.  Nothing worth spending $$$</li>
            <li> makes my hair look like there is more of it on the top.  I am very pleased with the results</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how well this works!  Adds body, and makes it look like I have 4X as much hair as I do. Hair is still soft!</li>
            <li> This works better than anything I have used thus far.</li>
            <li> I never thought too much about the volume of my hair, until I saw a photo of myself from the holidays, on a day that I thought my hair looked pretty presentable, and saw just how flat it really was. So I was very intrigued by this treatment and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shampoo and conditioner, I wring out my hair and use about 3.5 - 4 pumps, and flip my hair over so I can comb the product through the entire length of my hair from root to tip. The first thing I noticed about this product was the smell - I think it&#x27;s meant to be rather neutral/scentless, but it reminds me a lot of dog shampoo which discourages me a bit from using it too often. I leave it in my hair for about five minutes before rinsing out, towel dry, and then blow dry with a large round brush. It does provide a little bit of volume, but nothing particularly noteworthy. It&#x27;s really the day after the wash that I appreciate this - whereas before, my hair would be rather limp &amp;#62;24 hours after washing, and after having slept on it, my hair looks a little more voluminous than it would otherwise be. However, I have noticed that this product does affect the texture of my hair, leaving it not soft as it usually is, and it looks a little dull rather than shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a so-so product that I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be trying again.</li>
            <li> I liked several things about Luxurious Volume Treatment quite a bit. The first was that it -did- add volume to my hair, which is fine and long, but also thick, so the weight makes it hard to get much \\&quot;oomph\\&quot;. The difference is more noticeable on shorter hair, but I -did- see more body and it lasted about 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this as directed--washed and conditioned first, then used 3-4 pumps of the JF Treatment, left it on 3-5 minutes then rinsed out. You can blow dry it, but I didn&#x27;t and I still could see some difference in the height and volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it very much is that it has a very strong scent. Not unpleasant, maybe like a heavily perfumed hand soap would smell. I just would have preferred that it had no scent or, at least, a far more mild one. It wasn&#x27;t completely gone after I rinsed, so that was a drawback for me, even though the scent isn&#x27;t offensive, I just don&#x27;t like it. (It also would run less risk of being drying for fine hair without the chemicals/perfumes.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the effect itself, I thought this was a good product, though I wouldn&#x27;t use it all the time--just for \\&quot;occasions\\&quot;--since with fine, color-treated hair I&#x27;d be concerned about dryness.</li>
            <li> My hair has gotten finer the older I have gotten. For awhile I kept it colored just because it felt thicker that way. However, I love my natural silver gray, so I stopped coloring, and was back to fine hair. I followed the directions and used this product in the shower. I could immediately feel that my hair was thicker when I started styling it. After a blow- dry with my round brush (my usual routine) I was thrilled with the results! My hair is short, so I usually wash it twice a week, and the body lasted a week as claimed. If you wash more often, it probably will need treating more often. I really like this product and would recommend. I plan to reorder this.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t think this really did anything for my hair&#x27;s volume. I have naturally curly, baby fine hair. At the age of 45, my hair is thinner than it was when I was younger (which is really annoying. especially for a woman). I used the product as directed. The instructions very clearly said to blow dry your hair -- it was even underlined -- so I did. And yes, my hair was fuller. But my hair is *always* fuller when I blow dry it. I don&#x27;t think there was a lasting effect after that first day, either. Disappointing, but also proof that there are no magic products when it comes to hair and skin.</li>
            <li> First thing fix the pump.  Mine does not work.  I tried everything but it just won&#x27;t move.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product, It works okay but not better than other products on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this is called a seven day treatment but according to the instructions, you use it once then wait two to three shampooings before using it again.  I thought based on the description that it is a 7 day volume enhancer.  But that means it should last longer.</li>
            <li> I have long (almost waist-length), straight, baby-fine hair. I absolutely love this stuff. Because I am older (56) and my hair is dry, I only wash it 2-3 times a week so the treatment lasted 5 days. Yes, it made my hair a little fuller (wonderful), but my major joy was the fact that it wasn&#x27;t filled with static!! Here in the northern US the heat is on for a long time (esp this year!) and my hair was horribly full of static and &amp;#34;flying away&amp;#34; no matter what I used. This stuff worked great. It was best the first day, good the second, fine after washing on day 3, and starting to disappear on days 4 and 5 (I had to use a little Static-Guard on my hairbrush). I air-dried my hair part way and then used a blow drier to finish. (Normally I air -dry only). I will be using this product at least through winters. Yes, it made my hair a tiny bit duller, but the trade-off with the static was well worth it, in my opinion. I will try the shampoo and conditioner at some point too.</li>
            <li> Didnt use due to problems w shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
            <li> The good:  it does give a bit of volume.  The bad: took twice as long to blow dry my hair, which felt greasy &amp; waxy.  I style my short, piecey, layered hairstyle straight, but within an hour of drying it became super wavy (which I don&#x27;t want).  And when dry, my hair felt dirty &amp; almost gritty.  Bottom line: if you absolutely need the volume &amp; are willing to put up with the flaws, go for it.  I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. I wash my hair 2-3 time a week and this product does an awesome job at making my hair appear as though I just washed it. The volume is amazing and stays for a few days. Will definitely keep purchasing.</li>
            <li> The bottle of this John Frieda product says, &amp;#34;Visibly full, touchably soft.&amp;#34; I wanted to try this volume maximizer to give me more volume, but I have to say, my hair is not soft after using this product. Even though it&#x27;s used in the shower and rinsed off, my hair feels like there&#x27;s a coating of lotion on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thick, long, wavy hair usually hangs straight with no oomph. My hair definitely has more volume, with my waves coming out more, but I don&#x27;t care for the feel of my hair. I&#x27;d rather style my hair with a little less wave than have more waves and greasy hair. This is definitely more like a styling aid then a treatment for hair, in that I would only use this prior to a night out or something, not for regular use.</li>
            <li> I kind of like this.  My hair is very fine and medium thickness, and in the dry northern winter static electricity makes it stand out like a halo.&lt;br /&gt;This really does increase the volume and it lasts through a few shampoos.  (I don&#x27;t think it lasts through 6 but might make the 7 day mark if you only wash it every other day.)&lt;br /&gt;In my opinion it does so at the expense of shine, and it feels kind of odd.I didn&#x27;t notice the tacky sensation when it was dry but when I washed my hair I had to refrain from shampooing several times because it felt so strange.&lt;br /&gt;I will probably continue to use this in the winter and let humidity work its wonders in the summer.</li>
            <li> We tried this--one of us is elderly, the other middle aged.  Both had thick hair as young women, but with age, the inevitable has happened--our hair has thinned.  I&#x27;m the middle aged one, and I have long hair, while the elderly one has cut hers short.  Both of us are gray and neither of us dyes our hair, so we have relatively healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went through the routine as the directions ask, although we did NOT use John Frieda shampoo.  We did use premium shampoos from the salon, along with conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our results were only so-so.  On the elderly user, there was some slight increase in volume, but not enough to get real excited about.  On my hair, there was really no visible difference.  It felt nice, but the shampoo and conditioner do that anyhow.  I had the sensation of more volume at the roots, where the weight of the hair usually keeps it pretty flat, but that may have been merely the suggestion caused by using the product and expecting some results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real test comes over time.  With long hair, I usually only wash it once every 5-7 days unless I actually get very sweaty or dirty, but that last day is just about guaranteed to be a \\&quot;bad hair day\\&quot; with flat hair and no body.  We&#x27;ll see how it fairs towards the end of the week, and if a miracle occurs...I&#x27;ll update the review.  As it stands, this isn&#x27;t a product I&#x27;m dying to keep in my shower for regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this several times now.  Yes, it does make your hair appear thicker &amp; fuller, but at a price.  I have silver hair with darker streaks, and it is normally very shiny.  (Shiny enough that it looks like a halo if it escapes the &#x27;do with backlight)  With this product, the shine is gone entirely.  My hair appears dull, and the silvery effect is gone entirely, making my hair just gray.  I really don&#x27;t like the dullness at all, and with my hair in the earliest stages of age-inspired thinning, I&#x27;d rather deal with that than dull, lifeless hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how it lasts through the week without making my hair needing to be washed sooner--it has zero effect.  The most noticeable effect is that when I wash my hair and finish with the conditioner, the slick, silky effect that the wet hair has disappears entirely when this product is applied.  Instead, my hair immediately feels coarse and rough--more like a horse&#x27;s tail than my hair!  I also had a LOT of problems with static, especially if I used a natural bristle brush, when brushing it out each day before putting it up.  (I wear my long hair either in a knot or a braid normally.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is coming to visit soon, and I&#x27;ll try to talk her into trying it on her hair, as it is naturally thin, fine, and straight, as well as not gray.  Maybe she will like it better than I have.k without making my hair needing to be washed sooner--it has zero effect.

            <li> This product worked but hardly to the claims of the packaging. I&#x27;d call my hair normal, or perhaps on the thin side of it, a bit past shoulder-length and not color-treated. After using the product as directed, it left my hair with slightly more volume but very dry. The next morning, my hair was much more tangled than usual and looked dirty. Sometimes I skip a day between washings but no way after using this stuff. It feels like I rubbed lotion on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, it smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps this would&#x27;ve worked better in more capable hands. For me, it seemed more like a leave-in conditioner than a volumizer.</li>
            <li> I have only used this once. The package&#x27;s directions say not to use it every time you shampoo, but every third or fourth time. I was unclear on whether that was regardless of how frequently you shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I found it definitely made a difference. My hair was more manageable, fuller, and even softer.&lt;br /&gt;I also used my Nexxus Youth Renewal treatment (http://www.amazon.com/Nexxus-Youth-Renewal-Plump-Spray/dp/B00AE07GX0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1422304907&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1-fkmr0&amp;keywords&#x3D;nexxus+blow+dry+hair+treatment) after this was rinsed out and I had towel dried my hair. It didn&#x27;t compete with the John Frieda product. Actually, they seemed to enhance each other.&lt;br /&gt;I have never used John Frieda before, but I would buy this again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I am a hair product hobbyist with long but fine hair (although it&#x27;s not thin - my hairdresser says I have a LOT of hair).  My skin is on the oily side so I&#x27;m a daily hair washer.  This product has the right goal but it didn&#x27;t deliver quite as I expected.  Did it volumize?  Yes.  Does it last 7 days?  Only if you wash your hair twice.&lt;br /&gt;If that&#x27;s all I had to complain about, I&#x27;d gladly double up on my use of this product.  However the &amp;#34;fit and finish&amp;#34; of my hair wasn&#x27;t very nice during my trial of this product.  It goes on in the shower after you&#x27;ve already shampooed and conditioned.  Leave on for 3 minutes and rinse.  Blowdry and style as usual.  I did just that and my hair came out feeling both filmy and wiry.  The next day it had a greasiness at the roots that I&#x27;m not accustomed to.  I thought maybe I just didn&#x27;t rinse it well enough - so I washed my hair again in the shower that next day.  It was better (no film) but my hair is so wiry and frizzy!  It&#x27;s like a poof ball!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is done with modest highlights/lowlights at the salon and I have about an inch of roots.  The root area (virgin hair) didn&#x27;t seem to become quite as coarse and frizzy, so if you don&#x27;t have treated hair this might work better for you!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I&#x27;m just not a fan of this product.  I had high hopes.  The only save I can find is for those with fine/silky hair who want to wear their hair in a pony tail.  This &amp;#34;roughs up&amp;#34; your hair enough that you can have some volume in your ponytail style and the hair band won&#x27;t fall out.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it does give wonderful volume and it does not leave a residue on my hair.  After use my hair feels soft and is shinier.  The  reason for the 4 stars is that the volume does last through 1 washing but not 2-3 as stated.  When I washed my hair the first time I could tell there was product remaining by the texture and it did blow out as expected without additional products.  I washed my hair again today and the volume just was not there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still would recommend this product as the volume it provides is better and softer than most products I have used and it really does last through another washing.  An extra plus my hair is shinier and softer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 43-year old woman. It&#x27;s not uncommon for women my age to have thinning hair. I have pale scalp and dark hair which accentuates the empty spots. I tried out the John Frieda Luxurious Volume cream and I didn&#x27;t think about it, but I noticed later that my hair looked pretty good without doing ANYTHING to it. It wasn&#x27;t until later I remembered the product and realized that the reason it looked good was exactly from increase in volume due to John Frieda. I recommend this. Along with some Kaboki or similar hair powder (for those with pale scalps) to sprinkle a little filler in the part.</li>
            <li> This product promises 7 days of volume. It&#x27;s super easy to use. You apply it in shower after washing and conditioning. They suggest 3- 4 pumps and that you leave it on for 3 to 4 minutes then rinse. The directions state to blow dry and style as desired. When I ordered this product I was NOT aware that it required or suggested blow drying. I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair as it makes my hair too brittle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the product as suggested on the box except I just towel dried my hair. My results have been good. I have thick hair but it&#x27;s limp and dry. This product gives my hair a fuller,softer look and feel with more movement...Dare I say it has more bounce? I am pretty sure my results would be even better if I were to blow dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall,this is a product worth trying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s reasonably priced !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s non permanent !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s non damaging !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Safe for color treated hair !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried any volumizing products, but I have somewhat fine hair, so I thought it would be interesting to try out. I ended up hating having my hair volumized, but this product worked really well, so I am giving it 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is applied in the shower after you&#x27;ve washed and conditioned your hair. You then rub 3-5 pumps through all of your hair and let sit for about 5 minutes, then rinse. Blow dry and style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once your hair is dried you can easily tell the difference. I lazily blew dry my hair till it was almost dry then stopped, and as soon as it was totally dry I could see a difference in volume. Of course, I could also feel what the product did to my hair, which is make it very hard to brush. I understand that is normal for this type of product (part of how it achieves the volume), but I have very long hair and it did not feel good -- in fact it made my hair a bit frizzy and it felt damaged for some time after. Trying again with only applying to the scalp helped a bit, but I&#x27;ve decided that I am better off without volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took three shampoos to return my hair to normal, so the 7 day label depends on how often you wash your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product worked and lasted as advertised and was very easy to use. The bottle is rather small but it still contains a decent amount, especially if you only have to apply it weekly.</li>
            <li> This John Frieda Luxurious Volume 7 Day Volume in-shower treatment is part of a full line of products geared towards amplifying hair thickness for up to 7 days. This product claims to be a semi-permanent treatment and lasts up to 7 days or three washings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll share my experience at the end of this review after providing you with information you&#x27;ll need for using the product. Most of it is on the box for the user&#x27;s convenience. It is also on the bottle although I found that a little more difficult to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the box you&#x27;ll find a 4 ounce plastic bottle with a pump top. Since the bottle isn&#x27;t transparent it isn&#x27;t possible to see how much is left after each use. I can&#x27;t accurately judge how far it will go but the bottle still feels quite full after two so there is definitely enough for multiple applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions: shampoo and condition hair (they recommend using the Luxurious Shampoo &amp; Conditioner which I didn&#x27;t not have). Squeeze out excess water. While still in the shower, apply 3-4 pumps of the treatment to wet hair. Be sure to fully cover the entire length of the hair including under sections and root area. Use more or less depending on hair length and thickness. Leave on for 3-5 minutes and then rinse. Blow dry and style as desired. Allow 2-3 washes before your next treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice for short, piecy styles: You need all over volume. Try using the treatment from root to tip, then style with Luxurious Volume Mousse and blow dry with a vent brush. Make sure to lift hair at the roots to give more airflow for an even fuller look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advice for longer, layered styles: Long hair can be heavy and cause volume to fall flat. Try applying the treatment from roots to mid-shaft. Then, apply Luxurious Volume Root Booster at the crown area and blow dry with a large-barrel round brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is safe for color treated hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients include: Water, Isodecyl Neopentanoate, PVP, Polyquaternium-37, VP/VA Copolymer, Cetyl alcohol, Polymide-1, Benzyl alcohol, Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, Fragrance, Silicone quaternium-18, Trideceth-6, Malic acid, Trideceth-12, Glycine, Steartrimonium Chloride, Glycerin, Hydrolyzed vegetable protein, PG-propyl silanetriol, Alcohol denat, Amp-isostearoyl hydrolyzed wheat protein,  Hydrolyzed keratin, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Methylisothiazolinone, Green 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know much about these ingredients but I see several forms of alcohol which tend to be drying. Also, the protein and keratin which are highlighted on the box are near the bottom of the list as you can see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes out of the pump as a fairly thick green/turquoise colored conditioner. The fragrance is light and not over-powering. I found it to be pleasant enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as my overall experience goes, I was less than impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of style my hair would fall under short and piecy. I&#x27;m currently growing it out so I have a lot of layers. I applied this product as directed, to the best of my ability. I found it difficult to feel it on my hair while it was wet. Since I don&#x27;t have a mirror in the shower all I could do was give it my best effort. After rinsing I used a blow dryer as I always do with a vent brush. My regular routine is much like the advice given on the box. However, the outcome was vastly different than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was very heavy on the top and the sides fell flat. This was not at all what I&#x27;d hoped for. Instead of improvement my hair looked worse than usual. And, my head was itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regularly use Aussie Mega Volumizing Gel and it works much better than this particular John Frieda product did at a fraction of the cost. I&#x27;m going to stick with it although I do think that my Mom, who has fine hair, might like to try this out. Perhaps she&#x27;ll get a different result. It&#x27;s always fun to try something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I did note is that other John Friedavolumizing products are recommended along with this in the advice given on the box. The product description/claims make no mention of them. I find that to be a bit misleading. If the performance of this product is enhanced by using others in conjunction with it, I would like to know that upfront. So, it is my feeling that the product description should be changed so that those purchasing will know that additional products are needed to get maximized results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It appears from the reviews that some are having better results than others with this product. That could be due to hair style and or texture. I don&#x27;t have really fine hair to begin with. Still, I&#x27;m able to achieve extra volume with my regular product so I&#x27;d expect to do at least that given the reputation of the John Frieda line and the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my experience I can&#x27;t recommend this product.I find that to be a bit misleading.

            <li> No two ways about it - this stuff is fairly expensive, especially if you&#x27;re used to using cheap $0.99 bottles of shampoo. However, I got a sample of this and had to try it. I have long, very fine hair that&#x27;s thinned out because of illness. I don&#x27;t want to cut off my hair, so making it look fuller was of primary importance.  So, I tried the sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was magnificent! My hair hadn&#x27;t looked that good in twenty years! I could wear my hair down, without doing anything special to make it look fuller.  My favorite husband loved it, and I felt pretty darned gorgeous that day. I decided that I needed to buy this stuff, and searched local places high and low. Either they weren&#x27;t carrying this product, or it was all gone. Family members came home with the shampoo or matching conditioner, but not this in-shower treatment.  Finally, I saw it here and bought some immediately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s as good as the sample. It lasts several days (not a week, but close to it), and gives me gorgeous, full hair that looks like mine looked years ago. I certainly cannot guarantee that this will work as well for you, but it has worked miracles for my mother too, as well as other fine haired friends. (If you are one of those women blessed with hair that needs thinning at the hairdresser, leave this on the shelf. Thin haired women like me NEED this!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, a little goes a long way with this stuff. I have hair nearly to my waist and I use a tablespoon or so of product. That&#x27;s really good for very long hair. Hope you give this a try and have the miraculous fullness I got. I&#x27;ll never have a hairdresser ask me how I can stand the weight of all my hair, but it looks nice enough to gain complements, even when I wear my hair down.</li>
            <li> It doeswhat you want a &amp;#34;luxurious volume&amp;#34; product to do.  It makes your hair appear thicker and fuller after only one use.  The product smells good and is a pretty blue color.  The color doesn&#x27;t matter but hey it&#x27;s better than a boring white color.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and thick enough that it doesn&#x27;t glop out of your hands or onto the shower floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just washed my hair and conditioned like normal and then used this product.  You do rinse it out.  It&#x27;s good stuff. Really like what it did for my hair.</li>
            <li> this is the only product i have ever tried that made my hair look thicker and fuller, and i&#x27;ve tried them all.  i&#x27;m using it with the shampoo but skipping the conditioner bec my hair&#x27;s too fine for that.  WOW what a difference.  anybody with thin or thinning hair, give it a try, it&#x27;s a God-send.</li>
