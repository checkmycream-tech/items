            <li>This dryer is wonderful.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s awesome, that&#x27;s why.</li>
            <li>Anytime I&#x27;ve been over my mom or sister&#x27;s house and used theirs, I realize just how wonderful my hair dryer is.</li>
            <li>and it is totally awesome.</li>
            <li>Probably the best hairdryer we&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>It was not even close to as wonderful as this Infiniti by Conair Nano Silver Tourmaline Ceramic Styler.  </li>
            <li>This is the best drier ever!</li>
            <li>The heat settings and air settings are what make it so incredible.</li>
            <li>This dryer still works incredibly well.  </li>
            <li>VERY SATISFIED and would recommend!</li>
            <li>This is a great hairdryer for the price.</li>
            <li>Ive had this dryer for 4 yrs and still works great...</li>
            <li>I tried this hair dryer in a rented condo, and it was so great.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Hot\\&quot; setting was great for melting the candle wax I spilled on my carpet, though.</li>
            <li>so I was washing the night before, but that wasn&#x27;t a great solution.  </li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>I wanted to buy a good dryer under $35.00, and all reviews pointed that a Conair dryer is a great choice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use any of the attachments it comes with but seems like a good buy.</li>
            <li>Also, although this is a fairly lightweight dryer, the handle is too slim which offsets balance.</li>
            <li>what good is</li>
            <li>Ive owned this for id say a good 2-3 years.</li>
            <li>For now though I like the dryer fairly well.  </li>
            <li>I bought two of these at once because I thought it  was so good</li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Am I ever glad he did!  </li>
            <li>Theres so many options, and accessories!</li>
            <li>Love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li>Worth the price and very good quality.</li>
            <li>I bought mine at TJ Maxx for $29.99, not expecting it to be as amazing as it is</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is amazing.  </li>
            <li>That is astounding for my hair.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s nice looking and works well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a great-performing hairdryer at a nice price.</li>
            <li>nice range of speeds&lt;</li>
            <li>nice range of heats.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A retractable cord would also be nice.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love!!</li>
            <li>full heat within 3-5seconds at most&lt;br /&gt;+Results are always very nice-</li>
            <li>I also love the look of the dryer and how amazingly lightweight it is.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s fine (not thin), and the diffuser is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>always very smooth</li>
            <li>All in all, I am satisfied with this one, but I think Conair 213X might have been a better choice.</li>
            <li>But now after using it, I realize I should have started using a better blowdryer like this years ago.</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair looking healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>I love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>My hair has never been so healthy.</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have frizzy hair anymore.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s magical...</li>
            <li>it works better than any diffuser I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Favorite.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>My wife and I both love this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>I decided I need to find a dryer that had ions and ceramic because I&#x27;d heard they were better with frizz and</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>For too many years to count, I&#x27;ve always preferred Conair dryers because I got plenty of power and heat for the price.</li>
            <li>, I know I should clean it more often!).  </li>
            <li>I loved it at first.  </li>
            <li>I remember I loved that dryer when I first got it</li>
            <li>love it great product, great price, brought the first one a year ago, this is second time brought it from amazon.com.</li>
            <li>filter is effective and easy to clean out (Q-tip is easiest do to the grooves before the</li>
            <li>(1) Fair price, considering its function   (2) Don&#x27;t expect too much from the accessories that come along with the dryer  </li>
            <li>loved it so much I had to find another one on Amazon .</li>
            <li>i just ran some electrical tape the full circumference on the inside of the comb attachment and voila!</li>
            <li>Dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>but overall I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying a Remington with a similar diffuser and it works great.</li>
            <li>This does the job fast and effectively.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to use cheap hotel hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>The volumizer fits on nice, and has an option for how much heat comes through the volumizer.</li>
            <li>I also have a frizziness problem and this drier made my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>The cool shot button doesn&#x27;t feel easy to reach, either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll hear a clinking noise from the inside and then smell that familiar burning smell.</li>
            <li>I could change the stars on my original review</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very pleased with the performance so far.  </li>
            <li>Thought this would be a great time to review a product after using it for so long.  </li>
            <li>I clean the lint trap, treat it with care, don&#x27;t leave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d knock it down to 1 star because honestly, even if it&#x27;s the best dryer on the planet if it only lasts 7 months to a year</li>
            <li>There are many ways to set heat and cooling and the technology is great for no static hair when you are done.</li>
            <li>I love the comb attachment; it helps so much.  </li>
            <li>It has cool/warm/hot heat + low/high speed + cool shot functions:</li>
            <li>(c) \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button helps when you are drying your hair</li>
            <li>On the plus side, this one looks really cool and space age.  </li>
            <li>They offered me the option of reimbursement or replacement and since I love this blow dryer so much, I went with a replacement.</li>
            <li>My hair always looks very shiny and healthy when I use this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It is my absolute favorite hair dryer.</li>
            <li>the *cool* button that makes it just blow air is BUTTON and not a toggle switch-</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most amazing single product that I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li>This is a great hair dryer, however, I purchased this hair dryer over the other conair infiniti dryers because of the comb attachment feature...</li>
            <li>Other than that, the dryer is great.</li>
            <li>That one died within 3 months, so I contacted Amazon and they were super helpful.</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it better would be a folding handle to make it more portable, because now I travel with it</li>
            <li>I am fair with fine, curly hair that gets frizzy looking in the back if I don&#x27;t really style it.  </li>
            <li>Gets very hot</li>
            <li>It dries my hair fast and this is the first time that I&#x27;ve used a dryer and my hair ended up sliky smooth and not a ball of frizz!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so hot you&#x27;ll burn yourself!</li>
            <li>no yellowing, beautiful and strangely still looks new.  </li>
            <li>(My preschoolers enjoy testing the dryer with me to see which large play balls it can roll across the room, it&#x27;s THAT</li>
            <li>This dryer generates a VERY strong blast of air - enough to add some nice volume at the roots and dry my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li>I totally recommend it best hair dryer if you are looking for silky smooth  hair with little frizz.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of success with the accessories, but my hair is tricky</li>
            <li>I use it maybe twice a week and have enjoyed it so far.</li>
            <li>but i rarely use that feature anyway</li>
            <li>I had even tried a lower-end Chi and returned it to be replaced by this Conair because it had far more power and heat.</li>
            <li>I am more of a low-maintenance, low-cost beauty type of girl, and I can think of lots of other better uses for my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the $40 Conair Infiniti.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve used other ceramic dryers, but none make my hair look as good as this one does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this dryer with the provided diffuser attachment the other morning before work and got fairly good results.  </li>
            <li>I waited for the right price and ordered it.  </li>
            <li>The hot setting is hot!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s best to let the curls partially air dry.  </li>
            <li>I use it full blast on medium heat mostly, sometimes on low air and hot for my stubborn cowlicks.</li>
            <li>It dries my hair fast and gets very hot.</li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable for the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li>Great quality product, nice features, good flow of air, not too much and not to little, switching to this dryer actually decreased my hair drying time to about 4 minutes (I have long, fine hair).  </li>
            <li>(3) Light weight and professional look  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty practical person who tends to hold on to things till they die.</li>
            <li>my first one goes....</li>
            <li>And it isn&#x27;t quieter, just higher pitched.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I love this dryer.</li>
            <li>UNLIKE MOST WHITE PRODUCTS-</li>
            <li>That setting is so hot that I couldn&#x27;t hold the paper towel on the wax, the hot setting literally burned my hand.</li>
            <li>Conair&#x27;s cheaper models used to work better and last longer than this piece of junk.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t ever see why anyone would want to use the High heat setting on their hair/skin - perhaps as a quick clothes dryer if you are handwashing pantyhose in a hotel or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Honestly, I picked this one up recently at Target while on my lunch hour, and I bought it mainly because I needed a new one and thought this one looked very pretty.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s nice that the dryer has multiple settings, but the only one I ever use is Low Heat/High airflow - with my finger on the Cool Shot button most of the time, and that dries my hair in no time at all.</li>
            <li>It does a nice job drying and is lighter than my previous Conair Pro dryer.  </li>
            <li>quiet for a hair dryer - no frizz - no fuss - lightweight - easy to handle - would buy it again and recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li>There was more frizz than if I had let it air dry (after using gel and deva curl</li>
            <li>The hot setting did get extremely hot (be careful), so I tend to stick mostly with the lower heat on a high setting and it does the job.</li>
            <li>which was good enough;  my scalp area was mostly dry</li>
            <li>I have healthy, straight hair which I dry with a hairdyer almost every day, so it was important for me to find a good hairdryer that doesn&#x27;t make my hair look dry and dull (like my old cheap Revlon).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame because they works so wonderfully with my hair, but there&#x27;s no way that a hair dryer that&#x27;s used less than 10 minutes a day should only last a couple of months.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it feels as hot as my older dryer</li>
            <li>very high material quality)&lt;br /&gt;Way</li>
            <li>The switch is easy compared to some of the flat ones.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about hairdryers, and didn&#x27;t do any research on them.</li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money - there is NO way I would consider spending $200 on a hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I find my hair much silkier and smoother using it.</li>
            <li>i dont wanna write that much.</li>
            <li>but the unit was still recieving power indicated by the ion indicator light on the back which leads me to believe</li>
            <li>Very lightweight to hold, fits well in the hand with ease of access to controls.  </li>
            <li>Plus it&#x27;s all white, so it looks nice and matches the bathroom and who doesn&#x27;t like the cute blue LED light when it&#x27;s running (never dry your hair in the dark).</li>
            <li>this was just a wire coming loose, but sadly im not quite handy enough to fix it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a replacement since it&#x27;s been nearly 6 years and surely, it will die eventually.</li>
            <li>The first two that I had died after a little more than a year of use.</li>
            <li>(I only clean it about once a year</li>
            <li>It handles a serious blowdry every day and the buttons are in a good spot</li>
            <li>a bit too hot (b) high speed is really loud!</li>
            <li>The dryer is still true white in finish -</li>
            <li>It dries more quickly than my last one - which was a cheaper Conair Ionic dryer that conked out on me after about a year and a half.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;i could not be more in love with a blow dryer without it being illegal in some states.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price was also better than any of the local big box stores in my area.</li>
            <li>i recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this hair dryer, and if it ever breaks, I am buying another one.</li>
            <li>It makes this high pitch tone which irritate my ears.</li>
            <li>Dries hair so fast and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>There is a warranty, but it wasn&#x27;t worth paying the shipping and handling to try and get another one that would probably only work for about 6 months.</li>
            <li>and you get too hot  (5) Quiet, but not so much (</li>
            <li>If you are considering a cheaper model, let me tell you that this is worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>(a) cool is not really cool, and hot is</li>
            <li>set it free before drying), but not as much as other dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re using \\&quot;high\\&quot; speed, it gets really loud!)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed several reviewers said hot wasn&#x27;t hot enough</li>
            <li>After my first one died (it lasted about 3 years), I purchased a second one.</li>
            <li>/&gt; after my first had FINALLY died after 3 years of use&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li>Another thing I love is that it&#x27;s small and lightweight.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the low setting on this medium setting on this unit surpasses the max of most products and i like the option to have less and more.&lt;br /&gt;hope</li>
            <li>Definitely gets my hair straight in a shorter period of time compared to my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li>My old Elchim dryer worked way faster than this one and frankly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a lightweight, quiet and fast hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it nearly every day for nearly 6 years and must once again say, I fear the day it dies.</li>
            <li>I have a friend who has this hair dryer, and I knew when my old one bit the dust that this was the one I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I never imagined there could be a hair dryer that would make my hair soft and shiny instead of damaging it.  </li>
            <li>and I still have it and use it (thats 5 years old).</li>
            <li>My hair was very frizzed, and my hair is very short!</li>
            <li>- just don&#x27;t get your hand near it</li>
            <li>Other than that one little flaw though, this dryer is amazing</li>
            <li>Make sure to clean out the vent area as it gets dirty from pulling air and dust through</li>
            <li>This my second one (i owned my first for several years).</li>
            <li>It has a low and high setting.</li>
            <li>i just put it to high speed and low heat</li>
            <li>This dryer doesn&#x27;t dry so fast as my old conair dryer did</li>
            <li>I plan to order a few more, just in case it breaks, particularly as I noticed that the price just dropped by half.  </li>
            <li>and I hope it will last me just as long as my first one.</li>
            <li>Several times,  I noticed that the heat setting had changed from high to low when I inadvertently flipped the switch while using the dryer.</li>
            <li>Some reviews in other places have mentioned trouble keeping this attachment on - see the photo I&#x27;ve uploaded for an easy solution to this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 2 year old Conair ionic hairdryer died recently, so I looked around at reviews on the net before settling on this one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;+The chord is pretty  long and flexible (for those of us who stray from the bathroom with it)&lt;br /&gt;-only..somewhat not positive thing i could say is</li>
            <li>I wish I threw out my old hair dryer long ago!</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this one because it had an addition of a new technology called \\&quot;Nano Technology\\&quot; which the other two didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>I need a new hair dryer, and this one was recommended on other websites</li>
            <li>so be careful not to burn your hair on the high setting by holding it too close for too long,</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> Great dryer: the cord can spin in the body of the handle, so it never twists or tangles!</li>

            <li> I deserve this wonderful dryer.  </li>

            <li> Anytime I&#x27;ve been over my mom or sister&#x27;s house and used theirs, I realize just how wonderful my hair dryer is.</li>
            <li> and it is totally awesome.</li>
            <li> Probably the best hairdryer we&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> It was not even close to as wonderful as this Infiniti by Conair Nano Silver Tourmaline Ceramic Styler.  </li>
            <li> This is the best drier ever!</li>
            <li> The heat settings and air settings are what make it so incredible.</li>
            <li> This dryer still works incredibly well.  </li>
            <li> VERY SATISFIED and would recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a great hairdryer for the price.</li>
            <li> Ive had this dryer for 4 yrs and still works great...</li>
            <li> I tried this hair dryer in a rented condo, and it was so great.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Hot\\&quot; setting was great for melting the candle wax I spilled on my carpet, though.</li>
            <li> so I was washing the night before, but that wasn&#x27;t a great solution.  </li>
            <li> Love it!!</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy a good dryer under $35.00, and all reviews pointed that a Conair dryer is a great choice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use any of the attachments it comes with but seems like a good buy.</li>
            <li> Also, although this is a fairly lightweight dryer, the handle is too slim which offsets balance.</li>
            <li> what good is</li>
            <li> Ive owned this for id say a good 2-3 years.</li>
            <li> For now though I like the dryer fairly well.  </li>
            <li> I bought two of these at once because I thought it  was so good</li>
            <li> and I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Am I ever glad he did!  </li>
            <li> Theres so many options, and accessories!</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Worth the price and very good quality.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at TJ Maxx for $29.99, not expecting it to be as amazing as it is</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is amazing.  </li>
            <li> That is astounding for my hair.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s nice looking and works well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a great-performing hairdryer at a nice price.</li>
            <li> nice range of speeds&lt;</li>
            <li> nice range of heats.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A retractable cord would also be nice.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love!!</li>
            <li> full heat within 3-5seconds at most&lt;br /&gt;+Results are always very nice-</li>
            <li> I also love the look of the dryer and how amazingly lightweight it is.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s fine (not thin), and the diffuser is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> always very smooth</li>
            <li> All in all, I am satisfied with this one, but I think Conair 213X might have been a better choice.</li>
            <li> But now after using it, I realize I should have started using a better blowdryer like this years ago.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair looking healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair has never been so healthy.</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have frizzy hair anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s magical...</li>
            <li> it works better than any diffuser I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Favorite.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> My wife and I both love this hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> I decided I need to find a dryer that had ions and ceramic because I&#x27;d heard they were better with frizz and</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> For too many years to count, I&#x27;ve always preferred Conair dryers because I got plenty of power and heat for the price.</li>
            <li> , I know I should clean it more often!).  </li>
            <li> I loved it at first.  </li>
            <li> I remember I loved that dryer when I first got it</li>
            <li> love it great product, great price, brought the first one a year ago, this is second time brought it from amazon.com.</li>
            <li> filter is effective and easy to clean out (Q-tip is easiest do to the grooves before the</li>
            <li> (1) Fair price, considering its function   (2) Don&#x27;t expect too much from the accessories that come along with the dryer  </li>
            <li> loved it so much I had to find another one on Amazon .</li>
            <li> i just ran some electrical tape the full circumference on the inside of the comb attachment and voila!</li>
            <li> Dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> but overall I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying a Remington with a similar diffuser and it works great.</li>
            <li> This does the job fast and effectively.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to use cheap hotel hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> The volumizer fits on nice, and has an option for how much heat comes through the volumizer.</li>
            <li> I also have a frizziness problem and this drier made my hair smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> The cool shot button doesn&#x27;t feel easy to reach, either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll hear a clinking noise from the inside and then smell that familiar burning smell.</li>
            <li> I could change the stars on my original review</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very pleased with the performance so far.  </li>
            <li> Thought this would be a great time to review a product after using it for so long.  </li>
            <li> I clean the lint trap, treat it with care, don&#x27;t leave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d knock it down to 1 star because honestly, even if it&#x27;s the best dryer on the planet if it only lasts 7 months to a year</li>
            <li> There are many ways to set heat and cooling and the technology is great for no static hair when you are done.</li>
            <li> I love the comb attachment; it helps so much.  </li>
            <li> It has cool/warm/hot heat + low/high speed + cool shot functions:</li>
            <li> (c) \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button helps when you are drying your hair</li>
            <li> On the plus side, this one looks really cool and space age.  </li>
            <li> They offered me the option of reimbursement or replacement and since I love this blow dryer so much, I went with a replacement.</li>
            <li> My hair always looks very shiny and healthy when I use this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It is my absolute favorite hair dryer.</li>
            <li> the *cool* button that makes it just blow air is BUTTON and not a toggle switch-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most amazing single product that I have ever bought.  </li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer, however, I purchased this hair dryer over the other conair infiniti dryers because of the comb attachment feature...</li>
            <li> Other than that, the dryer is great.</li>
            <li> That one died within 3 months, so I contacted Amazon and they were super helpful.</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make it better would be a folding handle to make it more portable, because now I travel with it</li>
            <li> I am fair with fine, curly hair that gets frizzy looking in the back if I don&#x27;t really style it.  </li>
            <li> Gets very hot</li>
            <li> It dries my hair fast and this is the first time that I&#x27;ve used a dryer and my hair ended up sliky smooth and not a ball of frizz!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so hot you&#x27;ll burn yourself!</li>
            <li> no yellowing, beautiful and strangely still looks new.  </li>
            <li> (My preschoolers enjoy testing the dryer with me to see which large play balls it can roll across the room, it&#x27;s THAT</li>
            <li> This dryer generates a VERY strong blast of air - enough to add some nice volume at the roots and dry my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> I totally recommend it best hair dryer if you are looking for silky smooth  hair with little frizz.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of success with the accessories, but my hair is tricky</li>
            <li> I use it maybe twice a week and have enjoyed it so far.</li>
            <li> but i rarely use that feature anyway</li>
            <li> I had even tried a lower-end Chi and returned it to be replaced by this Conair because it had far more power and heat.</li>
            <li> I am more of a low-maintenance, low-cost beauty type of girl, and I can think of lots of other better uses for my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the $40 Conair Infiniti.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve used other ceramic dryers, but none make my hair look as good as this one does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this dryer with the provided diffuser attachment the other morning before work and got fairly good results.  </li>
            <li> I waited for the right price and ordered it.  </li>
            <li> The hot setting is hot!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s best to let the curls partially air dry.  </li>
            <li> I use it full blast on medium heat mostly, sometimes on low air and hot for my stubborn cowlicks.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair fast and gets very hot.</li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable for the quality of the product.  </li>
            <li> Great quality product, nice features, good flow of air, not too much and not to little, switching to this dryer actually decreased my hair drying time to about 4 minutes (I have long, fine hair).  </li>
            <li> (3) Light weight and professional look  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty practical person who tends to hold on to things till they die.</li>
            <li> my first one goes....</li>
            <li> And it isn&#x27;t quieter, just higher pitched.  </li>
            <li> It is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> UNLIKE MOST WHITE PRODUCTS-</li>
            <li> That setting is so hot that I couldn&#x27;t hold the paper towel on the wax, the hot setting literally burned my hand.</li>
            <li> Conair&#x27;s cheaper models used to work better and last longer than this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t ever see why anyone would want to use the High heat setting on their hair/skin - perhaps as a quick clothes dryer if you are handwashing pantyhose in a hotel or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Honestly, I picked this one up recently at Target while on my lunch hour, and I bought it mainly because I needed a new one and thought this one looked very pretty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that the dryer has multiple settings, but the only one I ever use is Low Heat/High airflow - with my finger on the Cool Shot button most of the time, and that dries my hair in no time at all.</li>
            <li> It does a nice job drying and is lighter than my previous Conair Pro dryer.  </li>
            <li> quiet for a hair dryer - no frizz - no fuss - lightweight - easy to handle - would buy it again and recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> There was more frizz than if I had let it air dry (after using gel and deva curl</li>
            <li> The hot setting did get extremely hot (be careful), so I tend to stick mostly with the lower heat on a high setting and it does the job.</li>
            <li> which was good enough;  my scalp area was mostly dry</li>
            <li> I have healthy, straight hair which I dry with a hairdyer almost every day, so it was important for me to find a good hairdryer that doesn&#x27;t make my hair look dry and dull (like my old cheap Revlon).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame because they works so wonderfully with my hair, but there&#x27;s no way that a hair dryer that&#x27;s used less than 10 minutes a day should only last a couple of months.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it feels as hot as my older dryer</li>
            <li> very high material quality)&lt;br /&gt;Way</li>
            <li> The switch is easy compared to some of the flat ones.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about hairdryers, and didn&#x27;t do any research on them.</li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money - there is NO way I would consider spending $200 on a hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I find my hair much silkier and smoother using it.</li>
            <li> i dont wanna write that much.</li>
            <li> but the unit was still recieving power indicated by the ion indicator light on the back which leads me to believe</li>
            <li> Very lightweight to hold, fits well in the hand with ease of access to controls.  </li>
            <li> Plus it&#x27;s all white, so it looks nice and matches the bathroom and who doesn&#x27;t like the cute blue LED light when it&#x27;s running (never dry your hair in the dark).</li>
            <li> this was just a wire coming loose, but sadly im not quite handy enough to fix it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a replacement since it&#x27;s been nearly 6 years and surely, it will die eventually.</li>
            <li> The first two that I had died after a little more than a year of use.</li>
            <li> (I only clean it about once a year</li>
            <li> It handles a serious blowdry every day and the buttons are in a good spot</li>
            <li> a bit too hot (b) high speed is really loud!</li>
            <li> The dryer is still true white in finish -</li>
            <li> It dries more quickly than my last one - which was a cheaper Conair Ionic dryer that conked out on me after about a year and a half.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i could not be more in love with a blow dryer without it being illegal in some states.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price was also better than any of the local big box stores in my area.</li>
            <li> i recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this hair dryer, and if it ever breaks, I am buying another one.</li>
            <li> It makes this high pitch tone which irritate my ears.</li>
            <li> Dries hair so fast and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> There is a warranty, but it wasn&#x27;t worth paying the shipping and handling to try and get another one that would probably only work for about 6 months.</li>
            <li> and you get too hot  (5) Quiet, but not so much (</li>
            <li> If you are considering a cheaper model, let me tell you that this is worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li> (a) cool is not really cool, and hot is</li>
            <li> set it free before drying), but not as much as other dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re using \\&quot;high\\&quot; speed, it gets really loud!)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed several reviewers said hot wasn&#x27;t hot enough</li>
            <li> After my first one died (it lasted about 3 years), I purchased a second one.</li>
            <li> /&gt; after my first had FINALLY died after 3 years of use&lt;br /&gt;Ive</li>
            <li> Another thing I love is that it&#x27;s small and lightweight.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the low setting on this medium setting on this unit surpasses the max of most products and i like the option to have less and more.&lt;br /&gt;hope</li>
            <li> Definitely gets my hair straight in a shorter period of time compared to my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My old Elchim dryer worked way faster than this one and frankly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a lightweight, quiet and fast hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it nearly every day for nearly 6 years and must once again say, I fear the day it dies.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who has this hair dryer, and I knew when my old one bit the dust that this was the one I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I never imagined there could be a hair dryer that would make my hair soft and shiny instead of damaging it.  </li>
            <li> and I still have it and use it (thats 5 years old).</li>
            <li> My hair was very frizzed, and my hair is very short!</li>
            <li> - just don&#x27;t get your hand near it</li>
            <li> Other than that one little flaw though, this dryer is amazing</li>
            <li> Make sure to clean out the vent area as it gets dirty from pulling air and dust through</li>
            <li> This my second one (i owned my first for several years).</li>
            <li> It has a low and high setting.</li>
            <li> i just put it to high speed and low heat</li>
            <li> This dryer doesn&#x27;t dry so fast as my old conair dryer did</li>
            <li> I plan to order a few more, just in case it breaks, particularly as I noticed that the price just dropped by half.  </li>
            <li> and I hope it will last me just as long as my first one.</li>
            <li> Several times,  I noticed that the heat setting had changed from high to low when I inadvertently flipped the switch while using the dryer.</li>
            <li> Some reviews in other places have mentioned trouble keeping this attachment on - see the photo I&#x27;ve uploaded for an easy solution to this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 2 year old Conair ionic hairdryer died recently, so I looked around at reviews on the net before settling on this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;+The chord is pretty  long and flexible (for those of us who stray from the bathroom with it)&lt;br /&gt;-only..somewhat not positive thing i could say is</li>
            <li> I wish I threw out my old hair dryer long ago!</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this one because it had an addition of a new technology called \\&quot;Nano Technology\\&quot; which the other two didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> I need a new hair dryer, and this one was recommended on other websites</li>
            <li> so be careful not to burn your hair on the high setting by holding it too close for too long,</li>
            <li> , it dries my thick hair fairly quickly and it is not extremely loud.</li>
            <li> , withstood HEAVY use and dropping frequently (still not  a single crack or scratch.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick, long blonde hair.  </li>
            <li> Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black]]</li>
            <li> The time to dry your hair doesn&#x27;t get short</li>
            <li> (I used a $11.00 hair dryer before this one, and the time I spend to dry my hair is the same)  </li>
            <li> Even with the divafuser on it left my hair SO frizzy and took forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> (gel applied before towel) and the drying time of 6 min left my hair somewhere between 60-70% dry-</li>
            <li> The blasting of the air literally killed the competition in my old Revlon.</li>
            <li> It lasted a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Seeing as replacements of this exact hair dryer are practically extinct, I will just need to keep my fingers crossed that it keeps lasting!</li>
            <li> Strongly recommended for people with curly, thick hair that tends to look dull after being blown out.</li>
            <li> After going through six of these dryers with the last two lasting less than four months, I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I have long dense hair that takes quite awhile to dry.  </li>
            <li> Other dryers have left my hair still dripping after 5-6 min of drying time</li>
            <li> The tourmaline allows your hair to dry faster, but doesn&#x27;t do damage with the heat.</li>
            <li> ive used this on Speed-High~Heat-High every single day for 10-15 minutes a day myself &#x3D;</li>
            <li> The hairdryer is white (not hot pink, teak, purple or any of the other standard ugly colors of many dryers).</li>
            <li> Not only that, but the air felt less harsh--if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s less damaging to hair over time, but in the short run, it isn&#x27;t an improvement.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick, coarse hair which normally takes about 20 minutes to dry, but this baby had my hair dry in less than 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> then about 3 times a week since then due to a change in my hairstyle and the discovery of dry shampoo.  </li>
            <li> especially how my thick wavy frizzt hairs actually looks like i spent a ton of time taming it, when in fact i did not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it a few times</li>
            <li> Not sure of the other comments on not lasting long, I have been using mine for over 2 years and have just bought another when I found it on sale, just to have another incase</li>
            <li> , I got it half price at an outlet store, and it&#x27;s TERRIFIC at melting and lifting up dried wax</li>
            <li> And, it makes my hair smoother, as some of the other reviewers noted...</li>
            <li> My hair is now softer and silkier after drying, which I have never had happen with any other blowdryer, ever.</li>
            <li> it had a medium, but other than that</li>
            <li> not including other family members&#x3D;</li>
            <li> used plenty of other blowdryers and none seem to come quite as close,&lt;br</li>
            <li> On work days I can&#x27;t go in and have wet hair for half the day</li>
            <li> My hair is Very thick and fairly long (almost half way down my back on the longest layers) and after plopping in a microfiber towel for 30min-1hour it will take an additional 3.5-5 hours to air dry.  </li>
            <li> This is my 3rd purchase of the dryer, daughter has really long, thick hair, so all dryers she uses take a beating, this one lasted the longest!</li>
            <li> Feels less damaging than other dryers I have used.  </li>
            <li> Wish my old dryer hadn&#x27;t broken.  </li>
            <li> Ionic dryers are supposed to be quieter than regular dryers and cut down your drying time as well as negatively charging your hair so it doesn&#x27;t look as frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Each one has stopped working within a year or less of purchase.</li>
            <li> I can spend less time on straightening.  </li>
            <li> It cuts my drying time in half and leaves my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair</li>
            <li> , my hair doesn&#x27;t look any less frizzy, it&#x27;s just harder to get the waves out because the air doesn&#x27;t come out as hard.  </li>
            <li> I got complements on my hair, with so little effort.  </li>
            <li> I had bought one a few years ago.</li>
            <li> and I dried for 6 minutes after leaving it in a towel for about 15</li>
            <li> butit does not fit with or without the adapter.  </li>
            <li> and I usually need at least 20 minutes to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> No more cheapie dryers for me.    </li>
            <li> Oh and cord can get really twisted even though it swivels, but that&#x27;s a small matter as the cord is nicely long.  </li>
            <li> Fans SLOWLY (over the course of about 4 minutes) started to slow down to a very forced hault</li>
            <li> have thick curly hair and straighten it every day.  </li>
            <li> &quot; so I&#x27;m not sure if it was age that made it go bad, or my hair being different</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a $20 Revlon hairdryer that I bought about seven years ago--and still actually works, but due to a nasty burning smell, I gather it&#x27;s slowly dying.</li>
            <li> and it had just broken about on the 3 year mark</li>
            <li> Sorry, it sounds so trivial, but these features make this dryer</li>
            <li> My last two hairdryer cost from $35-50 and were terrible.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say i just ordered another)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have kept this dryer if the on/off settings weren&#x27;t so inconveniently located.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really frustrated since the diffuser that comes with</li>
            <li> These beasts keep dying on me, and I keep buying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it, but buyer beware: It will probably crap out on you after a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i hate</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This was the 3rd blow dryer of this style that I have bought.  I loved it at first.  Each one has stopped working within a year or less of purchase. There is a warranty, but it wasn&#x27;t worth paying the shipping and handling to try and get another one that would probably only work for about 6 months.</li>
            <li> Great dryer: the cord can spin in the body of the handle, so it never twists or tangles! Plus it&#x27;s all white, so it looks nice and matches the bathroom and who doesn&#x27;t like the cute blue LED light when it&#x27;s running (never dry your hair in the dark). Sorry, it sounds so trivial, but these features make this dryer the best I have owned.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick, long blonde hair.  This hair dryer is great!  My hair is definitely shinier and smoother, and I don&#x27;t put product in it.  I got complements on my hair, with so little effort.  I love the comb attachment; it helps so much.  I wish I threw out my old hair dryer long ago!</li>
            <li> i just ran some electrical tape the full circumference on the inside of the comb attachment and voila! stays on now. everything else about this dryer i adore. especially how my thick wavy frizzt hairs actually looks like i spent a ton of time taming it, when in fact i did not. and it&#x27;s quiet-bonus for my husband that sleeps later than i do.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy a good dryer under $35.00, and all reviews pointed that a Conair dryer is a great choice. Before purchasing this hair dryer, I also researched and compared the following dryers: [[ASIN:B000E8O8UQ Conair 213X Infiniti Professional Tourmaline Ceramic Technology Ionic Styler, Black]] and [[ASIN:B000R80ZTQ Infiniti by Conair 223F Cord Reel Dryer]]. I decided to buy this one because it had an addition of a new technology called \\&quot;Nano Technology\\&quot; which the other two didn&#x27;t have. Here is all you need to know about this dryer:  (1) Fair price, considering its function   (2) Don&#x27;t expect too much from the accessories that come along with the dryer  (3) Light weight and professional look  (4) It has cool/warm/hot heat + low/high speed + cool shot functions: (a) cool is not really cool, and hot is a bit too hot (b) high speed is really loud! (c) \\&quot;cool shot\\&quot; button helps when you are drying your hair and you get too hot  (5) Quiet, but not so much (if you&#x27;re using \\&quot;high\\&quot; speed, it gets really loud!)  (6) The time to dry your hair doesn&#x27;t get short (I used a $11.00 hair dryer before this one, and the time I spend to dry my hair is the same)  (7) My hair looks the same, not shinier or smoother as advertised   All in all, I am satisfied with this one, but I think Conair 213X might have been a better choice.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the nicest hairdryer I have ever owned.  I would never have paid $40 for a hairdryer, but my husband bought this for me as a birthday gift.  Am I ever glad he did!  I deserve this wonderful dryer.  It dries more quickly than my last one - which was a cheaper Conair Ionic dryer that conked out on me after about a year and a half.  And, it makes my hair smoother, as some of the other reviewers noted...I can spend less time on straightening.  If you are considering a cheaper model, let me tell you that this is worth the extra money.  This is one instance where you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty practical person who tends to hold on to things till they die. I&#x27;ve had a $20 Revlon hairdryer that I bought about seven years ago--and still actually works, but due to a nasty burning smell, I gather it&#x27;s slowly dying. I don&#x27;t know much about hairdryers, and didn&#x27;t do any research on them. Honestly, I picked this one up recently at Target while on my lunch hour, and I bought it mainly because I needed a new one and thought this one looked very pretty. But now after using it, I realize I should have started using a better blowdryer like this years ago. The blasting of the air literally killed the competition in my old Revlon. I have very thick, coarse hair which normally takes about 20 minutes to dry, but this baby had my hair dry in less than 10 minutes. That is astounding for my hair. Not only that, but the air felt less harsh--if that makes sense. My hair is now softer and silkier after drying, which I have never had happen with any other blowdryer, ever. The hot setting did get extremely hot (be careful), so I tend to stick mostly with the lower heat on a high setting and it does the job. I did knock one star off because like others have mentioned, the pick attachment does like to fall off. Other than that one little flaw though, this dryer is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> love it great product, great price, brought the first one a year ago, this is second time brought it from amazon.com.</li>
            <li> I read about this dryer on a blog which compared it to a very-high end dryer.  I think it&#x27;s nice looking and works well.  I don&#x27;t think it feels as hot as my older dryer but overall I&#x27;m happy with it.  I don&#x27;t use any of the attachments it comes with but seems like a good buy.</li>
            <li> My 2 year old Conair ionic hairdryer died recently, so I looked around at reviews on the net before settling on this one. I have healthy, straight hair which I dry with a hairdyer almost every day, so it was important for me to find a good hairdryer that doesn&#x27;t make my hair look dry and dull (like my old cheap Revlon). I also didn&#x27;t want to spend too much money - there is NO way I would consider spending $200 on a hairdryer. I am more of a low-maintenance, low-cost beauty type of girl, and I can think of lots of other better uses for my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the $40 Conair Infiniti. This dryer generates a VERY strong blast of air - enough to add some nice volume at the roots and dry my hair very quickly. (My preschoolers enjoy testing the dryer with me to see which large play balls it can roll across the room, it&#x27;s THAT powerful).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nice that the dryer has multiple settings, but the only one I ever use is Low Heat/High airflow - with my finger on the Cool Shot button most of the time, and that dries my hair in no time at all. With any hairdryer, I&#x27;ve always stayed on the lowest setting to minimize heat damage to my hair. I can&#x27;t ever see why anyone would want to use the High heat setting on their hair/skin - perhaps as a quick clothes dryer if you are handwashing pantyhose in a hotel or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other positives: The hairdryer is white (not hot pink, teak, purple or any of the other standard ugly colors of many dryers). It comes with attachments, of which the only one I would ever use on occasion is the straightening pick/comb. Some reviews in other places have mentioned trouble keeping this attachment on - see the photo I&#x27;ve uploaded for an easy solution to this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great-performing hairdryer at a nice price. Keeps my hair looking healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has been the best hair dryer I have ever purchased. I had bought one a few years ago. It lasted a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I loved it so much I had to find another one on Amazon . You can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore. I totally recommend it best hair dryer if you are looking for silky smooth  hair with little frizz.  Works great! !!</li>
            <li> The dryer lives up to the advertising.  It does a nice job drying and is lighter than my previous Conair Pro dryer.  The location of the controls worked well for me.  The dryer feels very solid and well built.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer. My hair has never been so healthy. There are many ways to set heat and cooling and the technology is great for no static hair when you are done. Not sure of the other comments on not lasting long, I have been using mine for over 2 years and have just bought another when I found it on sale, just to have another incase my first one goes....</li>
            <li> UPDATE SEPT. 2008 -- This baby is dying, almost gone.  No power.  No more cheapie dryers for me.    Ionic dryers are supposed to be quieter than regular dryers and cut down your drying time as well as negatively charging your hair so it doesn&#x27;t look as frizzy.  My old Elchim dryer worked way faster than this one and frankly, my hair doesn&#x27;t look any less frizzy, it&#x27;s just harder to get the waves out because the air doesn&#x27;t come out as hard.  Maybe it&#x27;s less damaging to hair over time, but in the short run, it isn&#x27;t an improvement.  And it isn&#x27;t quieter, just higher pitched.  Wish my old dryer hadn&#x27;t broken.  On the plus side, this one looks really cool and space age.  If only my hair did!</li>
            <li> I would have kept this dryer if the on/off settings weren&#x27;t so inconveniently located. Several times,  I noticed that the heat setting had changed from high to low when I inadvertently flipped the switch while using the dryer. The cool shot button doesn&#x27;t feel easy to reach, either. I&#x27;ve noticed several reviewers said hot wasn&#x27;t hot enough -- maybe they flipped the heat setting switch without realizing they did. Also, although this is a fairly lightweight dryer, the handle is too slim which offsets balance. The swivel cord is an excellent idea.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this drier for about a month. I love that I don&#x27;t have frizzy hair anymore. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the attachments keep falling when drying and straightening. Great product for the money! Dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairdryer for the price. The tourmaline allows your hair to dry faster, but doesn&#x27;t do damage with the heat. I find my hair much silkier and smoother using it. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a lightweight, quiet and fast hairdryer.</li>
            <li> After my first one died (it lasted about 3 years), I purchased a second one. That one died within 3 months, so I contacted Amazon and they were super helpful. They offered me the option of reimbursement or replacement and since I love this blow dryer so much, I went with a replacement. The one they sent me is still doing what it should and I hope it will last me just as long as my first one. Strongly recommended for people with curly, thick hair that tends to look dull after being blown out. My hair always looks very shiny and healthy when I use this blow dryer. Love, love, love!!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has changed my life.  It&#x27;s the most amazing single product that I have ever bought.  I plan to order a few more, just in case it breaks, particularly as I noticed that the price just dropped by half.  My last two hairdryer cost from $35-50 and were terrible.  After using this hair dryer, I look like I just got back from the salon.  It&#x27;s magical...</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer!!!! Dries hair so fast and leaves my hair soft and shiny. Worth the price and very good quality.</li>
            <li> This dryer is wonderful. It cuts my drying time in half and leaves my hair shiny. The hot setting is hot! It has a low and high setting. WIsh it had a medium, but other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd purchase of the dryer, daughter has really long, thick hair, so all dryers she uses take a beating, this one lasted the longest!</li>
            <li> I need a new hair dryer, and this one was recommended on other websites so I thought I would try it. I have been using it for awhile now, and I like it a lot! I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it, it dries my thick hair fairly quickly and it is not extremely loud.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer, however, I purchased this hair dryer over the other conair infiniti dryers because of the comb attachment feature...well it didn&#x27;t matter because the comb attachment doesn&#x27;t stay on!!! I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking when they made the comb attachment. Did they not realize it does not hook to the dryer?? Other than that, the dryer is great. It dries my hair fast and this is the first time that I&#x27;ve used a dryer and my hair ended up sliky smooth and not a ball of frizz! I also love the look of the dryer and how amazingly lightweight it is.  Except for the comb attachment, I recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> I am on my third Conair 228 Nano Silver. I know... if it&#x27;s made so crappy that it dies once a year, why do I keep buying more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#x27;s awesome, that&#x27;s why. I have wavy/curly hair that&#x27;s fine (not thin), and the diffuser is the best I&#x27;ve ever used. And I&#x27;ve used other ceramic dryers, but none make my hair look as good as this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem? The first two that I had died after a little more than a year of use. One day I&#x27;ll be drying my hair and BAM! I&#x27;ll hear a clinking noise from the inside and then smell that familiar burning smell. And it&#x27;s toast. I clean the lint trap, treat it with care, don&#x27;t leave it plugged in, never drop it, etc. These beasts keep dying on me, and I keep buying them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it, but buyer beware: It will probably crap out on you after a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE July 2010: I bought my third dryer Jan. 10, 2010, and it died yesterday: July 17, 2010. Started smoking and smelling like fire, and the motor stopped working. This one didn&#x27;t even last a year. It&#x27;s really frustrated since the diffuser that comes with it works better than any diffuser I&#x27;ve ever had. I wish I could find a different dryer and stick the Nano&#x27;s diffuser on there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could change the stars on my original review I&#x27;d knock it down to 1 star because honestly, even if it&#x27;s the best dryer on the planet if it only lasts 7 months to a year what good is it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE SEPTEMBER 2011: After going through six of these dryers with the last two lasting less than four months, I&#x27;m done. It&#x27;s a shame because they works so wonderfully with my hair, but there&#x27;s no way that a hair dryer that&#x27;s used less than 10 minutes a day should only last a couple of months. I ended up buying a Remington with a similar diffuser and it works great.</li>
            <li> Favorite. I fear the day mine dies. I was cleaning out my closet and decided to open the box to this hair dryer that I&#x27;ve had for years.... The receipt reads November 2008!! It is my absolute favorite hair dryer. Anytime I&#x27;ve been over my mom or sister&#x27;s house and used theirs, I realize just how wonderful my hair dryer is. I&#x27;ve searched high and low for a replacement since it&#x27;s been nearly 6 years and surely, it will die eventually. Seeing as replacements of this exact hair dryer are practically extinct, I will just need to keep my fingers crossed that it keeps lasting! The heat settings and air settings are what make it so incredible. I use it full blast on medium heat mostly, sometimes on low air and hot for my stubborn cowlicks. I&#x27;ve used it nearly every day for nearly 6 years and must once again say, I fear the day it dies. Conair, please bring these hair dryers back!! I bought mine at TJ Maxx for $29.99, not expecting it to be as amazing as it is and here I am 6 years later praying it never breaks.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who has this hair dryer, and I knew when my old one bit the dust that this was the one I wanted.  I waited for the right price and ordered it.  It is exactly what I needed.  I have long dense hair that takes quite awhile to dry.  This does the job fast and effectively.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of success with the accessories, but my hair is tricky so I might have to keep playing with them.  Overall, I love this dryer.</li>
            <li> Ive had this dryer for 4 yrs and still works great...have thick curly hair and straighten it every day.  Looking to get another so i have a back up.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this. My friend bought the same one and I got this for a fraction of what she paid for. Love it!! Theres so many options, and accessories!</li>
            <li> so far so good. and i hate the rating rule coz i dont wanna write that much. i wont leave any feedback next time.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer! Definitely gets my hair straight in a shorter period of time compared to my old hair dryer. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair dyer for awhile now and it is totally awesome. It dries my hair fast and gets very hot. I use it maybe twice a week and have enjoyed it so far.</li>
            <li> Ive owned this for id say a good 2-3 years. (for people wondering about the durability- ive used this on Speed-High~Heat-High every single day for 10-15 minutes a day myself &#x3D;not including other family members&#x3D; and it had just broken about on the 3 year mark, withstood HEAVY use and dropping frequently (still not  a single crack or scratch. very high material quality)&lt;br /&gt;Way it died: Fans SLOWLY (over the course of about 4 minutes) started to slow down to a very forced hault but the unit was still recieving power indicated by the ion indicator light on the back which leads me to believe this was just a wire coming loose, but sadly im not quite handy enough to fix it. Needless to say i just ordered another)&lt;br /&gt;i could not be more in love with a blow dryer without it being illegal in some states.&lt;br /&gt;+very nice range of speeds&lt;br /&gt;+very nice range of heats.&lt;br /&gt;+very stable.&lt;br /&gt;+At full heat within 3-5seconds at most&lt;br /&gt;+Results are always very nice- no frizz and always very smooth&lt;br /&gt;+ UNLIKE MOST WHITE PRODUCTS- this does not attract dirt and grime. i had a white straighter that looked like hell after 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;i probably only cleaned this item out of boredom, not necessity.&lt;br /&gt;+dust filter is effective and easy to clean out (Q-tip is easiest do to the grooves before the mesh)&lt;br /&gt;+The chord is pretty  long and flexible (for those of us who stray from the bathroom with it)&lt;br /&gt;-only..somewhat not positive thing i could say is the *cool* button that makes it just blow air is BUTTON and not a toggle switch- but i rarely use that feature anyway i just put it to high speed and low heat cuz im lazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- i recommend this highly. If you hadnt guessed from me ordering a 2nd&lt;br /&gt; after my first had FINALLY died after 3 years of use&lt;br /&gt;Ive used plenty of other blowdryers and none seem to come quite as close,&lt;br /&gt;the low setting on this medium setting on this unit surpasses the max of most products and i like the option to have less and more.&lt;br /&gt;hope this helped someone decide!</li>
            <li> My wife and I both love this hairdryer.  Bought it on a whim but I&#x27;m very pleased with the performance so far.  Probably the best hairdryer we&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is amazing.  I never imagined there could be a hair dryer that would make my hair soft and shiny instead of damaging it.  I am fair with fine, curly hair that gets frizzy looking in the back if I don&#x27;t really style it.  I tried this hair dryer in a rented condo, and it was so great.  I was going to order on Amazon because I could not find it in stores, then decided to try a Revlon model which sounded very similar in description and technology.  It was not even close to as wonderful as this Infiniti by Conair Nano Silver Tourmaline Ceramic Styler.  The only thing that would make it better would be a folding handle to make it more portable, because now I travel with it so I don&#x27;t have to use cheap hotel hair dryers.  A retractable cord would also be nice.  The price was very reasonable for the quality of the product.  VERY SATISFIED and would recommend!</li>
            <li> This my second one (i owned my first for several years). It handles a serious blowdry every day and the buttons are in a good spot so i&#x27;m not constantly switching it off inadvertantly.</li>
            <li> So its a rainy day and I am writing reviews on things I bought.  I actually purchased this hair dryer in 2009 and I still have it and use it (thats 5 years old). Thought this would be a great time to review a product after using it for so long.  The dryer is still true white in finish - no yellowing, beautiful and strangely still looks new.  I used it 5 days a week for about 3 years, and then about 3 times a week since then due to a change in my hairstyle and the discovery of dry shampoo.  This dryer still works incredibly well.  Gets very hot so be careful not to burn your hair on the high setting by holding it too close for too long, keep it moving. Very lightweight to hold, fits well in the hand with ease of access to controls.  Make sure to clean out the vent area as it gets dirty from pulling air and dust through (I only clean it about once a year, I know I should clean it more often!).  Oh and cord can get really twisted even though it swivels, but that&#x27;s a small matter as the cord is nicely long.  Great quality product, nice features, good flow of air, not too much and not to little, switching to this dryer actually decreased my hair drying time to about 4 minutes (I have long, fine hair).  Feels less damaging than other dryers I have used.  I would highly recommend this hair dryer, and if it ever breaks, I am buying another one.</li>
            <li> quiet for a hair dryer - no frizz - no fuss - lightweight - easy to handle - would buy it again and recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> This dryer doesn&#x27;t dry so fast as my old conair dryer did and it isn&#x27;t quiet either.  It makes this high pitch tone which irritate my ears.</li>
            <li> This dryer is not what I thought it would be. The \\&quot;Hot\\&quot; setting was great for melting the candle wax I spilled on my carpet, though. That setting is so hot that I couldn&#x27;t hold the paper towel on the wax, the hot setting literally burned my hand. So you really only have two heat settings, but I can&#x27;t tell any difference. The volumizer fits on nice, and has an option for how much heat comes through the volumizer. The concentrator works well. However, if you need the pick attachment, don&#x27;t buy this one - it won&#x27;t stay on. My hair was very frizzed, and my hair is very short! I&#x27;m keeping it only because I don&#x27;t need the pick, I got it half price at an outlet store, and it&#x27;s TERRIFIC at melting and lifting up dried wax - just don&#x27;t get your hand near it, it&#x27;s so hot you&#x27;ll burn yourself! I&#x27;ve never written a feedback before, so I hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I have very long, thick hair and I usually need at least 20 minutes to dry my hair. But this drier did it in 6 minutes! I also have a frizziness problem and this drier made my hair smooth and silky. Another thing I love is that it&#x27;s small and lightweight. This is the best drier ever!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair, somewhere between 2c-3B (I have lots of different curl types on my head) I had a Revlon RV484 Pro Stylist 1875W 3 Heat / 2 Speed Silver Ionic Dryer for about 7 years.  It was cracked though and so the defuser attachment wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  I remember I loved that dryer when I first got it (it seemed to add curl to my hair) but that was before I switched to \\&quot;no-poo\\&quot; so I&#x27;m not sure if it was age that made it go bad, or my hair being different but I began to hate using it.  Even with the divafuser on it left my hair SO frizzy and took forever to dry.  I decided I need to find a dryer that had ions and ceramic because I&#x27;d heard they were better with frizz and some research on amazon brought me to the Infiniti.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so I am NOT speaking to longevity-I will try to update if I have a problem. For now though I like the dryer fairly well.  My hair is Very thick and fairly long (almost half way down my back on the longest layers) and after plopping in a microfiber towel for 30min-1hour it will take an additional 3.5-5 hours to air dry.  On work days I can&#x27;t go in and have wet hair for half the day so I was washing the night before, but that wasn&#x27;t a great solution.  I used this dryer with the provided diffuser attachment the other morning before work and got fairly good results.  I timed it and I dried for 6 minutes after leaving it in a towel for about 15 (gel applied before towel) and the drying time of 6 min left my hair somewhere between 60-70% dry-which was good enough;  my scalp area was mostly dry and it&#x27;s best to let the curls partially air dry.  Other dryers have left my hair still dripping after 5-6 min of drying time so this was a big improvement.  There was more frizz than if I had let it air dry (after using gel and deva curl set it free before drying), but not as much as other dryers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Curly girls PLEASE NOTE: this does NOT work with the devafuser.  I had read somewhere that it was compatible butit does not fit with or without the adapter.  The nozzle is too tapered so the adapter just slides off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*wife&#x27;s review on husbands account*</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair dryer.  I have one in my travel bag, motor home and beach condo.  I like the ease of switching from the heat variatons and air flow.  The switch is easy compared to some of the flat ones.</li>
            <li> For too many years to count, I&#x27;ve always preferred Conair dryers because I got plenty of power and heat for the price. I had even tried a lower-end Chi and returned it to be replaced by this Conair because it had far more power and heat. So if it died after three years (as it used to do), then two, then one, so what. I bought two of these at once because I thought it  was so good, I bought two before they changed the model. \\&quot;Was\\&quot; is the operative word. After about four or five months, one of them lost its heating ability. When the second one gives out, I&#x27;m shopping for a different brand. Conair&#x27;s cheaper models used to work better and last longer than this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works well for me and I am very satisfied.  The price was also better than any of the local big box stores in my area.</li>
