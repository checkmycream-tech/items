            <li>Love this product !!  </li>
            <li>I love all anastasia eyebrow products, she is the best in the business!</li>
            <li>In theory, the kit sounds like a good idea.</li>
            <li>The brow filler brush is of good quality as well.</li>
            <li>but I loved the results.</li>
            <li>loved the set.</li>
            <li>I would like to say this products is good for beginners</li>
            <li>the powder wasnt all the good for me...</li>
            <li>amazing my eyebrows look insanely good</li>
            <li>Great item to help you correct and keep your eyebrows in tip top shape.</li>
            <li>I LOVE MY KIT!</li>
            <li>Comfortable, beautiful.</li>
            <li>I love this products!</li>
            <li>The brow shadow goes on smooth without a lot of effort and the highlighting shadows bring out my eyes beautifully.</li>
            <li>I recommend your own brush.</li>
            <li>but then again; what good make up IS cheap?</li>
            <li>It was pretty over priced, but the kit is so handy and a great starter kit for those that are just learning about the art of filling in eyebrows.</li>
            <li>It also brings an eyebrow brush which lets you be very precise when applying product.</li>
            <li>Nothing more than a glorified stencil that you can buy anywhere.</li>
            <li>I also love the highlighting eye shadow it comes with.</li>
            <li>I just love this kit, I have the brunnette.</li>
            <li>I lighten my eyebrows in the summer when I go blonde, so the lighter brown in here is perfect.</li>
            <li>It also comes with the brow stencils with a break where the arch should be, which I think allows for a more percise look.</li>
            <li>I. LOVE.</li>
            <li>Mostly, I just like the petite eyebrow shape it comes with.</li>
            <li>I will buy this again. :)</li>
            <li>Definitely was happy with my eyebrows before this product, but figured I would try it because of the amazing reviews.</li>
            <li>No problems with shipping-came very quickly.</li>
            <li>The stencils seem to be made from a fabulous silicone-type of plastic and this makes them extremely easy to use, and almost fool-proof.  </li>
            <li>The highlighter also looks cheap on the skin.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day, and when I say all day, I have worn this for 14 hours straight and it has not moved!!!</li>
            <li>So easy to use and looks so natural !!!!</li>
            <li>Super.</li>
            <li>and I love the way this fills in so naturally.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews warned that it wasn&#x27;t worth the price</li>
            <li>I like the kits, and the stencils, but I do not think it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>great fast delivery, been using this for a year and half.</li>
            <li>Hi it was just what she wanted ty very very much Dave</li>
            <li>, i love thr brush i used it for my eyebrows and concealing tiny areas on my face....</li>
            <li>The stencil guides were very helpful!</li>
            <li>Love this product and the low cost.</li>
            <li>The templates in this kit are all too large for my face.  </li>
            <li>For under $10, I would have, but no way can they justify this costing so much.</li>
            <li>&quot; You DO not want to go out and be stared at because your brows are darker than you&#x27;re hair or because it looks like you straight up shaved your brows and drew them on...</li>
            <li>the eyebrow wax lays your eyebrows really well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more darker than I expected.</li>
            <li>Prior to buying it, the whole little kit seems like a good idea.</li>
            <li>I like my normal NYX cake powder that is much cheaper than this.</li>
            <li>I tweezed my eyebrows too short when I was a young girl - hideous mistake, let me tell you - and Anastasia&#x27;s Beauty Express allows me to extend my brows back to their normal (who am I kidding, better than normal!)</li>
            <li>Thankfully, Sephora FINALLY opened up over here in the stix, so I was able to get it a little bit cheaper.</li>
            <li>It comes with a complete set of what you should do with your eyebrows and how.</li>
            <li>shape and size in a completely natural-looking way.  </li>
            <li>It also comes with the brow wax, which is the same use of brow gel: main purpose is to keep the hairs and color in place.</li>
            <li>the only concern is the price which seems to be higher than other similar cheaper products in the market.</li>

            <li> I have been wanting this kit for a long time, so I finally broke down and bought it.</li>

            <li> Sorry, I really wanted to like this!</li>
            <li> We have been using this every day for the past month, and I can tell it will last for a while.</li>
            <li> Do not order this if you have a small face or are a petite individual.</li>
            <li> It is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> This set for a dark&#x27;s brunets.</li>
            <li> and I aint down with that.</li>
            <li> my Momma gave me was, \\&quot;Less is more.\\</li>
            <li> Yes, this product was a little pricy</li>
            <li> as you can see, it&#x27;s not cheap..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very difficult to get used to at first.</li>
            <li> Instructions are hard to read.  </li>
            <li> tsk tsk... NOT a good look on ANYONE.</li>
            <li> As a teenager it was &amp;#34;the thing&amp;#34; to have thin brows.</li>
            <li> This little kit is expensive!</li>
            <li> The brush is also very stiff, so it&#x27;s impossible for me to use.</li>
            <li> I like the petite eyebrow shape but the others look unrealistic unless you have tons of eyebrow hair to fill them.</li>
            <li> but I found this difficult to use and time consuming.</li>
            <li> Ill continue to use these stencils with that powder after the powder runs out of this one.</li>

            <li> Nothing more than a glorified stencil that you can buy anywhere. It is not worth the money. I was so excited about ordering this when I saw a demonstration on Dr. Oz, but was disappointed when I actually used it. Sorry, I really wanted to like this! For under $10, I would have, but no way can they justify this costing so much.</li>
            <li> Xmas gift for my SIL.  She loves it!</li>
            <li> the shape of the applicator brush is great! I also love the highlighting eye shadow it comes with. It has also lasted me over a year! Will definitely re order this brand if I ever run out!</li>
            <li> Definitely was happy with my eyebrows before this product, but figured I would try it because of the amazing reviews. And yes, I am SO happy with this product.. The powder, wax, and stencils are perfection.  The stencils seem to be made from a fabulous silicone-type of plastic and this makes them extremely easy to use, and almost fool-proof.  Thank you Anastasia!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Anastasia product that I have bought and did not like. I tried it out. Prior to buying it, the whole little kit seems like a good idea. I bought the kit, went home and tried it. In theory, the kit sounds like a good idea. But it didnt work out for me for a number of reasons. This little kit is expensive! I will be returning it tommorow. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I just love this kit, I have the brunnette. My daughter and I both use this. It has great stencils which you can personalize depending on what type or brow you have. It brings a wax, two eyebrow colors, and two highlites, one with shimmer and one matte. It also brings an eyebrow brush which lets you be very precise when applying product. Its a little short but no big deal. It lasts all day, and when I say all day, I have worn this for 14 hours straight and it has not moved!!! We have been using this every day for the past month, and I can tell it will last for a while. Would definitely buy when we are out!!!!</li>
            <li> Instructions are hard to read.  Cannot be read unless you has a lighted magnifying glass.  Would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love this product !!  I also over tweezed my eyebrows when I was growing up and I love the way this fills in so naturally.  I will be reordering again when this is used up !!!  So easy to use and looks so natural !!!!</li>
            <li> I only use anistasia prodcuts on my brows!</li>
            <li> I waited awhile before I bought this.. as you can see, it&#x27;s not cheap.. but then again; what good make up IS cheap? Nada. The kit is $39.50 at Sephora and they will help you use it, if you&#x27;re unsure how to do so. Thankfully, Sephora FINALLY opened up over here in the stix, so I was able to get it a little bit cheaper. Now, the kid it for brunettes and the colors are perfect.. I lighten my eyebrows in the summer when I go blonde, so the lighter brown in here is perfect. It also comes with the brow wax, which is the same use of brow gel: main purpose is to keep the hairs and color in place. It also comes with the brow stencils with a break where the arch should be, which I think allows for a more percise look. The stencils also have dotted lines so you can line up the three points to a brow: inner eye is where it should start, where your pupil is should line up with the arch, and the outside corner of the eye should be where the brow ends. The brow filler brush is of good quality as well. The only thing I didnt like about the kit, is the highlighter. The highlighter is to go on the brow bone and on the inside corner of your eye. The kits highlighter is powder.. and I aint down with that. I use a cream highlighter... Pixie is the brand, here is the link to the one I use: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LADIES, PLEASE REMEMBER: ** You&#x27;re FILLING in the brow for a fuller, defined and percise look. The NUMBER ONE make up tip my Momma gave me was, \\&quot;Less is more.\\&quot; You DO not want to go out and be stared at because your brows are darker than you&#x27;re hair or because it looks like you straight up shaved your brows and drew them on... tsk tsk... NOT a good look on ANYONE. A tip?: Load the brush with brow color ONCE for each brow... dont dip back for 2nds or 3rds!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review has been helpful! I LOVE MY KIT! After you buy the kit, all you will need for the future is the brow color, wax and highlighter (if you like).</li>
            <li> Yes, this product was a little pricy but I loved the results. I over plucked my eyebrows and I&#x27;m now trying to grow them out... This product has been a life saver!</li>
            <li> the only concern is the price which seems to be higher than other similar cheaper products in the market.</li>
            <li> I. LOVE. THIS. I would recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> This kit is a must have for people learning how to do their eyebrows! It comes with a complete set of what you should do with your eyebrows and how. I love all anastasia eyebrow products, she is the best in the business!</li>
            <li> loved the set. Comfortable, beautiful. An impressive package. Perfect make-up. Convenient to take on the road. Super. I will still order a set for gifts</li>
            <li> Great item and great price!!!</li>
            <li> Wish there was a darker color for the eyebrows. The wax is hard to apply because it barely goes onto your finger. I like the petite eyebrow shape but the others look unrealistic unless you have tons of eyebrow hair to fill them. The brush is also very stiff, so it&#x27;s impossible for me to use. I recommend your own brush. The highlighter also looks cheap on the skin. Mostly, I just like the petite eyebrow shape it comes with.</li>
            <li> This product, in combination with the dip brow pomade will give you perfect, flawless brows! Lasts a long time, as well. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Maybe my dexterity has diminished with age but I found this difficult to use and time consuming. Some of the reviews warned that it wasn&#x27;t worth the price and they were correct. Wish i&#x27;d listened to them. No problems with shipping-came very quickly. I didn&#x27;t bother to return it.</li>
            <li> My daughter gave me Beauty Express as a present, and I can truly say I&#x27;m thankful that she did!  I tweezed my eyebrows too short when I was a young girl - hideous mistake, let me tell you - and Anastasia&#x27;s Beauty Express allows me to extend my brows back to their normal (who am I kidding, better than normal!) shape and size in a completely natural-looking way.  This makeup doesn&#x27;t clump, doesn&#x27;t flake, and is just generally an excellent product.  I recommend Beauty Express 100%!</li>
            <li> I started out using this drawing my eyebrows on...I would like to say this products is good for beginners the eyebrow wax lays your eyebrows really well, i love thr brush i used it for my eyebrows and concealing tiny areas on my face....the powder wasnt all the good for me...I used the pink shimmer powder sometimes for a hihglighter under my brow area...</li>
            <li> I love this products! The wax works wonders. The brow shadow goes on smooth without a lot of effort and the highlighting shadows bring out my eyes beautifully. Thank you Anastasia!</li>
            <li> It was pretty over priced, but the kit is so handy and a great starter kit for those that are just learning about the art of filling in eyebrows. The stencil guides were very helpful! I use the brow highlighters as eyeshadows all the time.</li>
            <li> As a teenager it was &amp;#34;the thing&amp;#34; to have thin brows. Now, as an adult I struggle with filling in my thin brows (over plucking caused my brows to not fully grow back)...I have been wanting this kit for a long time, so I finally broke down and bought it. It&#x27;s very difficult to get used to at first. Holding stencils up to your face and keeping it still for you to fill in your brows can be a challenge, however after the 3 or 4th use It was simple and did not take very long. I like the kits, and the stencils, but I do not think it is worth the price. I like the stencils, but I will not purchase again. I like my normal NYX cake powder that is much cheaper than this. Ill continue to use these stencils with that powder after the powder runs out of this one.</li>
            <li> The templates in this kit are all too large for my face.  Do not order this if you have a small face or are a petite individual.</li>
            <li> great fast delivery, been using this for a year and half. amazing my eyebrows look insanely good</li>
            <li> Great item to help you correct and keep your eyebrows in tip top shape. Love this product and the low cost. I will buy this again. :)</li>
            <li> Hi it was just what she wanted ty very very much Dave</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more darker than I expected. This set for a dark&#x27;s brunets.</li>
