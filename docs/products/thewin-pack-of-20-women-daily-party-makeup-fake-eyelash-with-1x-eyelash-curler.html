            <li>very easy to apply!</li>

            <li>good  price and good product</li>

            <li>These lashes are quite nice.  </li>
            <li>But if you like any kind of lash than you would like these.</li>
            <li>They are so cheap and look very nice.</li>
            <li>very satisfied love them</li>
            <li>Perfect, lightweight, they look very natural.</li>
            <li>The lash band should make them very easy to apply to the eyes.</li>
            <li>Perfect to add just a bit of fullness to a natural look.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for natural light sets of lashes for a good deal these are perfect.</li>
            <li>Natural looking perfect length.</li>
            <li>These are beautiful at first glance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a good thing these were cheap,</li>
            <li>seeing that they were cheap but the quality of the lashes are good.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply too!</li>
            <li>wanted something more natural looking and these were perfect</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m loving them more and more every time I look in the mirror.</li>
            <li>so i was pretty happy with how these felt.</li>
            <li>And I think that by the time I&#x27;m very adept with them my own lashes will have grown in enough that with some favorite mascara, I&#x27;ll be good to go.  </li>
            <li>they are finely made and the strip is amazingly thing which I wish all lashes came like this</li>
            <li>I so love these lashes.</li>
            <li>but so worth the wait, loved the price also.</li>
            <li>The most I get out of a pair is two uses before it starts to become &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; on the band.</li>
            <li>they came in the mail fast,and I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li>but i can always put mascara :)</li>
            <li>I love these lashes</li>
            <li>these are awesome lashes i only brought one pack to see how they</li>
            <li>but i love i would recommend to others</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used mascara on these yet, but I&#x27;d imagine that would make the eyes pop more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying way more of these.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I bought this product before, two packages, and purchased two more.</li>
            <li>ok but do not buy if you need in a hurry, mine took well over a month to get to me.</li>
            <li>Eyelashes aren&#x27;t tapered like most.</li>
            <li>Good price though for what it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>Love love these.</li>
            <li>I love how it comes with so many too.</li>
            <li>I gotta get more.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these lashes.</li>
            <li>love the eyelashes.</li>
            <li>The package was a bit squished but the lashes weren&#x27;t damaged to the point of not being able to wear them.  </li>
            <li>I will forever buy these lashes and from this seller &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>they were nice they fit well and will order more</li>
            <li>So satisfied..</li>
            <li>These are way better than store bought lashes.  </li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more :-)</li>
            <li>This is a better deal for better quality eyelashes than the ones you&#x27;d get at walmart or target.</li>
            <li>Plus the box is cute.</li>
            <li>and you may be able to get 2-3 wearings out of them.  </li>
            <li>Packaging was okay...</li>
            <li>so they stay better</li>
            <li>but i couldnt pass these up so cheap!</li>
            <li>Love these lashes.</li>
            <li>Love these lashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping is \\&quot;free\\&quot; but it takes around a month or more for the item to arrive..</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re more like for if you have no eyelashes at all</li>
            <li>glad i purchased them</li>
            <li>It took a while to arrive but when I got them, they were better than the picture!&lt;br /&gt;Thin</li>
            <li>If you find them itchy at the ends, trim off a hair knot or two, or as many as you need before you don&#x27;t get that poking sensation.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these with the hopes that I could use them on a more &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; basis.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Maybe with more glue?</li>
            <li>I ordered these for Halloween party dress up they are of ok quality</li>
            <li>so I will probably continue using them, but I wish the product hadn&#x27;t changed to this more rigid type.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>I love these lashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just kind of cheaply made but</li>
            <li>I like the human hair lashes best</li>
            <li>They have a beautiful appearance for the days I want a more natural lash look.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy with the product, I highly recomend.</li>
            <li>I love them and it&#x27;s easy to get a dozen or more uses out of each of the lashes.</li>
            <li>This particular brand of lashes are very popular among night markets in Taiwan</li>
            <li>It can tend to shift or move, whereas lashes that have a stiffer band can be more easily nudged against the edge of</li>
            <li>Also got deliverd exacly when expecting highly recomanded very natruel cont get eny closer to natruel than this just a very great buy.</li>
            <li>they look natural and i feel great when i wear them</li>
            <li>First of all, it is cheap and of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>It took forever for them to come but what do you expect when you pay $0.98 haha overal good product</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a good product!</li>
            <li>but these lashes are so easy to put on and they stay put so well.&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li>Easy to apply close to lashes.</li>
            <li>I like these because they don&#x27;t have a band so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>They curl amazingly with mascara and don&#x27;t really require being squeezed with a lash curler... unless you prefer that look!</li>
            <li>Not plasticky, fine hair and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re really nice for how much they cost!</li>
            <li>I apply these to my own eyes and tried them but really like a thicker one the quality works though, but I like them thicker!</li>
            <li>but they look pretty awesome, they definitely draw attention to the eyes!!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re light and do not fall off easily.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s Beautiful and very practical, I like it so much</li>
            <li>Yet I purchased another product and worked just fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m pretty satisfied and okay with them.</li>
            <li>These are very natural and stay on really good.</li>
            <li>Love the look on me very pretty</li>
            <li>I originally purchased one box then decided to order 4 more after doing a bridal party&#x27;s makeup (where I was the Maid of Honor) with them and seeing them hold up for over 14 hours of use including dancing, hot and humid summer temperatures, and many photos.</li>
            <li>Box was a little beat up but lashes were in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic because they are cheap, light and durable.  </li>
            <li>and they are comfortable.</li>
            <li>They just need to be trimmed to fit the eye and then applied with eyelash glue (bought separately).</li>
            <li>Night and light you don&#x27;t even know you have them on.</li>
            <li>MUCH LIKE MY OWN LASHES,</li>
            <li>but if you are looking for cheap ones then yep.</li>
            <li>Beside that, they are fantastic.</li>
            <li>One of the \\&quot;Naturalites\\&quot; line of Eylure is available here on Amazon:</li>
            <li>looks more natural than many others sold like this, however most of the lashes fall off while removing them from the carton.</li>
            <li>They are light weight.</li>
            <li>I am overall happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great for daytime usage, Attention getting but not crazy over the top.</li>
            <li>I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have been so cheap.</li>
            <li>The price was great on them, so that&#x27;s a &amp;#34;win&amp;#34; I would purchase these again definitely and would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li>I just ordered 4 more packs well worth the money</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the wait because i really like the lashes and the lashes came in good condition.</li>
            <li>They look natural and its in good quality.</li>
            <li>gorgeous is what you look naturally.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more, need to stock up!!</li>
            <li>i love them they are so easy to put on and for a very cheap price would higly recomend them they look really natural.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with my product, and they were very reasonable in price.  </li>
            <li>These are great if you are not using an upper eye liner, nice clear band.</li>
            <li>First of all let me start off by saying i love these lashes.!&lt;br /&gt;i didn&#x27;t expect to get these lashes until a month</li>
            <li>I am looking to have natural lashes, perhaps with the best mascara application on, not to be glamorous or obvious or as evening wear.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply on and totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Lashes tend to pull off rather easily and are not as flexible as I would like but considering the cost they are worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>and I have to say they are absolutely amazing and all natural!</li>
            <li>envelope.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting much with these lashes, being that it is priced very cheap, BUT they came in as shown in the photo (#31).&lt;br</li>
            <li>i wear them every time there is a special occasion.</li>
            <li>They look so natural, it&#x27;s amazing for the price.</li>
            <li>I have yet to wears these and look forward to completing a full review on them.</li>
            <li>I have ordered these twice because I love them so much.</li>
            <li>The Quality is quite nice they are so natural no need to add liner.</li>
            <li>look real will buy more of these</li>
            <li>OR TOO FULL...</li>
            <li>JUST MUCH LONGER AND PRETTIER :)</li>
            <li>when i put it on, it seems nothing on me, but i feel better than my real lashes</li>
            <li>I am a real customer :)</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when i got these lashes in the mail because i wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be so nice.</li>
            <li>It is fair enough.</li>
            <li>Looks natural and mascara looks like you&#x27;re just adding to your own.</li>
            <li>I guess it a good for daily work look?.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price though....</li>
            <li>Worth the money... while the backing is kinda flimsy they are adorable and very realistic.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, for the price they are a great buy.</li>
            <li>These are very natural and easy to put on!</li>
            <li>great price very natural!! will definitely buy again!!!!!</li>
            <li>I love these lashes, they look so natural when worn and were super cheap.</li>
            <li>but lucky i do like the lashes.</li>
            <li>I love how light and natural the thickness of the lashes are too.</li>
            <li>came quick.</li>
            <li>They came really quick.</li>
            <li>These lashes are natural looking and since i am not really a eyelash wearer these are just perfect.</li>
            <li>I got my shipment super quick and the box is in mint condition.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very pretty &amp; arrived within promised date &amp; price</li>
            <li>The price was great but not worth the hassle that will come wearing the lashes to me.</li>
            <li>They look natural and easy to apply!</li>
            <li>so natural but have a nice flare to give you that flirty look;)...</li>
            <li>They are very nice subtle lashes, and seem to be somewhat more durable than the Eylure.  </li>
            <li>As most reviews say, they look very natural.</li>
            <li>I love these lashes for the very natural look they give off.</li>
            <li>REAL looking lashes!!</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more!</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more of these lashes!</li>
            <li>So pretty!</li>
            <li>Very natural and the material they use feels soft and good quality.</li>
            <li>These are perfect for everyday wear very natural looking.</li>
            <li>I believe that every girl looks beautiful with long luscious natural looking lashes!</li>
            <li>I bought a single set of these and liked them so much that I decided to order 5 more sets.  </li>
            <li>It took me several times before I got it (getting them applied) but also realized later I liked better lashes!</li>
            <li>I found the UK brand Eylure to have the best, most natural looking lashes, but they are very hard to find here in the US.  </li>
            <li>These particular lashes are very fine, have variable length, like natural lashes, and certainly look the most \\&quot;normal\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Now they&#x27;re lightweight and very flimsy so be light handed with the glue (hence Kiss glue) after you sizr them to your eye.</li>
            <li>was wanting something more natural looking</li>
            <li>love it really natural looking..</li>
            <li>I guess they are worth the dollar, and I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>It looks really natural on but make sure to cut the sides before you put them on.</li>
            <li>They look natural and because they are light, they feel comfortable.  </li>
            <li>you will just need to cut them to size but totally worth the price to try them out.</li>
            <li>Love the natural look affect too.</li>
            <li>so not even worth returning.</li>
            <li>Another thing i really liked was the packaging &amp; you can out them back once you&#x27;ve used them.</li>
            <li>Got these today, been waiting forever, but worth it</li>
            <li>The wait was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>they look a lot more natural</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s a natural look, but the condition in which it came keeps me from applying.  </li>
            <li>Until this happened about a month ago, I&#x27;d only worn them once, and they were put on by a make up artist, so I&#x27;ve had to learn a lot on my own.  </li>
            <li>These lashes are nice but not something for me because I like the human hair lashes.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li>Sooo natural looking, fell in love with these.</li>
            <li>Also these lashes came surprisingly fast, overall good product.</li>
            <li>at this price, I rarely feel the need to reuse them, however, they do hold up nicely for multiple uses</li>
            <li>They are a beautiful baby doll look to them, they are thin and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>They are thin, making them more natural looking!!!i love them!!!</li>
            <li>These are just normal, easy to put on eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I bought these and some more dramatic ones, and these are great.</li>
            <li>RIGHT</li>
            <li>they were very natural looking and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>i just love these eyelashes in general &amp; im</li>
            <li>These lashes look beautiful and aren&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li>i would not recommened the price is good but not worth it.</li>
            <li>These are really good for a simple natural every day look!</li>
            <li>These are nice and long...</li>
            <li>my own lashes are long</li>
            <li>/&gt;And there are some days that both lashes go on just right the first time</li>
            <li>Lashes are very long and it is nice looking.</li>
            <li>I really like how its a clear band &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>CAME super fast which I wasn&#x27;t expecting at all.</li>
            <li>These are so soft and light, easy to work with and very natural looking.  </li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need very much</li>
            <li>And the price is very very reasonable as you noticed 😁</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different lashes, looking for something that was easy to apply, and looked natural.  </li>
            <li>Also the bands are clear and easy to apply and they&#x27;re natural and light weight</li>
            <li>The first pair I brought on here  </li>
            <li>These are pretty long for most eye shapes but for the price, it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>got this today and i must say great product but at least u guys cud have include a bottle of eyelash glue loll</li>
            <li>If not, its an absolute perfection!</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t look exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>So first off, I was expecting the package to come in between Mar. 27 - Apr. 13 and it came in today, Mar. 18 (order was made on Mar. 3).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d have an easier time with it if shaped properly.</li>
            <li>these came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Well.... While these lashes aren&#x27;t EXACTLY as they appear in the picture I still like them.</li>
            <li>For the price they&#x27;re ok, but they&#x27;re frankly too short when it says &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; don&#x27;t plan on purchasing again.</li>
            <li>can even wear it with no eyeliner, because itself would define my eyeliner pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>Looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li>Overall they are okay.</li>
            <li>The only problem is not being able to shape them to the curve of the eye.</li>
            <li>so pretty</li>
            <li>These are so cheap and they&#x27;re amazing they look so natural but give my lashes that extreme umpf they need.</li>
            <li>if used with a clear adhesive they would look even more natural!</li>
            <li>By far the best false lashes ever.</li>
            <li>but these are good for more casual days and you cant beat the price.</li>
            <li>Really natural looking lashes and came pretty quick even coming from China.</li>
            <li>They arrived pretty fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was my first time ordering lashes online and with it being very affordable, I bought two packs (20 pairs of lashes for about $2?</li>
            <li>came pretty fast in the mail too</li>
            <li>They look really natural and full.</li>
            <li>I have full lashes naturally</li>
            <li>Anyways I highly recommend getting your hands on as many of these as possible.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call the look natural but they are pretty and worth a pair of 10 for under $2 when at Walmart a set of 5 is $8</li>
            <li>They look very beautiful and long without looking overly thick.</li>
            <li>Not dramatic.</li>
            <li>Meaning the lashes have some longer &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; in certain spots.</li>
            <li>I love how you could use them for very natural looks or double them up for a night out.</li>
            <li>Because they are so fine they are particularly fragile</li>
            <li>so i did cut the lashes to make it short to fit my eyes..</li>
            <li>I have had these for awhile and really like them.</li>
            <li>Pro: They&#x27;re subtle/natural-looking&lt;br /&gt;Con: They&#x27;re really rigid/difficult to bend.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore them.</li>
            <li>The shipment was fast.  </li>
            <li>You can bend it but it won&#x27;t really stay in place .</li>
            <li>very affordable.</li>
            <li>They are also shorter than my real lashes.</li>
            <li>they look very natual</li>
            <li>The packaging was very pristine and the boxes came in a compact bubble wrap</li>
            <li>There were no defects and they are very sturdy when wearing, cleaning, and re-using.</li>
            <li>Have not fallen apart from being washed (lightly scrubbed) multiple times.</li>
            <li>They blend so well with your real lashes.</li>
            <li>They look real...</li>
            <li>and it really helps with applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re like too straight.</li>
            <li>and i really like them.</li>
            <li>i dont really like it,</li>
            <li>so blending with real lashes should not be a problem.</li>
            <li>These dont really stay when you try to shape them before you put them on.</li>
            <li>They look great, but they feel irritating, as I&#x27;ve found all synthetic lashes do on me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Which brings me to the biggest problem: the strip is not curved at all and does not stayed curved no matter how much you bend it before applying the lashes to your lid.</li>
            <li>This makes the edges pop off of your lid because the lash strip wants to be straight instead of curved like an eyelid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re looking to have a fresh pair and wear them regularly I definitely recommend them, They definitely add length, not a lot of thickness but easily able to apply mascara.</li>
            <li>Very affordable, but I would not repurchase.</li>
            <li>Really like these lashes.</li>
            <li>I like to use false eye lashes often so this deal is great and</li>
            <li>so what I do is, I slip off a couple lashes and stick them individually to my lash line which looks so much more natural.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used false eyelashes for years and thought these would be great.  </li>
            <li>Look very real, has a clear strip instead of the big black one holding the lashes together which I really love makes it look way more real</li>
            <li>They blend very well with my natural lashes!!!</li>
            <li>I did find them a bit long but they were easy to trim to shape.</li>
            <li>A bit too long for my eyes but easy to cut.</li>
            <li>They are also $6.99 each pair, so are much more expensive than certainly either of these two sets of ten pairs are, and more than the Ardell brand lashes that are commonly available in the US.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are really long (width of eye), which I like so that I can cut on both ends of the lash for the most natural appearance and comfort.</li>
            <li>Soft banded lashes like these are very comfortable to wear because there is no stiff corner to poke you when blinking.  </li>
            <li>Super thin and natural these are so much better and well worth the wait!</li>
            <li>I got these lashes because they seemed really pretty and natural.</li>
            <li>I have a decent amount of experience with lashes, but I really only wear them for special occasions or when going out at night.</li>
            <li>They are dramatic but they do give off a nice full volume look.</li>
            <li>i love this false lashes,it is natural and great, the length is not long, but it is not too short for me.</li>
            <li>They are very natural which is nice, they last decently long.</li>
            <li>With tacky adhesive it is easy to gently press down on the lash tips to put some gentle pressure on the lash band to adhere to my lid.  </li>
            <li>basically this just gives me a slight more volume.</li>
            <li>Better than much more expensive ones ($4-$10/pair).  </li>
            <li>Now, I don&#x27;t have to buy a pair of lashes that cost around $5, or take steal them from my older sister.</li>
            <li>Better quality then some of your more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>The have a set very similar to this around the same price and the quality is BETTER.</li>
            <li>you get 10 lashes and no glue, the lashes are very frail and can easily be broken and twisted, just by nicely taking off the lashes , the good thing about them are they are light on the eyes....</li>
            <li>These lashes give you a very natural look but they do not stick on very well.</li>
            <li>Lashes look very natural which I really like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These Ardell \\&quot;demure\\&quot; lashes are available on Amazon as a single pair or in this pack of four pairs for $14.76.</li>
            <li>Also, the band that holds the lashes is extremely thin and I&#x27;m pretty sure these are only meant for a one or two time use, but if you take really good care of them and peel the adhesive glue completely off after each use, you can definitely extend their use.</li>
            <li>But once you get the banda bit more flexible by wearing or by gently rolling them around a finger to make it softer, I&#x27;ve found that because the band IS stiff it is a bit easier to place correctly.  </li>
            <li>It will generally dry reasonably invisibly, but if you need to you can always use some virtually black eyeshadow powder and a very skinny slanted brush to gently dab along the lash strip as an \\&quot;eyeliner\\&quot; to fill in any gaps between the lash strip and your own lashes, or to cover up any adhesive that may be showing.  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend these lashes to everyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it...</li>
            <li>However, they are very flimsy compared to other ones I have bought cheaply.  </li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re super sensitive to that stuff, then only buy these if you really know what you&#x27;re doing and have worn eye lashes a lot.</li>
            <li>its so natural!!</li>
            <li>really natural!!</li>
            <li>They are nice and soft and pretty subtle.  </li>
            <li>i like how the lashes are not super long because it probably won&#x27;t look good on my eyes if the lashes are super long.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say they look natural</li>
            <li>These lashes are very dense and I don&#x27;t think they can be worn to pull off a natural look.</li>
            <li>They really are a natural look.</li>
            <li>That being said, the band is too straight to apply directly to your eyelid</li>
            <li>These look natural and aren&#x27;t too much.</li>
            <li>but you are looking for a normal look, these are not gonna give that</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of an everyday look.</li>
            <li>They are thin wispy lashes, but I think thats whats makes them look good.</li>
            <li>Easy to use (as easy as putting false lashes can be anyway) and look very Natural.</li>
            <li>very natural looking lashes, they are worth it if u like only wearing lashes one time and throwing them out</li>
            <li>so they can go on either the left or the right lash line without it looking backwards.  </li>
            <li>They are super long (horizontally)</li>
            <li>I have been a professional makeup artist for 17 years and while I typically purchase lashes of higher price ranges to insure quality, I was not overwhelmingly disappointed by these lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They do not flare out or create a nice shape to the eye, which is the whole point of a false lash.</li>
            <li>However, I do get compliments that they look very natural.</li>
            <li>but they look very natural once you apply them.</li>
            <li>The lashes feel and look very natural.</li>
            <li>JUST LIKE THE IMAGE, VERY NATURAL</li>
            <li>Eyelashes looked very natural.</li>
            <li>They are flexible and look very natural.  </li>
            <li>The hair is very soft, as is the band onto which it is attached.  </li>
            <li>Also very natural.  </li>
            <li>The lashes are very natural looking.</li>
            <li>These are very natural looking (I wear all styles of lashes)</li>
            <li>Very natural looking.</li>
            <li>I do wish they had tapered ends, but they are fine enough and fanned out nicely that the blunt ends don&#x27;t put me off or look fake like I thought it</li>
            <li>Very natural lookin only thing is the band is a little cheap and doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s shape but still worth the money</li>
            <li>Unlike other cheap lashes, these lashes come with clear bands.</li>
            <li>Overall I love them and will definitely re-buy when my current ones get used up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not yet tried the first pair, but the Criss Cross one turns out to be one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>never in my life had my eyes looked big and pretty ( complimenting my self</li>
            <li>These are the same exact product as the one I bought in TW.</li>
            <li>so you do have to trim them down a bit to fit your eyes, which I don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li>These lashes look more natural than other ones in the same price range</li>
            <li>UNLESS YOU&#x27;RE INTO THAT, THEN KEEPING THEM CRAZY LONG WOULD PROBABLY BE BEST</li>
            <li>I love it these false eyelashes so much!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li>Natural looking , arrived 2 weeks early !</li>
            <li>I believe that is due to the fact that they are shaped very straight, without much curve.</li>
            <li>They are a little long on the sides where they are stickered onto the packaging, but are very easy to trim.</li>
            <li>Not stiff.</li>
            <li>I have thick and medium long eyelashes already so these were perfect to add a little more length without them looking extra bulky and thick, everyone is usually surprised they&#x27;re fake lol</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hard to apply to lid and most came straight or crooked instead in an arc.  </li>
            <li>Mine did not come with clear bands&lt;</li>
            <li>They are delicate and more natural in shape than the ones you get a drug or beauty store.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re much longer than my natural Asian lashes</li>
            <li>They have a clear flexible wire-like material for a band.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t like the clear plastic band.</li>
            <li>they look really natural</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re so natural looking.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that they look so natural.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them so far.</li>
            <li>You can see the strip completely.</li>
            <li>Look really natural on and arrive on time</li>
            <li>The eyelashes are natural but flimsy.</li>
            <li>They do not feel like natural hair but like plastic.</li>
            <li>they are natural.</li>
            <li>, they look sooo natural and they are definitely soft.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is they really are a wear once and</li>
            <li>and they look natural</li>
            <li>i buy and wear to pair for a natural look</li>
            <li>They look 100% natural .</li>
            <li>They blend well with your natural eye lashes.</li>
            <li>Two of the lashes are completely unusable.</li>
            <li>I understand they were being shipped from far away but come on, 30 days???</li>
            <li>B000ORSICQ Eylure Naturalites Natural Volume - 020 - Adhesive Included]]  </li>
            <li>Goal was to find natural looking ones.</li>
            <li>and they are by far the hardest things to apply.</li>
            <li>They look natural and the strip is comftorble to wear.</li>
            <li>Shipping took about a week or two which is understandable because they are coming from far away.</li>
            <li>looks natural but if you are a beginner like me .</li>
            <li>My natural lashes are longer.</li>
            <li>it was really really soft.</li>
            <li>also looks natural because it has a clear base.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I suspect this is like sort of like a conditioner like action not a nourishment miracle growth type deal).  </li>
            <li>Each set of lashes is hand-made, so some vary slightly in overall length of lashes, but I still really like them.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have extra glue on hand with me at that time but even if I did, it would be very troublesome to replace the glue every hour</li>
            <li>i want it natural</li>
            <li>this for natural no makeup look.. to me its like blah.</li>
            <li>, natural , lashes that I could wear everyday!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess I just have sensitive</li>
            <li>And it doesnt look natural.  </li>
            <li>Looks natural.</li>
            <li>They look very similar, but are much more rigid than the last set I received and are more difficult to work with.  </li>
            <li>These lashes are seriously natural.</li>
            <li>really natural looking.</li>
            <li>They feel and look natural.</li>
            <li>I like how natural they look and the invisible band but</li>
            <li>They were flimzy and difficult to put on but the price was so good.</li>
            <li>The lashes are good as far as fullness, they don&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li>And although they&#x27;re not that thick because its for a more natural look, a bit of mascara can fix that.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, when the band is so soft and flexible it can make it a bit more difficult to place the lash securely against the edge of your eyelid by pushing gently on the lash tips themselves or on the band.  </li>
            <li>They were Kind of stiff, which made it harder for me to apply.</li>
            <li>the strip that the eyelashes are attached to isnt too obvious, like other cheap options i have tried from amazon</li>
            <li>which makes it easier to put on and more realistic looking.&lt;br /&gt;The eye lashes are also thin, (if that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for.</li>
            <li>that the whole box was smushed-ish so the lashes are all FLAT...</li>
            <li>I will say that they are definitely for a more natural look; they look just slightly longer and thicker than my actual lashes.</li>
            <li>Perfect for natural looking eyelashes and some mascara for a dramatic look!!!</li>
            <li>These are light and airy and not overly dramatic, just the right look to enhance without being over-done.</li>
            <li>But overall decent lashes.</li>
            <li>I waited forever for these lashes but overall they were decent quality.</li>
            <li>&gt; The inner corners of the eye lashes are not shorter for a realistic look.</li>
            <li>The lashes themselves are much too long and won&#x27;t look natural unless you are part camel.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for daily wear if you don&#x27;t mind length.</li>
            <li>i bought these for a major steal!</li>
            <li>Easy and inexpensive enough for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li>And when you are a poor college student like me, paying this little for such a nice product is worth it!</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical about these based on the price, but was really happy.  </li>
            <li>so this is not a good fit for me!</li>
            <li>The only reason I gave them only four stars is because they don&#x27;t really taper at the inside corners like natural lashes</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re obviously natural looking because you can&#x27;t barely tell they are there.</li>
            <li>They take a long time to arrive so if you plan on ordering, order a whole bunch at a time.</li>
            <li>Flexible &amp; thin band make application incredibly easy!</li>
            <li>They are not too much and not too little, they look so natural!!!</li>
            <li>I loved how these lashed looked very natural but also a full long look; however, the plastic band was so hard it was difficult to bend it to my eye shape, the glue kept getting all over my eye and the lash kept snapping back to its straight shape.</li>
            <li>You also have to snip the sides of the strip to fit your eye, kind of annoying...</li>
            <li>liked that these are packaged with tiny gold dot stickers, so that they do not fly all over the place during shipping.</li>
            <li>They are very long but they are soft and high quality.</li>
            <li>Not much difference between right and left.</li>
            <li>Super stiff.  </li>
            <li>The price is cheap and is free shipping so even if I don&#x27;t like the lashes i not going to be all mad about it</li>
            <li>these lashes dont look realistic and i have to cut them because they are to long ehic</li>
            <li>Perfect for daily wear, they are long enough to be used on multiple eye widths and are basically unnoticable as false (I tight line</li>
            <li>She praised the clear adhesive that they sell (note my comment above about that)</li>
            <li>Also, just a tip: you should wet and leave drying on a curved surface because they come packaged straight.</li>
            <li>But overall , it was alright and made my lash look natural</li>
            <li>Not drag.</li>
            <li>If you want something that is natural looking but also enhances your lashes at the same time, they are the ones to go to!</li>
            <li>its the same as my natural lash.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These lashes are made of synthetic material, but still look like soft human hair.  </li>
            <li>Was kind of expecting a fake plastic feel to them</li>
            <li>Nice enhancement without looking gaudy or fake.</li>
            <li>Or maybe I&#x27;ll decide that I love wearing false eyelashes</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t put them on just right, they will bother you a little.</li>
            <li>I use DUO eyelash glue which usually works top notch with every other falsies</li>
            <li>They did look very natural, not too long</li>
            <li>to a temporary loss of my own lashes (not a total loss, but they are very, very short just now) it is necessary for me to wear false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>These eyelashes are a hot mess</li>
            <li>but they came quite fast compared to other things i order that come from chine.</li>
            <li>I really have benefited from the product reviews that other women have posted on Amazon and am so grateful for the help.  </li>
            <li>they are not dark enough</li>
            <li>They really are soft and natural-looking, first ones I&#x27;ve tried that didn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>, I only marked it a three cus I have to cut the actual lashes because they don&#x27;t always match.</li>
            <li>these are definitely more natural looking than the $6 fake lashes here in the states.</li>
            <li>very thin i love dramatic but this is more of a natural look</li>
            <li>Thanks to all of you who took the time to write in about other similar products.  </li>
            <li>Long and natural.</li>
            <li>They would only work if you barely have lashes.</li>
            <li>, I have to cut the edges to fit my eye shape, the only thing which bothers me is that since it is supposed to look natural, the strip is really thin</li>
            <li>One problem with clear adhesive, I&#x27;ve discovered much to my surprise, is that it is impossible to tell where you&#x27;ve applied it to the lash strip, how thickly it has been applied, and while it sounds like a good idea, I&#x27;ve stopped using the clear one I bought as a result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do not recommend these, the packaging they came in was a cute little box but other than that I was not very amused.</li>
            <li>Normally, i wont even go for these 10 pack eyelashes online because they just look so cheap and as fake as they can get.</li>
            <li>so I dont like the dramatic look, and these are perfect to give the extra fullness without the fake look.</li>
            <li>I always try out products on myself before my clients and these were light, natural, and long wearing (I use waterproof dark tinted glue; current brand-Revlon Dark Lash Adhesive).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for about ten cents a lash, I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li>enjoying the new look using the Natural Black Long Fake Eyelashes</li>
            <li>They are really flimsy and hard to get on if you aren&#x27;t professional.</li>

            <li> They are great for this reason.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s lightweight and would be great for these.</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY happy with the lashes.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re an experienced lash wearer, then you can just chop them off.  </li>

            <li> I really liked them !</li>
            <li> I love these lashes they are great for beginners or maybe to have variety in a freelance kit for makeup artists!!...</li>
            <li> and they started to come off very quickly, even with the best glue that i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> very easy to apply!</li>

            <li> AS SOON AS I GOT THEM AND LOVED THEM</li>

            <li> good  price and good product</li>

            <li> would of liked it alot if I got a hold of it.</li>
            <li> your done kind of eyelash</li>

            <li> very satisfied love them</li>
            <li> Perfect, lightweight, they look very natural.</li>

            <li> These are beautiful at first glance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a good thing these were cheap,</li>
            <li> seeing that they were cheap but the quality of the lashes are good.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply too!</li>
            <li> wanted something more natural looking and these were perfect</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m loving them more and more every time I look in the mirror.</li>
            <li> so i was pretty happy with how these felt.</li>
            <li> And I think that by the time I&#x27;m very adept with them my own lashes will have grown in enough that with some favorite mascara, I&#x27;ll be good to go.  </li>
            <li> they are finely made and the strip is amazingly thing which I wish all lashes came like this</li>
            <li> I so love these lashes.</li>
            <li> but so worth the wait, loved the price also.</li>
            <li> The most I get out of a pair is two uses before it starts to become &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; on the band.</li>
            <li> they came in the mail fast,and I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> but i can always put mascara :)</li>

            <li> these are awesome lashes i only brought one pack to see how they</li>
            <li> but i love i would recommend to others</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used mascara on these yet, but I&#x27;d imagine that would make the eyes pop more.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying way more of these.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> I bought this product before, two packages, and purchased two more.</li>
            <li> ok but do not buy if you need in a hurry, mine took well over a month to get to me.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes aren&#x27;t tapered like most.</li>
            <li> Good price though for what it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Love love these.</li>

            <li> The package was a bit squished but the lashes weren&#x27;t damaged to the point of not being able to wear them.  </li>
            <li> I will forever buy these lashes and from this seller &#x3D;]</li>

            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more :-)</li>
            <li> This is a better deal for better quality eyelashes than the ones you&#x27;d get at walmart or target.</li>
            <li> Plus the box is cute.</li>
            <li> and you may be able to get 2-3 wearings out of them.  </li>
            <li> Packaging was okay...</li>
            <li> so they stay better</li>
            <li> but i couldnt pass these up so cheap!</li>
            <li> Love these lashes.</li>
            <li> Love these lashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping is \\&quot;free\\&quot; but it takes around a month or more for the item to arrive..</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re more like for if you have no eyelashes at all</li>
            <li> glad i purchased them</li>
            <li> It took a while to arrive but when I got them, they were better than the picture!&lt;br /&gt;Thin</li>
            <li> If you find them itchy at the ends, trim off a hair knot or two, or as many as you need before you don&#x27;t get that poking sensation.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these with the hopes that I could use them on a more &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; basis.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Maybe with more glue?</li>
            <li> I ordered these for Halloween party dress up they are of ok quality</li>
            <li> so I will probably continue using them, but I wish the product hadn&#x27;t changed to this more rigid type.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> I love these lashes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s just kind of cheaply made but</li>
            <li> I like the human hair lashes best</li>
            <li> They have a beautiful appearance for the days I want a more natural lash look.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy with the product, I highly recomend.</li>
            <li> I love them and it&#x27;s easy to get a dozen or more uses out of each of the lashes.</li>
            <li> This particular brand of lashes are very popular among night markets in Taiwan</li>
            <li> It can tend to shift or move, whereas lashes that have a stiffer band can be more easily nudged against the edge of</li>
            <li> Also got deliverd exacly when expecting highly recomanded very natruel cont get eny closer to natruel than this just a very great buy.</li>
            <li> they look natural and i feel great when i wear them</li>
            <li> First of all, it is cheap and of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> It took forever for them to come but what do you expect when you pay $0.98 haha overal good product</li>
            <li> Thank you for such a good product!</li>
            <li> but these lashes are so easy to put on and they stay put so well.&lt;br /&gt;very</li>
            <li> Easy to apply close to lashes.</li>
            <li> I like these because they don&#x27;t have a band so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> They curl amazingly with mascara and don&#x27;t really require being squeezed with a lash curler... unless you prefer that look!</li>
            <li> Not plasticky, fine hair and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re really nice for how much they cost!</li>
            <li> I apply these to my own eyes and tried them but really like a thicker one the quality works though, but I like them thicker!</li>
            <li> but they look pretty awesome, they definitely draw attention to the eyes!!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re light and do not fall off easily.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s Beautiful and very practical, I like it so much</li>
            <li> Yet I purchased another product and worked just fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty satisfied and okay with them.</li>
            <li> These are very natural and stay on really good.</li>
            <li> Love the look on me very pretty</li>
            <li> I originally purchased one box then decided to order 4 more after doing a bridal party&#x27;s makeup (where I was the Maid of Honor) with them and seeing them hold up for over 14 hours of use including dancing, hot and humid summer temperatures, and many photos.</li>
            <li> Box was a little beat up but lashes were in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic because they are cheap, light and durable.  </li>
            <li> and they are comfortable.</li>
            <li> They just need to be trimmed to fit the eye and then applied with eyelash glue (bought separately).</li>
            <li> Night and light you don&#x27;t even know you have them on.</li>
            <li> MUCH LIKE MY OWN LASHES,</li>
            <li> but if you are looking for cheap ones then yep.</li>
            <li> Beside that, they are fantastic.</li>
            <li> One of the \\&quot;Naturalites\\&quot; line of Eylure is available here on Amazon:</li>
            <li> looks more natural than many others sold like this, however most of the lashes fall off while removing them from the carton.</li>
            <li> They are light weight.</li>
            <li> I am overall happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great for daytime usage, Attention getting but not crazy over the top.</li>
            <li> I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have been so cheap.</li>
            <li> The price was great on them, so that&#x27;s a &amp;#34;win&amp;#34; I would purchase these again definitely and would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> I just ordered 4 more packs well worth the money</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the wait because i really like the lashes and the lashes came in good condition.</li>
            <li> They look natural and its in good quality.</li>
            <li> gorgeous is what you look naturally.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more, need to stock up!!</li>
            <li> i love them they are so easy to put on and for a very cheap price would higly recomend them they look really natural.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with my product, and they were very reasonable in price.  </li>
            <li> These are great if you are not using an upper eye liner, nice clear band.</li>
            <li> First of all let me start off by saying i love these lashes.!&lt;br /&gt;i didn&#x27;t expect to get these lashes until a month</li>
            <li> I am looking to have natural lashes, perhaps with the best mascara application on, not to be glamorous or obvious or as evening wear.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply on and totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Lashes tend to pull off rather easily and are not as flexible as I would like but considering the cost they are worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> and I have to say they are absolutely amazing and all natural!</li>
            <li> envelope.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting much with these lashes, being that it is priced very cheap, BUT they came in as shown in the photo (#31).&lt;br</li>
            <li> i wear them every time there is a special occasion.</li>
            <li> They look so natural, it&#x27;s amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> I have yet to wears these and look forward to completing a full review on them.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these twice because I love them so much.</li>
            <li> The Quality is quite nice they are so natural no need to add liner.</li>
            <li> look real will buy more of these</li>
            <li> OR TOO FULL...</li>
            <li> JUST MUCH LONGER AND PRETTIER :)</li>
            <li> when i put it on, it seems nothing on me, but i feel better than my real lashes</li>
            <li> I am a real customer :)</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when i got these lashes in the mail because i wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be so nice.</li>
            <li> It is fair enough.</li>
            <li> Looks natural and mascara looks like you&#x27;re just adding to your own.</li>
            <li> I guess it a good for daily work look?.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price though....</li>
            <li> Worth the money... while the backing is kinda flimsy they are adorable and very realistic.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, for the price they are a great buy.</li>
            <li> These are very natural and easy to put on!</li>
            <li> great price very natural!! will definitely buy again!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, they look so natural when worn and were super cheap.</li>
            <li> but lucky i do like the lashes.</li>
            <li> I love how light and natural the thickness of the lashes are too.</li>
            <li> came quick.</li>
            <li> They came really quick.</li>
            <li> These lashes are natural looking and since i am not really a eyelash wearer these are just perfect.</li>
            <li> I got my shipment super quick and the box is in mint condition.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very pretty &amp; arrived within promised date &amp; price</li>
            <li> The price was great but not worth the hassle that will come wearing the lashes to me.</li>
            <li> They look natural and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> so natural but have a nice flare to give you that flirty look;)...</li>
            <li> They are very nice subtle lashes, and seem to be somewhat more durable than the Eylure.  </li>
            <li> As most reviews say, they look very natural.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes for the very natural look they give off.</li>
            <li> REAL looking lashes!!</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more!</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more of these lashes!</li>
            <li> So pretty!</li>
            <li> Very natural and the material they use feels soft and good quality.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for everyday wear very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I believe that every girl looks beautiful with long luscious natural looking lashes!</li>
            <li> I bought a single set of these and liked them so much that I decided to order 5 more sets.  </li>
            <li> It took me several times before I got it (getting them applied) but also realized later I liked better lashes!</li>
            <li> I found the UK brand Eylure to have the best, most natural looking lashes, but they are very hard to find here in the US.  </li>
            <li> These particular lashes are very fine, have variable length, like natural lashes, and certainly look the most \\&quot;normal\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Now they&#x27;re lightweight and very flimsy so be light handed with the glue (hence Kiss glue) after you sizr them to your eye.</li>
            <li> was wanting something more natural looking</li>
            <li> love it really natural looking..</li>
            <li> I guess they are worth the dollar, and I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> It looks really natural on but make sure to cut the sides before you put them on.</li>
            <li> They look natural and because they are light, they feel comfortable.  </li>
            <li> you will just need to cut them to size but totally worth the price to try them out.</li>
            <li> Love the natural look affect too.</li>
            <li> so not even worth returning.</li>
            <li> Another thing i really liked was the packaging &amp; you can out them back once you&#x27;ve used them.</li>
            <li> Got these today, been waiting forever, but worth it</li>
            <li> The wait was definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> they look a lot more natural</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s a natural look, but the condition in which it came keeps me from applying.  </li>
            <li> Until this happened about a month ago, I&#x27;d only worn them once, and they were put on by a make up artist, so I&#x27;ve had to learn a lot on my own.  </li>
            <li> These lashes are nice but not something for me because I like the human hair lashes.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> Sooo natural looking, fell in love with these.</li>
            <li> Also these lashes came surprisingly fast, overall good product.</li>
            <li> at this price, I rarely feel the need to reuse them, however, they do hold up nicely for multiple uses</li>
            <li> They are a beautiful baby doll look to them, they are thin and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> They are thin, making them more natural looking!!!i love them!!!</li>
            <li> These are just normal, easy to put on eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I bought these and some more dramatic ones, and these are great.</li>
            <li> RIGHT</li>
            <li> they were very natural looking and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> i just love these eyelashes in general &amp; im</li>
            <li> These lashes look beautiful and aren&#x27;t too thick.</li>
            <li> i would not recommened the price is good but not worth it.</li>
            <li> These are really good for a simple natural every day look!</li>
            <li> These are nice and long...</li>
            <li> my own lashes are long</li>
            <li> /&gt;And there are some days that both lashes go on just right the first time</li>
            <li> Lashes are very long and it is nice looking.</li>
            <li> I really like how its a clear band &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> CAME super fast which I wasn&#x27;t expecting at all.</li>
            <li> These are so soft and light, easy to work with and very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need very much</li>
            <li> And the price is very very reasonable as you noticed 😁</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different lashes, looking for something that was easy to apply, and looked natural.  </li>
            <li> Also the bands are clear and easy to apply and they&#x27;re natural and light weight</li>
            <li> The first pair I brought on here  </li>
            <li> These are pretty long for most eye shapes but for the price, it is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> got this today and i must say great product but at least u guys cud have include a bottle of eyelash glue loll</li>
            <li> If not, its an absolute perfection!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t look exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> So first off, I was expecting the package to come in between Mar. 27 - Apr. 13 and it came in today, Mar. 18 (order was made on Mar. 3).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d have an easier time with it if shaped properly.</li>
            <li> these came exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Well.... While these lashes aren&#x27;t EXACTLY as they appear in the picture I still like them.</li>
            <li> For the price they&#x27;re ok, but they&#x27;re frankly too short when it says &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; don&#x27;t plan on purchasing again.</li>
            <li> can even wear it with no eyeliner, because itself would define my eyeliner pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Looks exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more in the future!</li>
            <li> Overall they are okay.</li>
            <li> The only problem is not being able to shape them to the curve of the eye.</li>
            <li> so pretty</li>
            <li> These are so cheap and they&#x27;re amazing they look so natural but give my lashes that extreme umpf they need.</li>
            <li> if used with a clear adhesive they would look even more natural!</li>
            <li> By far the best false lashes ever.</li>
            <li> but these are good for more casual days and you cant beat the price.</li>
            <li> Really natural looking lashes and came pretty quick even coming from China.</li>
            <li> They arrived pretty fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was my first time ordering lashes online and with it being very affordable, I bought two packs (20 pairs of lashes for about $2?</li>
            <li> came pretty fast in the mail too</li>
            <li> They look really natural and full.</li>
            <li> I have full lashes naturally</li>
            <li> Anyways I highly recommend getting your hands on as many of these as possible.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call the look natural but they are pretty and worth a pair of 10 for under $2 when at Walmart a set of 5 is $8</li>
            <li> They look very beautiful and long without looking overly thick.</li>
            <li> Not dramatic.</li>
            <li> Meaning the lashes have some longer &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; in certain spots.</li>
            <li> I love how you could use them for very natural looks or double them up for a night out.</li>
            <li> Because they are so fine they are particularly fragile</li>
            <li> so i did cut the lashes to make it short to fit my eyes..</li>
            <li> I have had these for awhile and really like them.</li>
            <li> Pro: They&#x27;re subtle/natural-looking&lt;br /&gt;Con: They&#x27;re really rigid/difficult to bend.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore them.</li>
            <li> The shipment was fast.  </li>
            <li> You can bend it but it won&#x27;t really stay in place .</li>
            <li> very affordable.</li>
            <li> They are also shorter than my real lashes.</li>
            <li> they look very natual</li>
            <li> The packaging was very pristine and the boxes came in a compact bubble wrap</li>
            <li> There were no defects and they are very sturdy when wearing, cleaning, and re-using.</li>
            <li> Have not fallen apart from being washed (lightly scrubbed) multiple times.</li>
            <li> They blend so well with your real lashes.</li>
            <li> They look real...</li>
            <li> and it really helps with applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re like too straight.</li>
            <li> and i really like them.</li>
            <li> i dont really like it,</li>
            <li> so blending with real lashes should not be a problem.</li>
            <li> These dont really stay when you try to shape them before you put them on.</li>
            <li> They look great, but they feel irritating, as I&#x27;ve found all synthetic lashes do on me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Which brings me to the biggest problem: the strip is not curved at all and does not stayed curved no matter how much you bend it before applying the lashes to your lid.</li>
            <li> This makes the edges pop off of your lid because the lash strip wants to be straight instead of curved like an eyelid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re looking to have a fresh pair and wear them regularly I definitely recommend them, They definitely add length, not a lot of thickness but easily able to apply mascara.</li>
            <li> Very affordable, but I would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> Really like these lashes.</li>
            <li> I like to use false eye lashes often so this deal is great and</li>
            <li> so what I do is, I slip off a couple lashes and stick them individually to my lash line which looks so much more natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used false eyelashes for years and thought these would be great.  </li>
            <li> Look very real, has a clear strip instead of the big black one holding the lashes together which I really love makes it look way more real</li>
            <li> They blend very well with my natural lashes!!!</li>
            <li> I did find them a bit long but they were easy to trim to shape.</li>
            <li> A bit too long for my eyes but easy to cut.</li>
            <li> They are also $6.99 each pair, so are much more expensive than certainly either of these two sets of ten pairs are, and more than the Ardell brand lashes that are commonly available in the US.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are really long (width of eye), which I like so that I can cut on both ends of the lash for the most natural appearance and comfort.</li>
            <li> Soft banded lashes like these are very comfortable to wear because there is no stiff corner to poke you when blinking.  </li>
            <li> Super thin and natural these are so much better and well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> I got these lashes because they seemed really pretty and natural.</li>
            <li> I have a decent amount of experience with lashes, but I really only wear them for special occasions or when going out at night.</li>
            <li> They are dramatic but they do give off a nice full volume look.</li>
            <li> i love this false lashes,it is natural and great, the length is not long, but it is not too short for me.</li>
            <li> They are very natural which is nice, they last decently long.</li>
            <li> With tacky adhesive it is easy to gently press down on the lash tips to put some gentle pressure on the lash band to adhere to my lid.  </li>
            <li> basically this just gives me a slight more volume.</li>
            <li> Better than much more expensive ones ($4-$10/pair).  </li>
            <li> Now, I don&#x27;t have to buy a pair of lashes that cost around $5, or take steal them from my older sister.</li>
            <li> Better quality then some of your more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> The have a set very similar to this around the same price and the quality is BETTER.</li>
            <li> you get 10 lashes and no glue, the lashes are very frail and can easily be broken and twisted, just by nicely taking off the lashes , the good thing about them are they are light on the eyes....</li>
            <li> These lashes give you a very natural look but they do not stick on very well.</li>
            <li> Lashes look very natural which I really like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These Ardell \\&quot;demure\\&quot; lashes are available on Amazon as a single pair or in this pack of four pairs for $14.76.</li>
            <li> Also, the band that holds the lashes is extremely thin and I&#x27;m pretty sure these are only meant for a one or two time use, but if you take really good care of them and peel the adhesive glue completely off after each use, you can definitely extend their use.</li>
            <li> But once you get the banda bit more flexible by wearing or by gently rolling them around a finger to make it softer, I&#x27;ve found that because the band IS stiff it is a bit easier to place correctly.  </li>
            <li> It will generally dry reasonably invisibly, but if you need to you can always use some virtually black eyeshadow powder and a very skinny slanted brush to gently dab along the lash strip as an \\&quot;eyeliner\\&quot; to fill in any gaps between the lash strip and your own lashes, or to cover up any adhesive that may be showing.  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend these lashes to everyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it...</li>
            <li> However, they are very flimsy compared to other ones I have bought cheaply.  </li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re super sensitive to that stuff, then only buy these if you really know what you&#x27;re doing and have worn eye lashes a lot.</li>
            <li> its so natural!!</li>
            <li> really natural!!</li>
            <li> They are nice and soft and pretty subtle.  </li>
            <li> i like how the lashes are not super long because it probably won&#x27;t look good on my eyes if the lashes are super long.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say they look natural</li>
            <li> These lashes are very dense and I don&#x27;t think they can be worn to pull off a natural look.</li>
            <li> They really are a natural look.</li>
            <li> That being said, the band is too straight to apply directly to your eyelid</li>
            <li> These look natural and aren&#x27;t too much.</li>
            <li> but you are looking for a normal look, these are not gonna give that</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of an everyday look.</li>
            <li> They are thin wispy lashes, but I think thats whats makes them look good.</li>
            <li> Easy to use (as easy as putting false lashes can be anyway) and look very Natural.</li>
            <li> very natural looking lashes, they are worth it if u like only wearing lashes one time and throwing them out</li>
            <li> so they can go on either the left or the right lash line without it looking backwards.  </li>
            <li> They are super long (horizontally)</li>
            <li> I have been a professional makeup artist for 17 years and while I typically purchase lashes of higher price ranges to insure quality, I was not overwhelmingly disappointed by these lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They do not flare out or create a nice shape to the eye, which is the whole point of a false lash.</li>
            <li> However, I do get compliments that they look very natural.</li>
            <li> but they look very natural once you apply them.</li>
            <li> The lashes feel and look very natural.</li>
            <li> JUST LIKE THE IMAGE, VERY NATURAL</li>
            <li> Eyelashes looked very natural.</li>
            <li> They are flexible and look very natural.  </li>
            <li> The hair is very soft, as is the band onto which it is attached.  </li>
            <li> Also very natural.  </li>
            <li> The lashes are very natural looking.</li>
            <li> These are very natural looking (I wear all styles of lashes)</li>
            <li> Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> I do wish they had tapered ends, but they are fine enough and fanned out nicely that the blunt ends don&#x27;t put me off or look fake like I thought it</li>
            <li> Very natural lookin only thing is the band is a little cheap and doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s shape but still worth the money</li>
            <li> Unlike other cheap lashes, these lashes come with clear bands.</li>
            <li> Overall I love them and will definitely re-buy when my current ones get used up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not yet tried the first pair, but the Criss Cross one turns out to be one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li> never in my life had my eyes looked big and pretty ( complimenting my self</li>
            <li> These are the same exact product as the one I bought in TW.</li>
            <li> so you do have to trim them down a bit to fit your eyes, which I don&#x27;t mind</li>
            <li> These lashes look more natural than other ones in the same price range</li>
            <li> UNLESS YOU&#x27;RE INTO THAT, THEN KEEPING THEM CRAZY LONG WOULD PROBABLY BE BEST</li>
            <li> I love it these false eyelashes so much!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li> Natural looking , arrived 2 weeks early !</li>
            <li> I believe that is due to the fact that they are shaped very straight, without much curve.</li>
            <li> They are a little long on the sides where they are stickered onto the packaging, but are very easy to trim.</li>
            <li> Not stiff.</li>
            <li> I have thick and medium long eyelashes already so these were perfect to add a little more length without them looking extra bulky and thick, everyone is usually surprised they&#x27;re fake lol</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to apply to lid and most came straight or crooked instead in an arc.  </li>
            <li> Mine did not come with clear bands&lt;</li>
            <li> They are delicate and more natural in shape than the ones you get a drug or beauty store.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re much longer than my natural Asian lashes</li>
            <li> They have a clear flexible wire-like material for a band.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like the clear plastic band.</li>
            <li> they look really natural</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re so natural looking.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that they look so natural.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them so far.</li>
            <li> You can see the strip completely.</li>
            <li> Look really natural on and arrive on time</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are natural but flimsy.</li>
            <li> They do not feel like natural hair but like plastic.</li>
            <li> they are natural.</li>
            <li> , they look sooo natural and they are definitely soft.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is they really are a wear once and</li>
            <li> and they look natural</li>
            <li> i buy and wear to pair for a natural look</li>
            <li> They look 100% natural .</li>
            <li> They blend well with your natural eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Two of the lashes are completely unusable.</li>
            <li> I understand they were being shipped from far away but come on, 30 days???</li>
            <li> B000ORSICQ Eylure Naturalites Natural Volume - 020 - Adhesive Included]]  </li>
            <li> Goal was to find natural looking ones.</li>
            <li> and they are by far the hardest things to apply.</li>
            <li> They look natural and the strip is comftorble to wear.</li>
            <li> Shipping took about a week or two which is understandable because they are coming from far away.</li>
            <li> looks natural but if you are a beginner like me .</li>
            <li> My natural lashes are longer.</li>
            <li> it was really really soft.</li>
            <li> also looks natural because it has a clear base.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I suspect this is like sort of like a conditioner like action not a nourishment miracle growth type deal).  </li>
            <li> Each set of lashes is hand-made, so some vary slightly in overall length of lashes, but I still really like them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have extra glue on hand with me at that time but even if I did, it would be very troublesome to replace the glue every hour</li>
            <li> i want it natural</li>
            <li> this for natural no makeup look.. to me its like blah.</li>
            <li> , natural , lashes that I could wear everyday!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess I just have sensitive</li>
            <li> And it doesnt look natural.  </li>
            <li> Looks natural.</li>
            <li> They look very similar, but are much more rigid than the last set I received and are more difficult to work with.  </li>
            <li> These lashes are seriously natural.</li>
            <li> really natural looking.</li>
            <li> They feel and look natural.</li>
            <li> I like how natural they look and the invisible band but</li>
            <li> They were flimzy and difficult to put on but the price was so good.</li>
            <li> The lashes are good as far as fullness, they don&#x27;t look fake.</li>
            <li> And although they&#x27;re not that thick because its for a more natural look, a bit of mascara can fix that.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, when the band is so soft and flexible it can make it a bit more difficult to place the lash securely against the edge of your eyelid by pushing gently on the lash tips themselves or on the band.  </li>
            <li> They were Kind of stiff, which made it harder for me to apply.</li>
            <li> the strip that the eyelashes are attached to isnt too obvious, like other cheap options i have tried from amazon</li>
            <li> which makes it easier to put on and more realistic looking.&lt;br /&gt;The eye lashes are also thin, (if that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for.</li>
            <li> that the whole box was smushed-ish so the lashes are all FLAT...</li>
            <li> I will say that they are definitely for a more natural look; they look just slightly longer and thicker than my actual lashes.</li>
            <li> Perfect for natural looking eyelashes and some mascara for a dramatic look!!!</li>
            <li> These are light and airy and not overly dramatic, just the right look to enhance without being over-done.</li>
            <li> But overall decent lashes.</li>
            <li> I waited forever for these lashes but overall they were decent quality.</li>
            <li> &gt; The inner corners of the eye lashes are not shorter for a realistic look.</li>
            <li> The lashes themselves are much too long and won&#x27;t look natural unless you are part camel.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for daily wear if you don&#x27;t mind length.</li>
            <li> i bought these for a major steal!</li>
            <li> Easy and inexpensive enough for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li> And when you are a poor college student like me, paying this little for such a nice product is worth it!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about these based on the price, but was really happy.  </li>
            <li> so this is not a good fit for me!</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave them only four stars is because they don&#x27;t really taper at the inside corners like natural lashes</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re obviously natural looking because you can&#x27;t barely tell they are there.</li>
            <li> They take a long time to arrive so if you plan on ordering, order a whole bunch at a time.</li>
            <li> Flexible &amp; thin band make application incredibly easy!</li>
            <li> They are not too much and not too little, they look so natural!!!</li>
            <li> I loved how these lashed looked very natural but also a full long look; however, the plastic band was so hard it was difficult to bend it to my eye shape, the glue kept getting all over my eye and the lash kept snapping back to its straight shape.</li>
            <li> You also have to snip the sides of the strip to fit your eye, kind of annoying...</li>
            <li> liked that these are packaged with tiny gold dot stickers, so that they do not fly all over the place during shipping.</li>
            <li> They are very long but they are soft and high quality.</li>
            <li> Not much difference between right and left.</li>
            <li> Super stiff.  </li>
            <li> The price is cheap and is free shipping so even if I don&#x27;t like the lashes i not going to be all mad about it</li>
            <li> these lashes dont look realistic and i have to cut them because they are to long ehic</li>
            <li> Perfect for daily wear, they are long enough to be used on multiple eye widths and are basically unnoticable as false (I tight line</li>
            <li> She praised the clear adhesive that they sell (note my comment above about that)</li>
            <li> Also, just a tip: you should wet and leave drying on a curved surface because they come packaged straight.</li>
            <li> But overall , it was alright and made my lash look natural</li>
            <li> Not drag.</li>
            <li> If you want something that is natural looking but also enhances your lashes at the same time, they are the ones to go to!</li>
            <li> its the same as my natural lash.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These lashes are made of synthetic material, but still look like soft human hair.  </li>
            <li> Was kind of expecting a fake plastic feel to them</li>
            <li> Nice enhancement without looking gaudy or fake.</li>
            <li> Or maybe I&#x27;ll decide that I love wearing false eyelashes</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t put them on just right, they will bother you a little.</li>
            <li> I use DUO eyelash glue which usually works top notch with every other falsies</li>
            <li> They did look very natural, not too long</li>
            <li> to a temporary loss of my own lashes (not a total loss, but they are very, very short just now) it is necessary for me to wear false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> These eyelashes are a hot mess</li>
            <li> but they came quite fast compared to other things i order that come from chine.</li>
            <li> I really have benefited from the product reviews that other women have posted on Amazon and am so grateful for the help.  </li>
            <li> they are not dark enough</li>
            <li> They really are soft and natural-looking, first ones I&#x27;ve tried that didn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing false eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> , I only marked it a three cus I have to cut the actual lashes because they don&#x27;t always match.</li>
            <li> these are definitely more natural looking than the $6 fake lashes here in the states.</li>
            <li> very thin i love dramatic but this is more of a natural look</li>
            <li> Thanks to all of you who took the time to write in about other similar products.  </li>
            <li> Long and natural.</li>
            <li> They would only work if you barely have lashes.</li>
            <li> , I have to cut the edges to fit my eye shape, the only thing which bothers me is that since it is supposed to look natural, the strip is really thin</li>
            <li> One problem with clear adhesive, I&#x27;ve discovered much to my surprise, is that it is impossible to tell where you&#x27;ve applied it to the lash strip, how thickly it has been applied, and while it sounds like a good idea, I&#x27;ve stopped using the clear one I bought as a result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not recommend these, the packaging they came in was a cute little box but other than that I was not very amused.</li>
            <li> Normally, i wont even go for these 10 pack eyelashes online because they just look so cheap and as fake as they can get.</li>
            <li> so I dont like the dramatic look, and these are perfect to give the extra fullness without the fake look.</li>
            <li> I always try out products on myself before my clients and these were light, natural, and long wearing (I use waterproof dark tinted glue; current brand-Revlon Dark Lash Adhesive).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for about ten cents a lash, I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> enjoying the new look using the Natural Black Long Fake Eyelashes</li>
            <li> They are really flimsy and hard to get on if you aren&#x27;t professional.</li>
            <li> I love these false eyelashes!</li>
            <li> Its more suited for Halloween, dramatic makeup looks, stage makeup and drag makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The clear spine ends, and the lash knots on these things are so sharp.</li>
            <li> I have pretty big eyes but had to cut at least a third of the strip off for it to be the length of my eyelid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It bends easily when applying to lashline and holds its shape extremely well which is a big plus compared to other, more expensive lashes I have tried that are very stiff.</li>
            <li> I wear false lashes almost every weekend and for special occasions.</li>
            <li> There is adhesive in black, white, and clear.  </li>
            <li> I ordered lashes with a clear band and the ones I got obviously had a black band.</li>
            <li> The strip is clear versus a dark color..</li>
            <li> - so it takes a long time from ordering and actually getting them.</li>
            <li> They are not too long and not too short</li>
            <li> Personally they&#x27;re too long for me</li>
            <li> They are fuller than the Eylure, but not as long as the lashes in the 10 pair pack mentioned above.</li>
            <li> If you have long eyelashes or big eyes don&#x27;t buy them.</li>
            <li> the same note, the strip is also too long.</li>
            <li> I would totally recommend these to anyone who likes natural looking/feeling lashes and are on a tight budget.</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for, theyre big but not as ridiculous as some.</li>
            <li> AFTER I GIVE THEM A LITTLE TRIM, THESE REALLY BRING MY EYES OUT, WITHOUT LOOKING DRAG QUEENY...</li>
            <li> It is very unnatural looking and feel very heavy.</li>
            <li> Some short, some long not in the same area, it looks weird, cheap.</li>
            <li> Lashes look very natural, not too long or thick and they are quite soft.</li>
            <li> i cant really complain for the price but these eyelashes are hard to contour on your lid since the actual lash strip is a string of plastic.</li>
            <li> i stuck with these because the thicker ones i saw on here didnt look like they would be soft and look really odd.</li>
            <li> they work as accent lashes when i cut them in half but as a full lash it is kinda hard to get it to stay on.</li>
            <li> so i trimmed a little bit of the side off but other than that i really really like them and plan on buying again</li>
            <li> They look great but the lashes fell off the clear band while trying to creat a little curve before gluing them down:(</li>
            <li> admit, they are stiff but all you have to do is run your nail across the lash line in a curved position a few times and they loosen right up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I waited for a month to receive my lashes in the mailbox,i didn&#x27;t like how i waited that long</li>
            <li> Too long, made my lashes look spidery.</li>
            <li> , THEY ARE REALLY LONG</li>
            <li> Came in earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> way earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t impact the visuals, but will go a long way towards your comfort.</li>
            <li> They came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> They are particularly long.</li>
            <li> I tend not to wait long enough, and when the adhesive is wet</li>
            <li> the natural pale eye look</li>
            <li> I used these on 3 completely different complexion/ eye shape/ eye colored individuals other than myself..</li>
            <li> so I just threw it back in the box and put on the other ones that I have.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t stick on for long!</li>
            <li> The band is thin and the lashes are not stiff so the look natural.</li>
            <li> (makes my eyelashes grow very long -</li>
            <li> They are very long but of course you can cut them.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t very long and the lashline doesn&#x27;t hide well.</li>
            <li> The lashes, in terms of length protruding from the band, is slightly long but can be trimmed down; I personally do not trim it.</li>
            <li> The band was pretty tough ..</li>
            <li> Even after flexing the band a few times, couldn&#x27;t really apply them because they were so stiff.  </li>
            <li> very nature, hard for other people to find out.</li>
            <li> Very natural looking, and long, with out being overly thick or dramatic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have short straight Asian lashes and when I have these nobody can tell I have fake lashes one.</li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;ll be wearing false ones for real!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-About half into the 8 hour work day, the lashes will lose their bend and detach from the middle of the eyelid</li>
            <li> They are 100% human hair, the lashes are longer than I&#x27;d optimally like, and the band they are attached to is stiffer and looks like black eyeliner when I wear them.  </li>
            <li> Quality for less and same as I would buy at stores for $4.00 a pair</li>
            <li> They are fairly simple to apply, but they are definitely not reusable and if you make an application mistake you are not able to correct anything.</li>
            <li> I used a dark lash glue by Ardell and have since, if you utilize the lashes correctly, you only need a little liner towards the inner and outer corners of your lids as there is no color to the strip that lashes are attached to.</li>
            <li> trying to build my makeup artist kit...had to cut the ends a little because of the extra band</li>
            <li> I ordered 50 packs because  I wear lashes daily so somedays when I want them a little thicker</li>
            <li> They also have a little bit of untrimmed extra spine for you to hold onto and guide it into position.  </li>
            <li> you may have to trim a little if your lashes are short like mine.</li>
            <li> The lashes are so soft I can hardly feel them when running my fingers on them.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes came in the mail wet and one pair was effected by the water.</li>
            <li> They came sooner then expected.</li>
            <li> Slightly harder to apply.</li>
            <li> not much of a difference with or without it.  </li>
            <li> but expected to be</li>
            <li> A month as expected</li>
            <li> the lash line and apply mascara after they&#x27;re on) and only my cosmetologist/ esthetic collegues who have seen me without lashes can tell they&#x27;re not mine after looking for a few moments.</li>
            <li> I did have to trim the length of them down because they looked a bit long otherwise.</li>
            <li> they are really long too so if you want them shorter, just trim them down.</li>
            <li> but when I went there I discovered some other false eyelashes to try and ordered two pair - one their #100 Basic Layered Eyelash ($4.99 plus shipping) and the other was on sale - #206 Criss Cross Low Volume lashes for $2.99.  </li>
            <li> These lashes has a thin, and long natural look.</li>
            <li> they are a little long</li>
            <li> The lashes are a little too long for me.</li>
            <li> Before i ordered these lashes, a lot of the other reviews helped to.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend especially for people like me who usually have cut their lashes.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t keep the curve like other lashes I&#x27;ve bought online.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with glue and package came extremely damaged.</li>
            <li> This eyelashes are to small, smaller than my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> i usually get human hair lashes</li>
            <li> i tried revlon n alots of other eyelashes</li>
            <li> I use dou glue and usually wear red cherry lashes, and never have  issues like I did with these lashes</li>
            <li> The lash band is clear, which I like, but has a little hard time with holding eyelash glue.</li>
            <li> Natural looking eyelashes but not as dramatic and long as I wanted them..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to false</li>
            <li> i was a little put off for second because they looked like they would be stiff</li>
            <li> they are very thin and if this is your first time wearing them I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these</li>
            <li> These lashes are thin and very natural looking.  </li>
            <li> only success I had with these was cutting the strip to about 1/2 an inch or shorter and just gluing that small part to the outer edge of my eyelid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-There is no natural bend in the lashes and it is difficult to apply for those new to lashes</li>
            <li> only negative</li>
            <li> not worth it at all</li>
            <li> Lash band is thin and clear (&amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34;?)</li>
            <li> Only negative is that they take a month to arrive.</li>
            <li> I saw my friend using this brand of false eyelashes which looked so natural on her</li>
            <li> I like these because they are thin and natural looking and the band on them is transparent.</li>
            <li> this problem (needing to wear false eyelashes) developed, I was traveling in Europe.  </li>
            <li> Lashes are too thin to boend with natural lashes when you have mascara on.</li>
            <li> What I like about these lashes is they look so natural the clear band makes is almost impossible for any one to tell they are faulties.</li>
            <li> then you would still be let down.</li>
            <li> The corners refuse to stay down</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m out the door, and others when or the other (or both!)</li>
            <li> although really wide and not easy to shape.</li>
            <li> The lashes are very thin and they look and feel real.</li>
            <li> The only thing is to be careful when you take them out of the package because they are very delicate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a piece of black string as the band.....</li>
            <li> I however wear black eyeliner and mascara</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I cut it into half and attach it to the end of my eye.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s half the price I would pay in TW.</li>
            <li> Just not worth the trouble</li>
            <li> But their really wide so i usually have to cut alot off to use them.</li>
            <li> The one complaint is how long shipping took.</li>
            <li> Not too thick, and not too long.</li>
            <li> For under $3 for 10 pairs, how can you lose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006GKHIHQ 10 Pairs Handmade Natural Soft False Eyelashes Fake Eye Lash]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn false lashes for about 2 years on special occasions, but I wanted some that I could wear to work, that would not be to obviously fake.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn fake lashes before, so it wasn&#x27;t new to me to apply but with these, I just cannot seem to get a grip.</li>

            <li> /&gt;It takes a little bit to ship</li>
            <li> So if you want to save a little bit of money and can wait for them to arrive, go ahead and give these a try.  </li>
            <li> The box was a little beaten up when it got here</li>
            <li> but a bit longer and a little darker.</li>
            <li> I even cut them down n put them on my lower lashes!</li>
            <li> They have a clear band which seem to be difficult to locate.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like that they felt so heavy</li>
            <li> A FEW DAYS BEFORE ESTIMATED...</li>
            <li> dont waste your money on these</li>
            <li> But for everyday wear....</li>
            <li> but I would not choose them for everyday use</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product came in package marked &amp;#34;Cell phone case&amp;#34; which made me uncomfortable about Supplier&#x27;s honesty with postal import regulations.</li>
            <li> I wear false lashes daily because mine are practically not there.  </li>
            <li> They are a bit longer than I would like, as they nearly touch my brows, but that is a common problem with false eye lashes.  </li>
            <li> Lashes are very thin and natural looking.</li>
            <li> In the UK there are several very subtle \\&quot;natural\\&quot; styles by Eylure, but regrettably are not available here</li>
            <li> They are on a very thin, clear, somewhat stiff string that extends beyond where the lashes are attached (under the gold stickers that hold them on the card).  </li>
            <li> Plastic and supers stiff.</li>
            <li> They are too stiff.</li>
            <li> Definitely not on the dramatic side.</li>
            <li> however, they are quite LONG from inter to outer eye areas &amp; rather thin</li>
            <li> I bought some other fake lashes which were too long.</li>
            <li> Sometimes false lashes take over the eyes, for example when someone has smaller eyes, or they&#x27;re closer together, or are excessive for those that already have thick lashes.</li>
            <li> i have small eyes</li>
            <li> No more guilt!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the lash band to be so thin it seem to be like a piece a yarn</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re just so small</li>
            <li> I usually buy a lot of lashes when I go to Taiwan.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re from Japan, so I should have known it&#x27;d take a while, but it took about 5 months for it to come in, I actually forgot I had placed the order and was a bit confused when they showed up in the mail!</li>
            <li> The band is so thin that it is difficult to bend it to conform to natural eye shape.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re are not whats advertised on the picture, they&#x27;re really thick lashes with very little hair.</li>
            <li> the sales person says it&#x27;s a mix of diffrent eyelashes but NOT TRUE!!</li>
            <li> way too long.. they look FAKE.</li>
            <li> The reason I bought this in the first place was because I HATE</li>
            <li> The bands on these are very stiff.</li>
            <li> I like how thin the band is because its less noticeable and lighter on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> They do look natural though, so if you&#x27;re going for the dramatic Kim K look them don&#x27;t go for these!!</li>
            <li> Hard to apply without a band though cause its homemade with fish wire.</li>
            <li> stif and hard to apply</li>
            <li> and they are hard to put on my eyes</li>
            <li> Its hard to apply, cause the material were u apply the glue....</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s because the band is too hard.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very thin yet VERY long.</li>
            <li> was sent wrong lashes, i was refunded back the couple dollers it cost but never got the thin lashes i orderd.</li>
            <li> I can use a pair at least twice before tossing them.  </li>
            <li> I thought the criss cross lashes would look artificial</li>
            <li> These were difficult to place on, and the clear part makes them difficult to place.  </li>
            <li> TOO THICK</li>
            <li> Its just made of plastic and doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;ll be comfy because of the thick weft (which looks like melted plastic).</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want thick glamorous ones, then get these.</li>
            <li> only\\&quot; type of false lash for me, not a comfortable \\&quot;all</li>
            <li> however, i took off a star because the line is a bit thick.</li>
            <li> These are very thin and be careful with the sticker.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this !!</li>
            <li> I wear them everyday!!</li>
            <li> I usually pay $3 a pair at Walmart for eyelashes like these in the Revlon brand, and these are a freakin&#x27; steal!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a subtle enhancement to your natural look, day or night, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with these.</li>
            <li> Ive purchased several fake lashes, I like to give my eye lashes a break by using fake lashes and using jajoba oil</li>
            <li> Not very good quality lashes!</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is they&#x27;re not that pliable.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is that the lashes arent not taped to the box...</li>
            <li> My seller I bought from was Key bargains, BAD shipping b/c</li>
            <li> (I know you can just trim them yourself, but I&#x27;m not good at making them even b/c</li>
            <li> Not to thin or to thick.</li>
            <li> each side).&lt;br /&gt;The band on this one was stiff and unyielding, and bent the wrong way.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that the base is made from like fishing line material which is hard to form to the lash line.</li>
            <li> They need lots of trimming and are very stiff which makes them difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> These look a little too awkward and unnatural.</li>
            <li> Pull too hard or at the wrong angle</li>
            <li> thin</li>
            <li> Not a great product at all.</li>
            <li> They are really thin</li>
            <li> WORSE 2.00 DOLLARS</li>
            <li> The only thing, the packaging is annoying....</li>
            <li> They were too thin and in the photo they appear thicker and darker.</li>
            <li> They were way too thin.</li>
            <li> for the price it seems like a steal, BUT........ the lashes themselve are extreamly thin.</li>
            <li> line is THIN.</li>
            <li> I though these where too thin for me, but they could work for someone with shorter lashes.</li>
            <li> the line being thick, it feels a bit uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I have used high end and drugstore lashes, but these are AWFUL.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a dramatic look for a party or something, these aren&#x27;t for you.  </li>
            <li> I have always bought &#x27;dramatic&#x27; kinds which looked plastic.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re looking for something dramatic, this might not be for you...</li>
            <li> i would have took the time to again make the orded but was blind sided by amazon charging my account 85 dollers for a membership i never agreed to.</li>
            <li> sorry don&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li> really uncomfortable ..</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m frustrated and run late for work or whatever appointment I have that day.  </li>
            <li> otherwise they are useless...</li>
            <li> I thought they were shorter, but I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Way too thin, can hardly place lases on without noticing the glue! :(</li>
            <li> i really hate those stiff plastic-y lashes</li>
            <li> They are very thin indeed this is for those whom plan on not wearing any mascara or eyeliner to there eyes</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very very thin though.</li>
            <li> saw that the lash band was very thin</li>
            <li> I prefer the dramatic eye!</li>
            <li> I HATE THAT THEY TAKE SO LONG TO ARRIVE !! :(</li>
            <li> apply them by cutting the strip into 3 parts.</li>
            <li> Would recommend cutting to size and using a hair dryer to shape them</li>
            <li> cant be mad price</li>
            <li> what supports the fake eye lashes!</li>
            <li> but they make my eye look like m wearing a fake eyelashes even the boys can tell!</li>
            <li> False advertising!!</li>
            <li> these were very difficult to put on</li>
            <li> Impossible for me to get these on.</li>
            <li> bad stuff..  </li>
            <li> guess what made this purchase a bad one was the shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but looks can be decieving because i was shocked when i opened the box and ran my finger across one.</li>
            <li> I use false eyelashes often, and these were horrible.</li>
            <li> Not what was in the picture :(</li>
            <li> Worse product ever!!!</li>
            <li> the thin lash band gives you easiest application..please order now!!!</li>
            <li> ( how stupid )</li>
            <li> i hate this...</li>
            <li> but you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> very painful and annoying to deal with!</li>
            <li> they was plastic theses terrible.</li>
            <li> Horrible lashes the worst I&#x27;ve ever had,</li>
            <li> Look for lashes with a thread like base - those work wonders!</li>
            <li> horrible .</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> i have small eyes so i did cut the lashes to make it short to fit my eyes..i like how the lashes are not super long because it probably won&#x27;t look good on my eyes if the lashes are super long.I waited for a month to receive my lashes in the mailbox,i didn&#x27;t like how i waited that long but it&#x27;s worth the wait because i really like the lashes and the lashes came in good condition.The price is cheap and is free shipping so even if I don&#x27;t like the lashes i not going to be all mad about it but lucky i do like the lashes.I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very soft and natural looking. Amazing</li>
            <li> They look really natural and full.</li>
            <li> Great lashes for one time use</li>
            <li> I love them! Came quick and are gorgeous!!</li>
            <li> I so love these lashes. Took a lil while but so worth the wait, loved the price also. I will definitely be ordering more, need to stock up!! Recommend!!!!!!! Before i ordered these lashes, a lot of the other reviews helped to.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re awesome!! I can&#x27;t really say they look natural but they look pretty awesome, they definitely draw attention to the eyes!!</li>
            <li> I got these lashes because they seemed really pretty and natural. I&#x27;ve worn fake lashes before, so it wasn&#x27;t new to me to apply but with these, I just cannot seem to get a grip. The lash band is clear, which I like, but has a little hard time with holding eyelash glue. I have yet to wears these and look forward to completing a full review on them.</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are a hot mess don&#x27;t order them .I never seen lashes that short.You can not bend them you get what you pay for.The first pair I brought on here  they was plastic theses terrible.I will stick to my beauty store or walmart and pay $2.99 a pair.You can go to walmart and buy the bulk with 5 in the pack for $9.99 and they human hair.</li>
            <li> I have had these for awhile and really like them. The most I get out of a pair is two uses before it starts to become &amp;#34;gunky&amp;#34; on the band. The lashes, in terms of length protruding from the band, is slightly long but can be trimmed down; I personally do not trim it. I love how light and natural the thickness of the lashes are too.</li>
            <li> very thin i love dramatic but this is more of a natural look</li>
            <li> Item as described; speedy shipping</li>
            <li> REAL looking lashes!! No reason to go any-wear else!! Thank you for such a good product! Timely delivery. &amp;#34;Slap Happy Salon&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received them wayyyyy before I thought I would with an estimated date of June 10th  very satisfied love them they look really natural</li>
            <li> I loved how these lashed looked very natural but also a full long look; however, the plastic band was so hard it was difficult to bend it to my eye shape, the glue kept getting all over my eye and the lash kept snapping back to its straight shape. These did not work out for me! I do not recommend especially for people like me who usually have cut their lashes.</li>
            <li> Always buy these cause they&#x27;re so natural looking. Hard to apply without a band though cause its homemade with fish wire.</li>
            <li> These are very nice eyelashes and they are comfortable. I like the fact that they look so natural. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with them so far. I&#x27;ll just have to remember to use eyemake up removal so that I won&#x27;t tear off my own lashes. Then I&#x27;ll be wearing false ones for real!</li>
            <li> It came 8 months later, and was not the model I order. You can see the strip completely. not like the picture.</li>
            <li> way too long.. they look FAKE. was wanting something more natural looking</li>
            <li> I bought these and some more dramatic ones, and these are great. they were very natural looking and easy to apply. they came in the mail fast,and I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> love it really natural looking.. but i can always put mascara :)</li>
            <li> They are thin, making them more natural looking!!!i love them!!! They arrived pretty fast. They blend very well with my natural lashes!!! Very happy with these!!</li>
            <li> I wear false lashes almost every weekend and for special occasions. I have used high end and drugstore lashes, but these are AWFUL. You get what you pay for. The shape is what is the problem with them. They do not flare out or create a nice shape to the eye, which is the whole point of a false lash. You also have to snip the sides of the strip to fit your eye, kind of annoying...</li>
            <li> Mine did not come with clear bands&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a piece of black string as the band..... I didn&#x27;t know that&#x27;s how it was going to be but they do look if</li>
            <li> I love these lashes I use 2 strip on each eye to have a fuller look</li>
            <li> Great Saller 💯. Thank you!</li>
            <li> stif and hard to apply</li>
            <li> came quick. thin but I like that</li>
            <li> Look really natural on and arrive on time</li>
            <li> I use these a lot !These are great if you are not using an upper eye liner, nice clear band.</li>
            <li> Pro: They&#x27;re subtle/natural-looking&lt;br /&gt;Con: They&#x27;re really rigid/difficult to bend.&lt;br /&gt;I apply them by cutting the strip into 3 parts.</li>
            <li> These lashes are very dense and I don&#x27;t think they can be worn to pull off a natural look. Its more suited for Halloween, dramatic makeup looks, stage makeup and drag makeup. I purchased these because they were inexpensive and I had wanted to practice applying lashes. I didn&#x27;t like that they felt so heavy and they lifted at the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you want to practice applying lashes go for it but you are looking for a normal look, these are not gonna give that</li>
            <li> Great price, stays on well, I only marked it a three cus I have to cut the actual lashes because they don&#x27;t always match. Meaning the lashes have some longer &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; in certain spots.</li>
            <li> these were very difficult to put on I would not buy them again.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these twice because I love them so much. I originally purchased one box then decided to order 4 more after doing a bridal party&#x27;s makeup (where I was the Maid of Honor) with them and seeing them hold up for over 14 hours of use including dancing, hot and humid summer temperatures, and many photos. As most reviews say, they look very natural. I used these on 3 completely different complexion/ eye shape/ eye colored individuals other than myself.. Sometimes false lashes take over the eyes, for example when someone has smaller eyes, or they&#x27;re closer together, or are excessive for those that already have thick lashes. These are PERFECT for all shapes/ sizes/ lash types. I used a dark lash glue by Ardell and have since, if you utilize the lashes correctly, you only need a little liner towards the inner and outer corners of your lids as there is no color to the strip that lashes are attached to. This is another feature that I applaud. The strip is clear versus a dark color.. if used with a clear adhesive they would look even more natural! They curl amazingly with mascara and don&#x27;t really require being squeezed with a lash curler... unless you prefer that look! Anyways I highly recommend getting your hands on as many of these as possible.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes are natural but flimsy. They do not feel like natural hair but like plastic. However, I do get compliments that they look very natural. I guess they are worth the dollar, and I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> was sent wrong lashes, i was refunded back the couple dollers it cost but never got the thin lashes i orderd. i would have took the time to again make the orded but was blind sided by amazon charging my account 85 dollers for a membership i never agreed to. If i some how did agree then it wasent aparent what it was. 85 dollers isent just a mistake charge. ANYWAYS never got my lashes</li>
            <li> These lashes look beautiful and aren&#x27;t too thick. They really are a natural look. I&#x27;d recommend these to a friend.</li>
            <li> The lashes are very thin and they look and feel real. I love this lash! I will definitely reorder them again</li>
            <li> these are awesome lashes i only brought one pack to see how they where but i love i would recommend to others</li>
            <li> These are pretty long for most eye shapes but for the price, it is totally worth it. It looks really natural on but make sure to cut the sides before you put them on.</li>
            <li> Beautiful lashes .! Love them.!</li>
            <li> its fishing wire and they are hard to put on my eyes itched for 3 days. i would not recommened the price is good but not worth it. i will be purchasing different lashes that i have used before</li>
            <li> These are fantastic because they are cheap, light and durable.  They look natural and because they are light, they feel comfortable.  I can use a pair at least twice before tossing them.  If you are looking for a dramatic look for a party or something, these aren&#x27;t for you.  If you are looking for a subtle enhancement to your natural look, day or night, you won&#x27;t be disappointed with these. I haven&#x27;t used mascara on these yet, but I&#x27;d imagine that would make the eyes pop more.  Enjoy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I can think of is that it ships from China or Taiwan - so it takes a long time from ordering and actually getting them.</li>
            <li> They were flimzy and difficult to put on but the price was so good. I wanted to practice using them so I could get more expensive ones later. It worked out well for practice lashes.</li>
            <li> Perfect to add just a bit of fullness to a natural look. Flexible &amp; thin band make application incredibly easy!</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are AMAZING. They save time when you don&#x27;t want to deal with hassle of applying mascara. I absolutely adore them. Will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> These are so cheap and they&#x27;re amazing they look so natural but give my lashes that extreme umpf they need. I have short straight Asian lashes and when I have these nobody can tell I have fake lashes one. I&#x27;ll be buying way more of these.</li>
            <li> you will just need to cut them to size but totally worth the price to try them out.</li>
            <li> The shipment was fast.  The product was accurate, and a great price. Love the natural look affect too. I would recommend these to anyone!!</li>
            <li> i hate this... it doesnt not stay on my lashes so well and it doesnt hold the glue so welll either ......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different lashes, looking for something that was easy to apply, and looked natural.  I was very skeptical about these based on the price, but was really happy.  They really are soft and natural-looking, first ones I&#x27;ve tried that didn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;re wearing false eyelashes.  Can wear with or without mascara, depending on the look.  They are on a very thin, clear, somewhat stiff string that extends beyond where the lashes are attached (under the gold stickers that hold them on the card).  Recommend using a nail clipper to trim this off to where the lashes are attached.  Better than much more expensive ones ($4-$10/pair).  Easy and inexpensive enough for everyday wear.  Love these.</li>
            <li> I bought this product before, two packages, and purchased two more. I&#x27;m new to false lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap investment&lt;br /&gt;-Natural length and feel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-There is no natural bend in the lashes and it is difficult to apply for those new to lashes&lt;br /&gt;-About half into the 8 hour work day, the lashes will lose their bend and detach from the middle of the eyelid</li>
            <li> The lashes aer ok but do not buy if you need in a hurry, mine took well over a month to get to me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t receive my lashes I&#x27;ve waited for 1month &amp;1/2&lt;br /&gt;I would of liked it alot if I got a hold of it.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes aren&#x27;t tapered like most. Not much difference between right and left.</li>
            <li> They were Kind of stiff, which made it harder for me to apply. They did look very natural, not too long</li>
            <li> Not what was in the picture :( sorry don&#x27;t like them. It also took a while to get here so not even worth returning. Good price though for what it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> Just not worth the trouble</li>
            <li> Love love these. .I wanted something more natural looking and these were perfect</li>
            <li> First of all let me start off by saying i love these lashes.!&lt;br /&gt;i didn&#x27;t expect to get these lashes until a month but they came quite fast compared to other things i order that come from chine. i highly recommend these lashes to everyone. The Quality is quite nice they are so natural no need to add liner. If you take care of them one pair can last up to 5 uses. They are not too long and not too short they are natural. Another thing i really liked was the packaging &amp; you can out them back once you&#x27;ve used them.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing is they&#x27;re not that pliable. U need to work on the..after u work on them a bit they&#x27;re great</li>
            <li> Got these today, been waiting forever, but worth it, they look sooo natural and they are definitely soft. The package I just like it looks. Great.</li>
            <li> This eyelashes are great, best that i have bought on line. Also got deliverd exacly when expecting highly recomanded very natruel cont get eny closer to natruel than this just a very great buy.</li>
            <li> These are so soft and light, easy to work with and very natural looking.  The only downfall is they really are a wear once and your done kind of eyelash but if you don&#x27;t wear that often then a good deal for the quantity you receive.</li>
            <li> Love them! They just need to be trimmed to fit the eye and then applied with eyelash glue (bought separately). Work perfectly.</li>
            <li> however, they are quite LONG from inter to outer eye areas &amp; rather thin so I&#x27;ll have&lt;br /&gt;to wear 2 pairs together at a time. Doing this they look great (once I cut off one end)&lt;br /&gt;&amp; put the 2 pairs together.  They&#x27;re very pretty &amp; arrived within promised date &amp; price&lt;br /&gt;was excellent.</li>
            <li> Simple to put on. Long and natural. Great and affordable price. A great buy and no risks either. I love how it comes with so many too.</li>
            <li> These are very natural and easy to put on! It took forever for them to come but what do you expect when you pay $0.98 haha overal good product</li>
            <li> I love these lashes for the very natural look they give off. They are a beautiful baby doll look to them, they are thin and easy to apply. The only thing is to be careful when you take them out of the package because they are very delicate. And also you can tell they are hand crafted.</li>
            <li> I gotta get more. Night and light you don&#x27;t even know you have them on.</li>
            <li> got this today and i must say great product but at least u guys cud have include a bottle of eyelash glue loll</li>
            <li> great and they look natural</li>
            <li> These are amazing lashes!!  They have a beautiful appearance for the days I want a more natural lash look.  They have a clear band which seem to be difficult to locate.  Would not hesitate to reorder!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these lashes. Easy to use (as easy as putting false lashes can be anyway) and look very Natural. They&#x27;re light and do not fall off easily.</li>
            <li> i bought these for a major steal! i cant really complain for the price but these eyelashes are hard to contour on your lid since the actual lash strip is a string of plastic. they work as accent lashes when i cut them in half but as a full lash it is kinda hard to get it to stay on.</li>
            <li> The band was pretty tough .. You can bend it but it won&#x27;t really stay in place . really uncomfortable .. Individual lashes hairs were off .. Some short, some long not in the same area, it looks weird, cheap. You get what you pay for. Had them for a while now, only used like 4 pairs.</li>
            <li> What I like about these lashes is they look so natural the clear band makes is almost impossible for any one to tell they are faulties.</li>
            <li> bad stuff..  dont buy</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting, but you get what you pay for. Not a great product at all.</li>
            <li> You get what you paid for. Plastic and supers stiff.</li>
            <li> They are really thin but they look very natural once you apply them.</li>
            <li> Perfect, lightweight, they look very natural. I love them and it&#x27;s easy to get a dozen or more uses out of each of the lashes.</li>
            <li> I believe that every girl looks beautiful with long luscious natural looking lashes! I have always bought &#x27;dramatic&#x27; kinds which looked plastic. Meh! But I LOVE THIS SET OF LASHES! Just that, I have to cut the edges to fit my eye shape, the only thing which bothers me is that since it is supposed to look natural, the strip is really thin and I don&#x27;t know how to make it work. If not, its an absolute perfection!</li>
            <li> 5 stars, best find ever. love the eyelashes. very affordable. enjoying the new look using the Natural Black Long Fake Eyelashes</li>
            <li> Some of them were bent out of shape or fell apart when I tried to take them out of their packaging. They are really flimsy and hard to get on if you aren&#x27;t professional. I wouldn&#x27;t call the look natural but they are pretty and worth a pair of 10 for under $2 when at Walmart a set of 5 is $8</li>
            <li> I love these false eyelashes! They look very beautiful and long without looking overly thick. Very natural and the material they use feels soft and good quality. I like to use false eye lashes often so this deal is great and the quality is impressive.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little bit to ship but you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Its hard to apply, cause the material were u apply the glue.... Its like the one they use for fishing...</li>
            <li> Too long, made my lashes look spidery. I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain, since these were so inexpensive, but still! I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order again.</li>
            <li> did not like at all. They need lots of trimming and are very stiff which makes them difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> I wear false lashes daily because mine are practically not there.  They don&#x27;t look exactly like the picture but they&#x27;re really nice for how much they cost! I did have to trim the length of them down because they looked a bit long otherwise. The package was a bit squished but the lashes weren&#x27;t damaged to the point of not being able to wear them.  I would buy these again!</li>
            <li> They are too stiff. I can&#x27;t get them to stay glued. They are also shorter than my real lashes.</li>
            <li> I really like how its a clear band &#x3D;] I will forever buy these lashes and from this seller &#x3D;] TIP. use pill box strips to store your lashes!</li>
            <li> they were nice they fit well and will order more</li>
            <li> Worse product ever!!! False advertising!! the sales person says it&#x27;s a mix of diffrent eyelashes but NOT TRUE!! ALL SAME SIZE!!! WORSE 2.00 DOLLARS EVER SPEND ON THIS NOT TO SAY IT TOOK ALMOST A MONTH TO ARRIVE!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT BUY!  Had been getting individual sets for the cost of these 10!!  They were great, I use them all the time.</li>
            <li> The eyelashes came in the mail wet and one pair was effected by the water.</li>
            <li> very natural looking lashes, they are worth it if u like only wearing lashes one time and throwing them out</li>
            <li> The product was good for the price.</li>
            <li> i buy and wear to pair for a natural look look real will buy more of these they look very natual</li>
            <li> I saw my friend using this brand of false eyelashes which looked so natural on her so I wanted to give them a try. Personally they&#x27;re too long for me so what I do is, I slip off a couple lashes and stick them individually to my lash line which looks so much more natural.</li>
            <li> These are really good for a simple natural every day look! Awesome price &amp; great deal! They stay in all day!</li>
            <li> So first off, I was expecting the package to come in between Mar. 27 - Apr. 13 and it came in today, Mar. 18 (order was made on Mar. 3). The wait was definitely worth it. They weren&#x27;t destroyed through delivery. No damages or anything. The packaging was very pristine and the boxes came in a compact bubble wrap envelope.&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#x27;t expecting much with these lashes, being that it is priced very cheap, BUT they came in as shown in the photo (#31).&lt;br /&gt;It was my first time ordering lashes online and with it being very affordable, I bought two packs (20 pairs of lashes for about $2? who wouldn&#x27;t take that deal?!). I am very very very pleased! Now, I don&#x27;t have to buy a pair of lashes that cost around $5, or take steal them from my older sister. No more guilt!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried them yet, but I can&#x27;t wait to! The lashes feel and look very natural. Not too thick, and not too long. I would definitely buy these again from this seller. I would totally recommend these to anyone who likes natural looking/feeling lashes and are on a tight budget. .. So satisfied..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used false eyelashes for years and thought these would be great.  They are a bargain but do not mold to you eye as they should.  I now cut them in three sections and they go on easier that way.</li>
            <li> I HATE THAT THEY TAKE SO LONG TO ARRIVE !! :( ALMOST A MONTH, BUT ON A PLUS THEY DID ARRIVE A FEW DAYS BEFORE ESTIMATED...WHICH ISN&#x27;T THAT GREAT BUT SORTA LESSENS THE BLOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I TRIED ON A PAIR AS SOON AS I GOT THEM AND LOVED THEM, THEY ARE REALLY LONG SO YOU WILL HAVE TO TRIM THEM!!!! RIGHT AFTER I GIVE THEM A LITTLE TRIM, THESE REALLY BRING MY EYES OUT, WITHOUT LOOKING DRAG QUEENY...UNLESS YOU&#x27;RE INTO THAT, THEN KEEPING THEM CRAZY LONG WOULD PROBABLY BE BEST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THEY&#x27;RE JUST LIKE THE IMAGE, VERY NATURAL LOOKING NOT TOO THICK OR TOO FULL...MUCH LIKE MY OWN LASHES, JUST MUCH LONGER AND PRETTIER :)</li>
            <li> I do not recommend these, the packaging they came in was a cute little box but other than that I was not very amused. They don&#x27;t keep the curve like other lashes I&#x27;ve bought online. DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> Natural looking , arrived 2 weeks early !</li>
            <li> Great for practicing lash extensions on a mannequin. I would wear them too, if I wore strip lashes. They are delicate and more natural in shape than the ones you get a drug or beauty store. They take time to ship, so be patient!</li>
            <li> great price very natural!! will definitely buy again!!!!! trying to build my makeup artist kit...had to cut the ends a little because of the extra band</li>
            <li> By far the best false lashes ever. They look 100% natural . When I wear them no one even knows I have then on. Great buy and even better price.</li>
            <li> They are very thin indeed this is for those whom plan on not wearing any mascara or eyeliner to there eyes these are very sheer which is nice if you go for the natural pale eye look I however wear black eyeliner and mascara so this is not a good fit for me! they are finely made and the strip is amazingly thing which I wish all lashes came like this but overall they just are to light and thin for me I prefer the dramatic eye!</li>
            <li> they are nice! very easy to apply! they are very thin and if this is your first time wearing them I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these but if you are looking for cheap ones then yep.</li>
            <li> they look natural and i feel great when i wear them cant be mad price is nice came pretty fast in the mail too i would buy it again</li>
            <li> Lashes are very long and it is nice looking. They look natural and its in good quality. They blend well with your natural eye lashes.</li>
            <li> i am thinking of returning them,,,, do not like the quality...</li>
            <li> Shipped when it said it would. The lashes are so soft I can hardly feel them when running my fingers on them. It bends easily when applying to lashline and holds its shape extremely well which is a big plus compared to other, more expensive lashes I have tried that are very stiff. There were no defects and they are very sturdy when wearing, cleaning, and re-using. Overall I love them and will definitely re-buy when my current ones get used up.</li>
            <li> These look a little too awkward and unnatural. I don&#x27;t even wear them so they&#x27;re just sitting on my shelf.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with glue and package came extremely damaged. Two of the lashes are completely unusable.</li>
            <li> What you see is what you get !</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used them yet, but i have bought them before and I like them.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes looked very natural. All though I haven&#x27;t mastered actually wearing them they look a lot more natural then what I&#x27;ve seen in stores.</li>
            <li> Package was damaged. But overall decent lashes.</li>
            <li> i love them they are so easy to put on and for a very cheap price would higly recomend them they look really natural.</li>
            <li> They are great. They are so cheap and look very nice. The band is thin and the lashes are not stiff so the look natural. I will buy them again.</li>
            <li> I bought these after I read the reviews, and seen the pictures. They&#x27;re are not whats advertised on the picture, they&#x27;re really thick lashes with very little hair. It is very unnatural looking and feel very heavy. Horrible lashes the worst I&#x27;ve ever had, but hey you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These are way better than store bought lashes.  The part that the glue goes on is a lot thinner than the ones you find at walmart.  They are flexible and look very natural.  These are an AWESOME deal!  I will definitely order more!</li>
            <li> This eyelashes are to small, smaller than my eyelashes. They look bigger in the picture, but they are not. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this !! Don&#x27;t recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> dont waste your money on these</li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s a natural look, but the condition in which it came keeps me from applying.  It&#x27;s really hard to apply to lid and most came straight or crooked instead in an arc.  You get what you pay for.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;d have an easier time with it if shaped properly.</li>
            <li> Love them. There even reusable.</li>
            <li> Have not fallen apart from being washed (lightly scrubbed) multiple times. The only thing, the packaging is annoying.... They come attached to the paper at the end so you have to rip them out , not a big deal though.  Also, just a tip: you should wet and leave drying on a curved surface because they come packaged straight.</li>
            <li> Have not try them on yet! The Only think I don&#x27;t like is that it has plastic what supports the fake eye lashes! N it took 2 months or so to arrive to my house!</li>
            <li> Was expecting something different. Its just made of plastic and doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;ll be comfy because of the thick weft (which looks like melted plastic).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these lashes! They look so natural, it&#x27;s amazing for the price. They blend so well with your real lashes. I will be buying more :-)</li>
            <li> Love the look on me very pretty</li>
            <li> I love these!! It beats paying all this money at the salon!!! It&#x27;s the same thing they have!!</li>
            <li> Some are great and some are not. Not bad for the price though....</li>
            <li> these came exactly as described. they are great for me because im just beginning to use these so i need lots of trials and with these ones i get a lot of opportunities and i didn&#x27;t have to spend a lot of money on them</li>
            <li> These are friggin awesome. If you don&#x27;t put them on just right, they will bother you a little. Oh well. Price of being beautiful but if you&#x27;re super sensitive to that stuff, then only buy these if you really know what you&#x27;re doing and have worn eye lashes a lot.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting the lash band to be so thin it seem to be like a piece a yarn .. But overall , it was alright and made my lash look natural</li>
            <li> A month after ordering these eyelashes, I finally got them! I understand they were being shipped from far away but come on, 30 days??? Beside that, they are fantastic. They are thin wispy lashes, but I think thats whats makes them look good. They look real... they are really long too so if you want them shorter, just trim them down. This is a better deal for better quality eyelashes than the ones you&#x27;d get at walmart or target. And when you are a poor college student like me, paying this little for such a nice product is worth it! If you are patient, I recommend getting them!</li>
            <li> The bands on these are very stiff. they&#x27;re alright for costume makeup but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them for daily wear.</li>
            <li> Well.... While these lashes aren&#x27;t EXACTLY as they appear in the picture I still like them. They&#x27;re very very thin though. I ordered 50 packs because  I wear lashes daily so somedays when I want them a little thicker I just double them. They do look natural though, so if you&#x27;re going for the dramatic Kim K look them don&#x27;t go for these!! But for everyday wear.... They&#x27;re Goooooood!</li>
            <li> They were too thin and in the photo they appear thicker and darker. You would have to glue about 2 or 3 of them to get the look you want. The price was great but not worth the hassle that will come wearing the lashes to me.</li>
            <li> I have been a professional makeup artist for 17 years and while I typically purchase lashes of higher price ranges to insure quality, I was not overwhelmingly disappointed by these lashes.&lt;br /&gt;I admit, they are stiff but all you have to do is run your nail across the lash line in a curved position a few times and they loosen right up.&lt;br /&gt;They are really long (width of eye), which I like so that I can cut on both ends of the lash for the most natural appearance and comfort. I always try out products on myself before my clients and these were light, natural, and long wearing (I use waterproof dark tinted glue; current brand-Revlon Dark Lash Adhesive).&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for about ten cents a lash, I&#x27;m satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Not very good quality lashes!</li>
            <li> These are just normal, easy to put on eyelashes. No complaints at all. Plus the box is cute.</li>
            <li> They are very long but they are soft and high quality. This particular brand of lashes are very popular among night markets in Taiwan</li>
            <li> Beautiful, well-made and natural-looking!  Excellent product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat these for the price.  I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I like these because they are thin and natural looking and the band on them is transparent. That being said, the band is too straight to apply directly to your eyelid so what I do is, before trimming the ends, I hold both of them together so that the lash forms into a circle and hold it like that for 20-30 seconds. That gives it a bit of a curvature and it really helps with applying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked that these are packaged with tiny gold dot stickers, so that they do not fly all over the place during shipping. They arrived ne day after the beginning of the estimated arrival date in perfect shape to me. for the price, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not the type to wear lashes therefore i&#x27;m not that great when putting them on but these lashes are so easy to put on and they stay put so well.&lt;br /&gt;very good for the price!</li>
            <li> Wish it came with the glue.</li>
            <li> I actually really liked them , just they were darker but over I like them</li>
            <li> Amazing! I have thick and medium long eyelashes already so these were perfect to add a little more length without them looking extra bulky and thick, everyone is usually surprised they&#x27;re fake lol</li>
            <li> They were way too thin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve written this review about a very similar product, but I think the information contained will help here as well.  I&#x27;ve bought them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to a temporary loss of my own lashes (not a total loss, but they are very, very short just now) it is necessary for me to wear false eyelashes.  Until this happened about a month ago, I&#x27;d only worn them once, and they were put on by a make up artist, so I&#x27;ve had to learn a lot on my own.  I really have benefited from the product reviews that other women have posted on Amazon and am so grateful for the help.  That is why i wanted to share my experience here.  I am looking to have natural lashes, perhaps with the best mascara application on, not to be glamorous or obvious or as evening wear.  That alone eliminates a lot of the options here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an experiment I bought these lashes, which come in a pack of 10 pairs as well.  [[ASIN:B007PY4QV8 New Thin 10 Pair Natural Black Long Fake False Eyelashes Eye Lash Makeup]]  They appeared to be identical to the ones I mention in the next paragraph, and they arrived today, from Hong Kong.  I can say that the packages look identical, the lashes also look identical, and the labels on the packages are identical.  So if you want to save a little bit of money and can wait for them to arrive, go ahead and give these a try.  For under $3 for 10 pairs, how can you lose?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B006GKHIHQ 10 Pairs Handmade Natural Soft False Eyelashes Fake Eye Lash]] These lashes are quite nice.  The hair is very soft, as is the band onto which it is attached.  They are a bit longer than I would like, as they nearly touch my brows, but that is a common problem with false eye lashes.  In experimenting with different types and different brands, I&#x27;ve learned the advantages and disadvantages of each.  Soft banded lashes like these are very comfortable to wear because there is no stiff corner to poke you when blinking.  On the other hand, when the band is so soft and flexible it can make it a bit more difficult to place the lash securely against the edge of your eyelid by pushing gently on the lash tips themselves or on the band.  It can tend to shift or move, whereas lashes that have a stiffer band can be more easily nudged against the edge of the lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One tip I can offer is to let the adhesive set up for a good 20-30 seconds.  You want it to be tacky or sticky and not \\&quot;wet\\&quot; when placed against the lid so it will \\&quot;stick\\&quot;.  I tend not to wait long enough, and when the adhesive is wet it just won&#x27;t \\&quot;hold\\&quot;.  These lashes do not come with any adhesive, by the way.  There is adhesive in black, white, and clear.  I tend to favor the white.  It will generally dry reasonably invisibly, but if you need to you can always use some virtually black eyeshadow powder and a very skinny slanted brush to gently dab along the lash strip as an \\&quot;eyeliner\\&quot; to fill in any gaps between the lash strip and your own lashes, or to cover up any adhesive that may be showing.  One problem with clear adhesive, I&#x27;ve discovered much to my surprise, is that it is impossible to tell where you&#x27;ve applied it to the lash strip, how thickly it has been applied, and while it sounds like a good idea, I&#x27;ve stopped using the clear one I bought as a result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These lashes can be reused, and with care you can probably get 2-3-4 wearings out of them.  They are basically disposable, but i would say that you don&#x27;t have to toss them after one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this problem (needing to wear false eyelashes) developed, I was traveling in Europe.  I found the UK brand Eylure to have the best, most natural looking lashes, but they are very hard to find here in the US.  One of the \\&quot;Naturalites\\&quot; line of Eylure is available here on Amazon: [[ASIN:B000ORSICQ Eylure Naturalites Natural Volume - 020 - Adhesive Included]]  They do come with a tiny bottle of adhesive, and I&#x27;ve taken to carrying one in my purse at all times for emergency re-gluing.  These particular lashes are very fine, have variable length, like natural lashes, and certainly look the most \\&quot;normal\\&quot;.  Because they are so fine they are particularly fragile so take care and you may be able to get 2-3 wearings out of them.  They are also $6.99 each pair, so are much more expensive than certainly either of these two sets of ten pairs are, and more than the Ardell brand lashes that are commonly available in the US.  In the UK there are several very subtle \\&quot;natural\\&quot; styles by Eylure, but regrettably are not available here that I can find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These Ardell \\&quot;demure\\&quot; lashes are available on Amazon as a single pair or in this pack of four pairs for $14.76. [[ASIN:B003ZS1OCW Ardell Fashion Lashes Pair - Demure (Pack of 4)]]  They are fuller than the Eylure, but not as long as the lashes in the 10 pair pack mentioned above. The description on Amazon says \\&quot;they may be reused up to three weeks\\&quot;.  Balderdash.  I&#x27;ve not come across any brand of lash that could possible be worn for 10+ hours a day, every day, for three weeks! They are very nice subtle lashes, and seem to be somewhat more durable than the Eylure.  I like them quite a bit, so see what you think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one of the helpful reviews I&#x27;ve read here on Amazon about lashes a reviewer mentioned Headcovers.com, a website for women with hair loss from cancer.  She praised the clear adhesive that they sell (note my comment above about that) but when I went there I discovered some other false eyelashes to try and ordered two pair - one their #100 Basic Layered Eyelash ($4.99 plus shipping) and the other was on sale - #206 Criss Cross Low Volume lashes for $2.99.  I&#x27;ve not yet tried the first pair, but the Criss Cross one turns out to be one of my favorites.  I thought the criss cross lashes would look artificial but I&#x27;m assured they don&#x27;t.  They are 100% human hair, the lashes are longer than I&#x27;d optimally like, and the band they are attached to is stiffer and looks like black eyeliner when I wear them.  But once you get the banda bit more flexible by wearing or by gently rolling them around a finger to make it softer, I&#x27;ve found that because the band IS stiff it is a bit easier to place correctly.  With tacky adhesive it is easy to gently press down on the lash tips to put some gentle pressure on the lash band to adhere to my lid.  I was surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there are some days that both lashes go on just right the first time and I&#x27;m out the door, and others when or the other (or both!) just will not seat properly and I&#x27;m frustrated and run late for work or whatever appointment I have that day.  I never know how it will turn out.  But it does get easier with practice.  And I think that by the time I&#x27;m very adept with them my own lashes will have grown in enough that with some favorite mascara, I&#x27;ll be good to go.  Or maybe I&#x27;ll decide that I love wearing false eyelashes every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I hope this has been helpful.  Thanks to all of you who took the time to write in about other similar products.  I couldn&#x27;t have done this without you!</li>
            <li> i love this false lashes,it is natural and great, the length is not long, but it is not too short for me. when i put it on, it seems nothing on me, but i feel better than my real lashes ( bc i dont have too much..lol)</li>
            <li> Quality for less and same as I would buy at stores for $4.00 a pair</li>
            <li> Came in earlier than expected. Love the quality! P.s. I am a real customer :)</li>
            <li> Great, would buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> For the price they&#x27;re ok, but they&#x27;re frankly too short when it says &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; don&#x27;t plan on purchasing again.</li>
            <li> i like it but it does not stay well on my eye lid if i trim it.&lt;br /&gt;hope the lashes are shorter on both ends.</li>
            <li> Nice lashes! Goal was to find natural looking ones. They are great for this reason. Would recommend them to any lash wearer!</li>
            <li> Ordered date: 11/10&lt;br /&gt;Estimated delivery date: 12/10-12/17&lt;br /&gt;Arrival date: 11/19&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Came way earlier than expected. Packaging was okay... Wasn&#x27;t the best. The box was a little beaten up when it got here but the inside product was beautiful. 10 pairs of gorgeously made lashes! I put them on today and they look amazing. Not drag. Not dramatic. Simply beautiful. They&#x27;re much longer than my natural Asian lashes so it will take some getting use to but I&#x27;m loving them more and more every time I look in the mirror. Already had a lot of compliments! Will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> These lashes are nice but not something for me because I like the human hair lashes. I didn&#x27;t read and just assumed. But if you like any kind of lash than you would like these.</li>
            <li> What you pay for is what you get...&lt;br /&gt;I saw that the lash band was very thin so I thought it would be a breeze to put on just like all the others I have (I put them on in 5 seconds each side).&lt;br /&gt;The band on this one was stiff and unyielding, and bent the wrong way. It simply would not conform to the shape of my eye so I just threw it back in the box and put on the other ones that I have. It probably going into the bin or.... to put in my bathroom to scare people.</li>
            <li> Very nice but doesn&#x27;t have a nice bend .</li>
            <li> looks more natural than many others sold like this, however most of the lashes fall off while removing them from the carton.</li>
            <li> Took way to leong to get here and they are by far the hardest things to apply. They are threaded?  Just different I guess.</li>
            <li> Normally, i wont even go for these 10 pack eyelashes online because they just look so cheap and as fake as they can get. These are really really nice for the price! I love how you could use them for very natural looks or double them up for a night out.</li>
            <li> Loved thse lashes.  They are light weight. cant feel them when I have them on. Also very natural.  I have full lashes naturally so I dont like the dramatic look, and these are perfect to give the extra fullness without the fake look.</li>
            <li> I just received these today. They look natural and the strip is comftorble to wear. I am overall happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> i like it lot, i don&#x27;t wear them often but it really good if good glue n it suit me, matching my lashing</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when i got these lashes in the mail because i wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be so nice. these are definitely more natural looking than the $6 fake lashes here in the states. I like how thin the band is because its less noticeable and lighter on my eyelids. If you want them to be perfect you can always trim them accordingly and I am going to be buying from this brand again. I prefer the $6 individual lash set to this but these are good for more casual days and you cant beat the price. Shipping took about a week or two which is understandable because they are coming from far away. If you&#x27;re looking for natural light sets of lashes for a good deal these are perfect.</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, they look so natural when worn and were super cheap. I would recommend them to anyone</li>
            <li> for the price it seems like a steal, BUT........ the lashes themselve are extreamly thin. not worth it at all</li>
            <li> I waited forever for these lashes but overall they were decent quality. They are dramatic but they do give off a nice full volume look.</li>
            <li> if you expert at putting eyelashes then no difficulty. blend in well. looks natural but if you are a beginner like me . take and hour extra..will take a while to put it on. but once you got it on...mama mia...gorgeous is what you look naturally.</li>
            <li> These are nice and long...but they&#x27;re like too straight. They don&#x27;t curve up like others do.</li>
            <li> Love these!! They look natural and easy to apply!</li>
            <li> I love these lashes! They came sooner then expected. Also the bands are clear and easy to apply and they&#x27;re natural and light weight I wear them everyday!!</li>
            <li> These lashes did not add any length for my lashes. My natural lashes are longer. They would only work if you barely have lashes.</li>
            <li> The lashes are very natural looking. Unlike other cheap lashes, these lashes come with clear bands. If you want something that is natural looking but also enhances your lashes at the same time, they are the ones to go to!</li>
            <li> Worth the money... while the backing is kinda flimsy they are adorable and very realistic.  For 10 pair it&#x27;s an awesome deal and came in 3 days!</li>
            <li> CAME super fast which I wasn&#x27;t expecting at all. The only bad thing is that the lashes arent not taped to the box...it has the hole that goes in and you have  to pull it out. The reason I bought this in the first place was because I HATE THOSE HOLE S*** and now I bought one that has that. Pisses me off hardcore not gonna lie.</li>
            <li> Perfect length. although really wide and not easy to shape. Would recommend cutting to size and using a hair dryer to shape them so they stay better</li>
            <li> i jussstt got these today and i really like them. i usually get human hair lashes but i couldnt pass these up so cheap! i stuck with these because the thicker ones i saw on here didnt look like they would be soft and look really odd. when i opened the packaging and ripped off the bubble wrap i was a little put off for second because they looked like they would be stiff but looks can be decieving because i was shocked when i opened the box and ran my finger across one. it was really really soft. i really hate those stiff plastic-y lashes so i was pretty happy with how these felt. they are a little long so i trimmed a little bit of the side off but other than that i really really like them and plan on buying again</li>
            <li> It is fair enough. Good product, good price.</li>
            <li> exactly what i was looking for, theyre big but not as ridiculous as some. i wear them out on the weekend and i would definitely buy them again! the strip that the eyelashes are attached to isnt too obvious, like other cheap options i have tried from amazon</li>
            <li> I got these for .01 cent!  I don&#x27;t know why they only cost a penny but for that price I should have ordered 100.  They are nice and soft and pretty subtle.  The only reason I gave them only four stars is because they don&#x27;t really taper at the inside corners like natural lashes do so you do have to trim but not a big deal.  Also these lashes do not come with adhesive.</li>
            <li> First of all, it is cheap and of good quality.&lt;br /&gt;It also looks natural because it has a clear base.&lt;br /&gt;I can even wear it with no eyeliner, because itself would define my eyeliner pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I cut it into half and attach it to the end of my eye.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I like these lashes. They give body and length and help make my eyes pop when i wear makeup! i would purchase again. Definitely worth the money</li>
            <li> I just got these and I have to say they are absolutely amazing and all natural! I cant wait to wear them tomorrow! I am so happy with the product, I highly recomend.</li>
            <li> Not to thin or to thick. Natural looking perfect length.</li>
            <li> Natural looking eyelashes but not as dramatic and long as I wanted them..</li>
            <li> Ive purchased several fake lashes, I like to give my eye lashes a break by using fake lashes and using jajoba oil (makes my eyelashes grow very long - I suspect this is like sort of like a conditioner like action not a nourishment miracle growth type deal).  These were difficult to place on, and the clear part makes them difficult to place.  Look for lashes with a thread like base - those work wonders!</li>
            <li> Really natural looking lashes and came pretty quick even coming from China.</li>
            <li> These are very thin and be careful with the sticker. Pull too hard or at the wrong angle and you&#x27;re getting a funky lash. Now they&#x27;re lightweight and very flimsy so be light handed with the glue (hence Kiss glue) after you sizr them to your eye. Looks natural and mascara looks like you&#x27;re just adding to your own. I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;re for beginners but for the price you can wear it out. It took me several times before I got it (getting them applied) but also realized later I liked better lashes! Kiss glue you don&#x27;t need very much so it&#x27;s lightweight and would be great for these. Can&#x27;t say they&#x27;re reusable however, (hence $) not that big a fuss. Hopes this helps!</li>
            <li> I apply these to my own eyes and tried them but really like a thicker one the quality works though, but I like them thicker!</li>
            <li> They look great but the lashes fell off the clear band while trying to creat a little curve before gluing them down:(</li>
            <li> Love these lashes. Better quality then some of your more expensive ones. Will definitely buy more. Have already recommend these ro my friend&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> they had a plastic lining and was hurting my eyes. i dont really like it, im not using this anymore.</li>
            <li> very nature, hard for other people to find out.</li>
            <li> I really liked them !</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY happy with the lashes. Box was a little beat up but lashes were in perfect condition. Looks exactly like the picture. Highly recommend for daily wear if you don&#x27;t mind length. Lash band is thin and clear (&amp;#34;invisible&amp;#34;?) so blending with real lashes should not be a problem. Will be ordering more in the future! Only negative is that they take a month to arrive.</li>
            <li> they are not dark enough</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good . Not plasticky, fine hair and easy to apply. I highly recommend it... And the price is very very reasonable as you noticed 😁</li>
            <li> Love these lashes. If you don&#x27;t want thick glamorous ones, then get these. These are very natural and stay on really good. Easy to apply close to lashes.</li>
            <li> Sooo natural looking, fell in love with these. Slightly harder to apply. Not stiff. Will definitely re-order and recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Each set of lashes is hand-made, so some vary slightly in overall length of lashes, but I still really like them. I will say that they are definitely for a more natural look; they look just slightly longer and thicker than my actual lashes. So if you&#x27;re looking for something dramatic, this might not be for you... it&#x27;s more of an everyday look. They are a little long on the sides where they are stickered onto the packaging, but are very easy to trim. Also, the band that holds the lashes is extremely thin and I&#x27;m pretty sure these are only meant for a one or two time use, but if you take really good care of them and peel the adhesive glue completely off after each use, you can definitely extend their use.</li>
            <li> I cut these in a quarter size to use at the end of both of my eye. It is best value and works well for me.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful at first glance. They&#x27;re very thin yet VERY long. They have a clear flexible wire-like material for a band. I use DUO eyelash glue which usually works top notch with every other falsies and I&#x27;ve never had a problem until I got these. They were beautiful when I put them on but they don&#x27;t stick on for long! It only takes around an hour for the wires to fight against the glue. I think it&#x27;s because the band is too hard. I would not recommend if you plan on actually wearing it out... I was so embarrassed! I didn&#x27;t have extra glue on hand with me at that time but even if I did, it would be very troublesome to replace the glue every hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping is \\&quot;free\\&quot; but it takes around a month or more for the item to arrive..</li>
            <li> its the same as my natural lash. this is my mistake. i want it natural but a bit longer and a little darker. basically this just gives me a slight more volume. if that make sense. I guess it a good for daily work look?. this for natural no makeup look.. to me its like blah. not much of a difference with or without it.  but expected to be &amp;#34;black long&amp;#34; so yea this is not for me.</li>
            <li> Look very real, has a clear strip instead of the big black one holding the lashes together which I really love makes it look way more real</li>
            <li> So beautiful, I&#x27;m ordering more for a friend. Very natural looking, and long, with out being overly thick or dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for daytime usage, Attention getting but not crazy over the top.</li>
            <li> These definately took. While to get here. A month as expected but they came undamaged. I gave them 3 stars because they&#x27;re tiny. If you have long eyelashes or big eyes don&#x27;t buy them. They&#x27;re more like for if you have no eyelashes at all they&#x27;re just so small I put 2 pairs of them on in order for you to even notice them. They&#x27;re obviously natural looking because you can&#x27;t barely tell they are there. If you have no eyelashes this would be a good buy for you. Just not the look I was going for and that&#x27;s my fault I guess I shouldn&#x27;t have been so cheap.</li>
            <li> The lashes are good as far as fullness, they don&#x27;t look fake. The price was great on them, so that&#x27;s a &amp;#34;win&amp;#34; I would purchase these again definitely and would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> these lashes dont look realistic and i have to cut them because they are to long ehic causes the plastic part to poke my eye when i blink. very painful and annoying to deal with! I only use them for events like halloween or event like that otherwise they are useless...</li>
            <li> Easy to apply on and totally worth it. i wear them every time there is a special occasion. And although they&#x27;re not that thick because its for a more natural look, a bit of mascara can fix that. i just love these eyelashes in general &amp; im glad i purchased them</li>
            <li> These dont really stay when you try to shape them before you put them on. I was helping a friend put these on and they started to come off very quickly, even with the best glue that i&#x27;ve ever used. They are very long but of course you can cut them. They are very natural which is nice, they last decently long. Overall they are okay. The only problem is not being able to shape them to the curve of the eye.</li>
            <li> Loved these! I usually pay $3 a pair at Walmart for eyelashes like these in the Revlon brand, and these are a freakin&#x27; steal! Never buying eyelashes anywhere else again. Got lots of compliments on my eyes &amp; women wondering what mascara I used.</li>
            <li> It took a while to arrive but when I got them, they were better than the picture!&lt;br /&gt;Thin, natural , lashes that I could wear everyday!&lt;br /&gt;They were a steal!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s Beautiful and very practical, I like it so much, I would recommend to all buy this stuff, you Will not regret.</li>
            <li> EDIT: I&#x27;ve had these lashes for a while now, and I have to say, that I don&#x27;t wear them often.  They look great, but they feel irritating, as I&#x27;ve found all synthetic lashes do on me.  I guess I just have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clear spine ends, and the lash knots on these things are so sharp. They poke my eyelids at their most vulnerable points.  These are a \\&quot;for pictures only\\&quot; type of false lash for me, not a comfortable \\&quot;all day\\&quot; type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These lashes are made of synthetic material, but still look like soft human hair.  I do wish they had tapered ends, but they are fine enough and fanned out nicely that the blunt ends don&#x27;t put me off or look fake like I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lashes don&#x27;t have a \\&quot;side\\&quot; so they can go on either the left or the right lash line without it looking backwards.  They also have a little bit of untrimmed extra spine for you to hold onto and guide it into position.  If you&#x27;re an experienced lash wearer, then you can just chop them off.  If you find them itchy at the ends, trim off a hair knot or two, or as many as you need before you don&#x27;t get that poking sensation.  It won&#x27;t impact the visuals, but will go a long way towards your comfort.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The line is THIN. which makes it easier to put on and more realistic looking.&lt;br /&gt;The eye lashes are also thin, (if that&#x27;s the look you&#x27;re going for. For me, it was)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess what made this purchase a bad one was the shipping.&lt;br /&gt; The inner corners of the eye lashes are not shorter for a realistic look. (I know you can just trim them yourself, but I&#x27;m not good at making them even b/c I&#x27;ve tried.)&lt;br /&gt; My seller I bought from was Key bargains, BAD shipping b/c they just put it in a envelope thing.&lt;br /&gt;it had no protection at all, the lashes&#x27; white box it comes in was smashed in the middle, it&#x27;s not even good for storing the lashes any more.&lt;br /&gt;besides that the whole box was smushed-ish so the lashes are all FLAT...&lt;br /&gt;I know you can just curl them once you have them glued to your eye, but it&#x27;s gonna be a hassle to make it even and so on for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll still use them, b/c I bought them.&lt;br /&gt;But for the hassle of how it arrived, I&#x27;ll just buy from walmart.  The have a set very similar to this around the same price and the quality is BETTER.</li>
            <li> These are very natural looking (I wear all styles of lashes) I even cut them down n put them on my lower lashes! These are a must have in your makeup collection!</li>
            <li> I have a decent amount of experience with lashes, but I really only wear them for special occasions or when going out at night. I ordered these with the hopes that I could use them on a more &amp;#34;everyday&amp;#34; basis.&lt;br /&gt;The problems I had were numerous. The lashes themselves are much too long and won&#x27;t look natural unless you are part camel. You have to trim them or they will probably hit your eyebrows when your eyes are open.&lt;br /&gt;On the same note, the strip is also too long. I have pretty big eyes but had to cut at least a third of the strip off for it to be the length of my eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;Which brings me to the biggest problem: the strip is not curved at all and does not stayed curved no matter how much you bend it before applying the lashes to your lid. This makes the edges pop off of your lid because the lash strip wants to be straight instead of curved like an eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;The only success I had with these was cutting the strip to about 1/2 an inch or shorter and just gluing that small part to the outer edge of my eyelid.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good thing these were cheap, but I&#x27;m going to stick to the lashes that actually work for human eyes. You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> I bought binding bands separately. Good for practicing</li>
            <li> These lashes give you a very natural look but they do not stick on very well. I believe that is due to the fact that they are shaped very straight, without much curve. Maybe with more glue? Oh well.</li>
            <li> you get 10 lashes and no glue, the lashes are very frail and can easily be broken and twisted, just by nicely taking off the lashes , the good thing about them are they are light on the eyes....</li>
            <li> Lashes look very natural, not too long or thick and they are quite soft. Was kind of expecting a fake plastic feel to them seeing that they were cheap but the quality of the lashes are good. Also shipping came in two weeks before the estimated delivery time!</li>
            <li> I love these lashes they are great for beginners or maybe to have variety in a freelance kit for makeup artists!!...so natural but have a nice flare to give you that flirty look;)...the thin lash band gives you easiest application..please order now!!!</li>
            <li> These are light and airy and not overly dramatic, just the right look to enhance without being over-done. I did find them a bit long but they were easy to trim to shape.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for Halloween party dress up they are of ok quality but I would not choose them for everyday use</li>
            <li> They came really quick. The lashes are a little too long for me. And it doesnt look natural.  But I figured it was way cheaper than the others so couldn&#x27;t complain</li>
            <li> I bought some other fake lashes which were too long. These look natural and aren&#x27;t too much. You can actually use these for a daily look.</li>
            <li> These are beautiful lashes. They came earlier than expected. My only gripe is that the base is made from like fishing line material which is hard to form to the lash line. Other than that, for the price they are a great buy. I would def buy from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn false lashes for about 2 years on special occasions, but I wanted some that I could wear to work, that would not be to obviously fake. my own lashes are long but I like to make them look fuller I though these where too thin for me, but they could work for someone with shorter lashes.</li>
            <li> Looks natural. Amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought a single set of these and liked them so much that I decided to order 5 more sets.  However, when I received the second order of them they were not the same lashes I had received before.  They look very similar, but are much more rigid than the last set I received and are more difficult to work with.  These lashes look more natural than other ones in the same price range so I will probably continue using them, but I wish the product hadn&#x27;t changed to this more rigid type.</li>
            <li> Very natural lookin only thing is the band is a little cheap and doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s shape but still worth the money</li>
            <li> These lashes are seriously natural. Why would you want something that looks just as short (if not shorter) than your lashes? If you are thinking of doubling them up with another type of longer lash to give it depth- then you would still be let down. save your pennies</li>
            <li> 4 *s because you have to cut the edges off in order for you to use it properly</li>
            <li> These lashes are natural looking and since i am not really a eyelash wearer these are just perfect. Also these lashes came surprisingly fast, overall good product.</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with my product, and they were very reasonable in price.  Thanks</li>
            <li> The lashes look different than the photo that was posted. I ordered lashes with a clear band and the ones I got obviously had a black band. Not too happy.</li>
            <li> I like these because they don&#x27;t have a band so easy to apply. But their really wide so i usually have to cut alot off to use them.</li>
            <li> Way too thin, can hardly place lases on without noticing the glue! :(</li>
            <li> good  price and good product</li>
            <li> i love this eyelashes! never in my life had my eyes looked big and pretty ( complimenting my self ( how stupid ) i tried revlon n alots of other eyelashes but they make my eye look like m wearing a fake eyelashes even the boys can tell! how embarrassing! when i started wearing this one my best friend was like hey ur eyes so pretty n they didnt even knw!! i love this eyelashes! its so natural!! really natural!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for natural looking eyelashes and some mascara for a dramatic look!!! They&#x27;re also reusable !can&#x27;t believe the price !  Perfect love them!</li>
            <li> Lash bands are straight--hard to make them conform to lash line. Hoping that a good glue will help; lashes appear well made otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product came in package marked &amp;#34;Cell phone case&amp;#34; which made me uncomfortable about Supplier&#x27;s honesty with postal import regulations.</li>
            <li> I love it these false eyelashes so much! They are not too much and not too little, they look so natural!!!</li>
            <li> I got because I feel like my lashes are lacking in thickness. I thought they were shorter, but I was wrong. They are particularly long. Some people may like them, but I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Perfect for daily wear, they are long enough to be used on multiple eye widths and are basically unnoticable as false (I tight line the lash line and apply mascara after they&#x27;re on) and only my cosmetologist/ esthetic collegues who have seen me without lashes can tell they&#x27;re not mine after looking for a few moments. I just ordered 4 more packs well worth the money</li>
            <li> I usually buy a lot of lashes when I go to Taiwan. But now I don&#x27;t have to! These are the same exact product as the one I bought in TW. The best thing about it, it&#x27;s half the price I would pay in TW. I got my shipment super quick and the box is in mint condition. I will definitely buy more of these lashes!</li>
            <li> Yes they worked out great  Can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
            <li> A bit too long for my eyes but easy to cut. Lashes tend to pull off rather easily and are not as flexible as I would like but considering the cost they are worth the purchase. Definitely not quality ones to wash and reuse but if you&#x27;re looking to have a fresh pair and wear them regularly I definitely recommend them, They definitely add length, not a lot of thickness but easily able to apply mascara.</li>
            <li> The band is thin and the lashes are comfortable to wear....at this price, I rarely feel the need to reuse them, however, they do hold up nicely for multiple uses</li>
            <li> Lashes are very thin and natural looking. Love it.</li>
            <li> These lashes are thin and very natural looking.  I just got them and will be trying them tomorrow. The lash band should make them very easy to apply to the eyes.</li>
            <li> They are fairly simple to apply, but they are definitely not reusable and if you make an application mistake you are not able to correct anything. They take a long time to arrive so if you plan on ordering, order a whole bunch at a time.</li>
            <li> I love them! Super thin and natural these are so much better and well worth the wait! Must buy ☺️😁😁</li>
            <li> Super stiff.  Even after flexing the band a few times, couldn&#x27;t really apply them because they were so stiff.  I use false eyelashes often, and these were horrible.</li>
            <li> I keep attempting to purchase these lashes but I&#x27;m only wasting my time it says there was an error.  Yet I purchased another product and worked just fine</li>
            <li> Lashes look very natural which I really like. I just don&#x27;t like the clear plastic band.</li>
            <li> They took quite a while to get here and are thinner than they looked in description.</li>
            <li> OK.  However, they are very flimsy compared to other ones I have bought cheaply.  They aren&#x27;t very long and the lashline doesn&#x27;t hide well.</li>
            <li> Lashes are too thin to boend with natural lashes when you have mascara on. The band is so thin that it is difficult to bend it to conform to natural eye shape. I had to use extra glue to make them stick and they still didn&#x27;t  last all day . I use dou glue and usually wear red cherry lashes, and never have  issues like I did with these lashes</li>
            <li> Impossible for me to get these on. The corners refuse to stay down and I use good eyelash glue. Very affordable, but I would not repurchase.</li>
            <li> horrible . my eyelashes came all squished and not wearable. took almost 2months.</li>
            <li> Love the lashes! Very natural looking.</li>
            <li> So pretty! Easy to apply too!</li>
            <li> I love these lashes. you may have to trim a little if your lashes are short like mine. really natural looking. so beautiful. however, i took off a star because the line is a bit thick. so you will have to hold it a bit while to stay. not only that but the line being thick, it feels a bit uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> These lashes are simply beautiful. They feel and look natural. Nice enhancement without looking gaudy or fake. Really like these lashes.</li>
            <li> I like how natural they look and the invisible band but not all of them are identical.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just kind of cheaply made but then again, it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than the ones from the store.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pretty satisfied and okay with them.</li>
            <li> I like the human hair lashes best</li>
            <li> The eye lashes are very nice, soft..doesn&#x27;t look fake...love them..ive order my 4th box..</li>
            <li> These are perfect for everyday wear very natural looking. Definitely not on the dramatic side.</li>
            <li> Very good quality lashes once you do your own DIY to it. They are super long (horizontally) so you do have to trim them down a bit to fit your eyes, which I don&#x27;t mind, I like to shape eyelashes to fit me perfectly anyways. The one complaint is how long shipping took. They&#x27;re from Japan, so I should have known it&#x27;d take a while, but it took about 5 months for it to come in, I actually forgot I had placed the order and was a bit confused when they showed up in the mail!</li>
            <li> These lashes has a thin, and long natural look. The band does not curve, but you can bend it yourself into a curved shape. It&#x27;s good for it&#x27;s price. Good luck!</li>
