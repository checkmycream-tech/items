            <li>Great and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Like it because it is perfect for daytime wear - not too much &amp;#34;glisten.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>If you use this on it&#x27;s own, the powder falls off rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shades can be sutle, or you can build on that and make it more striking depending on whether it is for day wear, or evening wear.</li>

            <li>I tried this eye shadow at the very last minute and im happy</li>

            <li>My sister likes this because the colors are what she uses all the time and it make it good to use daily with the colors</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve used this eye shadow quad for years and have received many compliments on my eyes, using the FORMER champagne pearl shade under the brow and especially the taupe shade I used in the crease before applying the darker brown.</li>
            <li>the brush it comes with is the classic eye shadow brush</li>
            <li>eye primer will help it stay on and look vibrant for longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The main color I wanted was the dusty rose looking color in the upper right corner</li>
            <li>Maybe they were old and faded???</li>
            <li>Was unable to find a suitable match in this year&#x27;s offerings.  </li>
            <li>and I found that it was applying either too dark or too much in one area</li>

            <li> Love this product, I was disappointed when I could no longer get it at Wal-mart.  </li>

            <li> It stays where I put it and doesn&#x27;t get dull looking after several hours of wear.</li>
            <li> I thought it would go on as dark as it shows in the compact...</li>
            <li> I have bought a few of these.</li>

            <li> The colors have changed slightly from the old one, which was disappointing tp me.  </li>
            <li> Two of the four shadow colors were broken into pieces  </li>
            <li> Color was wrong.</li>
            <li> Close, but still wrong.</li>
            <li> Very unhappy and frustrated customer!</li>

            <li> Bought this color last season and really liked.  It is earthy neutral colors. Was unable to find a suitable match in this year&#x27;s offerings.  Quality product.</li>
            <li> i got this eye shodow quad in autumn leaves today and when i open it..there are no applicators?? how can this happen? the product seems to be a fake/tampered item..i did not expect this ordering from amazon</li>
            <li> I like the way the colors are coordinated. The shades can be sutle, or you can build on that and make it more striking depending on whether it is for day wear, or evening wear. I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Great colors and easy to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye shadow quad for years and have received many compliments on my eyes, using the FORMER champagne pearl shade under the brow and especially the taupe shade I used in the crease before applying the darker brown. When I realized when shopping that the usual shades in the \\&quot;Wear Infinite Eye Shadow Quad, Autumn Leaves\\&quot; had changed, I searched online for the old colors, with no luck.  Apparently L&#x27;Oreal decided to arbitrarily change the shades in this eye shadow quad but still use the same name, \\&quot;Autumn Leaves\\&quot;, and I see I&#x27;m not the only unhappy customer.  I&#x27;ve looked everywhere in an effort to find the frosted taupe shade without success. Why L&#x27;Oreal would change the shades and not the name of the eye shadow, I cannot imagine. Very unhappy and frustrated customer!</li>
            <li> I like the color scheme with my brown eyes. It stays where I put it and doesn&#x27;t get dull looking after several hours of wear.</li>
            <li> My sister likes this because the colors are what she uses all the time and it make it good to use daily with the colors</li>
            <li> Great and easy to use. No powdery shake off. Stays on for about 4 hours. Gr8 for smoky eyes. I have bought a few of these.</li>
            <li> I like the colors because they are earth tone and go with just about any thing you wear. It also has numbers on it to tell you which color goes where.</li>
            <li> It had me waiting for like 2-3 weeks! But other than that it came in perfect brand new amd a good quality of makeup! Loved it !</li>
            <li> excelente calidad muy acorde con lo ofertado,  y el tiempo estimado de entrega es justo lo que publican los felicito</li>
            <li> Love this product, I was disappointed when I could no longer get it at Wal-mart.  So I was thrilled to find it on Amazon and at a good price!!</li>
            <li> Two of the four shadow colors were broken into pieces  I was very disappointed. Not worth spending monry to mail it back so i threw it out.</li>
            <li> Could not find this in my local stores. So glad to find it online. Love the colors without wasting my money trying others.</li>
            <li> Really great color but the brush it comes with is the classic eye shadow brush and I found that it was applying either too dark or too much in one area and then it&#x27;s a pain to spread.</li>
            <li> Good colors but applicator tip fell off on the third use.</li>
            <li> Color was wrong. Close, but still wrong.</li>
            <li> I use this eye shadow everyday and let me tell u how great this colors go together. I would really recommend!</li>
            <li> I thought it would go on as dark as it shows in the compact...but you must apply several &amp;#34;layers&amp;#34; to achieve that hue. It&#x27;s L&#x27;oreal, so it&#x27;s a good product..and I&#x27;d buy these colors again.</li>
            <li> I tried this eye shadow at the very last minute and im happy I did very good. And it came on time.</li>
            <li> Great colors! Stays on until I lick it off!! She can&#x27;t keep me off her now! What are we gonna do?! We got 3 kids already.. dam</li>
            <li> Been using this shadow for a few years.  Like it because it is perfect for daytime wear - not too much &amp;#34;glisten.&amp;#34;  Very soft colors and the two lighter colors provide nice highlights.</li>
            <li> I have used this color combo for years. They stopped selling it in the stores. I was so excited to find it online. I got the product home and used it. It is not exactly the same color as the L&#x27;Oreal 804 used to be, but it is very similar. I am happy with it. My eye makeup is just like I like it.</li>
            <li> If you use this on it&#x27;s own, the powder falls off rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eye primer will help it stay on and look vibrant for longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors are good - nice for making smoky eyes.  It&#x27;s ok for the price.</li>
            <li> The main color I wanted was the dusty rose looking color in the upper right corner but it has almost no pigmentation to it and it falls all over my face the more I put on</li>
            <li> These eye shadow shades are perfect year round and since they are no longer available locally I am so glad Amazon carries them! The colors are fantastic and do not &#x27;crease&#x27;!</li>
            <li> Seems like the same colors but when applying them they aren&#x27;t quite the same. Maybe they were old and faded???</li>
            <li> it is not like the photo, but ok</li>
            <li> I would recommend not to buy this product. The product was not as described. It is better to pay a little more for a better quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this color quad because I had an old one that I liked a lot. The colors have changed slightly from the old one, which was disappointing tp me.  However, this is a manufacturer issue, not a sellar issue.  The sellar got the product to me quickly and I have no complaints with them.</li>
            <li> I love it. It&#x27;s so easy and it turns out great.</li>
