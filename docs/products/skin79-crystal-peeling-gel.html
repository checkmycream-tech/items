            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>This is a great product and make sure to use a good moisturizer after using it!</li>
            <li>I tried it, and it was just really good.</li>
            <li>It feels so good, because you feel as though your skin is just renewing itself.</li>
            <li>This crystal peeling gel is good for arms, legs, feet, but not for your face.</li>
            <li>This is a good exfoliate.</li>
            <li>I took a good look at my skin in a magnifying mirror and the scaly patches I thought would be gone were still there.</li>
            <li>Excellent products and defiantly worth the price.</li>
            <li>and I will be getting more soon!</li>
            <li>after one application, my face feels and looks much better!  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin look and feel aMAZing.</li>
            <li>It is some kind of substance that forms into globs when you rub it on any surface.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I have not notice any difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>The Missha Super Aqua D-Tox Peeling Gel had great reviews around the web, and I saw that Skin79 makes one, too (Crystal Peeling Gel).</li>
            <li>They are finer than US exfoliators and the kind I prefer, much more gentler on the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;so far the best exfoliator i&#x27;ve found is a peeling gel from japan.</li>
            <li>which both myself and my skin love.</li>
            <li>This peeling gel has a stronger scent than Missha, more floral than fruity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do spend more time on my oilier T-Zone, and there is noticeably much more beading up of the product as there is more sebum in this area for me.</li>
            <li>Product is authentic, arrived sealed and with all packaging intact.</li>
            <li>But anyways, I really love this product.</li>
            <li>The tube says use once or twice a week, and you should definetly not use more than that because it can cause irritation.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more of an exfoliation gel.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better suited for maintaining your complexion rather than fixing it.</li>
            <li>i love the peels where you don&#x27;t have to strip or wash the goo</li>
            <li>it is called nature cure gel or aqua gel (can&#x27;t remember off the top of my head--it&#x27;s in my bathroom).</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>no flaky skin, and able to keep moisture in better.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than twice a week (</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I am 42 and love this product.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really had time to see any great results.</li>
            <li>I am ok with it, but it should have been cheaper.</li>
            <li>i have to try it for a longer period of time to get a better feel for how it works.</li>
            <li>No sensitivity, no redness--just better skin.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to be the first to try it and see how good it worked.</li>
            <li>Does seem to make my face feel very clean and between this and my other skin79 product my face is flawless,</li>
            <li>I had never tried one of these peels, but have heard a lot of great things about them, and after I switched from American brand products to a Korean skin care regime, my skin has never been softer, smoother, more radiant, healthier, and a lot more calmer.</li>
            <li>I love the size of the bottle too and it is cheap.</li>
            <li>Left my face incredibly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Not a terrible product but nothing to get excited about.</li>
            <li>I thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try since my pores tend to clog up easily.</li>
            <li>I have ordered two more of these because it is well worth the money with the many uses.</li>
            <li>I feel kind of like a magician revealing a magic trick, but the bottom line is the result is desirable, so maybe it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  </li>
            <li>Second, this product is great it leaves your skin smooth and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>This stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>Provides a cool and refreshing cleanse in the morning</li>
            <li>many other products out there that are really really good for a lower price even!</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li>Has a light fruity scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This gel is smooth without any added exfoliating crystals.</li>
            <li>This is such a great product that I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li>I wrote a detailed account of all of the peeling gels out there</li>
            <li>It does leave your skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>For better results I use it directly on my skin without moistening it, rinsing it off with warm water.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Missha may be more suitable for you if you do NOT have sensitive skin, Skin79 may be more suitable for you if you DO have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I love this gel so much!</li>
            <li>This product does leave your skin feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>Super smooth and</li>
            <li>Super Aqua D-Tox Peeling Gel:&lt;br /&gt;Contains citric acid and lactic acid.</li>
            <li>I use the Skin79 Crystal Peeling Gel once a week, the Skin79 BB Cleanser with Skin Detox once every 3 days and use the Skin79 Super+</li>
            <li>I tried it the very first day it arrived.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, my face was pretty smooth.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth</li>
            <li>This stuff is cheap, is a way bigger tube than I expected, and makes my skin look and FEEL so GOOD!</li>
            <li>I lived in Japan for a year and fell in love with a peeling gel that was provided for free at hot springs resorts I stayed at, but was a bit out of my price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After moving back home, I&#x27;d forgotten what brand that peeling gel was, so I decided to try out some of the alternatives.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that after a few more times it wiil be quite satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This gel makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is the first one I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Only downside is I can&#x27;t stop touching my face now...</li>
            <li>Overall I love it</li>
            <li>so 3 days later I cleaned my face with my Skin79 BB Cleanser with Skin Detox (which I absolutely Love and refuse to go without) and then used this product</li>
            <li>/&gt;It arrived today and the first thing I did was smell it.  </li>
            <li>At first, I was concerned the scent was too overpowering, but once I put it on my face the scent disappeared.  </li>
            <li>So, as a test, I &amp;#34;exfoliated&amp;#34; my kitchen table and, sure enough, gobs of &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; came off my table as well.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li>Once the entire product has lifted away and beaded up, I gently rinse off everything in warm water and follow with my normal skincare regimen (Korean toner, emulsion, moisturizer, skin finisher).&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin really feels smooth after using it, can clearly see the difference before and after scrubbing my face with it</li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive and acne prone, and this has not harmed it at all.</li>
            <li>I have found that it&#x27;s the act of rolling these dry crystal around your face that do most of the buffing that the lotion claims.  </li>
            <li>Previously I&#x27;ve tried peeling wash from Etude and I liked that product</li>
            <li>It used to be kinda dull and gray, but now I have a really bright complexion.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week amazing product removes dead skin.</li>
            <li>I religiously use exfoliators to help remove excess sebum and skin particles to help smooth my skin and keep my pores from clogging and breaking out.</li>
            <li>The whole point of this product is to lift away excess sebum and skin to remove it from your face (or in case of counter tops, the gel product and dirt/dust).</li>
            <li>I was really amazed.</li>
            <li>Well, when I ordered this, I was really expecting so much out of this...</li>
            <li>Although it doesn&#x27;t help my acne condition, it really improved the tone of my skin.</li>
            <li>The con is... it doesn&#x27;t help much with acne.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I purchased this.</li>
            <li>Absolutely NOTHING.  </li>
            <li>I purchased another pealing rice gel and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so much smoother and the oiliness is gone.</li>
            <li>Get ready to peel.</li>
            <li>So much &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; seemed to come off every time I used it.</li>
            <li>I tried this gel and it did absolutely nothing for my skin.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I enjoy this product and think it&#x27;s work buying.</li>
            <li>and I really like both.</li>
            <li>It does peel off easily as indicated and right after my skin does feel baby soft and supple as if I just washed it for a long time</li>
            <li>I will stick with my top two recommended brands and stop trying to find any other brands out there.</li>
            <li>, I use it every other week,but I will start using it more to see results.</li>
            <li>Better off buying the micro dermabrasion yourself and just mix with a little EVOO, save yourself the money, if you are looking for exfoliation.</li>
            <li>The price is good too, a little will go a long way and you recieve a generous amount of product.</li>
            <li>Your face is actually really soft and feels really moisturized.</li>
            <li>They feel smooth, and the rough cracked look is gone.  </li>
            <li>This is a highly touted ingredient in Korea for creating soft, glowing, and vibrant skin.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin),</li>
            <li>My skin is soo soft!</li>
            <li>first I preferred Missha, as I appreciated the extra exfoliating texture it provides, but I have to say after trying both over several weeks</li>
            <li>I am going into my 3rd month and still have more than half a bottle</li>
            <li>My skin feels clean after using this, definitely not &#x27;tight&#x27; like other face masks for oily skin.</li>
            <li>Use common sense; check the ingredient list to make sure it does not contain something youare allergic to.</li>
            <li>This truly does what it says - makes your skin soft and supple and helps with the skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li>No sloughing, no dead skin beading up, no improvement in texture after the shower.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely not recommend this product to anyone who wants to try a peeling gel.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t peel off as much skin as I thought it would and after massaging my face with the gel on, my face became red.</li>
            <li>As far as toning and evening + brightning skin tone I still need to see about that.</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother, my pores look so much smaller, the discoloration from the tanning I used to do has lessened, even my crow&#x27;s feet are diminished.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because you can actually see all the dead skin coming off your skin as you rub it in.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle, even it gives you a very strange impression of tearing your skin off when you rub it...</li>
            <li>so far so good!The skin feels smooth instantly after use like I&#x27;ve read on other reviews.</li>
            <li>I recently bought this product due to all the rave about it given it being so cheap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Afterwards my skin is completely smooth, no more flaky bits.</li>
            <li>and my skin went back to normal.</li>
            <li>First of all it arrived sooner than what I expected.</li>
            <li>it rolls up in particles and takes old dead skin layer with it, exposing the fresh, dewey skin underneath.  </li>
            <li>and (for me at least) the fragrance, while strong, was not a problem during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed a major difference compared to the Olay cleanser that I get cheaper from Costco.  </li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to physical exfoliates, then this is for you!</li>
            <li>no red skin, nothing unnormal after a rinse it with water, just soft and glowing skin.</li>
            <li>It works as described and left my skin feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I only used it once so far.</li>
            <li>Each session typically takes me 30 minutes, as the skin only really started to peel after about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>All you do is take a little and \\&quot;rub\\&quot; in gentle circles on your face.</li>
            <li>I read all the reviews on this product good and bad and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Its an amazing product that DOES take away that dead skin and dirt left behind.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Otherwise, my face was pretty smooth.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth</li>
            <li> This stuff is cheap, is a way bigger tube than I expected, and makes my skin look and FEEL so GOOD!</li>
            <li> I lived in Japan for a year and fell in love with a peeling gel that was provided for free at hot springs resorts I stayed at, but was a bit out of my price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After moving back home, I&#x27;d forgotten what brand that peeling gel was, so I decided to try out some of the alternatives.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that after a few more times it wiil be quite satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This gel makes my skin feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Only downside is I can&#x27;t stop touching my face now...</li>
            <li> Overall I love it</li>
            <li> so 3 days later I cleaned my face with my Skin79 BB Cleanser with Skin Detox (which I absolutely Love and refuse to go without) and then used this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived today and the first thing I did was smell it.  </li>
            <li> At first, I was concerned the scent was too overpowering, but once I put it on my face the scent disappeared.  </li>
            <li> So, as a test, I &amp;#34;exfoliated&amp;#34; my kitchen table and, sure enough, gobs of &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; came off my table as well.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> Once the entire product has lifted away and beaded up, I gently rinse off everything in warm water and follow with my normal skincare regimen (Korean toner, emulsion, moisturizer, skin finisher).&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin really feels smooth after using it, can clearly see the difference before and after scrubbing my face with it</li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive and acne prone, and this has not harmed it at all.</li>
            <li> I have found that it&#x27;s the act of rolling these dry crystal around your face that do most of the buffing that the lotion claims.  </li>
            <li> Previously I&#x27;ve tried peeling wash from Etude and I liked that product</li>
            <li> It used to be kinda dull and gray, but now I have a really bright complexion.</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week amazing product removes dead skin.</li>
            <li> I religiously use exfoliators to help remove excess sebum and skin particles to help smooth my skin and keep my pores from clogging and breaking out.</li>
            <li> The whole point of this product is to lift away excess sebum and skin to remove it from your face (or in case of counter tops, the gel product and dirt/dust).</li>
            <li> I was really amazed.</li>
            <li> Well, when I ordered this, I was really expecting so much out of this...</li>
            <li> Although it doesn&#x27;t help my acne condition, it really improved the tone of my skin.</li>
            <li> The con is... it doesn&#x27;t help much with acne.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I purchased this.</li>
            <li> Absolutely NOTHING.  </li>
            <li> I purchased another pealing rice gel and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so much smoother and the oiliness is gone.</li>
            <li> Get ready to peel.</li>
            <li> So much &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; seemed to come off every time I used it.</li>
            <li> I tried this gel and it did absolutely nothing for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I enjoy this product and think it&#x27;s work buying.</li>
            <li> and I really like both.</li>
            <li> It does peel off easily as indicated and right after my skin does feel baby soft and supple as if I just washed it for a long time</li>
            <li> I will stick with my top two recommended brands and stop trying to find any other brands out there.</li>
            <li> , I use it every other week,but I will start using it more to see results.</li>
            <li> Better off buying the micro dermabrasion yourself and just mix with a little EVOO, save yourself the money, if you are looking for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> The price is good too, a little will go a long way and you recieve a generous amount of product.</li>
            <li> Your face is actually really soft and feels really moisturized.</li>
            <li> They feel smooth, and the rough cracked look is gone.  </li>
            <li> This is a highly touted ingredient in Korea for creating soft, glowing, and vibrant skin.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin),</li>
            <li> My skin is soo soft!</li>
            <li> first I preferred Missha, as I appreciated the extra exfoliating texture it provides, but I have to say after trying both over several weeks</li>
            <li> I am going into my 3rd month and still have more than half a bottle</li>
            <li> My skin feels clean after using this, definitely not &#x27;tight&#x27; like other face masks for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Use common sense; check the ingredient list to make sure it does not contain something youare allergic to.</li>
            <li> This truly does what it says - makes your skin soft and supple and helps with the skin&#x27;s texture.</li>
            <li> No sloughing, no dead skin beading up, no improvement in texture after the shower.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely not recommend this product to anyone who wants to try a peeling gel.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t peel off as much skin as I thought it would and after massaging my face with the gel on, my face became red.</li>
            <li> As far as toning and evening + brightning skin tone I still need to see about that.</li>
            <li> My skin is much smoother, my pores look so much smaller, the discoloration from the tanning I used to do has lessened, even my crow&#x27;s feet are diminished.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because you can actually see all the dead skin coming off your skin as you rub it in.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle, even it gives you a very strange impression of tearing your skin off when you rub it...</li>
            <li> so far so good!The skin feels smooth instantly after use like I&#x27;ve read on other reviews.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product due to all the rave about it given it being so cheap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Afterwards my skin is completely smooth, no more flaky bits.</li>
            <li> and my skin went back to normal.</li>
            <li> First of all it arrived sooner than what I expected.</li>
            <li> it rolls up in particles and takes old dead skin layer with it, exposing the fresh, dewey skin underneath.  </li>
            <li> and (for me at least) the fragrance, while strong, was not a problem during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a major difference compared to the Olay cleanser that I get cheaper from Costco.  </li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to physical exfoliates, then this is for you!</li>
            <li> no red skin, nothing unnormal after a rinse it with water, just soft and glowing skin.</li>
            <li> It works as described and left my skin feeling soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I only used it once so far.</li>
            <li> Each session typically takes me 30 minutes, as the skin only really started to peel after about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> All you do is take a little and \\&quot;rub\\&quot; in gentle circles on your face.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this product good and bad and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Its an amazing product that DOES take away that dead skin and dirt left behind.</li>
            <li> One application of the Missha peeling gel completely removed all of the dry skin flakes and reduced the redness and irritation – yes, these products DO remove loose skin</li>
            <li> Warning, another long review:&lt;br /&gt;I have problematic and sensitive skin, extremely oily, and prone to acne breakouts/hormonal cystic acne.</li>
            <li> Maybe because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough, or something.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve found it to be pretty gimmicky like other masks and whatnot.</li>
            <li> Both of these products state to use no more than 2x a week (and I highly recommend to use it only once a week).</li>
            <li> I ordered this with slight reservations because I am sensitive to fragrances, but needed something to help my skin feel and look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the intervening time period is the same (1 week) and the time spent massaging my face is the same.</li>
            <li> one you just rub rub rub until it take the dead skincells off into little chunks and falls right off your face.&lt;br /&gt;it does take longer than what i&#x27;m used to and my arm hurts by the time i finish.</li>
            <li> You wash your face (or after a shower), dry it, and then rub this product on your face until the upper dry layer of skin peels off.</li>
            <li> all my dead skin cells completely washed away.  </li>
            <li> I will go back to another pink bottle one.</li>
            <li> but now that I&#x27;m back in the US, it&#x27;s a bit harder to find.</li>
            <li> My skin has been really dry and peeling due to the winter weather and having just gotten over a cold, and none of my regular exfoliating scrubs have been able to help it.</li>
            <li> There are a bunch of grains suspended in the gel that you can&#x27;t see until the lotion is rubbed dry.  </li>
            <li> I leave it on for a couple of minutes till its about to dry</li>
            <li> made my boyfriend try it out since he has a lot of dry skin and</li>
            <li> It works wonders of my dry skin</li>
            <li> You are left with a bunch of what appears to be dead skin just falling off your face, when it&#x27;s really only probably 1% to 5% of what you are seeing.  </li>
            <li> My skin always feels softer afterwards, but I&#x27;m not sure if it helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> like to first address the poor reviews saying that this product is a gimmick because they wore gloves and used it on a counter</li>
            <li> Yes, these are both gels, and the ingredients do interact together and on/with your skin to ‘pill’ together and gather loose skin cells.</li>
            <li> Malic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid may also be used for the same function as AHAs, but are less stable and not as beneficial.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well on wet skin, but when dry, you can scrub off a lot of dead/dry cells.</li>
            <li> I have problems with little blackheads around my cheek area and nothing on the shelves of my local store seemed to work</li>
            <li> Dont try to use it on wet skin, it can take forever to make some peeling effect that way.</li>
            <li> It worked so well on smoothing and softening my face, that I decided to try it on my rough hands and feet.  </li>
            <li> the second time, so I think it is dead skin cells and not just the cellulose in the product itself, although I&#x27;m in no way an expert on the subject.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell that I am rubbing off my dead skin.</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy this product, just be careful with the sun exposure and don&#x27;t forget to use sun block.</li>
            <li> It makes your acne seem LESS VISIBLE, but not completely disappear.    </li>
            <li> Using small, GENTLE, circular massaging movement with my fingertips, I slowly work my way all over my face one area at a time.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Also it doesn&#x27;t leave your face dry and tight.</li>
            <li> You apply this gel and as you rinse it off you can feel and actually see the dead skin being removed!</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical at first but after reading reviews and purchasing other items from SKIN79</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in the appearance of my skin or other benefits.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the past several weeks.</li>
            <li> I use it minimally as well, maybe once every week and a half.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t bubble like an oxygen one, but peels the dry dead skin flakes off just as well.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone with serious skin problems, it&#x27;s not powerful enough.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviews, I waste money.</li>
            <li> I recently had a severe head cold, and with all the nose-blowing, my nose turned red, irritated and extremely dry and flakey.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t take rid of the black heads I have on my nose.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I tried using on my husband&#x27;s back</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I have a rather tight pores</li>
            <li> little chunks of a playdough-like substance form</li>
            <li> no more blackheads, or other breakouts for that matter.</li>
            <li> It is a little drying</li>
            <li> Contains Camellia sinensis leaf extract (AKA green tea extract).</li>
            <li> My sister had just bought this product a few days ago</li>
            <li> Even after a shower or even washing your face, use this product and you&#x27;ll see what was left behind and this will take it away.</li>
            <li> I broke out on my forehead like a few months ago (before I got this product) and I was expecting this product to heal the acne...</li>
            <li> A few minutes of rubbing this gel into my feet and</li>
            <li> It cleans dead skin cells off but can be drying, do not use every day (just as the directions say 1 or 2 times a week)</li>
            <li> Too trouble to return it.</li>
            <li> However, it seems that all the reviewers think that all the debris that emerges as you rub in the lotion is dead skin.  </li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s dead skin, just the product.</li>
            <li> When you are rubbing it on your face you do get gunk that rolls up and is stated that it is dead skin.</li>
            <li> I wanted to test that out to see if it was dead skin or just the product</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This is not removing dead skin from your face.</li>
            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Following the instructions, I tried to apply a layer of this to my face and had a hard time because of all the dead skin coming off (sorry for the mental image).</li>
            <li> I put a thin layer of gel on my face, let it dry a few minutes, and then rub in circular motion with fingertips -</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, and the winter def makes it worse.</li>
            <li> i just feel disappointed with it because i spent a lot of money recently on different korean products and majority</li>
            <li> , people complained that it caused rashes, burning, and irritation.</li>
            <li> Commonly used AHA acids in beauty products: glycolic acid and lactic acid.  </li>
            <li> If it’s a new product for you, use a small amount on a small area to test for a bad reaction (inside of your wrist preferably) and if you do have any adverse reaction using and/or testing the product STOP using it!</li>
            <li> &quot;... they really mean it.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> THIS ONE MAKE MY SKIN NOT GOOD</li>
            <li> I spread the gel thinly and evenly all over my face like any wash-off mask (avoiding eyes and mouth).</li>
            <li> It exfoliates well without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> You will be shocked at how much dead skin will come off.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed.</li>
            <li> for me it didn&#x27;t, sorry.</li>
            <li> i may have had unrealistic expectations.  </li>
            <li> In the summer i use this maybe once a week, but with the cold weather I Use this every 2 or 3 days, works wonders for me.</li>
            <li> Your counter was probably filthy and 2)</li>
            <li> I hate to burst everyone&#x27;s bubble.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Warning, another long review:&lt;br /&gt;I have problematic and sensitive skin, extremely oily, and prone to acne breakouts/hormonal cystic acne. I religiously use exfoliators to help remove excess sebum and skin particles to help smooth my skin and keep my pores from clogging and breaking out. I had never tried one of these peels, but have heard a lot of great things about them, and after I switched from American brand products to a Korean skin care regime, my skin has never been softer, smoother, more radiant, healthier, and a lot more calmer. The Missha Super Aqua D-Tox Peeling Gel had great reviews around the web, and I saw that Skin79 makes one, too (Crystal Peeling Gel). I’ve never tried Missha products, but I have and do use Skin79 ones, which both myself and my skin love. So, I bought both to try and compare, these are my findings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’d like to first address the poor reviews saying that this product is a gimmick because they wore gloves and used it on a counter and it still balled up. 1) Your counter was probably filthy and 2) Yes, these are both gels, and the ingredients do interact together and on/with your skin to ‘pill’ together and gather loose skin cells. The beads are the product AND sebum AND skin. The whole point of this product is to lift away excess sebum and skin to remove it from your face (or in case of counter tops, the gel product and dirt/dust). I recently had a severe head cold, and with all the nose-blowing, my nose turned red, irritated and extremely dry and flakey. One application of the Missha peeling gel completely removed all of the dry skin flakes and reduced the redness and irritation – yes, these products DO remove loose skin particles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, people complained that it caused rashes, burning, and irritation. Both of these products state to use no more than 2x a week (and I highly recommend to use it only once a week). Use common sense; check the ingredient list to make sure it does not contain something youare allergic to. If it’s a new product for you, use a small amount on a small area to test for a bad reaction (inside of your wrist preferably) and if you do have any adverse reaction using and/or testing the product STOP using it! Missha also contains several Alpha Hydroxy Acids (AHAs). These are powerful antioxidants which the FDA even recommends that they be used sparingly and to use sunscreen not only while using products that contain them, but for at least two weeks after discontinuing them (you should wear sunscreen period, no matter if you use AHA or not). Product packages may or may not state that it contains AHA. Commonly used AHA acids in beauty products: glycolic acid and lactic acid.  Malic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid may also be used for the same function as AHAs, but are less stable and not as beneficial. Now for the comparison!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Missha Super Aqua D-Tox Peeling Gel:&lt;br /&gt;Contains citric acid and lactic acid. Also contains urea which is used in a lot of skin softeners/creams (especially for callouses). Contains Camellia sinensis leaf extract (AKA green tea extract). This is a highly touted ingredient in Korea for creating soft, glowing, and vibrant skin. This gel also contains micro exfoliating particles. They are finer than US exfoliators and the kind I prefer, much more gentler on the skin. Has a light fruity scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin79 Crystal Peeling Gel:&lt;br /&gt;Contains no AHAs. Does contain trehalose, hyaluronic acid and pyrus malus (apple) extract. All of these ingredients are beneficial to soothe, soften and lock in moisture. This gel is smooth without any added exfoliating crystals. This peeling gel has a stronger scent than Missha, more floral than fruity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I preferred Missha, as I appreciated the extra exfoliating texture it provides, but I have to say after trying both over several weeks, I like them both equally. I now alternate once a week between them (I only use one of either product only once a week).After washing my face and hands, I apply about a quarter sized in circumference dollop in my hand. I spread the gel thinly and evenly all over my face like any wash-off mask (avoiding eyes and mouth). I rinse the product off my hands and let it sit on my face for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Using small, GENTLE, circular massaging movement with my fingertips, I slowly work my way all over my face one area at a time. I do spend more time on my oilier T-Zone, and there is noticeably much more beading up of the product as there is more sebum in this area for me. Once the entire product has lifted away and beaded up, I gently rinse off everything in warm water and follow with my normal skincare regimen (Korean toner, emulsion, moisturizer, skin finisher).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both products are 100 ml and are sold for the same price – about $13 each. (Missha from k-beauty on Amazon. Product is authentic, arrived sealed and with all packaging intact. Skin79 bought from one of my trusted on-line beauty stores that caters to Asian products)&lt;br /&gt;Missha may be more suitable for you if you do NOT have sensitive skin, Skin79 may be more suitable for you if you DO have sensitive skin. Either way, use them only 1x a week and wear sunscreen to protect your skin.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to physical exfoliates, then this is for you! Scrubs like St Ives aggravate my acne. I found this and I could not be happier! This truly does what it says - makes your skin soft and supple and helps with the skin&#x27;s texture. Nothing makes my skin softer and smoother than this product. It&#x27;s one of my holy grail skin care products. I love the size of the bottle too and it is cheap. I have used a similar one from Peter Thomas Roth and this one blows that one out of the water!</li>
            <li> My sister had just bought this product a few days ago and so it came in today. I wanted to be the first to try it and see how good it worked. I was really amazed. It worked so awesome! I felt my skin breathe and what nots. Its an amazing product that DOES take away that dead skin and dirt left behind. All you do is take a little and \\&quot;rub\\&quot; in gentle circles on your face. Even after a shower or even washing your face, use this product and you&#x27;ll see what was left behind and this will take it away. Also it doesn&#x27;t leave your face dry and tight. Your face is actually really soft and feels really moisturized. I&#x27;d totally RECOMMEND this.[[ASIN:B003T4B468 SKIN79 Crystal Peeling Gel]]</li>
            <li> I tried it the very first day it arrived. It is very gentle, even it gives you a very strange impression of tearing your skin off when you rub it... But there is no irritation (and I can tell you I have a very sensitive skin), no red skin, nothing unnormal after a rinse it with water, just soft and glowing skin. Dont try to use it on wet skin, it can take forever to make some peeling effect that way. The reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 points? It can&#x27;t take rid of the black heads I have on my nose. Maybe it&#x27;s because I have a rather tight pores and I need some product that can make it trogh.</li>
            <li> Well, when I ordered this, I was really expecting so much out of this... I tried it, and it was just really good. Although it doesn&#x27;t help my acne condition, it really improved the tone of my skin. It used to be kinda dull and gray, but now I have a really bright complexion. However, it says on the product \\&quot;USE ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK\\&quot;... they really mean it. I used it for like 4 consecutive days, and my cheeks just started to break out and redden... so I stopped using it for a week and my skin went back to normal. So I advise: ONCE OR TWICE. A WEEK. &#x27;    But anyways, I really love this product. You wash your face (or after a shower), dry it, and then rub this product on your face until the upper dry layer of skin peels off. It feels so good, because you feel as though your skin is just renewing itself. Afterwards I use moisturizer (NIVEA) and go to bed... the next morning my skin is GLOWING! Not oily, but just glowing.    The con is... it doesn&#x27;t help much with acne. I broke out on my forehead like a few months ago (before I got this product) and I was expecting this product to heal the acne... Maybe because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough, or something. It makes your acne seem LESS VISIBLE, but not completely disappear.    Otherwise, I really recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I purchased this. I found it by way of a youtube review. I thought it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try since my pores tend to clog up easily. I use this once or twice a week, especially on my forehead where my skin is the driest. This is such a great product that I recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> I ordered this maybe a week ago, and I started out by using it on my face.  It worked so well on smoothing and softening my face, that I decided to try it on my rough hands and feet.  This stuff works miracles.  My feet have always looked and felt terrible.  I have tried all sorts of products on my feet.  A few minutes of rubbing this gel into my feet and all my dead skin cells completely washed away.  They feel smooth, and the rough cracked look is gone.  My hands have also been noticeably softer.  When I use it on my hands and feet, I use lotion afterwards because it can have a drying effect on them.  On my face, the drying effect is perfect because I have oily skin.  I have ordered two more of these because it is well worth the money with the many uses.</li>
            <li> I wrote a detailed account of all of the peeling gels out there and I wanted to add this one to my list as a &amp;#34;don&#x27;t buy&amp;#34;.  Seriously, I tried using on my husband&#x27;s back (the all-being epitome of an area needing exfoliation) and it was as if I were just rubbing in lotion.  No sloughing, no dead skin beading up, no improvement in texture after the shower.  Absolutely NOTHING.  Another one in the trash.  I will stick with my top two recommended brands and stop trying to find any other brands out there.</li>
            <li> You apply this gel and as you rinse it off you can feel and actually see the dead skin being removed! This is a great product and make sure to use a good moisturizer after using it!</li>
            <li> I recently bought this product due to all the rave about it given it being so cheap. I tried it on several times and there&#x27;s no result for me.  Will definitely not recommend this product to anyone who wants to try a peeling gel.  I have to say I have tried numerous peeling gels and nothing can beat  Ossion peeling gel/ bubble mask.</li>
            <li> This gel makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. It exfoliates well without irritating my skin. My skin is super sensitive and acne prone, and this has not harmed it at all. The tube says use once or twice a week, and you should definetly not use more than that because it can cause irritation. I have used products like Origins, Philosophy, Khiels, and this has given me the best results. The price is good too, a little will go a long way and you recieve a generous amount of product.</li>
            <li> It works great.  It cleans dead skin cells off but can be drying, do not use every day (just as the directions say 1 or 2 times a week)</li>
            <li> It did not have function like web describe. Too trouble to return it. Like the other reviews, I waste money.</li>
            <li> This stuff is cheap, is a way bigger tube than I expected, and makes my skin look and FEEL so GOOD! I ran across it while looking for a BB cream to try. Tried Skin79&#x27;s sample pack of BBs and was kinda unimpressed after all the hype they have been getting. But THIS is a different story. Makes my skin look and feel aMAZing. If you ask me, THIS is what the hype should be about. Seriously.</li>
            <li> I purchased another pealing rice gel and it worked very well.And then I saw this one and decided to try it. It does not peal as well. I will go back to another pink bottle one.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more of an exfoliation gel.  Did nothing for exfoliation. Better off buying the micro dermabrasion yourself and just mix with a little EVOO, save yourself the money, if you are looking for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t peel off as much skin as I thought it would and after massaging my face with the gel on, my face became red. Otherwise, my face was pretty smooth.</li>
            <li> This crystal peeling gel is good for arms, legs, feet, but not for your face. Be careful if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a second thought to my Skin 79 BB Cream purchase.  It does leave your skin silky smooth.  However, it seems that all the reviewers think that all the debris that emerges as you rub in the lotion is dead skin.  It is not.  There are a bunch of grains suspended in the gel that you can&#x27;t see until the lotion is rubbed dry.  Then it appears.  I have found that it&#x27;s the act of rolling these dry crystal around your face that do most of the buffing that the lotion claims.  You are left with a bunch of what appears to be dead skin just falling off your face, when it&#x27;s really only probably 1% to 5% of what you are seeing.  If you rub a tiny bit between your finger, it will have the same effect consecutively, and I know my fingers tips don&#x27;t have a lot of skin to lose.  I hate to burst everyone&#x27;s bubble.  I feel kind of like a magician revealing a magic trick, but the bottom line is the result is desirable, so maybe it doesn&#x27;t really matter.  :)</li>
            <li> I lived in Japan for a year and fell in love with a peeling gel that was provided for free at hot springs resorts I stayed at, but was a bit out of my price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After moving back home, I&#x27;d forgotten what brand that peeling gel was, so I decided to try out some of the alternatives. This is the first one I&#x27;ve tried and I&#x27;m in love with it. My skin has been really dry and peeling due to the winter weather and having just gotten over a cold, and none of my regular exfoliating scrubs have been able to help it. Following the instructions, I tried to apply a layer of this to my face and had a hard time because of all the dead skin coming off (sorry for the mental image). Rinsed it all off, decided to try again just in case and there weren&#x27;t any &amp;#34;beads&amp;#34; the second time, so I think it is dead skin cells and not just the cellulose in the product itself, although I&#x27;m in no way an expert on the subject.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards my skin is completely smooth, no more flaky bits. Only downside is I can&#x27;t stop touching my face now...</li>
            <li> I think I will continue using ...so far so good!The skin feels smooth instantly after use like I&#x27;ve read on other reviews.</li>
            <li> I love this gel so much! I was a bit skeptical at first but after reading reviews and purchasing other items from SKIN79 I gave this a try. What can I say.. I was sold! My skin feels so much smoother and the oiliness is gone. My skin feels clean after using this, definitely not &#x27;tight&#x27; like other face masks for oily skin. Overall I love it and I will be getting more soon!</li>
            <li> Wish it lived up to the claims but it just does not. Not a terrible product but nothing to get excited about.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a major difference compared to the Olay cleanser that I get cheaper from Costco.  So I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> Provides a cool and refreshing cleanse in the morning</li>
            <li> Great product. Does the job well!! I leave it on for a couple of minutes till its about to dry and i start rubbing.  Works well!  Shipping was quick!</li>
            <li> I can definitely tell that I am rubbing off my dead skin. However, I haven&#x27;t noticed any changes in my overall complexion. It hasn&#x27;t changed my acne scars, blackheads, or brightness. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone with serious skin problems, it&#x27;s not powerful enough. It&#x27;s better suited for maintaining your complexion rather than fixing it.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me at all. Would not reccommend at all. many other products out there that are really really good for a lower price even!</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week amazing product removes dead skin. For better results I use it directly on my skin without moistening it, rinsing it off with warm water. I will reorder this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! You will be shocked at how much dead skin will come off. Totally a must buy.</li>
            <li> I love this product because you can actually see all the dead skin coming off your skin as you rub it in. This product leaves my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. This is a good exfoliate.</li>
            <li> i love the peels where you don&#x27;t have to strip or wash the goo off.&lt;br /&gt;this one you just rub rub rub until it take the dead skincells off into little chunks and falls right off your face.&lt;br /&gt;it does take longer than what i&#x27;m used to and my arm hurts by the time i finish.</li>
            <li> i had hopes for this exfoliator but i&#x27;ve found it to be pretty gimmicky like other masks and whatnot. it is just a gel you spread on your face and rub around to exfoliate. little chunks of a playdough-like substance form but i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s dead skin, just the product. my skin didn&#x27;t feel totally exfoliated afterwards but it was a bit softer. i just feel disappointed with it because i spent a lot of money recently on different korean products and majority produce no results. the exception to that is moisturizers, moisturizing sleeping packs, paper masks, and bb cream...those work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so far the best exfoliator i&#x27;ve found is a peeling gel from japan. the dead skin really comes off instantly and it isn&#x27;t abrasive or drying. it is called nature cure gel or aqua gel (can&#x27;t remember off the top of my head--it&#x27;s in my bathroom). the price is around $40 a bottle but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews on this product good and bad and decided to give it a try. I have problems with little blackheads around my cheek area and nothing on the shelves of my local store seemed to work so I thought why not try this. When you are rubbing it on your face you do get gunk that rolls up and is stated that it is dead skin. I wanted to test that out to see if it was dead skin or just the product so 3 days later I cleaned my face with my Skin79 BB Cleanser with Skin Detox (which I absolutely Love and refuse to go without) and then used this product and there was no gunk rolling up. Does seem to make my face feel very clean and between this and my other skin79 product my face is flawless, no more blackheads, or other breakouts for that matter. I am a forever user of these products now! I use the Skin79 Crystal Peeling Gel once a week, the Skin79 BB Cleanser with Skin Detox once every 3 days and use the Skin79 Super+ Beblesh Balm BB Cream VIP Gold daily as my foundation. Even my hairdresser ask me what I had been using when I got my monthly facial. Excellent products and defiantly worth the price. A little goes a long way so this is not a product that you will need to buy monthly. I am going into my 3rd month and still have more than half a bottle</li>
            <li> My skin really feels smooth after using it, can clearly see the difference before and after scrubbing my face with it</li>
            <li> Previously I&#x27;ve tried peeling wash from Etude and I liked that product but now that I&#x27;m back in the US, it&#x27;s a bit harder to find. I thought I&#x27;d give the Skin79 a try and it worked just as well. Get ready to peel.</li>
            <li> This product does leave your skin feeling clean.  I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in the appearance of my skin or other benefits.</li>
            <li> This is a great skin peeling gel. But it takes some time for it to work. Each session typically takes me 30 minutes, as the skin only really started to peel after about 5 minutes. The amount of skin peeled varies time to time even though the amount of gel I use is the same and the intervening time period is the same (1 week) and the time spent massaging my face is the same. Sometimes I can be left with &#x27;burned&#x27; finger(s) as the gel &#x27;eats&#x27; into my finger(s)&#x27; skin too. After peeling you&#x27;ll feel your skin is fairer and it has the added benefit of removing blackheads too. Been using it once a week for 4 months now and I expect each tube can last me 6-7 months.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I put a thin layer of gel on my face, let it dry a few minutes, and then rub in circular motion with fingertips - it rolls up in particles and takes old dead skin layer with it, exposing the fresh, dewey skin underneath.  I feel like I&#x27;ve had a facial after using it.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin, and the winter def makes it worse. In the summer i use this maybe once a week, but with the cold weather I Use this every 2 or 3 days, works wonders for me. no flaky skin, and able to keep moisture in better.</li>
            <li> I literally got this product an hour ago and I love it. I was gentle massaging and all of a sudden all of this dead skin comes of. I&#x27;ve never had an exfoliant like that. Left my face incredibly smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also made my boyfriend try it out since he has a lot of dry skin and his skin looked perfect after. Super smooth and glowy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> First of all it arrived sooner than what I expected. Second, this product is great it leaves your skin smooth and healthy looking. I will continue to buy this product, just be careful with the sun exposure and don&#x27;t forget to use sun block.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing. It works as described and left my skin feeling soft and refreshed. It is a little drying so I wouldn&#x27;t use it more than twice a week (which is what the product label recommends).</li>
            <li> I ordered this with slight reservations because I am sensitive to fragrances, but needed something to help my skin feel and look better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived today and the first thing I did was smell it.  At first, I was concerned the scent was too overpowering, but once I put it on my face the scent disappeared.  (Thankfully!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after one application, my face feels and looks much better!  This product is definitely worth it&#x27;s price and (for me at least) the fragrance, while strong, was not a problem during use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend to anyone who needs their skin to look/feel fresher and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I am 42 and love this product.  I plan to purchase it again when I run out.  It&#x27;s not just for teenagers or people in their 20&#x27;s!*</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do anything for me when I used it and eventually I had to toss it after about a month or so. I&#x27;m not saying that it won&#x27;t work on somebody else but for me it didn&#x27;t, sorry.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts when I tried this product. So much &amp;#34;skin&amp;#34; seemed to come off every time I used it. I took a good look at my skin in a magnifying mirror and the scaly patches I thought would be gone were still there. So, as a test, I &amp;#34;exfoliated&amp;#34; my kitchen table and, sure enough, gobs of &amp;#34;dead skin&amp;#34; came off my table as well.  Amazing!  Please don&#x27;t waste your money. This is not removing dead skin from your face. It is some kind of substance that forms into globs when you rub it on any surface.</li>
            <li> I DON&#x27;T LIKE IT THIS ONE MAKE MY SKIN NOT GOOD AND I WILL NV TO USE IT AGAIN AND I WILL NOT TELL YOU TO BUY IT TO , BUT IF YOUR WANT TO TRY.....IS UP TO YOU,</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! My skin is soo soft! Looove it! It works wonders of my dry skin this is a must have</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really had time to see any great results. I only used it once so far. I&#x27;m sure that after a few more times it wiil be quite satisfactory.</li>
            <li> So I have not been using this product every week, I use it every other week,but I will start using it more to see results. It does peel off easily as indicated and right after my skin does feel baby soft and supple as if I just washed it for a long time so that&#x27;s a plus. As far as toning and evening + brightning skin tone I still need to see about that. I am ok with it, but it should have been cheaper.</li>
            <li> I tried this gel and it did absolutely nothing for my skin.  I requested a return authorization and was told not if I have opened it.  I won&#x27;t be buying anything from this line again.</li>
            <li> Overall, I enjoy this product and think it&#x27;s work buying. Doesn&#x27;t work well on wet skin, but when dry, you can scrub off a lot of dead/dry cells. My skin always feels softer afterwards, but I&#x27;m not sure if it helped clear up my skin. I use it minimally as well, maybe once every week and a half.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 versions of peeling mask and I really like both. This one doesn&#x27;t bubble like an oxygen one, but peels the dry dead skin flakes off just as well.</li>
            <li> i may have had unrealistic expectations.  I was dreaming of beautiful and glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;my skin does feel cleaner when i use it but i seem to be breaking out more.&lt;br /&gt;maybe i have to try it for a longer period of time to get a better feel for how it works.</li>
            <li> I wash my face and exfoliate regularly, but after trying this product I can&#x27;t believe the difference!  My skin is much smoother, my pores look so much smaller, the discoloration from the tanning I used to do has lessened, even my crow&#x27;s feet are diminished.  I use it 2x per week per the directions.  No sensitivity, no redness--just better skin.  I absolutely recommend!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I have not notice any difference in my skin. I have been using it for the past several weeks. It was a waste of money. A little disappointed.</li>
